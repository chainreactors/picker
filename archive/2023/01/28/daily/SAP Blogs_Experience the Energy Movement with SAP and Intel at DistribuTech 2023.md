We are excited to participate in this year’s [DISTRIBUTECH](https://www.distributech.com/), held February 7-9 in sunny San Diego, California - alongside our trusted partner Intel. SAP and Intel will be bringing live content and demos to participants on the exhibitor floor and our subject matter experts will be available to speak with participants on multiple areas of focus- you can view our full demo guide [here](https://indd.adobe.com/view/cd8680e8-9267-4345-b26c-095619db9ee2).

As part of the shared effort between SAP and Intel, participants will learn more about how modernization of the utility infrastructure is being driven by IoT solutions that enable the convergence of IT and OT, harness the power of artificial intelligence, and facilitate the ability to process data at the edge. Workload consolidation is the key to moving from legacy systems to fully virtualized application environments and hardware such as Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors and Intel network interface cards will provide the foundation for a more resilient and intelligent enterprise.

“The utility industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, creating new challenges and opportunities for utility companies.”  says Michael O’Donnell, National Vice President, Utilities at SAP America. “Our focus at SAP has been to ensure that we are bringing the right technology and expertise forward to help you to navigate these challenges and we are excited to do that with Intel!”

For details on the exhibitor floor hours, booth locations, and to register for the event to meet the SAP and Intel teams, visit the [DISTRIBUTECH](https://www.distributech.com/) website.
