![Top 12 Website Hardening Tips](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_Top-10-Website-Hardening-Tips-820x386.png)

Attackers are always on the hunt for vulnerable websites. Whether you have a WordPress, Magento, or Joomla website — you’ll want to take steps to secure your site and server from attacks and malware.

In today’s post, we’ll be outlining the top twelve steps you can take to harden your website and enhance the security of your environment.

## What is website security?

Website security is all about adding layers of protection to reduce the risk of an attack. This is a process referred to as “[defense in depth](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/10/accounting-for-defense-in-depth-in-website-security.html).” It’s essentially a catch-all term used to describe the techniques, settings, and configurations that help enhance the security of your website.

## Why should I secure my website?

If you care about your website and visitors, you’ll want to take steps to secure your website against attacks. Website hardening techniques can help reduce risk from automated attacks, known vulnerabilities, and strengthen any weak access points.

## How to secure a website

Let’s dive in. Here are our top 12 recommendations to secure a website:

1. [Keep website software patched and updated](#step1)
2. [Reduce the attack surface](#step2)
3. [Remove unnecessary plugins and themes](#step3)
4. [Practice the principle of least privilege](#step4)
5. [Restrict access to the admin panel](#step5)
6. [Use multi-factor authentication](#step6)
7. [Use strong, unique passwords](#step7)
8. [Access over HTTPS](#step8)
9. [Reduce exposure of information](#step9)
10. [Monitor the website and keep up with its log activity](#step10)
11. [Check for input sanitization techniques](#step11)
12. [Use a web application firewall](#step12)

### 1 – Keep website software patched and updated

Every single piece of software running on your website needs to be kept up to date with the latest patches and security updates. Website vulnerabilities come in all shapes and sizes, so it is important to update your CMS along with any third party components like plugins, themes, and extensions.

Keep your CMS patched with the latest updates to mitigate risk.

And don’t neglect your server, Apache, or [PHP updates](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/04/keeping-up-with-php-updates.html) either. These important components need to be patched to the latest version to mitigate risk, too.

By keeping everything up-to-date with the latest security releases, you’ll reduce the possibility of attackers targeting your site due to known vulnerabilities.

### 2 – Reduce the attack surface

There are a few ways you can reduce the attack surface of your website.

* Only allow public access to public areas of your application.
* Deny everything else by default.
* Search for and harden all of your [website access points](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/03/steps-to-keep-your-site-clean-access-points.html).

These can be accomplished with server configuration rules, setting [file and folder permissions](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/09/demystifying-file-and-folder-permissions.html), and by using features found in modern [web application firewalls](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/).

### 3 – Remove unnecessary plugins and themes

We all love features and functionality that improve engagement and website experience. But the more software (or third-party components) you have, the greater the risk of an attack. Each additional piece of code on your website is a potential gateway for attack.

So if you’re not using a plugin, theme, or third party component — uninstall it. Especially if you’re not keeping up with updates on your site. Keep only what you’re actively using on your website. And remember: disabling a plugin or theme is not the same as removing it.

### 4 – Practice the principle of least privilege
