**Part of a series**

This Blog post is part of the series [***Vulnerability Management Series: 3D (Definition, Deep-Dive, and Difficulties***)](https://blog.nviso.eu/series/vulnerability-management-series-3d/)

* Part 1 provides an overview of vulnerability management and the terms. This will be a recap for most people, but is a good starting point for all who just jump into this topic or want to sharpen their understanding.
* Part 2 dives deeper into vulnerability management, looking into the various areas of this topic. **[Coming soon]**
* Part 3 is about challenges we faced while supporting customers and consequently provides some tips on what to avoid and what might be worth considering.

# **Vulnerability Management ‚Äìcommon understanding and language enable teamwork**

In order to provide a common ground to talk about a topic, we need some definitions. Not only will this blog post provide a small glossary, but also some clarity about the relationship between these terms.

‚ÄúI can almost hear you saying: ‚ÄòIn our organization we use this term differently or we use another term‚Äô‚Äù. That might be OK, as long as all involved people have the same understanding. However, using the same language is essential to avoid misunderstandings and work towards the same goal. Once you interact with people outside of your organization, using different terms or meanings might backfire.

Therefore, let‚Äôs start with the obvious one:

## **What is Vulnerability Management?**

In order to provide a thorough definition of vulnerability management, the following explanation of the term has been assembled from multiple sources:

**Vulnerability Management** is a systematic approach and a critical and ongoing IT security operation practice that is related to risk management¬†[1] [2] [3]. Vulnerability Management encompasses identifying, assessing, categorizing, prioritizing, mitigating, remediating and reporting¬† (security) vulnerabilities in an organisation‚Äôs systems and the software that runs on those systems¬† [1] [2] [4]. Vulnerability Management contributes to preventing attacks, as well as minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers [5] and the damage of security incidents when these occur [6].

The ISO 27001:2022 standard uses the term ‚Äûmanagement of technical vulnerabilities‚Äú and addresses the scope as ‚Äúinformation systems in use‚Äù¬†[7, p. 16] and consequently defines areas as organisation, site and personnel, as out of scope. [8, p. 54ff]

You might ask now, what the target of vulnerability management is. It is not to remediate all vulnerabilities as soon as possible. The objective is to keep the risk the vulnerabilities pose within the defined and accepted risk level, which aligns with your risk appetite. This represents the maximum level of risk you are willing to accept based on the estimated impact it may have.

We will go deeper into this topic in part 2 of this series. (Part 2 will be linked once it is published)

## **But what is a vulnerability?**

ISO 27005:2022 defines a vulnerability as a ‚ÄúWeakness of an asset or control [‚Ä¶] that can be exploited so that an event [‚Ä¶] with a negative consequence [‚Ä¶] occurs‚Äú [8, p. 3]. Vulnerabilities are not static, as there is the ‚Äúpossibility of emergent vulnerabilities that can arise naturally over time as organizational missions/business functions evolve, environments of operation change, new technologies proliferate, and new threats emerge.‚Äú [9, p. 9] Also, there is usually a time difference between the discovery of a vulnerability and the public announcement [10], which if disclosed responsible, often include recommendations to mitigate or remediate the weakness and hence the vulnerability.

This is quite generic. But we will dive deeper a little further below and also look at frequently used terms of vulnerability management. Before we look at the WHAT, we first look at the WHY.

## **Why should I care?**

To speak in a metaphor, would you want someone else (unknown) to access your house? I assume not. You typically lock the door. In the same way, one wants to lock out others (unpermitted one) from the IT systems.

Even worse, if you take care of a house or parts of it for someone else (systems, components, data) and these would get abused. There might be inherent damage to the organisations and/or people which use the system or whose data this is, as well as to your own reputation.

Depending on the vulnerability and the importance of the system, the impact to your business can range from low to fatal.

Next to the inherent self-interest, you might be obliged to comply with laws, standards or industry regulations. The following table lists some examples and we all can be sure, more will come in the future:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Law | Scope | Vulnerability Management requirements? |
| Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)¬†[11] | Products with digital elements (hardware/software) in the EU | Explicit [11, p. 2] |
| NIS2 Directive [12] | Operators of essential and important entities across critical sectors in the EU | Explicit [12, p. 12] |
| EU Cybersecurity Act | ICT products, services, and processes across the EU | Explicit [13, pp. Article 51, 51a, 54, 55] |
| Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) | Financial sector (banks, insurers, investment firms, etc.) | Explicit [14, p. Article 8 and 25] |
| PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) | Organizations that handle credit card transactions and store, process, or transmit cardholder data globally | Explicit [15, p. 119 ff] |
| General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) | All organizations processing EU residents‚Äô personal data | Indirect (via security of processing ‚Äì article 32) |

Examples of Standards and Industry Regulations requiring Vulnerability Management

There are standards and frameworks to address vulnerability management. The following table lists some examples:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Description |
| ISO/IEC 27001 & 27002 [7]¬†[16] | Internationally recognized ISMS standards with explicit vulnerability management requirements. |
| NIST SP 800-53 [17] | Com...
