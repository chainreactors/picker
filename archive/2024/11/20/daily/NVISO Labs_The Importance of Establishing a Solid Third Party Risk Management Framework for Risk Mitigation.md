In the [previous post](https://blog.nviso.eu/2024/09/12/introduction-to-third-party-risk-management/), we introduced the concept of Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) and its importance in today‚Äôs interconnected world. Now, let us have a look at the practical aspects of building a solid TPRM program and why it is important for your company.

## **1. Start with a Third-Party Inventory**

The first step in building a strong Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program is to identify and understand exactly who your third-parties are. This requires achieving full visibility over all vendors, suppliers, and service providers involved in your operations.

Prioritizing and integrating third-party relationships in this way aligns TPRM with other management processes, ensuring a cohesive and consistent approach across the organization.

**Why is this Important?**

Without a comprehensive inventory of third-parties, an organization is essentially flying blind when it comes to managing risks. A complete inventory acts as the foundation for any Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program. If you do not know which third-parties you are working with, you can not assess their potential risks or mitigate their impact on your operations, data security, and compliance obligations.

**Key Questions to Ask:**

* Do I have a clear and up-to-date list of all vendors, suppliers, and service providers my organization is working with?
* Who is responsible for managing contracts and SLAs? Have I engaged with Procurement, Legal, and other relevant teams to gather this information?
* Is there a centralized repository for all third-party contracts and agreements, and is it regularly updated?
* Which vendors have access to sensitive data, internal systems, or perform critical services?
* Do I know when contracts were signed, when they are due for renewal, or if relationships have ended?

**Let‚Äôs break down the key reasons why this is critical:**

**Incident Response**: In case of a security incident or breach, knowing your third-parties allows you to quickly assess whether the breach was caused by a vendor and what data or systems were impacted. Without a clear vendor list, the response process becomes delayed and disorganized.

**Risk Identification**: You can not protect against risks you do not know exist. A comprehensive inventory allows you to identify vendors who may have access to sensitive data, internal systems, or operational controls, helping you understand potential exposure.

**Compliance Monitoring**: Many regulations require you to maintain oversight of third-parties who process or have access to sensitive data. Without knowing who those parties are, compliance with legal obligations becomes impossible, exposing your organization to fines and penalties.

**Implementation Tips:**

* Use a centralized inventory system e.g. using a dedicated database to record and manage all third-party relationships, ensuring information on vendors, suppliers, and service providers is easily accessible and regularly updated. This can be a dedicated TPRM tool or integrated into existing platforms like your CMDB or ERP system.

## **2. Determine Inherent Risks**

Once you have an inventory, the next step is identifying the inherent risks associated with each third-party. This is where **tiering** comes into play. Not all vendors pose the same level of risk, so you need to categorize them based on the services they provide, their access to sensitive data, and how critical they are to your operations.

Beyond simply listing third-parties, it is important to prioritize them based on their criticality. By conducting a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), you can map third-parties according to their role and contribution to critical business processes. Integration with tools like Configuration Management Databases (CMDB) or asset management systems also helps link third-parties to key assets, reflecting the importance of these relationships within your infrastructure.

**Key Questions to Ask:**

* Does this vendor handle sensitive customer or business data?
* Is this third-party integrated into core business systems?
* How would a failure or breach impact your organization?
* Does it affect my operations, reputation, data disclosure or compliance aspects?

**Implementation Tips:**

* Implement a tiering process based on BIA results to classify third-parties by their criticality to business operations. High-priority vendors can then be given additional oversight and security requirements.

## **3. Set Security Standards and Requirements**

Establishing a baseline of security standards for third-parties is essential for effective Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM). These standards should align with your organization‚Äôs internal security policies as well as any applicable regulatory requirements, creating a consistent approach to safeguarding data and reducing risk exposure from third-party relationships. To test adherence to this baseline, various tools and methods can be employed, such as questionnaires, audits, and penetration tests, ensuring that third-parties meet the established security expectations.

**Why is this Important?**

Defining clear security requirements for third-parties helps ensure your organization‚Äôs data is protected and compliance obligations are met. When vendors fall short on security, they can become weak points in your supply chain, potentially leading to data breaches, disruptions, and even legal liabilities. With well-framed contractual clauses, the responses provided in TPRM assessments are contractually binding, meaning that if third-parties misrepresent their security maturity, they can be held accountable in the event of an incident caused by t...
