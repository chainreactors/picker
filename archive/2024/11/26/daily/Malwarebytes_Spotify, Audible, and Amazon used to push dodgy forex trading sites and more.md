# Spotify, Audible, and Amazon used to push dodgy forex trading sites and more

Posted: November 25, 2024

[Spotify](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/spotify-abused-to-promote-pirated-software-and-game-cheats/) and [Amazon services](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/amazon-and-audible-flooded-with-forex-trading-and-warez-listings/) have been flooded with bogus listings that push dubious “forex trading” sites, Telegram channels, and suspicious links claiming to offer pirated software according to our friends over at BleepingComputer.

Cybercriminals are abusing the options to inject keywords and links into playlist names to make their entries rank high in Google search results.

BleepingComputer found that spammers had posted a lot of links on the content platforms, but that the length of the audio “episodes” published under these “podcasts” was zero seconds.

What you can expect to be offered are cracks, keygens, cheat codes, and other game related content, but also “forex trading” seems to be a popular subject to promote.

The fact that many cracks, keygens, and game mods are often replaced by or come bundled with [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) was already known in the previous century, so that shouldn’t surprise anyone.

The “forex trading” part may be a little harder to understand.

On the content platforms we mentioned, links are shared pointing to forex trading platforms where you can trade one currency for another speculating on exchange rate fluctuations. Forex trading is far from illegal, it’s an important part of international trade. But in areas where so much money changes hands, there will always be criminals looking for a piece of the action.

There are two main types of forex trading scams you need to be aware of. Scams performed by external criminals, and unethical forex brokers. Even though management teams within brokers must be vetted by regulators and licensers, there are plenty of incentives for brokers to take advantage of their customers.

The scams themselves can be largely identified as:

* Signal scams: Signals are data-driven broker-generated information prompts that give traders improved opportunities to make profitable trades. While many of them can be considered legitimate, they do not guarantee success and they can be abused by signal-sellers that prey on our tendency to want to get rich fast and with little effort.
* Pyramid schemes: The pyramid schemes are in fact private circles run by individuals who seek to profit by charging a subscription fee and encouraging new members to recruit fellow investors for the prize of a small commission payout. The higher up the money-earning pyramid you are, the more subscription fees flow your way.
* Point-spread scam: As brokers earn their commissions based on the gap between bid and ask prices, they make more money when the gap is bigger. When the natural supply and demand conditions do not create a big enough gap, some brokers have been known to exaggerate the gap by rigging the code that displays the prices.
* Robot scamming: This is a relative newcomer to the scams. It offers traders the option to earn money while you are not actively trading on your system. The term “robot” refers to the auto...
