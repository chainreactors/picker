As public transit companies worldwide embark on the crucial transition from conventional gas-powered fleets to sustainable electric vehicles, innovative solutions like SAP E-Mobility are proving to be instrumental. With its rich feature set, SAP E-Mobility offers comprehensive solutions for e-fleet management, making the transition smoother and more efficient.

**Real-Time Charging Station Management**

The key need for a e-fleet management is the ability to efficiently manage charging stations. SAP E-Mobility allows transit companies to monitor and control their charging infrastructure in real-time. They can start a charging session, onboard new stations, and keep track of all the ongoing charging sessions. The ability to customize the charging stations, distinguishing between, for instance, "Terminus" and "Main Depot" stations, adds another layer of flexibility.

**Badge Management and Charging Sessions**

Secure access to charging infrastructure is crucial. SAP E-Mobility's badge management feature helps ensure this, allowing companies to manage driver app badges and control charging access. The ability to monitor charging sessions in real-time also plays a critical role in maintaining operational readiness and optimizing charging schedules.
