# Claude Code is the Biggest AI Development Since ChatGPT

How Claude Code is surprisingly close to one definition of AGI

I've had a number of thoughts around Claude Code in the last couple of days. I've especially been trying to put into words a feeling of how *big* this is, and why I think so.

Here's what I've come up with:

1. Claude Code is as big a jump as ChatGPT was in 2022
2. ChatGPT was the ChatGPT for knowledge, and Claude Code is the ChatGPT for *action*
3. Claude Code is as good as it is because of *scaffolding*, not model IQ
4. I think Claude Code is *proto-AGI*, meaning it just needs more scaffolding, tools, and long-term memory and it'll be able to replace an average knowledge worker

I was having trouble putting this into words, and I think the above captures it.

Basically, it's as big as ChatGPT—*but for action instead of knowledge*.

## AGI? Really? [​](#agi-really)

I use the "AGI" word for a very specific reason: being able to replace human workers.

CC is already doing the work of a knowledge worker. And in fact way more and way better. But:

* It can only do so many tasks
* It only has so many tools
* Its memory is only so large
* It can't incorporate its entire career of knowledge into the next task
* Etc.

So it basically has tools and memory / knowledge management limitations. But, fundamentally, it's doing the work of someone in a corporate type job already.

This is huge to me, because to get to an actual AI product/service that can replace an employee I don't think requires some new, theoretical advance in AI.

What we have already just needs more wiring and plumbing. And I think Claude Code has made this very clear.
