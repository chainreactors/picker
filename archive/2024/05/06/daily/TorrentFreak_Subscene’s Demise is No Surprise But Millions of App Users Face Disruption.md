# Subscene’s Demise is No Surprise But Millions of App Users Face Disruption

After reporting that the site hasn't been financially viable for years, the operator of Subscene, one of the internet's most important subtitle sites, has pulled the plug. The plan had been known for some time and at least two, mostly complete backups, have been acquired by separate archiving teams. A 90GB torrent is currently being shared all over the world, but for international movie and TV show app users that rely on Subscene for subtitles, chaos may prevail for a while.

[![confused](https://torrentfreak.com/images/confused.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/confused.png)After two decades online and maybe even a few more under Divxstation branding right at the beginning, veteran subtitle download site Subscene.com has finally thrown in the towel.

In various guises, linked to specific geographic regions, perhaps as many as 50 domains can be linked to Subscene over the past twenty years. At a time when legal streaming services didn’t even exist, Subscene offered subtitles for large libraries of movies and TV shows in multiple languages.

Making content accessible to non-native speakers, in countries where legal streaming services wouldn’t arrive for a decade, didn’t just help people to understand movies. For those hoping to widen their horizons, subtitles became opportunities to learn new languages. For the deaf and hard of hearing, subtitles represented a new connection with the wider world.

## Competition – Finally

Things are, of course, very different today. While a disappointing number of legal streaming platforms still fail to provide acceptable subtitles on all content, Netflix releases often arrive with subtitles in dozens of languages. That seems likely to have played a part in reduced levels of traffic at Subscene, leading to a fairly quiet announcement two months ago.

“Hi everyone, i’m very sorry to be [writing] this, but Subscene cannot continue for much longer,” the site’s owner told users.

“It has not been paying for itself for several years now, visitors are falling, and maintenance cannot continue. I am amazed at all your administrative work with the content which is the primary reason that I have continued paying for the site for this long. Thank you all for this journey we have been on together. If I can do anything for you let me know.”

## Shutdown in 24 Hours

On May 2, 2024, Subscene’s owner posted to the site’s forum to confirm what had been mentioned at least eight weeks earlier. Subscene would be shutting down for good.

Some Subscene users complained that 24 hours wasn’t enough time to back up subtitles they had uploaded to the site. Others expressed concerns that a giant subtitle collection shouldn’t just disappear without an effort to preserve it. The reality is that efforts to preserve the contents of Subscene had been underway for some time.

## Archiving, Hoarding Data

Soon after the first announcement two months ago, indicating that Subscene would close down, members of the /r/DataHoarder subreddit had quickly sprung into action. They produced a full 90GB+ database, [which they say](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1b5rxc2/subscenecom_full_dump/) even includes deleted subtitle files, and then made it available online via a regular .torrent file, a magnet link, and for the Usenet fans, an NZB file.

[As mentioned on their Wiki](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Subscene), Archive Team [sprang into action](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/subscene-grab) with the 24-hour shutdown period underway yet still managed to retrieve almost everything.

“It was announced on 2024-05-02 that the site would cease operations within 24 hours, and that a ‘takeover plan was not possible’. No reason was given for the sudden closure. A DPoS project was started 2024-05-03 13:56 UTC and was able to grab most subtitles before the websites demise later that day at 2024-05-03 21:11 UTC.”

## Data Saved But in The Wrong Place for App Users

Users who prefer to use mostly Android apps for their movie and TV show fix, often have in-app access to subtitles. As the image below shows, Subscene.com is regularly used as a source for those subtitles.

## [![app-apk](https://torrentfreak.com/images/app-apk.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/app-apk.png)

Since the site’s URL appears to be hardcoded in many cases, only an app update will be able to point to a new location. Even then, open access to the files isn’t guaranteed and will only become more complex if there’s not enough centralized interest in creating or curating new subtitles for the latest titles.

There’s no suggestion from the site’s operator that Subscene has faced recent legal issues but nevertheless, blocking injunctions and personalized mentions in industry reports to government have played a part in the site’s history.

According to a message on the site’s main page, that history ends here.
