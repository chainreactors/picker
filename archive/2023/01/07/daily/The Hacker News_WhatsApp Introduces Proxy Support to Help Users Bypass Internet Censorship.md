Popular instant messaging service WhatsApp has launched support for proxy servers in the latest version of its Android and iOS apps, letting users circumvent government-imposed censorship and internet shutdowns.

"Choosing a proxy enables you to connect to WhatsApp through servers set up by volunteers and organizations around the world dedicated to helping people communicate freely," the Meta-owned company [said](https://blog.whatsapp.com/connecting-to-whatsapp-by-proxy).

Proxies act as an intermediary between end users and the service provider by routing requests originating from a client to the server and forwarding the response back to the device.

Users can [access the option](https://faq.whatsapp.com/520504143274092) by navigating to Settings > Storage and Data > Proxy > Use Proxy and entering a trusted proxy server address.

WhatsApp, which is used by more than two billion users across the world, has also made available a [reference implementation](https://github.com/WhatsApp/proxy/) that can be used to set up a proxy server to help others connect to the service.

The company emphasized that connecting through a proxy server still guarantees end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protections, and that the message contents will not be accessible to the servers, WhatsApp, or Meta.

"Use of a third-party proxy will share your IP address with the proxy provider," WhatsApp cautions in a Help Center page. "Third-party proxies aren't provided by WhatsApp."

The announcement comes months after Iran [curbed access](https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-iran-amid-protests-over-death-of-mahsa-amini-X8qVEwAD) to Instagram and WhatsApp in the wake of [widespread protests](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/hackers-aid-protests-against-iranian.html) after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in police custody.

In September 2022, encrypted messaging tool Signal, which is also blocked in Iran, [urged its users](https://signal.org/blog/run-a-proxy/) to set up proxy servers to help Iranians bypass restrictions and communicate via the platform.
