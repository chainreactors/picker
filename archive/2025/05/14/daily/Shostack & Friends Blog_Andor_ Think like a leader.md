# Andor: Think like a leader

Think like a what??!
![A shot of Luthen and Cassian Andor](/images/blog/img/2025/luthen-talking-to-cassian-in-andor-1000w.webp)

There’s an amazing moment of dialog in Andor:
Luthen: “You’re thinking like a thief!”
Andor: “I’m thinking like a soldier!”
Luthen: “I need you to think like a leader!”

Now, maybe this just hit me because of my own rebellion
against “think like an attacker,” but I think it’s a great small
bit. Luthen doesn’t explain how a leader thinks, but then, many
leaders don’t know how leaders think. They get promoted into the
job, and let’s face it. Rebellions are built on hope, and the H in
HR doesn’t stand for hope.

Large, successful organizations have ways they do things, and
training programs that reflect how things were done there. In
today’s world of rapid change, the training isn’t always up to
date and fully on-target.

What’s more, organizations generally want things done the same way,
but a rebellion, almost by definition, cannot have management done
the same way. As it grows from Fenix to .. other places (avoiding
a spoiler), the way leadership has to work has to change, and I
really can’t touch on some of the Andor plot points without a
spoiler. And so the direction to “think like a leader” makes an
unfortunate amount of sense: The Rebellion needs people to grow
into new shoes to take on the growing challenges which come with
success.

If you want to dig in without watching, two great roundups include
one from [Emmet
Asher-Perrin](https://reactormag.com/andor-questions-every-loyalty-in-three-new-episodes/) one from
[Eric Geller](https://ericgeller.wordpress.com/2025/05/10/andor-season-2-review-episodes-7-9/). Both are full of spoilers.

Some of my posts about thinking like an attacker have been:

* [The Discipline of “think like an attacker”](https://shostack.org/archive/2008/09/the-discipline-of-think-like-an-attacker/)
* [“Think Like an Attacker” is an opt-in mistake](https://shostack.org/archive/2016/04/think-like-an-attacker-is-an-opt-in-mistake/)
* [Modeling Attackers and Their Motives](https://shostack.org/blog/modeling-attackers-and-their-motives/)
* [Think Like An Attacker? Flip that advice!](https://shostack.org/archive/2014/11/think-like-an-attacker-flip-that-advice/)
* [Think Like An Attacker?](https://shostack.org/archive/2008/09/think-like-an-attacker/)

We think about these elements, and more, as we [coach](/coaching/) customers
through culture change for threat modeling, and it’s great to see
it on screen. And I should mention: Andor. It’s an older code, but
it still [checks out](https://courses.shostack.org/).

Yes, the screenshot is from Season 1. How many
times can I say: Spoilers?
