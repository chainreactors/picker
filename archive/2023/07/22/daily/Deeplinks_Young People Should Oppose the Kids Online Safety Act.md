*Are you a young person fighting back against bad bills like KOSA? Become an EFF member at a [new, discounted Neon membership level specifically for you--stickers included!](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/neon)*

Next week, Congress plans to move a bill forward that is opposed by dozens of organizations, digital rights protectors, LGBTQ+ activists, and human rights defenders: the [Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1409/text). As we’ve [written](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/kids-online-safety-act-still-huge-danger-our-rights-online) before, KOSA would lead to censorship and privacy invasions for all social media users. But the most impacted groups will be young people, who the bill purports to help by banishing to a second-class internet.

What’s often been left out of the debate over KOSA is how young people feel about this. In fact, many teenagers already oppose the bill. Young TikTok users have been rallying one another to call and email legislators to push back on the bill, and [videos](https://www.tiktok.com/%40omarsbigsister/video/7255338014325476650?_r=1&_t=8e1OQ9w10kE) [describing](https://www.tiktok.com/%40xillyz/video/7256918785481805099?q=kosa&t=1689796024123) [what’s](https://www.tiktok.com/%40juiceinaboxx/video/7254259434463972650?q=kosa&t=1689796024123) [wrong](https://www.tiktok.com/%40leahs.library/video/7254419754755050794?q=%23kosa&t=1689796527009) [with](https://www.tiktok.com/%40v1rtu3al_j0k3r/video/7257346607086046507?q=%23kosa&t=1689796367251) [KOSA](https://www.tiktok.com/%40bandnamegenerator/video/7254619080244727083?q=k...
