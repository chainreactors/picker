# Russian programmer says FSB agents planted spyware on his Android phone

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

3:00 AM PST · December 5, 2024

A programmer said the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) installed spyware on his Android phone after he was detained in Moscow earlier this year. Security researchers confirmed that his phone had spyware installed, likely when the authorities had physical access to his phone and had forced him to give up his passcode.

For the programmer Kirill Parubets, it was a terrifying and traumatic ordeal. But thanks to his computer expertise and vigilance, his story offers a rare firsthand account of Russian authorities deploying spyware on one of its citizens — not by using a technically advanced remote hacking attack, but with a more crude approach.

Parubets is a Russian systems analyst who identifies as having Ukrainian heritage, calls himself “an opposition political activist,” and has lived in Ukraine since 2020. Parubets says he has volunteered and given financial and humanitarian aid to Ukrainians after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.

Parubets said he and his wife traveled back to Russia in 2023 to deal with some paperwork, as they were trying to get Moldovan citizenship, which would have allowed them to remain in Ukraine.

On April 18, 2024, six FSB agents armed with machine guns burst into Parubets and his wife’s apartment in Moscow at around 6:30 in the morning. “They threw us to the floor, they dragged my wife into a small room, I was lying in the hallway. They didn’t let us get dressed,” according to his recollection of the events, which Parubets wrote in a document he shared with TechCrunch.

The agents asked him about transfers of money to Ukrainians, as well as about a friend of Parubets, whom he calls using the nickname Ivan Ivanov. (Parubets says he changed Ivan’s name to protect him.)

“What’s your f—king password?” one of the agents asked Parubets when they picked up his Android phone, according to his recollection of the events. Intimidated, Parubets said he gave away its password.

On the same day, Parubets said he and his wife were arrested and sentenced to 15 days of administrative arrest. While in detainment, where he said he was also beaten, Parubets said FSB officers visited him and asked about his volunteer activities and donations in Ukraine, as well as donations he made in the name of his friend Ivanov, which they claimed could be classified as treason. Then the FSB officers, according to Parubets, asked him to spy on Ivanov, whom they said had communicated with Ukraine’s Special Services.

“They threatened me and said that they would put me and my wife in prison for life if I did not provide them with assistance,” said Parubets.

That’s why Parubets said he decided to tell the agents he would agree to help them, even though he was not actually planning to do it.

Then, on May 3, Parubets said he and his wife were released and he went to get their belongings back, including his Android phone. Parubets said he soon noticed a strange notification that said “Arm cortex vx3 synchronization,” then disappeared and rebooted the phone.

At that point, Parubets, who has an interest in cybersecurity, said he inspected his phone and found a suspicious app that had several permissions granted access to a trove of personal data on the phone. At that point, Parubets said he reached out to [First Department](https://dept.one/), a legal assistance organization. The organization in turn reached out to Citizen Lab, a security research and internet watchdog at the University of Toronto, to analyze the suspicious app.

[According to a new Citizen Lab report](https://citizenlab.ca/2024/12/device-confiscated-by-russian-authorities-returned-with-monokle-type-spyware-installed/) out Thursday, authored by Cooper Quintin, Rebekah Brown, and John Scott-Railton, the app was indeed spyware.

The researchers said that the suspicious app identified by Parubets appeared to be “a trojanized version of the genuine Cube Call Recorder application,” a legitimate call recorder app.

According to the report, the fake app was able to access location information, read and send text messages, install other applications, read the calendar, take screenshots and record from the video camera, see a list of other applications, answer phone calls, and view user account details — all permissions that the real Cube Call Recorder does not have.
