Spanish Internet Service Providers (ISPs) continue to  fall short of robust transparency about their data protection and user privacy practices, with many failing to meet criteria  that directly builds on Spanish and EU data protection regulations.

While highlighting that internet companies in Spain need to step up their user privacy game, [Eticas Foundation](https://eticasfoundation.org/)’s third edition of [*¿Quien Defiende Tus Datos?*](https://eticas.tech/quien-defiende-tus-datos) [(Who Defends Your Data?) Spain](https://eticas.tech/quien-defiende-tus-datos) showed that Movistar (Telefónica) maintained a leadership position among companies evaluated, with a total of 18 out of 21 points. The ISP scored well in all evaluated criteria except for user notification. On the other hand, Habitaclia received the lowest score, with just 5.5 points.

All of Spain’s ISPs received credits in the privacy policy category, which covers crucial information companies should provide users about their data processing practices. ISPs made significant strides in this category in [Eticas’ last report](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/spains-new-who-defends-your-data-report-shows-robust-privacy-policie...
