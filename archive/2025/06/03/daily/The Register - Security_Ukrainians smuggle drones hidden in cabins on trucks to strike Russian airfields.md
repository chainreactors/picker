Ukraine claims it launched a cunning drone strike on Sunday against multiple Russian airbases, hitting over 40 military aircraft and inflicting an estimated $7 billion in damage, in an operation dubbed "Spiderweb."

[According to](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1929273356425248853) a post on X from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the operation, which took 18 months of planning, involved 117 drones, with operators in three different time zones directing kamikaze attacks against the Russian bomber fleet. The operators are all safely back in Ukraine, he claimed.

According to a Telegram post by Russian investigative outlet [Baza](https://t.me/bazabazon/37906), Ukrainian operatives hid explosive-laden drones inside trucks transporting prefabricated wooden cabins, which were driven into various regions of Russia by unwitting Russian drivers. In several cases, the drones reportedly launched after the trucks were parked near military facilities.
