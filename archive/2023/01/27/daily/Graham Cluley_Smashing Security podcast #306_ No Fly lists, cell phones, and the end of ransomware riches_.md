What are prisoners getting up to with mobile phones? Why might ransomware no longer be generating as much revenue for cybercriminals? And how on earth did an airline leave the US government‚Äôs ‚ÄúNo Fly‚Äù list accessible for anyone in the world to download?

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Maria Varmazis.
