Growing up in Bangalore before it got associated with traffic and IT. Life was a little different.

Every evening 6PM, my mom would religiously close all the doors and windows to block all the uninvited guests AKA mosquitos at bay.

Yet somehow, we hear these buzzing intruders make their way in and activating the primary defence mechanism, the infamous mosquito coil and the clapping them away like an out of sync orchestra also burning some calories along the way.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Picture7-3.png)

Over the years this technology has evolved in many ways

Good old hand clapping replaced by electric bats which would give an inferiority complex even to the best out there from Wimbledon. I remember this was my favourite 6PM activity and made me proud of my hunts every evening.

Then came the mosquito repellent sprays which allowed you to suddenly be immune to mosquito bites while they roamed around closely. It always a gave a feeling of being in a caged safari jeep in Kenya, riding through the lions without worrying about safety.

Today at home there is ingenuous little trapper machine that attracts mosquitos with its neon light and has a fan to suck them in and trap them into a little confinement which I religiously clean once a week, automating the entire need to worry about or do anything about the mosquitos.

Now summerizing these technologies into 4 broad categories as below, they also vary in the levels of automation.

Now as we witness the transformation of organisations as they embrace hyper automation, one of the debates that we always have is around what is worth automating and where is the value of automation?

As humans we have natural superiority in a few activities whereas machines are superior with standard repetitive tasks. However, there is also a middle path of humans and machines working in sync, complementing each other’s strengths.

The below table calls out the earlier mapping I did for the type of activities and the critical features in each of these elements.

So ultimately Automation becomes a great power which you can wield to whatever level of intensity based on your requirement.

At SAP, we have the SAP Process Automation tool kit which enables us to cater to all the automation needs from process discovery and intelligence to AI/ML, Low code tools, forms, feedback loops, workflows and various other microservices needed to support your automation journey.

Customers can repurpose manpower to more value added tasks and eliminate the bottlenecks in the core process multiple folds powered by this package.

Now what else can further sweeten this you ask?

Well as SAP, we also have a first-hand experience of bots/ workflows that are very commonly used across core processes in multiple industries around the world and that puts SAP in a unique position to create repeatable automation solutions.

One example is the SAP iRPA store: <https://irpa.store.sap.com/> where you can find all the relevant pre-built content for your processes.

The vibrant SAP partner ecosystem also is a great place to look for various automations and extensions for your needs.

Now this really puts the power into your hands as to what you want to automate, How much you want to automate and what needs to be the scope of that automation!

Happy Automation to you ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@F5E1ACF1B11D8F2A0F728ABA9AA5B820/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")
