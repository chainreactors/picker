Every day we are more and more exposed to cybercrime. Computers, smartphones and IoT devices are part of everyday life in every home and business. Added to this is the emergence of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud services, smart cities and 5G. All these results in endless opportunities and advantages for people, professionals and companies. But it also means an **increase in [cyber exposure](https://www.redseguridad.com/especialidades-tic/tecnologias-disruptivas/ciberexposicion-la-asignatura-pendiente_20221014.html)**. Therefore, all companies, not just the largest, must place cybersecurity at the center of their strategy. This is precisely the goal of the **CIS Controls Implementation Groups**.

The [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/implementation-groups) (CIS) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust in the digital world. To this end, it has developed various solutions and a methodological framework based on **global best practices in cybersecurity**. Within this work, creating and updating the **CIS critical security controls** stands out above all.

The latest version of this guide consists of 18 security controls and 153 safeguards. In other words, concrete actions must be taken to implement each control effectively.

Is it feasible for a medium-sized company to implement these 153 actions? The guide resolves these questions by defining three **groups for implementing CIS controls**, depending on the company’s size, resources, and cybersecurity maturity level.

Below, we will explore the **key CIS controls implementation groups**. And their relevance in helping small and medium-sized enterprises arm themselves against cybercriminals.

## 1. Digitalization and cybersecurity

Digitalization has spread to all areas of our lives and also to the business world as a whole. Today, most companies use software, digital devices or WiFi networks and have websites and other elements exposed to the Internet and, therefore, to cyber-attacks.

The digital transformation of companies must be accompanied by a **cybersecurity strategy** commensurate with the company’s exposure area and the data it stores.

Otherwise, companies expose themselves to being **victims of fraud or data theft**. As well as the consequences of these security incidents: damage to the company’s reputation, financial losses linked to the attack, legal repercussions and possible fines…

Large companies undertook their digital transformation years ago, which has led to a higher level of awareness of the importance of cybersecurity. This, together with their ability to mobilize economic resources and the need to comply with increasingly demanding regulations, has made it easier for these organizations to have specialized departments or to hire advanced [**cybersecurity services**](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-services/) to optimize their security measures, controls and policies.

On the other hand, SMEs have joined the digital revolution later, need more economic resources, have to deal with less demanding legal requirements and, above all, have a significantly lower level of awareness of the importance of cybersecurity.

This is also because many **cybersecurity incidents** this type of companies suffer go unreported. In contrast, the cyberattacks that large companies have to deal with are made public and are reported by the media to the public.

## 2. SMEs, the target of cyberattacks

Given the above context and the increasing cyber-exposure they face, SMEs and medium-sized companies have become ideal targets for criminals. It is easier to detect **security breaches** in this type of organization than in companies that use **cybersecurity services** to defend themselves.

According to the Ministry of Home Office, there were more than 200,000 cybercrimes in Spain between January and September 2022. Without knowing the figure for the last quarter and incorporating data from Catalonia and the Basque Country, this headline gives a good account of the number of criminal actions carried out over the Internet. A figure that is growing year after year.

Despite this, many companies and citizens do not perceive cyber-attacks as a major threat, which can **exfiltrate their data** and have a far-reaching impact on business activity and personal life.

As it is, Google’s Current Cybersecurity Landscape in Spain [report](https://www.ospi.es/export/sites/ospi/documents/documentos/Seguridad-y-privacidad/Google_Panorama-actual-de-la-ciberseguridad-en-Espana.pdf) provides worrying data. For example, only 12% of IT managers in SMEs consider that their organizations have a «very secure» level of prote...
