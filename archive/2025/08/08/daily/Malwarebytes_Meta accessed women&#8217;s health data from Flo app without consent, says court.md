# Meta accessed women’s health data from Flo app without consent, says court

Posted: August 7, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

A jury has [ruled](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/jury-rules-meta-violated-california-privacy-laws-by-collecting-menstrual-health-data-from-flo/) that Meta accessed [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from a woman’s reproductive health tracking app without consent.

The app in question is called Flo Health. Developed in 2015 in Belarus to track menstrual cycles, it has evolved over the years as a tracking app for highly detailed, intimate aspects of women’s reproductive health.

Flo Health user Erica Frasco bought a class action lawsuit against the company in 2021, following a damning [report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636) about its privacy infractions by the Wall Street Journal in 2019.

Since she downloaded the app in 2017, Frasco, like its other users, regularly answered highly intimate questions. These ranged from the timing and comfort level of menstrual cycles, through to mood swings and preferred birth control methods, and their level of satisfaction with their sex life and romantic relationships. The app even asked when users had engaged in sexual activity and whether they were trying to get pregnant.

According to the [complaint](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Flo-Health-Complaint.pdf), Flo Health promised not to share this data with third parties unless it was necessary for the provision of its services. Even then, it would not only share information relevant to web hosting and app development, it promised. It would not include “information regarding your marked cycles, pregnancy, symptoms, notes and other information entered by [users]”, reported the original complaint.

Yet between 2016 and 2019 Flo Health shared that intimate data with companies including Facebook and Google, along with mobile marketing firm AppsFlyer, and Yahoo!-owned mobile analytics platform Flurry. Whenever someone opened the app, it would be logged. Every interaction inside the app was also logged, and this data was shared.

Flo Health didn’t impose rules on how these third parties could use the data. “In fact, the terms of service governing Flo Health’s agreement with these third parties allowed them to use the data for their own purposes, completely unrelated to services provided in connection with the App,” the complaint went on.

By December 2020, 150 million people were using the app, according to court documents. Flo had promised them that they could trust it.

Users were “trusting us with intimate personal information,” it said in its privacy policy. “We are committed to keeping that trust, which is why our policy as a company is to take every step to ensure that individual user’s data and privacy rights are protected.”

The Federal Trade Commission investigated these allegations and [settled](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/192-3133-flo-health-inc) with Flo Health in 2021, imposing an independent review of its privacy policy and mandating that it not misrepresent its app.

The class action lawsuit claims common law invasion of privacy, breach of contract and implied contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of the Stored Communications Act and the California Confidenti...
