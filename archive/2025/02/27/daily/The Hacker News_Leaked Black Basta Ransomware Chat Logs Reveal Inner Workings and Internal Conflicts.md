"Leaked Black Basta Chat Logs")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_lpgnBM7XW9VnzTrnfXXtFkys63Nyty6Aizr_mdNNP_M034iFxgudki0Bl7Dczu69KzWCCxWn29FBRwg-qbLNYhmJct6PZKsGCocVkmyznLIF2to7wn8Ic9R9YOkumE9zoBV5RCjPvCVav29DApjzztP-_Q1HbvERR93XuzIm_P0i8HqdUyE2aMNxKyXQ/s790-rw-e365/ransomware.png)

More than a year's worth of internal chat logs from a ransomware gang known as Black Basta have been [published online](https://x.com/PRODAFT/status/1892636346885235092) in a leak that provides unprecedented visibility into their tactics and internal conflicts among its members.

The Russian-language chats on the Matrix messaging platform between September 18, 2023, and September 28, 2024, were initially leaked on February 11, 2025, by an individual who goes by the handle [ExploitWhispers](https://t.me/exploitwhispers), who claimed that they released the data because the group was targeting Russian banks. The identity of the leaker remains a mystery.

[Black Basta](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/black-basta-ransomware-strikes-500.html) first came under the spotlight in April 2022, using the now-largely-defunct QakBot (aka QBot) as a delivery vehicle. According to an advisory published by the U.S. government in May 2024, the double extortion crew is estimated to have targeted more than 500 private industry and critical infrastructure entities in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Per Elliptic and Corvus Insurance, the prolific ransomware group is estimated to have [netted at least $107 million](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/cactus-ransomware-exploits-qlik-sense.html) in Bitcoin ransom payments from more than 90 victims by the end of 2023.

Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT said the financially motivated threat actor, also tracked as Vengeful Mantis, has been "mostly inactive since the start of the year" due to internal strife, with some of its operators scamming victims by collecting ransom payments without providing a working decryptor.

What's more, key members of the Russia-linked cybercrime syndicate are said to have jumped ship to the [CACTUS](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/microsoft-warns-of-malvertising-scheme.html) (aka Nurturing Mantis) and Akira ransomware operations.

"The internal conflict was driven by 'Tramp' (LARVA-18), a known threat actor who operates a spamming network responsible for distributing QBot," PRODAFT said in a post on X. "As a key figure within BLACKBASTA, his actions played a major role in the group's instability."

Some of the [salient](https://x.com/3xp0rtblog/status/1892583537879994632) [aspects](https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1892830063365697685) of the leak, which contains nearly 200,000 messages, are listed below -

* Lapa is one of the main administrators of Black Basta and involved in administrative tasks
* Cortes is associated with the QakBot group, which has sought to distance itself in the wake of Black Basta's attacks against Russian banks
* YY is another administrator of Black Basta who is involved in support tasks
* Trump is one of the aliases for "the group's main boss" Oleg Nefedov, who goes by the names GG and AA
* Trump and another individual, Bio, worked together in the now-dismantled [Conti ransomware scheme](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/conti-ransomware-gang-shut-down-after.html)
* One of the Black Basta affiliates is believed to be a minor aged 17 years
* Black Basta has begun to actively [incorporate social engineering](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/black-basta-ransomware-evolves-with.html) into their attacks following the success of [Scattered Spider](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/scattered-spider-adopts-ransomhub-and.html)

According to Qualys, the Black Basta group leverages known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insufficient security controls to obtain initial access to target networks. The discussions show that SMB misconfigurations, exposed RDP servers, and weak authentication mechanisms are routinely exploited, often relying on default VPN credentials or brute-forcing stolen credentials.

Another key attack vector entails the deployment of malware droppers to deliver the malicious payloads. In a further attempt to evade detection, the e-crime group has been found to use legitimate file-sharing platforms like transfer.sh, temp.sh, and send.vis.ee for hosting the payloads.

"Ransomware groups are no longer taking their time once they breach an organization's network," Saeed Abbasi, manager of product at Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), [said](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/02/25/defense-lessons-from-the-black-basta-ransomware-playbook). "Recently leaked data from Black Basta shows they're moving from initial access to network-wide compromise within hours – sometimes even minutes."

The disclosure comes as Check Point's Cyberint Research Team revealed that the Cl0p ransomware group has resumed targeting organizations, listing organizations that were breached on its data leak site following the exploitation of a recently disclosed security flaw ([CVE-2024-50623](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/cleo-file-transfer-vulnerability-under.html)) impacting the Cleo managed file transfer software.

"Cl0p is contacting these companies directly, providing secure c...
