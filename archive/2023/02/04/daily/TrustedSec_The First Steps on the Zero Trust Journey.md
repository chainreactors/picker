One of the most discussed concepts in the Information Security world in recent history has been Zero Trust. Although many vendors claim to have products for implementing Zero Trust, an organization must not view them as an instant solution to achieving Zero Trust.

Zero Trust should be viewed as a philosophy comprised of many controls and technologies that enable more robust access management capabilities. It is a change in the mindset of how to protect an organization’s resources. Similar to a least privilege model, it can cause significant disruptions if it's too restrictive or overly complex. An organization adopting Zero Trust must first identify which framework aligns with its Information Security goals.

Several frameworks have been released for an organization to review, but we will focus on the NIST 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture in this discussion. We have decided to focus on NIST as it is product agnostic and from a widely known and respected standards organization, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). It is also a great starting point for organizations to demystify all the hype around Zero Trust and assess against a defined framework.

## **What is Zero Trust?**

Often within Zero Trust discussions and papers, the terms Zero Trust (ZT) and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) are used. The definitions of these terms as defined by NIST are:

* Zero Trust is a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised.
* Zero Trust Architecture is an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that utilizes Zero Trust concepts and encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies.

## **What exactly does that mean?**

In its most basic description, a Zero Trust deployment will evaluate access between all IT systems and end-users continually. Access will be permitted or denied by a centralized system based on dynamic processes. Zero Trust can be deployed on a per-application or environment basis depending on the organization’s requirements. There are multiple solutions and deployment models that an organization should evaluate to support its Zero Trust deployment, and each of these will have varying levels of cost, support models, and technical training requirements.

## **What's Needed to Implement Zero Trust?**

To implement Zero Trust, an organization will need to develop a significant understanding of deployed resources, communication workflows, and end-user access requirements. This information will assist in defining implicit trust zones and building policies that dynamically control access to the organization’s resources. These tasks should also be completed prior to considering assessing whether an organization has achieved Zero Trust.

An implicit trust zone is a collection of resources that permit lateral movement once an end-user or resource is a...
