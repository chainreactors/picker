## What Happened

In June 2025, 107k unique customer email addresses were allegedly obtained from TheSqua.re, the "easiest way to find your next serviced apartment". The data also included names, phone numbers and cities which were subsequently posted to a popular hacking forum. TheSqua.re did not respond to repeated attempts to disclose the incident, however multiple impacted HIBP subscribers confirmed the legitimacy and accuracy of the data.
