# Webtoon Targets 170+ Pirate Domains Through DMCA Subpoena

In June, Webtoon Entertainment celebrated going public by sounding the closing bell at the Nasdaq exchange. Thus far, early investors haven't been rewarded, but the company itself sees a bright future ahead. By targeting roughly 170 pirate site domains though a DMCA subpoena, it hopes to unmask their rogue operators and clear the path for future growth.

Partly owned by the South Korean company [Naver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naver_Corporation), Webtoon rode the popular ‘webtoon’ wave all the way to the Nasdaq exchange, where it got a listing this summer.

With millions of creators on board, and roughly 170 million active monthly users, the webtoon company is seen as a growth story. While that may be the case, Webtoon’s first quarterly earnings report on August 8 wasn’t well received.

## Webtoon’s Rough Start at Nasdaq

Instead of significant growth, revenues were more or less flat compared to a year ago. This was a disappointment to many investors and the stock price fell by more than 40%, ‘evaporating’ a billion dollars in market cap.

For the company’s management, it would’ve been easy to point at piracy as a contributing factor. However, piracy wasn’t mentioned once in the official earnings report. It did get a brief mention during the conference call; Webtoon CFO David Lee mentioned that piracy is a concern for all user generated content services.

Webtoon has a positive outlook on its future and attributed the ‘disappointing’ results to currency headwinds. When currency exchange rates are kept stable, the company noted that year-over-year growth was 11%, topping expectations.

## Eye on Pirates

While Webtoon doesn’t use piracy as a scapegoat, the company certainly considers it as a serious challenge going forward. This was made apparent in a [SEC filing](https://ir.webtoon.com/static-files/37babe94-1498-44e2-bbef-fdfc672801d5) published a few days ago.

“As the copying and distribution of content over the internet proliferates, the risk of piracy, gray market sales, illegal downloading, file-sharing or other infringement, misappropriation and other violation of our intellectual property is likely to continue to increase,” Webtoon Entertainment states.

“We take various measures to prevent and monitor unauthorized use of our content, including developing proprietary technology to detect piracy and other technological measures,” the SEC filing adds.

These mandatory statements don’t address any novel concerns. Piracy has always been a challenge for the company, which sends out millions of DMCA takedown notices every month in an effort to contain the problem.

Not all sites and services are receptive to these takedown requests, however. Webtoon occasionally has to step up its efforts and address ‘pirate’ threats more directly, through cease-and-desist letters accompanied by legal threats, for example.

## Webtoon Subpoenas Cloudflare to ‘Expose’ Pirates

Most ‘pirate’ sites don’t share their full names and contact details online, so getting to these people can be a challenge. Luckily for Webtoon, DMCA subpoenas may be useful to gather additional information.

A few days ago, Webtoon filed a DMCA subpoena request at a Texas federal court, compelling CDN service Cloudflare to expose the personal details of customers connected to allegedly-infringing domain names.

The legal paperwork lists close to 200 targets. After merging several subdomains, we end up with roughly 170 unique domain names, including those related to popular sites such as Bato.to, Mangareader.to, and Mangas.in, which all have millions of monthly visits.

A declaration submitted by an attorney at Webtoon anti-piracy partner Remove Your Media, clarifies that the information requested will only be used to protect the publisher’s rights.

“The purpose of the accompanying subpoena is to obtain the identity of the alleged copyright infringer(s) in control of the internet domain(s)/website(s) listed in the subpoena. The information obtained will be used only for the purpose of protecting the rights granted to my client,” the declaration reads.

After reviewing the application, a court clerk signed the subpoena and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) now has until October 1st to respond. Judging from previous cases, the US-based Internet infrastructure company won’t contest the request for user details.

## Effective, but Not Perfect

To what degree the information Cloudflare has on file will help Webtoon’s enforcement efforts has yet to be seen. Operators of pirate sites are known to use false identities and some are aware that their personal data can be discovered though DMCA subpoenas.

According to Webtoon’s previous experience, these legal efforts can certainly pay off. Last year, the company targeted [360 pirate domain names](https://torrentfreak.com/naver-webtoon-targets-hundreds-of-piracy-sites-ahead-of-public-listing-231024/) through a similar subpoena, which resulted in the shutdown of several sites.

Webtoon’s own reports suggested that 150 ‘sites’ went offline after they were targeted though the Cloudflare subpoena.

“After three months of hard work by Naver Webtoon, about 150 overseas illegal sites stopped operating. This is the result of Naver Webtoon’s action to issue a ‘Subpoena’ through a U.S. court, the first in the webtoon industry,” the company [wrote](https://torrentfreak.com/naver-webtoon-150-pirate-sites-shut-down-after-cloudflare-dmca-subpoena-231106/) in November.

Those shutdowns included many prominent pirate sites including Aquamanga.com, which had more than 60 million monthly visits at its peak.

Time will tell if the most recent subpoena produces similar results but as long as it leads to the shutdown of sizable pirate sites, Webtoon will likely continue these anti-piracy efforts moving forward.

**Update: November 2024:** Webtoon notes that some 70 domains have become unavailable following this action, as [reported](http://koreabizwire.com/naver-webtoon-shuts-down-70-overseas-piracy-sites-through-legal-action-in-u-s/298778) by Korea Bizwire.
