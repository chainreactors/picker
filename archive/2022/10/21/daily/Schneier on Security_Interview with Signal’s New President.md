## Interview with Signal’s New President

Long and interesting [interview](https://www.theverge.com/23409716/signal-encryption-messaging-sms-meredith-whittaker-imessage-whatsapp-china) with Signal’s new president, Meredith Whittaker:

> WhatsApp uses the Signal encryption protocol to provide encryption for its messages. That was absolutely a visionary choice that Brian and his team led back in the day ­- and big props to them for doing that. But you can’t just look at that and then stop at message protection. WhatsApp does not protect metadata the way that Signal does. Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections. We don’t know who you are talking to or who is in the membership of a group. It has gone above and beyond to minimize the collection of metadata.
>
> WhatsApp, on the other hand, collects the information about your profile, your profile photo, who is talking to whom, who is a group member. That is powerful metadata. It is particularly powerful—and this is where we have to back out into a structural argument ­ for a company to collect the data that is also owned by Meta/Facebook. Facebook has a huge amount, just unspeakable volumes, of intimate information about billions of people across the globe.
>
> It is not trivial to point out that WhatsApp metadata could easily be joined with Facebook data, and that it could easily reveal extremely intimate information about people. The choice to remove or enhance the encryption protocols is still in the hands of Facebook. We have to look structurally at what that organization is, who actually has control over these decisions, and at some of these details that often do not get discussed when we talk about message encryption overall.

I am a fan of Signal and I use it every day. The one feature I want, which WhatsApp has and Signal does not, is the ability to easily export a chat to a text file.

Signal requires a phone number, and requires using a “smart” phone to set it up.

So, no thanks.

It’s a messaging app. Why not simply use it on a laptop/desktop, with any username someone chooses? Then it can truly claim to be privacy focussed.

They can make all the promises they want, but that doesn’t mean that will keep them, or that they can keep them even if they wanted to. Leaks, hacks, subpoenas, etc. can make it all go backwards.

Signal uses phone numbers. Threema, for instance, uses random strings. Further if you install signal on your phone, and you are in my contacts, then I know you have installed signal. If you think that is OK, think harder.

Signal has done a really good job of misleading people about how safe it actually is.

@ ALL,

To be honest I stopped reading wheb I got to,

> *“Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections.”*

Whilst that is potentially true it’s disingenuous and designed as a “lie of ommission”

Signal has all it’s users phone numbers, these are like the new social security numbers.

Whilst Signal may not know all your details, it has the “Primary Key” by which they are all uniquely identified…

So they have the “keys to your kingdom” as “third party business records” and all the readers here should know what that means…

So there was no point reading on.

@Q

> Signal requires a phone number, and requires using a “smart” phone to set it up.

All security is a trade-off between security and usability. If you want perfect security, do not use a computer and do not use the internet, do not use the phone network, and do not use radio waves.

Then you also do not have any medium to transfer your message over, and no one to send it to.

If you want to use a smartphone and the internet, and you want to communicate with someone else, then the question is what would be better than Signal? I am open for suggestions.

And if you do not want iOS or Android, there are several Google free images for Android, some indeed geared to security and privacy. They are all hampered by the fact that they are build on TCP/IP and common hardware.

If you want to stick to a laptop, you can use one of several apps that all have in common that hardly anyone uses them. My experiences with encrypted messaging on laptops and computers are that there were never anyone to comunicate with.

Doesn’t Signal’s use of phone numbers help them ensure that you’re actually talking to the person you think you are? I mean, there are choices to be made about identity in the system, different options that are legitimate and defensible in different contexts.

Commenters here are writing as if Signal is lying and trying to trick us into using an insecure product. I don’t think that’s true.

In the end it’s only a tool, and like all tools, especially ones that involve security, it has its limitations, and you have to understand what’s going on to get the most out of it.

But do you guys really think Signal is a bad tool to have access to? They’ve made something that’s as usable as text messaging, and that goes a long way toward securing our privacy.

Smart phone convenience is a lure, alleged “security” is akin to religious faith, and Silicon Valley is a Ponzi scheme that can only offer more tech. Don’t expect tech courtiers to discuss such topics as that would put an abrupt end to all their paid speaking engagements.
