Right-to-repair advocates have spent more than a decade working for a simple goal: to make sure you can fix and tinker with your own stuff. That should be true whether we’re talking about a [car](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/eff-files-amicus-brief-defending-right-repair-massachusetts), [a tractor](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdazj/john-deere-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-for-alleged-tractor-repair-monopoly), a [smartphone, a computer](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apples-new-self-service-repair-program-what-it-means-for-you-and-your-apple-devices/), or really anything you buy. Yet product manufacturers have used the [growing presence of software](https://www.eff.org/issues/right-to-repair) on devices to make [nonsense arguments](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/eff-files-amicus-brief-defending-right-repair-massachusetts) about why tinkering with your stuff violates their copyright.

Our years of hard work pushing for consumer rights to repair are paying off in a big way. Case in point: Today—July 1, 2024—two strong repair bills are now law in California and Minnesota. As Repair Association Executive Director Gay Gordon-Byrne said on EFF's podcast about right to repair, after doggedly chasing this goal for years, [we caught the car](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/04/podcast-episode-right-repair-catches-car)!

Sometimes it's hard to know what to do after a long fight. But it's clear for the repair movement. Now is the time to celebrate! That's why EFF is joining our friends in the right to repair world by celebrating Repair Independence Day.
