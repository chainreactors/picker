# “Sad announcement” email implies your friend has died

Posted: November 20, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Tech support scammers are again stooping low with their email campaigns. This particular one hints that one of your contacts may have met an untimely end.

It all starts with an email titled “Sad announcement” followed by a full name of someone you know. The email may appear to come from the person themselves.

A co-worker who received such an email pointed it out to our team. Looking around, I found the first report about such an email in a [tweet](https://x.com/juliaioffe/status/1754545974058328199) dating back to February 5, 2024.

With some more information about what I was looking for, I managed to find several more.

There is a great deal of variation between the emails, but we do have enough samples to show you a pattern which looks like this:

![The pattern of the Sad announcement email](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/pattern_aaf4fa.jpg)

Subject: Sad announcement: <First name><Last name>

Sometimes the colon is replaced by the word “from”.

Then a short sentence to pique the reader’s curiosity, which often references photos. Here are some examples:

> “When you open them you will see why I actually wanted to share them with you today”
>
> “Never thought I would want to share these images with you, anyways here they are”
>
> “I’m presuming you should remember these two ladies, in that photo”
>
> “When I was looking through some old folders I found these 3 pics”
>
> “it wasn’t initially my plan, but I had to change my mind about it”
>
> “Two pictures that I wanted to share with you. They’re likely to bring a flood of memories to you, as they did to me…”
>
> “Probably should have contacted you a little bit earlier. Anyways just wanted to keep you updated”

This is then immediately followed by a link. These also follow a certain pattern:

`gjsqr.hytsiysx.com`

`tmdlod.vdicedohf.com`

`gtfhq.rmldxkff.com`

`pdbh.ramahteen.com`

`owwiu.dexfyerd.com`

`roix.unrgagceso.com`

`yrlbi.vohdsniuz.com`

`uqjk.mbafwnds.com`

`vjdbd.hhesdeh.com`

`mbjzo.enexoo.com`

These domains are all registered with NameCheap and are only active for a few days.

To close the emails off, the scammers end with a quote in the format:

> “You do not find the happy life. You make it.” –  Camilla Eyring Kimball

The sender addresses are spoofed to look like they were coming from family or friends of the target. The actual sender addresses are compromised accounts from all over the world.

The campaign looks to have targeted mainly the US, but I also found some located in Ireland and the UK and some odd ones in India and Italy.

So, the question is, what are they after? The short-lived domains really made it hard for me to figure that out. It took me quite a bit to find a domain that was still active, but then I knew soon enough what the end-goal of the spammers was.

A short chain of redirects sent me to [`https://niceandsafetystore0990.blob.core.windows[.]net/niceandsafetystore0990/index.html`](https://niceandsafetystore0990.blob.core.windows.net/niceandsafetystore0990/index.html) which is now blocked by Malwarebytes Browser Guard.
