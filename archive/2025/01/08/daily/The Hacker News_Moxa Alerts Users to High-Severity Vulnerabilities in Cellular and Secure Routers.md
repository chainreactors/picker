Taiwan-based Moxa has [warned](https://www.moxa.com/en/support/product-support/security-advisory/mpsa-241155-privilege-escalation-and-os-command-injection-vulnerabilities-in-cellular-routers%2C-secure-routers%2C-and-netwo) of two security vulnerabilities impacting its cellular routers, secure routers, and network security appliances that could allow privilege escalation and command execution.

The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

* **CVE-2024-9138** (CVSS 4.0 score: 8.6) - A hard-coded credentials vulnerability that could allow an authenticated user to escalate privileges and gain root-level access to the system, leading to system compromise, unauthorized modifications, data exposure, or service disruption
* **CVE-2024-9140** (CVSS 4.0 score: 9.3) - A vulnerability allows attackers to exploit special characters to bypass input restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized command execution

The shortcomings, reported by security researcher Lars Haulin, affect the below products and firmware versions -

* **CVE-2024-9138** - EDR-810 Series (Firmware version 5.12.37 and earlier), EDR-8010 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDR-G902 Series (Firmware version 5.7.25 and earlier), EDR-G902 Series (Firmware version 5.7.25 and earlier), EDR-G9004 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDR-G9010 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDF-G1002-BP Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), NAT-102 Series (Firmware version 1.0.5 and earlier), OnCell G4302-LTE4 Series (Firmware version 3.13 and earlier), and TN-4900 Series (Firmware version 3.13 and earlier)
* **CVE-2024-9140** - EDR-8010 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDR-G9004 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDR-G9010 Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), EDF-G1002-BP Series (Firmware version 3.13.1 and earlier), NAT-102 Series (Firmware version 1.0.5 and earlier), OnCell G4302-LTE4 Series (Firmware version 3.13 and earlier), and TN-4900 Series (Firmware version 3.13 and earlier)
