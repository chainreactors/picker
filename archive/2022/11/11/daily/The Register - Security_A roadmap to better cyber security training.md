# A roadmap to better cyber security training

Sponsored Post It's a common problem when it comes to finding a new job or landing that all important promotion. You need to upgrade your CV to show some knowledge and experience of systems, tools and frameworks that your current role doesn't require but the next step up the ladder does. But how do you learn what you need if you're current role focuses on a different set of priorities, or even know what areas of speciality different organisations prize most highly in the first place?

That's where the SANS' new [job role roadmap](https://www.sans.org/u/1nJT) comes in, designed to let students explore common career paths in cyber security and point them to the specific training courses which can help them get there.

That includes specific skillsets within cloud security, Industrial Control Systems (ICS), cyber defence and Blue Team Operations and cyber threat intelligence for example.
