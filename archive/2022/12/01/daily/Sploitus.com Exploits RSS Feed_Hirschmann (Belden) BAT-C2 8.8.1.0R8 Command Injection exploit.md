Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hirschmann BAT-C2 / 8.8.1.0R8

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection
The web server of the device is prone to an authenticated command injection.
It allows an attacker to gain full access to the underlying operating
system of
the device with all implications. If such a device is acting as key
device in
an industrial network, or controls various critical equipment via serial
ports,
more extensive damage in the corresponding network can be done by an
attacker.
