## Latest News

The community updates cover the latest news and events from OffSec. We focus on bringing the latest updates to the community every quarter covering OffSec news, content updates, and community conferences. Enjoy reading our blogs!

## Payment Plan Launch

Some students have communicated to us they face difficulties paying for their courses in one lump sum. To help address this we are proud to partner with Climb Credit to help with the upfront costs of certificates. Climb Credit offers a payment installment plan to help our students spread the cost of certification fees. Please note that OffSec does not provide payment plans for students directly, but instead we are leveraging this partner. This option is available with Climb Credit and applies to the Learn Fundamentals and Learn One subscriptions for students based in the USA. [Click here](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/9822378378004) if you would like to see if you qualify for the Climb Credit loan and apply.

## Help Us Bridge the Diversity Gap

Cyber Diversity in Action is an initiative where OffSec donates courses to charities, foundations, or non-profit organizations that focuses on providing resources to underrepresented groups worldwide. Our program gives students a headstart to secure a job in information security.Â Please support our mission to remove barriers and help these groups enter the cybersecurity field. We want to hear from organizations that empower more diversity and representation in cybersecurity. Want to learn more about Cyber Diversity in Action?

## Conferences and Community Events

The OffSec team has attended or sponsored the following conferences over the last quarter:

* [BSidesOttawa](https://bsidesottawa.ca/)
* [BSides Austin](https://bsidesaustin.com/)
* [Bsides Charlotte](https://www.bsidesclt.org/)
* [Texas Cyber Summit](https://texascyber.com/)
* [Hacktoria](https://hacktoria.com/)
* [CyberCon Melbourne](https://cyberconference.com.au/)
* [CircleCityCon](https://circlecitycon.org/)
* [NullCon GOA](https://nullcon.net/goa-2022)
* [Black Hat Middle East and Africa (MEA)](https://blackhatmea.com/)

OffSecâs brand ambassadors connect with passionate cybersecurity groups and provide resources to the local community anywhere in the world. Also, OffSecâs content development team travels to conferences to teach courses to global audiences. Letâs take a closer look at each cyber event we supported last quarter.

OffSec was an event sponsor for BSides security conferences based in Ottawa, Canada, Charlotte, US, and the virtual BSides Austin for security experts and anyone interested in infosec. Contestants won PWK courses with one exam attempt for the CTF events held at each event. We are thrilled to support BSides, a community-driven group helping individuals in security and cyber security share ideas, research, and build relationships in a safe space.

OffSec supported The Texas Cyber Summit’s mission to serve underserved and women communities in cybersecurity as a prize sponsor. The summit presented OSCP courses to some students at the Virtual Students Scholarships Awards to create inclusivity in the cybersecurity community.

OffSec sponsored Hacktoria, a worldwide OSINT and infosec community network that offers free games with challenges in Cyber, Investigation, and OSINT. We supported the network with OSCP courses for winners of CTF events.

OffSec is proud to sponsor global community events aligned with our mission to empower the world to fight cyber security threats with free resources and access to PWK courses.

## Black Hat MEA

OffSec trainers returned to Black Hat MEA in Saudi Arabia as a training partner to provide 100+ attendees with five in-person workshops on world-class cybersecurity and ethical hacking that prepare skilled infosec professionals. Courses included: Windows Exploitation (EXP-401), Web Attacks & Exploitation (WEB-300), Web Attacks with Kali Linux at the foundational level (WEB-200), Pentesting (PEN-200), and Security Operations & Defensive Analysis (SOC-200).

This was a learning zone that allowed participants to adopt techniques as they applied the theory in simulated virtual labs. The symposium to put in real effort, be willing to work, and learn creative solutions in their specialty areas will significantly help attendees succeed in their course. Thanks to our expert trainers for taking the time to travel to Riyadh and instruct cybersecurity courses to professionals.

## Online Community Events

OffSec’s community moderators routinely host contests with free giveaways on the Discord server. A special thanks to Tristam, OffSec’s community moderator, for creating another story-writing round for the users to help inspire each other with their journey in cybersecurity. We couldn’t be happier with the community’s flood of engaging content pieces for a chance to win some cool prizes. The panel selected stories with the most emoji responses, and the top contributors won a PG Play Practice for a one-month-long practice subscription giving access to virtual hacking labs. Other prizes included OffSec’s swag items and merchandise.

## Podcasts

OffSec provides monthly podcast interviews for the community to gain a deeper insight into cyber security.

Anyone in cybersecurity, information security, or interested in these fields can join the live sessions every Friday at 12 p.m. ET on the OffSec Official Twitch page.
