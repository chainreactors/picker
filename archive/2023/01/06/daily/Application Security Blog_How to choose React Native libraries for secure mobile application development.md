React Native, created by Meta, is an open source framework used to build cross-platform applications without losing native capabilities. The JavaScript nature of React Native made this hybrid approach of mobile application development very popular. What does this mean in terms of application security, especially for mobile applications, as they come with their own set of security loopholes and attack vectors? Does the development of mobile applications in conjunction with something as transparent as JavaScript pose new challenges or exacerbate existing ones?

When we choose a library, we usually think about its functionality: “Does it do the right job?” and performance, “Will it slow my application down?” But we should also think about security; “Will it make my application vulnerable?”

## Application security and React Native

Typically, applications are built with principles of security in mind, including

* Least privilege
* Defense-in-depth
* Open design or security by obscurity
* Minimizing attack surface
* Client trust

The implementation of these principles in a mobile application varies slightly due to the threat model being different from those of web applications, but it varies more for applications built with React Native. Let’s examine React Native’s impact on the overall security of the application for each of these principles.

## Least privilege

This principle specifies that an application should only have permissions that are essential. A typical mobile application is comprised of several components, such as services and receivers in the case of the Android environment. These components need to interact with various device processes for the application to function. For example, a music streaming appl...
