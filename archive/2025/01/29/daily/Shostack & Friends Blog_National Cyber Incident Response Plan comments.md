# National Cyber Incident Response Plan comments

Our comments on the National Cyber Incident Plan
![An ai image of a shocked woman's face](/images/blog/img/2025/comments-on-national-cyber-plan-1000w.png)

Josiah Dykstra and I have some [comments](https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CISA-2024-0037-0040) on the National Cyber Incident Response Plan updates.

Building on our [recent paper about pandemic-scale cyber events](https://doi.org/10.1145/3703465.3703466), we submitted 14 recommendations to further improve the plan. We share the desire for proactive plans that adequately prepare the Nation for cyber incidents. There’s many opportunities, including better foundational data that could jump start the collection of vital statistics about government and critical infrastructures through better lesson learning activity.

Don't blame me, Josiah picked the image and I needed an 800x300 excerpt.
