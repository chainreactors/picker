Picture this: your SSL certificate is like a carton of milk in your fridge. Sure, it’s good for a while, but let it sit too long, and you’re inviting a sour situation. At Sucuri, we’ve decided our certificates deserve a fresher approach—90 days fresh, to be exact. That’s right, **we’re now renewing our SSL certificates every three months**, and we’re here to tell you why this is the cybersecurity equivalent of a daily kale smoothie: good for you, great for security, and honestly, pretty trendy.

Let’s unpack why we’ve embraced the 90-day SSL lifecycle, how we’re making it painless for you, and where the industry’s headed—spoiler alert: it involves quantum elephants.

## What’s Changed? Certificates Are Now 90-Day Sprinters

Gone are the days when SSL certificates lounged around for a year like they were on an all-inclusive vacation. As of recently, Sucuri’s [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) renews SSL certificates every 90 days. Why? Because shorter certificate lifespans mean a tighter leash on potential security risks. A compromised certificate with a 3 year-long validity is like giving a hacker a 36-month Netflix subscription to your server. Ninety days? That’s barely enough time for them to pick a show.

This shift aligns with the industry’s push for agility and security, and we’re proud to be ahead of the curve, hand-in-hand with big players like Google and Let’s Encrypt. But before we pat ourselves on the back, let’s dive into the “why” behind this change.

## Why the Short Leash? Google, CA/B Forum, and the Security Glow-Up

The move to shorter certificate lifespans didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. It’s been brewing in the halls of the CA/Browser Forum (CA/B Forum), the nerdy roundtable where browser makers, certificate authorities (CAs), and security folks like us hash out the rules for SSL/TLS certificates. Back in 2019, Google floated the idea of 90-day certificates as part of its “Moving Forward, Together” roadmap, arguing that shorter lifespans shrink the window for attackers to exploit stolen keys and push organizations toward automation nirvana. The proposal didn’t pass then—Certificate Authorities grumbled about infrastructure readiness—but it lit a fire under the industry.

Fast-forward to 2023, Google doubled down, proposing 90-day certificates again to “encourage automation and the adoption of practices that will drive the ecosystem away from baroque, time-consuming, and error-prone issuance processes”. While that specific ballot didn’t make it to the CA/B Forum’s Baseline Requirements, it set the stage for Apple’s 2024 bombshell: a proposal to slash certificate lifespans to 45 days by 2027, which was negotiated to 47 days by 2029 via Ballot SC-074. The CA/B Forum’s phased plan now looks like this:

* **March 15, 2026:** Certificates max out at 200 days.
* **March 15, 2027:** Down to 100 days.
* **March 15, 2029:** A zippy 47 days.

Why all this fuss? Shorter lifespans mean:

* **Less time for mischief:** A stolen certificate expires faster, limiting damage.
* **Fresher crypto:** New certificates can adopt the latest algorithms, keeping your site ahead of threats.
* **Automation or bust:** Manual renewals every 90 (or 47) days are a nightmare, so automation becomes non-negotiable, reducing human error.

[Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), the free certificate fairy godmother, has been waving the automation flag for years, championing the ACME protocol (Automated Certificate Management Environment) to make renewals as smooth as a sunny day. Their mantra? “Automation is the only way to scale security without losing your mind”.  Sucuri’s 90-day renewals are a nod to this philosophy, and we’re not just following the cool kids—we’re setting the pace.

## How Sucuri’s Got Your Back (and Your Certificate)

Now, you might be thinking, “Marc, 90-day renewals sound like a part-time job I didn’t sign up for.” Fear not! Sucuri’s got this wired so you can keep sipping that coffee without breaking a sweat. Here’s how we’re making 90-day renewals a breeze:
