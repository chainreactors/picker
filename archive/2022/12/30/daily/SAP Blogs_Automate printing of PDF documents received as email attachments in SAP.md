**Summary :** In my [previous blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/29/save-incoming-e-mail-attachments-in-sap-and-auto-print-on-printer/) I have covered, how to process/save pdf documents (can have multiple) which are received in e-mail into SAP. In this blog, we will see how we can enable auto print functionality for PDF documents on dedicated physical printer or on local printer (LP01) in spool.

Additional Business requirement : All the PDF documents (if there are multiple attachments in e-mail) should get generated as one PDF in spool and in case of two-sided printing, one documents shouldn't get printed on back side of another one.

As per previous article, we have already implemented the two methods of Interface IF\_INBOUND\_EXIT\_BCS in inbound Exit(Z-class : ZCL\_BILLING\_EMAIL\_IN).

**Method : IF\_INBOUND\_EXIT\_BCS~CREATE\_INSTANCE** (Same as previous article)

```
*Create instance of the object with the class itself

    DATA(lo_ref_instance) = NEW zcl_billing_email_in( ).

    IF lo_ref_instance IS BOUND.

      ro_ref = lo_ref_instance.

    ENDIF.
```

**Method : IF\_INBOUND\_EXIT\_BCS~PROCESS\_INBOUND**

We need to write code in 2nd method of the interface to implement the printing functionality as per below code snippet with following steps.

1. Get the PDF documents (hex format) from the e-mail object

2. Convert hex format into XSTRING format

3. Get total no. of pages in each PDF document and identify if total no of pages are odd : Method - GET\_TOTAL\_PAGES.

4. Add additional blank page in PDF document if total no of pages are odd to avoid any issue in case of two sided printing. (Additional requirement) : Method - GET\_BLANK\_PDF\_PAGE

5. Merge all the XSTRING data

6. Print PDF document on printer : Method - PRINT\_PDF\_DOC

```
    CONSTANTS: lc_pdf TYPE char3 VALUE 'PDF'.        "Document Type PDF

    DATA: lv_printer      TYPE rspopshort,                "Spool: short name for output device

          lv_blank_page   TYPE xstring,

          lv_total_pages  TYPE i.

    CLEAR: e_retcode, es_t100msg.

lv_printer = 'LP01'. "Or any physical printer in SAP but with short name

*Extract Attachment from e-mail

    TRY .

        IF io_sreq IS BOUND.

* Get document

          DATA(lo_ref_document) = io_sreq->get_document( ).

          IF lo_ref_document IS BOUND.

* Find all the PDF attachments and process it.

              TRY.

* Create PDF Merge Object to be printed in spool as one document

                    TRY.

                        DATA(lo_ref_pdf_merger) = NEW cl_rspo_pdf_merge( ).

                      CATCH cx_rspo_pdf_merge INTO DATA(lv_merge_ex).

                    ENDTRY.

                    DO lo_ref_document->get_body_part_count( ) TIMES.

                      TRY.

                          DATA(lv_doc_type) = lo_ref_document->get_body_part_attributes( im_part = sy-index )-doc_type.

                          TRANSLATE lv_doc_type TO UPPER CASE.

* If Document type is PDF then only proceed as program needs to look into PDF attachments only

                          IF lv_doc_type = lc_pdf.

* Get the file name of attached document

                            DATA(lv_filename) = lo_ref_document->get_body_part_attributes( im_part = sy-index  )-filename.

* Get the content of attached file in hex format.

                            DATA(ls_body_part_content) = lo_ref_document->get_body_part_content( sy-index ).

                            IF lv_filename IS NOT INITIAL AND ls_body_part_content IS NOT INITIAL.

                                IF lo_ref_pdf_merger IS BOUND.

                                  lo_ref_pdf_merger->add_document( lv_xstring ).

                                ENDIF.

                                IF lv_odd_flag EQ abap_true.

* If there is odd number of pages, then add one blank PDF page at the end to avoid back to back printing

                                  IF lv_blank_page IS INITIAL.
