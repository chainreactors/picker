In today’s healthcare landscape, rising costs are all but guaranteed. From increased labor, supply and drug prices to the shift to value-based care models and growing technology investments, delivering healthcare has become increasingly expensive for both patients and providers.

Many organizations move to the cloud as a way to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively, though hybrid and multicloud environments can add complexity to these transformations. Still, improving data access and leveraging AI are essential steps toward better patient outcomes. A platformized approach to cybersecurity can help organizations navigate these challenges while strengthening resilience, boosting efficiency and managing costs.

## The Hidden Costs of Not Doing Cloud Computing “The Right Way”

When apps aren’t optimized for the cloud, organizations can face rising storage costs, lower service levels, and impacts on resilience that stretch their limited budgets. In fact, McKinsey & Company estimates [that cloud migration cost can overrun $100 billion in wasted spend](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cloud-migration-opportunity-business-value-grows-but-missteps-abound)ing in just three years. Additionally, a [research report from Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/sg-en/insights/cloud/cloud-outcomes-perspective) found that only 39% of companies surveyed were fully achieving their expectations when it came to cost savings from the cloud.

At the same time, as healthcare organizations move apps and data to the cloud, they also increase tech sprawl, which can limit visibility and increase their attack surface, making it difficult to identify vulnerabilities. In fact, [the same research report from Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/sg-en/insights/cloud/cloud-outcomes-perspective) found that security and compliance risks were among the top barriers holding companies back from unlocking the full value of the cloud. This is especially alarming as cyberattacks on the healthcare industry grow more frequent. If successful, cybersecurity breaches can have devastating financial repercussions, with healthcare enterprises averaging $10.93 million per incident – the highest of all industries, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissamcfarlane/2024/06/28/healthcare-breaches-are-more-costly-than-financial-breaches-heres-why/). Not only that, but a cyberattack can hurt a healthcare organization’s reputation and even lead to patient care disruptions that put health and lives at risk.

Additionally, legacy apps limit interoperability, slowing down IT teams, pulling their focus and resources away from innovation and ultimately preventing healthcare organizations from providing affordable, accessible and high-quality care.

## Reducing Costs and Protecting Patients Starts with Platformization

So, how can you successfully migrate to the cloud without the unnecessary storage costs and cyber risks? [Cybersecurity platformization.](/blog/2024/04/cybersecurity-platformization/)

Platformization consolidates everything into one place, giving you a holistic view of your organization’s ecosystem and helping you better identify vulnerabilities, combat cybersecurity threats, and keep up with evolving regulations in a more streamlined and efficient way. By reducing costs and boosting efficiency, a consolidated, connected approach to cybersecurity can help you promote affordable and accessible care, even in challenging economic times.

## Curious About Cybersecurity Platformization? 3 Things to Consider.

#### Choose Cutting-Edge Technology and Collaborative Partnership

You don’t just need the right technology – you need the right support. Work with partners that offer end-to-end managed services to help you securely integrate systems, devices and data to ensure solutions work as promised long after launch.

#### Select a Platform That Offers Flexibility

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare cybersecurity. That’s why you need a platform that can flex to your unique needs, and partners that closely collaborate with you to assess your requirements and goals.

#### Work With Partners That Have Industry Experience

Not all cloud providers or cybersecurity experts have healthcare industry experience or understand the unique regulatory requirements of payors and providers. You need trusted advisors that have proven healthcare expertise – like Palo Alto Networks, which currently supports 9 of 10 top U.S. hospitals and 5 of 5 largest U.S. payors.
