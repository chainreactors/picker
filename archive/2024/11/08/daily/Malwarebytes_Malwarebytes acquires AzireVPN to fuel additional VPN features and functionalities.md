# Malwarebytes acquires AzireVPN to fuel additional VPN features and functionalities

Posted: November 7, 2024
 by [Mark Beare](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mbearemalwarebytes-com)

Today I have great news to share: We’ve acquired AzireVPN, a privacy-focused [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) provider based in Sweden.

I wanted to share with you our intentions behind this exciting step, and what this means for our existing users and the family of solutions they rely on to keep them private and secure.

Malwarebytes has long been an advocate for user privacy (think [Malwarebytes Privacy VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn) and our free web extension [Malwarebytes Browser Guard)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard). Now, we’re leaning even more on our mission to reimagine consumer cybersecurity to protect devices and data, no matter where users are located, how they work and play, or the size of their wallet.

With AzireVPN’s infrastructure and intellectual property, Malwarebytes is poised to develop more advanced VPN technologies and features, offering increased flexibility and enhanced security for our users.

**Why AzireVPN?**

AzireVPN is renowned for its robust security standards and privacy-first commitment. Here are two examples of what the company does to support that:

* AzireVPN physically owns and controls all of its dedicated and diskless servers—a practice Malwarebytes is committed to continuing.

* The company developed Blind Operator, a unique privacy feature implemented to completely disable both remote and local access to its servers. This creates a barrier against unauthorized modifications and traffic interception, making it virtually impossible for anyone to modify or tap the traffic on its servers and share any information about a user.

**What does this mean for existing Malwarebytes Privacy VPN customers?**

There are no changes for Malwarebytes Privacy VPN customers at this time. They will continue to enjoy our streamlined, integrated user experience, and our no-log service will never track, store, or share any user network data.

**What does this mean for existing AzireVPN customers?**

AzireVPN customers will also continue to enjoy the same privacy-focused VPN service – no logs, no data collection, no [bandwidth](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bandwidth) limitations. There will continue to be no requirement to share any information to sign up for the service.

**An exciting future is ahead of us**

We’ll share more details on our future VPN offering in the coming months.

I’m so excited about our future. This is yet another milestone for Malwarebytes, underscoring our commitment to privacy and a free and open internet.

Thanks for putting your trust in us to protect you.
