DevOps teams dedicated to securing their supply chain and predicting potential risks consistently face novel threats. Fortunately, they can now improve their image and container security by harnessing Google-grade vulnerability scanning, which offers expanded open-source coverage. A significant benefit of utilizing Google Cloud Platform is its integrated security tools, including Artifact Analysis. This scanning service leverages the same infrastructure that Google depends on to monitor vulnerabilities within its internal systems and software supply chains.

Artifact Analysis has recently expanded its scanning coverage to eight additional language packages, four operating systems, and two extensively utilized base images, making it a more robust and versatile tool than ever before.

This enhanced coverage was achieved by integrating Artifact Analysis with the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) platform and database. This integration provides industry-leading insights into open source vulnerabilities—a crucial capability as software supply chain attacks continue to grow in frequency and complexity, impacting organizations reliant on open source software.

With these recent updates, customers can now successfully scan the vast majority of the images they push to Artifact Registry. These successful scans ensure that any known vulnerabilities are detected, reported, and can be integrated into a broader vulnerability management program, allowing teams to take prompt action.

# Open source vulnerabilities, with more reach

Artifact Analysis pulls vulnerability information directly from OSV, which is the only open source, distributed vulnerability database that gets information directly from open source practitioners. OSV’s database provides a consistent, high quality, high fidelity database of vulnerabilities from authoritative sources who have adopted the [OSV schema](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/). This ensures the database has accurate information to reliably match software dependencies to known vulnerabilities—previously a difficult process reliant on inaccurate mechanisms such as CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations).

Over the past three years, OSV has increased its total coverage to 28 language and OS ecosystems. For example, industry leaders such as GitHub, Chainguard, and Ubuntu, as well as open source ecosystems such as Rust and Python are now exporting their vulnerability discoveries in the OSV Schema. This increased coverage also includes [Chainguard’s](https://www.chainguard.dev/chainguard-images) Wolfi images and [Google’s Distroless images](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/README.md), which are popular choices for minimal container images used by many developers and organizations. Customers who rely on distroless images can count on Artifact Analysis scanning to support their minimal container image initiatives.  Each expansion in OSV’s coverage is incorporated into scanning tools that integrate with the OSV database.

# Broader vulnerability detection with Artifact Analysis

As a result of OSV’s expansion, scanners like Artifact Analysis that draw from OSV now alert users to higher quality vulnerability information across a broader set of ecosystems—meaning GCP project owners will be made aware of a [more complete set](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-analysis/docs/container-scanning-overview#feature-support) of vulnerability findings and potential security risks.

Existing [Artifact Registry scanning](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/analysis#automatic_scanning) customers don't need to take any action to take advantage of this update. Projects that have scanning enabled will immediately benefit from this expanded coverage and vulnerability findings will continue to be available in the Artifact Registry UI, Container Analysis API, and via [pub/sub](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-analysis/docs/pub-sub-notifications?hl=en) (for workflows).

Existing [On Demand scanning](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/analysis#on-demand_scanning) customers will also benefit from this expanded vulnerability coverage. All the same Operating Systems and Language package coverage that Registry Scanning customers enjoy are available in On Demand Scan.

# Beyond Artifact Registry

We know that detection is just one of the first steps necessary to manage risks. We’re continually expanding Artifact Analysis capabilities and in 2025 we’ll be integrating Artifact Registry vulnerability findings with Google Cloud’s [Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-command-center?hl=en). Through Security Command Center customers can maintain a more comprehensive vulnerability management program, and prioritize risk across a number of different dimensions.
