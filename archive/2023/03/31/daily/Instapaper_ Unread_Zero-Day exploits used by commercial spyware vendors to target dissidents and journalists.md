# Zero-Day exploits used by commercial spyware vendors to target dissidents and journalists

Mar 29, 2023

Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has released [a report](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/spyware-vendors-use-0-days-and-n-days-against-popular-platforms/) stating that commercial spyware vendors have been exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities that were addressed last year in order to target **Android** and **iOS** devices. These campaigns were highly targeted and limited, taking advantage of the patch gap between the release of a fix and when it was deployed on the targeted devices.

According to the report, these vendors enable the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools and arm governments that do not have the ability to develop such capabilities in-house. Although the use of surveillance technologies may be legal under national or international laws, they are often used by governments to target dissidents, journalists, human rights workers, and opposition party politicians.

The first campaign took place in November 2022 and targeted users in Italy, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan. Users were sent shortened links over SMS messages which, upon clicking, redirected them to web pages that hosted exploits for Android or iOS. The iOS exploit chain leveraged multiple bugs ([CVE-2022-42856](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42856), [CVE-2021-30900](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30900)), including a zero-day, to install an .IPA file onto the device. The Android exploit chain comprised three exploits ([CVE-2022-3723](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3723), [CVE-2022-4135](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4135) and [CVE-2022-38181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38181)) to deliver an unspecified payload.

The second campaign was observed in December 2022 and targeted the latest version of Samsung Internet Browser, with the exploits ([CVE-2022-4262](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4262), [CVE-2022-3038](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3038), [CVE-2022-22706](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22706), [CVE-2023-0266](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0266) and [CVE-2023-26083](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-26083)) delivered as one-time links via SMS to devices located in the **United Arab Emirates** (UAE). The web page implanted a malicious toolkit capable of harvesting data from chat and browser applications.

The report highlights that the commercial spyware industry continues to thrive and even smaller surveillance vendors have access to zero-days, posing a severe risk to the internet. It also raises concerns that exploits and techniques are being shared between surveillance vendors, enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools. The scale of the two campaigns and the nature of the targets are currently unknown.
