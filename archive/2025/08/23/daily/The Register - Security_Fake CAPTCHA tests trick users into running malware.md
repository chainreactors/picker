Microsoft's security team has published an in-depth report into ClickFix, the social engineering attack which tricks users into executing malicious commands in the guise of proving their humanity.

ClickFix pretends to be a standard CAPTCHA challenge. But, instead of clicking squares with motorbikes in them, sliding a puzzle-piece into place, or rotating increasingly-bizarre objects to particular orientations, it demands that users do something . . . else.

The fake CAPTCHA tells them to hit the Windows/Super key and R, then Control and V followed by Enter – a combination which, any reader who's used a computer for more than a week or so will likely recognize, opens up the Windows Run prompt, pastes whatever the attacker placed in the clipboard, and executes it. Imagine users smiling to themselves as they do this, thinking of how helpful they are being while crooks are helping themselves to unauthorized access.
