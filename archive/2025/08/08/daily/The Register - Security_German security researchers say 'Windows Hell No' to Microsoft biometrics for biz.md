## Hello loophole could let a rogue admin, or a pwned one, inject new facial scans

Black Hat Microsoft is [pushing hard](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/05/microsoft-apple-google-fido/) for Windows users to shift from using passwords to its Hello biometrics system, but researchers sponsored by the German government have found a critical flaw in its business implementation.

In a presentation at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, Dr Baptiste David and Tillmann Osswald from independent security shop ERNW Enno Rey Netzwerke demonstrated how one can crack the Hello system and a local admin, or someone who has access to their credentials via malware or other means, can inject biometric information into a computer that would allow it to recognize any face or fingerprint.

Hello supports authentication for business users, so that corporate PCs can link into platforms like Entra ID or Active Directory to clear access to servers. It does this by storing a cryptographic key in a database that links with Microsoft's Windows Biometric Service.
