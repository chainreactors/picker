Thanks to an incredibly talented co-author and extremely efficient editing team, we have released the 11th Edition of OSINT Techniques.

Full Details: <https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html>

47 Chapters | 590 Pages | Digital available now (Paperback Soon).

The previous edition of this book was originally written in late 2022. In mid 2024, I was asked to update this book, as it is required reading for numerous college courses, university degrees, and government training academies. I never want stale or inaccurate information being presented within training programs, so I created this special revision. I estimate that 20% of the content is brand new, 20% has been updated to reflect changes throughout 2024, and the remaining 60% is recycled from the from the previous edition. Much of the tenth edition content was still applicable and only needed minor updates to reflect changes since 2022. If you have read the previous edition, you will find most of those overall strategies within this book. However, I have added many new OSINT methods which complement the original text in order to cater to those who always need accurate information. I also removed a lot of outdated content which was no longer applicable. I believe there is much new value within this updated text. This edition presents several new chapters unavailable within previous versions and incorporates the previously-available digital supplement guides about virtual machines and data breaches, leaks, and logs.

All purchases include free download of updated custom search tools; updated Linux scripts to build your own virtual machines; detailed cheat-sheets to simplify each process; and a single Linux command to build a complete OSINT VM with every tool in the entire book. The outline is below.
