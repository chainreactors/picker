### A BPM Match Made in Heaven

SAP’s acquisition of Berlin-based BPM company Signavio unleashed manifold synergies, not just from a corporate perspective: Since January 2021, a community of well **over 10.000 SAP Signavio academic cloud users** can benefit from SAP’s vast academic ecosystem in over 100 countries worldwide. With SAP University Alliances (UA) support, the exchange between SAP UA professors and the Business Process Management (BPM) academic community has already led to great exchange and collaboration.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/ACC_DACH-1.png)

“Receiving hands-on enablement for the free use of SAP Signavio in academia has been great for the global SAP UA community.” - Prof. Dr. Karin Gräslund, [DSAG Board Member](https://dsag.de/ueber-uns/vorstand/) for Financials & Sustainability, at the SAP Academic Community Conference DACH 2022 (photo credit: A. Lander).

The cloud native [SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite Academic Edition](https://www.signavio.com/academic-and-research-alliances/) is completely free of charge for students, lecturers, and professors. With academic content support from SAP Signavio, the collaborative BPM tool has already grown highly popular at SAP partner universities: Academic faculty received on-site and virtual SAP Signavio trainings at five major UA Academic Community Conferences, in local enablement sessions, and at various scientific conferences in 2022.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Signavio_BPM.png)

Emphasising the commitment to the academic community, SAP Signavio released a data set of over 600,000 academic process models created by ~70,000 users for scientific research.

### Process Education in the US

SAP North America academic board member Nancy Jones from San Diego State University has had no difficulty in finding her way through SAP Signavio’s various modeling and process mining functionalities: Her process modeling training in January 2023 is expected to attract over 100 fellow lecturers all across North America. With an industry background in Accounting & Information Systems, her main interest remains the delivery of exciting, participative content in her courses:

“You can tell that students love process modeling with SAP Signavio. It’s not only beneficial from a process education and efficiency perspective, but also requires creativity and a certain sense for aesthetics. I was impressed with the clean and well-organized process models created by first-time users of SAP Signavio, sometimes even highlighted with different colors, and illustrated using symbols and pictures. You can just tell that the students are having fun with the tool!”

### EOG: A German BPM Highlight

Hans Jürgen Scheruhn from Harz University of Applied Sciences has been one of Germany’s fastest academic adopters of SAP Signavio: In record time, him and his students managed to recreate his Enterprise Online Guide (EOG) in the SAP Signavio Process Manager. The holistic business process framework works like a Google Maps for enterprises and combines SAP S/4HANA educational elements with process management.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/EOG.png)

“It has been an incredibly exciting journey for us at Harz University. SAP Signavio offers many advantages over other BPM tools, and with our amazing collaboration, I’m sure that we will continue to enable students and professors with sustainable and intelligent process transformation content and tooling worldwide!”, says Professor Scheruhn, member of the SAP Academic Board DACH and creator of EOG.

### Continued Global Outreach

2022 saw an uptick in global academic projects with SAP Signavio, particularly in Europe, the US, and Australia. With continued support from SAP Signavio and SAP University Alliances, the business process management collaboration between industry and academia will continue to flourish in the years to come. With various curriculum and enablement projects in process management, modeling, and process mining in the pipeline, 2023 will surely turn into another great win for BPM academic education.
