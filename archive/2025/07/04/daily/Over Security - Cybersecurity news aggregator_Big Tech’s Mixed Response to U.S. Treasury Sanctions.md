# Big Tech’s Mixed Response to U.S. Treasury Sanctions

July 3, 2025

[7 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/big-techs-mixed-response-to-u-s-treasury-sanctions/#comments)

In May 2025, the U.S. government sanctioned a Chinese national for operating a cloud provider linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. But a new report finds the accused continues to operate a slew of established accounts at American tech companies — including **Facebook**, **Github**, **PayPal** and **Twitter/X**.

On May 29, the **U.S. Department of the Treasury** [announced economic sanctions](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/u-s-sanctions-cloud-provider-funnull-as-top-source-of-pig-butchering-scams/) against **Funnull Technology Inc.**, a Philippines-based company alleged to provide infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams known as “[pig butchering](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/massive-losses-define-epidemic-of-pig-butchering/).” In January 2025, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Funnull was designed as a content delivery network that catered to [foreign cybercriminals seeking to route their traffic through U.S.-based cloud providers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/infrastructure-laundering-blending-in-with-the-cloud/).

The Treasury also sanctioned Funnull’s alleged operator, a 40-year-old Chinese national named **Liu “Steve” Lizhi**. The government says Funnull directly facilitated financial schemes resulting in more than $200 million in financial losses by Americans, and that the company’s operations were linked to the majority of pig butchering scams reported to the FBI.

It is generally illegal for U.S. companies or individuals to transact with people sanctioned by the Treasury. However, as Mr. Lizhi’s case makes clear, just because someone is sanctioned doesn’t necessarily mean big tech companies are going to suspend their online accounts.

The government says Lizhi was born November 13, 1984, and used the nicknames “**XXL4**” and “**Nice Lizhi**.” Nevertheless, Steve Liu’s 17-year-old account on LinkedIn (in the name “Liulizhi”) had hundreds of followers (Lizhi’s LinkedIn profile helpfully confirms his birthday) until quite recently: The account was deleted this morning, just hours after KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from LinkedIn.

Mr. Lizhi’s LinkedIn account was suspended sometime in the last 24 hours, after KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from LinkedIn.

In an emailed response, a LinkedIn spokesperson said the company’s “[Prohibited countries policy](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339324/prohibited-countries-policy?lang=en)” states that LinkedIn “does not sell, license, support or otherwise make available its Premium accounts or other **paid** products and services to individuals and companies sanctioned by the U.S. government.” LinkedIn declined to say whether the profile in question was a premium or free account.

Mr. Lizhi also maintains [a working PayPal account](https://paypal.com/paypalme/nicelizhi) under the name Liu Lizhi and username “**@nicelizhi**,” another nickname listed in the Treasury sanctions. A 15-year-old [Twitter/X account named “Lizhi”](https://x.com/phpedu/with_replies) that links to Mr. Lizhi’s personal domain remains active, although it has few followers and hasn’t posted in years.

These accounts and many others were flagged by the security firm **Silent Push**, which has been tracking Funnull’s operations for the past year and calling out U.S. cloud providers like **Amazon** and **Microsoft** for failing to more quickly sever ties with the company.

Liu Lizhi’s PayPal account.

In [a report](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/funnull-admin-sanctions/) released today, Silent Push found Lizhi still operates numerous Facebook accounts and groups, including a private Facebook account under the name Liu Lizhi. Another Facebook account clearly connected to Lizhi is a tourism page for Ganzhou, China called “**EnjoyGanzhou**” that was named in the Treasury Department sanctions.

“This guy is the technical administrator for the infrastructure that is hosting a majority of scams targeting people in the United States, and hundreds of millions have been lost based on the websites he’s been hosting,” said **Zach Edwards**, senior threat researcher at Silent Push. “It’s crazy that the vast majority of big tech companies haven’t done anything to cut ties with this guy.”

The FBI says it received nearly 150,000 complaints last year involving digital assets and $9.3 billion in losses — a 66 percent increase from the previous year. Investment scams were the top crypto-related crimes reported, with $5.8 billion in losses.

In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company continuously takes steps to meet its legal obligations, but that sanctions laws are complex and varied. They explained that sanctions are often targeted in nature and don’t always prohibit people from having a presence on its platform. Nevertheless, Meta confirmed it had removed the account, unpublished Pages, and removed Groups and events associated with the user for violating its policies.

Attempts to reach Mr. Lizhi via his primary email addresses at **Hotmail** and **Gmail** bounced as undeliverable. Likewise, his 14-year-old **YouTube** channel appears to have been taken down recently.

However, anyone interested in viewing or using Mr. Lizhi’s 146 computer code repositories will have no problem finding GitHub accounts for him, including one registered under the NiceLizhi and XXL4 nicknames mentioned in the Treasury sanctions.

One of multiple GitHub profiles used by Liu “Steve” Lizhi, who uses the nickname XXL4 (a moniker listed in the Treasury sanctions for Mr. Lizhi).

Mr. Lizhi also operates a GitHub page for an open source e-commerce platform called **NexaMerchant**, which advertises itself as a payment gateway working with numerous American financial institutions. Interestingly, this profile’s [“followers” page](https://www.github.com/orgs/NexaMerchant/follower) shows several other accounts that appear to be Mr. Lizhi’s. All of the account’s followers are tagged as “suspended,” even though that suspended message does not display when one visits those individual profiles.

In response to questions, GitHub said it has a process in place to identify when users and customers are Specially Designated Nationals or other denied or blocked parties, but that it locks those accounts instead of removing them. According to its policy, GitHub takes care that users and customers aren’t impacted beyond what is required by law.

All of the follower accounts for the XXL4 GitHub account appear to be Mr. Lizhi’s, and have been suspended by GitHub, but their code is still accessible.

“This includes keeping public repositories, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to s...
