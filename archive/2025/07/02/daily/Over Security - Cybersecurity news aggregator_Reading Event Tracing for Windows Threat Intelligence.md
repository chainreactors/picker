# Reading Event Tracing for Windows Threat Intelligence

Malware thought it could sneak past your EDR. Spoiler: It didn’t. Here’s how to make it regret its life choices.

---

## Intro

Now we can get into some more really cool stuff by utilising the Event Tracing for Windows: Threat Intelligence (ETW:TI) provider. I have actually talked about bypassing
ETW in my blog post [EDR Evasion ETW patching in Rust](https://fluxsec.red/etw-patching-rust).

That post deals with patching out certain telemetry signals from a usermode process, blinding the EDR to those signals. However; as stated there, we cannot patch out the
Threat Intelligence provider as this is emitted from within the kernel itself. To do so, you’d require...
