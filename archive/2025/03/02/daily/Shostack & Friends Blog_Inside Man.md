Some thoughts on the Voyager Episode ‘Inside Man’
![Two Reg Barclays](/images/blog/img/2025/Barclay_and_holographic_barclay_inside_man-700w.webp)

I’ve been doing a watch through of Voyager, and while generally,
it’s just nice to see smart competent people trying to do their
jobs, I did want to rant about the Season 7 Episode [Inside Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Man_%28Star_Trek%3A_Voyager%29). In it, Voyager gets
a hologram of Reg Barclay which has been modified by
Ferengi.

So, for this to work, the Ferengi have to be able to read and
modify messages flowing back and forth. Also, Voyager’s
diagnostics don’t find a rootkit or malicious added modules. That
seems entirely reasonable. I’m sure the Ferengi have a copy of the
diagnostic toolset and used it to test their holo Reg.

Anyway: I don’t know how to say this politely: WTAF? In the 24th
century, Starfleet is sending messages that not only have no
encryption, but not even some authentication? How can they send a
hologram full of advanced technology research in plaintext? Beyond
that, how do the Ferengi even manage to send messages through the
deep space network? Shouldn’t those messages be checked for
authentication before they’re relayed across the galaxy?

Do they even threat model?!

This is spoofing (or maybe expansion of authority), tampering and
information disclosure all at once! This is not smart competent
people designing communication or holographic technology!

Starfleet, call me. I can help!
