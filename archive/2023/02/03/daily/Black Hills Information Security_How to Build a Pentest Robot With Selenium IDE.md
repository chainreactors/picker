Have you ever been on a pentest and thought to yourself, “I wish I had a robot to do this testing for me right now cuz this is just too much work”?

I know I have. That’s how I came to use the QA tool, [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/), to automate things like:

* Brute forcing complicated authentication protocols. See Amazon Cognito’s implementation of [Secure Remote Password](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html), for example.
* Password spraying services where tooling is not available and there’s not enough time and/or willpower to figure out how to configure a Burp Suite Intruder attack with complicated CSRF mitigations.
* Harvesting email addresses from organizations’ websites when they are dynamically rendered (i.e. nothing to grep from the HTML source).
* Working around Google reCAPTCHA. Selenium IDE automation can help with the transparent sort of reCAPTCHA where a JavaScript challenge needs to be solved (not the annoying “Click all the panda bears in this grid” type of challenge).

Before we get started though, I want to point out that the demo to be presented in this blog was atypical insofar as there were some unique challenges presented with this particular app. My goal with this blog is to provide you with a reference for ideas on how to troubleshoot when your Selenium IDE tests aren’t working. It is typically *much* easier to automate your browser with Selenium IDE.

To show you how to build a pentest robot with Selenium IDE, we’ll take a look at how to brute force an example React app that I put together. The example app was built by following this excellent blog: [Build an Authentication System with AWS Amplify, Cognito and React](https://lo-victoria.com/build-an-authentication-system-with-aws-amplify-cognito-and-react). The app uses Amazon Cognito’s SRP for authentication which, as we’ll see, is just about impossible to automate with Burp Suite’s Intruder module.

According to Wikipedia, SRP is “an augmented password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol” where “the password never leaves the client.”[1](#references) That second phrase already sounds like a deal breaker for running a Burp Intruder attack. Usually, when using Burp Intruder for authentication attacks, you need to mark the password position in the HTTP request. If the password never leaves the client though (i.e. password is not sent in HTTP request), how can you mark the password position?

Here’s what the login form looked like for my React app during authentication.

Requests were sent to “cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com” after clicking the “Sign In” button. As can be seen in the following screenshot, the username was pretty easy to spot. The password…not so much. It seems that Wikipedia was right about the password not leaving the client.

Since using Burp Intruder won’t work for brute forcing this login form, I considered writing a Burp extension that implemented SRP. Before going down that rabbit hole, though, I took a peek at what would need to be implemented. The screenshot below was taken from a Stanford University webpage that describes the [SRP Protocol Design](http://srp.stanford.edu/design.html).

Prime, modulo, salt, exponentiation, you say?

It would probably be easier to build a robot that would do this brute force testing for me. Ok, so maybe the robot idea isn’t actually feasible either. But what if there was a tool that was easy to install and easy to configure (most of the time) that would automatically fi...
