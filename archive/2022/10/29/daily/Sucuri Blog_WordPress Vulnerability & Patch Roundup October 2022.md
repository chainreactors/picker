![WordPress Vulnerability & Patch Roundup October 2022](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_October-Vulnerability-Round-Up-820x385.jpg)

Vulnerability reports and responsible disclosures are essential for website security awareness and education. Automated attacks targeting known software vulnerabilities are one of the leading causes of website compromises.

To help educate website owners on emerging threats to their environments, we’ve compiled a list of important security updates and vulnerability patches for the WordPress ecosystem this past month.

You can mitigate risk by ensuring all of your website software and extensible components are patched with the latest updates and security releases.

## WordPress Core – Security Release

```
Affected Software: WordPress <= 6.0.2
Patched Versions: WordPress 6.0.3

A new security update has been released for WordPress. In this latest update, the WordPress security team [fixed a number of security issues](https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-0-3-security-release/) and vulnerabilities including a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) via wp-mail.php (post by email).

![Update WordPress to 6.0.3 or greater](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image8.png)

**To Update WordPress:**

1. Navigate to your WordPress Dashboard.
