Phishing attacks remain a huge challenge for organizations in 2025. In fact, with attackers increasingly leveraging identity-based techniques over software exploits, phishing arguably poses a bigger threat than ever before.

Attackers are turning to identity attacks like phishing because they can achieve all of the same objectives as they would in a traditional endpoint or network attack, simply by logging into a victim's account. And with organizations now using hundreds of internet apps across their workforce, the scope of accounts that can be phished or targeted with stolen credentials has grown exponentially.

With MFA-bypassing phishing kits the new normal, capable of phishing accounts protected by SMS, OTP, and push-based methods, detection controls are being put under constant pressure as prevention controls fall short.

## **Attackers are bypassing detection controls**

The majority of phishing detection and control enforcement is focused on the email and network layer — typically at the Secure Email Gateway (SEG), Secure Web Gateway (SWG)/proxy, or both.

But attackers know this, [and are taking steps to avoid these controls](https://pushsecurity.com/blog/how-aitm-phishing-kits-evade-detection-p2/), by:

* Routinely evading IoC driven blocklists by dynamically rotating and updating commonly signatured elements like IPs, domains, and URLs.
* Preventing analysis of their phishing pages by implementing bot protection like CAPTCHA or Cloudflare Turnstile alongside other detection evasion methods.
* Changing visual and DOM elements on the page so that even when the page is loaded, detection signatures may fail to trigger.

And in fact, by launching multi- and cross-channel attacks, attackers are evading email-based controls entirely. Just see [this recent example](https://pushsecurity.com/blog/investigating-a-recent-malvertising-campaign-targeting-onfido-customers/?utm_campaign=12081956-FY25Q2_Hacker-News-Article&utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored&utm_content=external-article), where attackers impersonating Onfido delivered their phishing attack via malicious Google ads (aka malvertising) — bypassing email altogether.

| Attackers are bypassing email by targeting their victims across IM, social media, using malicious ads, and by sending messages using trusted apps |

It's worth pointing out the limitations of email-based solutions here too. Email has some additional checks around the sender's reputation and things like DMARC/DKIM, but these don't actually identify malicious **pages**. Similarly, some modern email solutions are doing much deeper analysis of the **content** of an email. But… that doesn't really help with identifying the phishing sites themselves (just indicates that one might be linked in the email). This is much more appropriate for BEC-style attacks where the goal is to social engineer the victim, as opposed to linking them to a malicious page. And this still doesn't help with attacks launched over different mediums as we've highlighted above.

## **How browser-based detection and response can level the playing field**

Most phishing attacks involve the delivery of a malicious link to a user. The user clicks the link and loads a malicious page. In the vast majority of cases, the malicious page is a login portal for a specific website, where the goal for the attacker is to steal the victim's account.

These attacks are happening pretty much exclusively in the victim's browser. So rather than building more email or network-based controls looking from the outside-in at phishing pages accessed in the browser, there's a huge opportunity presented by building phishing detection and response capabilities *inside* the browser.

When we look at the history of detection and response, this makes a lot of sense. When endpoint attacks skyrocketed in the late 2000s / early 2010s, they took advantage of the fact that defenders were trying to detect malware with primarily network-based detections, signature-based analysis of files, and...
