### **Introduction**

In your business operations, it is customary to manage manual accruals, deferrals, and provision accounting adjustments by utilizing the automatic reversal feature when posting general journal entries. These transactions take place at the G/L level without involving specific vendors or customers, making it challenging to generate vendor or customer-wise reports for accruals, deferrals, and provision accounting when required.

However, fear not! We are about to explore a solution that enables you to obtain supplier and customer details for such transactions related to accruals, deferrals, and provision accounting.

Thanks to the In-App Extensibility of S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition, you can achieve the necessary such reporting. So, get ready to unlock the power of customization and enhance your financial reporting capabilities like never before!

Please note that the scenario discussed for accruals, deferrals, or provisions involves manual entries where no purchase order exists.

### **Solution Approach**

To implement this feature, we will leverage the power of In-App Extensibility. Our plan is to create Supplier and Customer Fields, enriched with standard F4 Values containing details of all suppliers and customers. This strategic customization will enable us to seamlessly enhance the functionality and cater to the specific reporting needs for accruals, deferrals, and provision accounting entries.
