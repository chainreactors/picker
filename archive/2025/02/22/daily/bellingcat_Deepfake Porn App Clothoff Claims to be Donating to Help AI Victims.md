# Deepfake Porn App Clothoff Claims to be Donating to Help AI Victims

*Warning: This article discusses non-consensual sexually explicit content and Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).*

Clothoff, one of the most notorious apps for non-consensual [deepfake pornographic material](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/02/23/behind-a-secretive-global-network-of-non-consensual-deepfake-pornography/), claims that it is donating funds to “support those affected by AI”, highlighting its collaboration with an organisation named ASU Label that says it aims to “protect your rights in the age of AI”.

But it is unclear who exactly is behind ASU Label and why – given its stated aims – it would choose to work with an organisation like Clothoff that runs a “free undress AI and clothes remover” app.

There is no information detailing the individuals or other organisations involved with ASU Label on its website.

Bellingcat first noticed a reference to this organisation in December 2024, when the following lines were added to some of Clothoff’s sites: “We are working with Asulable and donating funds to support those affected by AI. If you have experienced problems related to AI, please visit asulable.com or contact them at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).”

This paragraph appeared on several of Clothoff’s network of websites, including their main site, Clothoff.io, which went offline in December 2024. They still operate multiple websites with similar domain names in their network.

The website *asulable.com* could not be found. However, *asulabel.com* – the domain of the contact email address mentioned – goes to a site for an organisation that calls itself AisafeUse Label (ASU) or ASU Label. This website for “ASU Label” also features a logo on the top left-hand corner which matches a logo featured on Clothoff’s website, further indicating that this is the organisation Clothoff was referring to.

According to [DomainTools](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit/more/all-tools/domaintools-whois-lookup), a tool that displays the domain registration information of websites, ASU Label’s domain was registered on Oct. 15, 2024. The Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/01/09/using-the-wayback-machine-and-google-analytics-to-uncover-disinformation-networks/), a popular web archive, captured ASU Label’s site for the first time on Nov. 13, and Clothoff’s first mention of ASU Label was archived the following month in December.

ASU Label said their mission was “to assist individuals who have suffered due to the unsafe use of neural networks”.

Nowhere on ASU Label’s website do they state how exactly they help those affected by any type of AI or link to resources for victims. When asked to provide specifics on what they do, ASU Label said they provide “direct support to victims” and “assist individuals” but did not specify what this support or assistance looked like.

ASU Label told Bellingcat that it was registered as a non-profit organisation, but did not say where it was registered. Bellingcat’s searches on [several](https://www.wango.org/) [international](https://www.guidestar.org/search) [databases](https://ngobase.org/) of non-profits and non-governmental organisations for “ASU”, “AisafeUse Label” and “ASU Label” did not return any relevant matches, although such databases may not be equally comprehensive or updated in every country.

When asked for any evidence that they are a registered charity or non-profit, to clarify what country they operate from, or any evidence at all to prove that they are a legitimate organisation, ASU Label said their team had made a “collective decision not to disclose our legal documents” as “in recent times, we have encountered numerous adversaries whose sole intent is to hinder us from fulfilling our mission”.

They did not specify who these adversaries were or how these encounters took place.

ASU Label did not answer questions about the harms of deepfake pornography, which Clothoff’s platform creates. Nor did it address questions about who is behind ASU Label, beyond saying that they were founded by “a group of professionals from the fields of AI, law, and public advocacy”, or reveal any other organisations it works with to achieve its aims.

The organisation said it was not owned or managed by anyone including Clothoff. “We are a team of like-minded individuals focused on charity,” it said.

Clothoff’s website lists a contact email for ASU Label, which is how Bellingcat reached them, but this email address does not appear on ASU Label’s own site and does not come up anywhere else in a Google search. ASU Label’s website does not include any way to contact them except a pop-up contact form for those wanting to become a member of the organisation or for those affected by AI.

Since Bellingcat could not find any link or reference to ASU Label beyond its own website and the mention on Clothoff’s sites, we asked both organisations about their association with each other.

Clothoff did not respond to Bellingcat’s request for any evidence of donations to ASU Label, but said that it collaborates with ASU Label “from time to time”.

“Occasionally, they approach us with requests for direct assistance to individuals or proposals for joint research initiatives. Whenever possible, we support their efforts, as...
