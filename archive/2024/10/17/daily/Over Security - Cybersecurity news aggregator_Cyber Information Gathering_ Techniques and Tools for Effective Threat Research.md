Cyber Information Gathering: Techniques
and Tools for Effective Threat Research

To stay safe from cyber attacks, organizations need effective ways to gather information about threats before they cause irreparable damage. Let’s look at several methods for gathering [threat intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-explained/) (TI) to see how they can help you gain a better view of the current threat landscape.

## Why is Threat Intelligence Important?

Threat intelligence is [important](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/why-is-threat-intelligence-important/) for several reasons:

* **Proactive Awareness:** Knowing about potential threats helps [organizations](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-for-business/) take steps to deal with them before they escalate.

* **Quick Response:** When an attack happens, having threat intelligence allows teams to respond faster and more effectively.

* **Better Risk Management:** Understanding vulnerabilities helps organizations prioritize where to focus their security efforts.

## How to Collect Cyber Threat Intelligence

Gathering threat intelligence isn’t just about knowing where to look; it’s about understanding how to use those sources effectively. Let’s explore key methods for collecting threat intelligence, diving into the techniques and tools that can help cybersecurity professionals.

### Integrating Threat Intelligence Feeds

[Threat intelligence feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/what-are-threat-intelligence-feeds/) provide real-time streams of data on malware, vulnerabilities, and emerging risks. By using these feeds, organizations can stay up-to-date with the latest threats and trends. To [effectively gather](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-use-threat-intelligence-feeds/) intelligence:

* **Automate Data Collection:** Integrate feeds with your cybersecurity tools (like SIEM) for continuous monitoring.
* **Correlate Information:** Use multiple feeds to cross-reference threats and identify patterns.
* **Customize for Relevance:** Focus on feeds that provide the most pertinent information for your industry or organization’s needs.

### Using Threat Intelligence Portals

Threat intelligence portals centralize data and allow for comprehensive threat analysis. [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=threat_collection_techniques&utm_term=161024&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s [TI Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) is an example of a tool that helps with such analysis. Using TI Lookup, users can:

* **Investigate Indicators:** Enter suspicious IP addresses, domains, or file hashes to gain insights into potential threats.
* **Search for Known Threats:** Use the portal to research malware, attack methods, or [Indicators of Compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs).
* **Analyze Attack Techniques:** The tool can also be used to link threats to known tactics and vice versa, such as those in the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-attack/), helping users understand the nature of the threats they face.

### Monitoring Dark Web Forums

The Dark Web is often a hub for cybercriminal activities. Monitoring these forums can yield valuable information about planned [attacks](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/common-attack-methods/), new exploit techniques, and stolen data. Key steps incl...
