# 12 Key Questions For HIPAA Compliant Marketing Email Campaigns

October 30th, 2024

So – you’ve just been told that your email marketing program is putting your company at risk of violating HIPAA. How can you ensure you are running HIPAA compliant marketing email campaigns?

If you want to continue your email-based patient engagement efforts – without the risk of the financial, operational, and reputational risk that accompanies the exposure of sensitive patient data, you *must* implement [HIPAA compliant email marketing](https://luxsci.com/blog/hipaa-compliant-email-marketing.html) practices.

This is comprised of two components: becoming **HIPAA compliant,** setting up the required systems and procedures to ensure your PHI (PHI) and EPHI (EPHI) are protected, and your **marketing objectives**, who you want to reach and what to communicate.

However, you don’t have to let your marketing objectives suffer for the sake of security.

Implementing a HIPAA-compliant marketing program can actually help you achieve better marketing results.

Asking yourself these 12 questions ensures your email marketing campaigns align with your business goals and are HIPAA-compliant.

### **HIPAA Compliant Marketing Emails**

If your organization requires HIPAA-compliant email, start by using these questions to inspect your email marketing for compliance. Note that while we can’t provide legal advice, the below questions will help you identify some of the most common points of vulnerability and non-compliance.

### 1. Do you have security controls to protect access to your email marketing system?

Email security is an essential component of being HIPAA-compliant. As a starting point, check your internal security processes for access restrictions. This includes:

* **A robust password policy**, i.e., changed frequently (e.g., 30 days), has to contain a mixture of characters, etc.
* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, i.e., users verifying their identity in multiple ways, e.g., username/password *and* sent number codes (text, email, key fob, etc.), biometrics, etc.
* **Role-based access controls**, i.e., granting access to individuals based on the responsibilities of their job role.
* **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**, i.e., “never trust, always verify” – where users are required to reconfirm their identity on a case-by-case basis, as opposed to once when logging on, which mitigates session hijacking and similar threats.

### 2. Do you have a documented procedure to guide you HIPAA compliant email marketing?

“Winging it” simply doesn’t cut it when it comes to HIPAA-compliant email marketing; you must develop a comprehensive documented process detailing how you intend to safeguard PHI throughout your email marketing campaigns.

This should include:

* Specifying the **[HIPAA compliant email](https://luxsci.com/hipaa-compliant-email/ "HIPAA compliant email") delivery service** you’ll use to execute your marketing campaigns

* The processes and controls you’ll use to **encrypt data  for** ePHI at rest and in transit

* The **access and authentication controls** you have in place

* How you’ll implement **data minimization**: only using the minimum necessary PHI in communications – and not including sensitive PHI unless it’s essential.
* How you’ll **securely dispose of data**: Implement a process for securely deleting emails containing ePHI once they’re no longer needed, to comply with retention policies.
* **Staff training**: educating employees involved in email marketing on how to securely handle PHI and other HIPAA requirements.
* **Incident response plan**, i.e., an additional documented plan for how you’ll respond to data breaches and other cyber attacks; this also includes notifying any affected parties as mandated by HIPAA.

If you’re starting from scratch, the information contained in the answers to the questions in this article provides a useful starting point for creating your first procedure.

### 3. Can you send encrypted emails?

If you are sending highly sensitive data or PHI in your emails, be aware that HIPAA requires the data to be encrypted a rest, i.e., the storage medium where it resides, and in transit, when being sent to recipients.

To the surprise of many healthcare organizations, most major email marketing providers, such as Mailchimp and Constant Contact are unable to provide encryption for data in transit and only protect data in their systems. To avoid falling foul of HIPAA regulations, ensure that the email delivery platform you use to transmit messages containing PHI offers end-to-end encryption.

### 4. Do you have a complete understanding of your organization’s PHI and ePHI?

Much of the time, when we, as well as healthcare providers, talk about PHI, we’re actually referring to *electronic* protected health information (EPHI). While PHI is a catch-all term to account for all sensitive health information, in truth, in the digital age, the vast majority is stored electronically in data centers – and the patient data handled is EPHI.

You can discover “PHI” and “ePHI” within the context of your organization’s context by identifying and categorizing the PHI and ePHI typically handled in your business. It’s an absolutely crucial tenet of data protection that you simply can’t protect what you’re not aware of.

Comprehensive PHI categorization will help your staff navigate HIPAA-compliant email requirements.

### 5. Do you have a required training process in place for anyone sending HIPAA-compliant marketing emails?

Your HIPAA compliance program, as with your company’s overall cybersecurity posture, is only as strong as your weakest link. In light of this, it’s essential to educate the staff within your company who are involved in your healthcare engagement campaigns on the secure use of ePHI and HIPAA-compliant marketing practices.

Additionally, this needs to be reflected in your onboarding process, so new hires are made familiar with HIPAA regulations, should their role require it.

### 6. Do you have effective protection against malware?

In the unlikely event you need any further encouragement to revisit your company’s a...
