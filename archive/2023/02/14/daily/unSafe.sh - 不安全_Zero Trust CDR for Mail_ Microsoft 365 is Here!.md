Microsoft 365 Mail is critical to the everyday operations of most organizations around the world. For that reason, it is also the preferred infiltration method of cybercriminals, with **over 90% of cyberattacks starting with an email.**

### Zero Trust Email Security for Microsoft 365

The majority of organizations still rely on detection-based defenses for their email protection, that are simply outmatched by the ever evolving threat landscape.

That’s why Forcepoint’s new Zero Trust Content Disarm and Reconstruction ([CDR](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/zero-trust-cdr)) for Mail is **built specifically for Microsoft 365 Mail**. Pivoting away from detection-based protection, Zero Trust CDR for Mail: M365 is a true Zero Trust implementation of CDR that assumes all content is bad, ensuring that all malware is stopped, enabling the safe use of email.

**Raising Email Protection to a Whole New Level**

* **Stop attacks** delivered via **infected attachments** or malicious files downloaded from **embedded links**. Without requiring any on-premises infrastructure.
* Get unrivalled malware protection, **without delays** or impact on user experience.
* Simple and fast installation that can take as little as 25 minutes to configure.
* Stops the spread of malware for inbound, outbound and internal emails, **preventing data loss and [the use of steganography](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/stop-pictures-hiding-malicious-content)**.
