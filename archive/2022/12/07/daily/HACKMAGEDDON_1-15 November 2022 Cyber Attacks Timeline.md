In the first timeline of November, I have collected 127 events (corresponding to 8.47 events/day), a result in line with the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/11/22/16-31-october-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/), which confirms the sustained level of activity that is characterizing this end of 2022.

Despite Ransomware continues to be a cyber plague, its percentage dropped to 22.8% (29 out of 127 events), nearly ten points down compared to the second fortnight of October, when it was 31.5% (41 out of 130 events). Even the impact of vulnerabilities had a considerable drop to 3.9% (5 out of 127 events), less than half compared to 10% of the previous timeline.

Unsurprisingly, Decentralized Finance platforms were still under attack: Deribit suffered a $28M hack, and even the now nearly defunct FTX suffered a $400M blow, just to add fuel to the fire.

Once again, the impact of cyber campaigns related to Ukraine seems to decrease (at least the ones that are visible), even if Ukraine was hit by a specific ransomware strain dubbed ‘Somnia’. Even without the contribution of Ukraine, the cyber espionage front was equally quite crowded with well-known threat actors such as APT29, APT36 and the North-Korean Lazarus, but also newcomers such as Billbug and Earth Longzhi (particularly active, since two camaigns were discovered).

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community. As always, don’t forget to follow [@paulsparrows](https://twitter.com/paulsparrows) on Twitter, or even connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsparrows), for the latest updates.
