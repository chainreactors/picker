In episode 27 of The AI Fix, robots catch a ball, lead a revolt, and enjoy a juicy steak. Or do they? Graham struggles with a Micro USB cable, a student struggles with a school‚Äôs anti-AI rules, and OpenAI‚Äôs Sora video generation AI is leaked by hacktivists.

Graham circles back into an outside-the-box deep-dive where he synergises the low-hanging paradigm shift on a Zoom call with himself, and Mark wonders why we‚Äôre suddenly awash with real-life Bond villains.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
