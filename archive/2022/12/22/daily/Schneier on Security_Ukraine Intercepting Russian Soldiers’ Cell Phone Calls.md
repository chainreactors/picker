## Ukraine Intercepting Russian Soldiers’ Cell Phone Calls

They’re using commercial phones, which go through the [Ukrainian telecom network](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/we-were-allowed-to-be-slaughtered-calls-by-russian-forces-intercepted):

> “You still have a lot of soldiers bringing cellphones to the frontline who want to talk to their families and they are either being intercepted as they go through a Ukrainian telecommunications provider or intercepted over the air,” said Alperovitch. “That doesn’t pose too much difficulty for the Ukrainian security services.”
>
> […]
>
> “Security has always been a mess, both in the army and among defence officials,” the source said. “For example, in 2013 they tried to get all the staff at the ministry of defence to replace our iPhones with Russian-made Yoto smartphones.
>
> “But everyone just kept using the iPhone as a second mobile because it was much better. We would just keep the iPhone in the car’s glove compartment for when we got back from work. In the end, the ministry gave up and stopped caring. If the top doesn’t take security very seriously, how can you expect any discipline in the regular army?”

This isn’t a new problem and it isn’t a Russian problem. [Here’s](https://conversationalist.org/2020/03/20/soldiers-with-smartphones-can-be-a-gift-to-the-enemy/) a more general article on the problem from 2020.

@ ALL,

As I said just a day or two ago[1] int the “How to surrender to a drone” thread,

> *“Heck if I were the Ukranians I’d be dropping pairs of clean socks and bread rolls on the Russians not handgrenades… Even mobile phones with free minutes to phone home.*
>
> Why because for most soldiers the two things they want to do most are,
>
> 1, Stay healthy.

The fact that such “free phones” would enable lots and lots of phone calls from those soldiers…

“Of course never crossed my mind;-)”

Like our host @Bruce, I’ve been in this game for quite some time, and actually was involved with the design of certain aspects of what we now call “Mobile Phones”, and back then in the 1980’s “Cellular phones” (from Racal). It was trying to get data communications across them. Which these days is now their primary.

I discussed what I did and the issues back when every one was getting “hyped” about “jackpair”[2] voice encryptor that I gather failed for exactly the reasons I predicted. Hey ho…

For those wanting to do “voice encryption” these days, learn the lesson and use the “data” not “voice” channel…

After all how hard would it be to design a hardware “USB” dongle these days?

US military, NSA and CIA have been collecting raw cellfone data for a year; no need for direct access to Ukraine cellfone exchanges.

Ukraine conflict is a vast bonanza for US Intelligence services; much is shared with Ukraine government.

From *The Guardian*:

> The former Kremlin official said Putin was learning the hard way that his army was in dire need of modernisation and that the top-down Soviet style model was not fit for purpose.

The book [Chip War](https://www.amazon.com/Chip-War-Worlds-Critical-Technology/dp/1982172002/) has a chapter dedicated to Directorate T – a KGB division established in 1963 to “acquire” foreign technology. Unfortunately, or fortunately you could say, the USSR’s copy-it strategy of theft and replication only served to enforce a continued technological lag. Soviet military leaders were never assured of a steady supply of quality chips and “so they minimized the use of electronics and computers in military systems.” It appears you could argue their “teknologia” hasn’t gotten a whole lot better.

This is not about “failing security”. The root cause of this mess is the trueism that a countries army is not better than its economy.[1]

Russia is a Kleptocracy that has no big industrial sector and a miserable, corrupt administration. Basically, nothing works in Russia. The army of such a state will reflect the society. And it shows. Nothing actually works in the army as in it’s economy. Its army is little more than an uncoordinated horde with guns.

If nothing works, it’s phones won’t work either, nor it’s security in general.

If Ukraine were to set up base-stations along the front-line that allowed free calls, even if the phone has no SIM inserted, to Russia (to talk to relatives and/or friends) and Ukraine (to access the surrender hotline) it could be advantageous for intelligence gathering.

I am wondering why Ukraine has not deployed GNSS jamming/misdirection in much the same way that Russia immediately deployed it after the cruise missile/drone attack on the Dyagilevo and Engels/Engels-2 airbases. If the Iranian Shahed 136/Geran-2 drones use GNSS, it seems like a cheap way to misdirect them away from critical infrastructure.
