The launch of ChatGPT and other [deep learning](https://www.pcmag.com/news/what-is-deep-learning) quickly led to a flurry of lawsuits against model developers. Legal theories vary, but most are rooted in copyright: plaintiffs argue that use of their works to train the models was infringement; developers counter that their training is fair use. Meanwhile developers are making as many licensing deals as possible to stave off future litigation, and it’s a sound bet that the existing litigation is an elaborate scramble for leverage in settlement negotiations.

These cases can end one of three ways: rightsholders win, everybody settles, or developers win.
