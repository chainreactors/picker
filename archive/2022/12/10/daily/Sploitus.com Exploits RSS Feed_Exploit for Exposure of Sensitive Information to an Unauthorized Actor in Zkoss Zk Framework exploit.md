From the vulnerability description, if the route /zkau/upload contains the nextURI parameter, the ZK AuUploader servlet will forward the forward request, which can bypass the identity authentication and return the files in the web context, such as obtaining web.xml, zk page, applicationContext -security.xml configuration information, etc.
