Cybersecurity researchers have [flagged](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/supply-chain-attack-on-react-native-aria-ecosystem) a supply chain attack targeting over a dozen packages associated with GlueStack to deliver malware.

The malware, introduced via a change to "lib/commonjs/index.js," allows an attacker to run shell commands, take screenshots, and upload files to infected machines, Aikido Security told The Hacker News, stating these packages collectively account for nearly 1 million weekly downloads.

The unauthorized access could then be used to perform various follow-on actions like mining cryptocurrency, stealing sensitive information, and even shutting down services. Aikido said the first package compromise was detected on June 6, 2025, at 9:33 p.m. GMT.

The list of the impacted packages and the affected versions is below -

* @gluestack-ui/utils version 0.1.16 (101 Downloads)
* @gluestack-ui/utils version 0.1.17 (176 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/button version 0.2.11 (174 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/checkbox version 0.2.11 (577 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/combobox version 0.2.8 (167 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/disclosure version 0.2.9 (N/A)
* @react-native-aria/focus version 0.2.10 (951 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/interactions version 0.2.17 (420 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/listbox version 0.2.10 (171 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/menu version 0.2.16 (54 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/overlay version 0.3.16 (751 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/radio version 0.2.14 (570 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/slider version 0.2.13 (264 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/switch version 0.2.5 (56 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/tabs version 0.2.14 (170 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/toggle version 0.2.12 (589 Downloads)
* @react-native-aria/utils version 0.2.13 (341 Downloads)

Furthermore, the malicious code injected into the packages is [similar](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/malicious-npm-packages-infect-3200.html#npm-package-rand-user-agent-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack) to the remote access trojan that was delivered following the compromise of another npm package "rand-user-agent" last month, indicating that the same threat actors could be behind the activity.

The trojan is an updated version that supports two new commands to harvest system information ("ss\_info") and the public IP address of the host ("ss\_ip").

The project maintainers have since [revoked the access token](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/issues/2894) and marked the impacted versions as deprecated. Users who may have downloaded the malicious versions are recommended to roll back to a safe version to mitigate any potential threats.

"The potential impact is massive in scale, and the malware's persistence mechanism is particularly concerning – attackers maintain access to infected machines even after maintainers update the packages," the company said in a statement.

However, in an incident report published on June 9, 2025, the project maintainers acknowledged that a public access token associated with one of their contributors was compromised, thereby allowing threat actors to publish tampered versions of react-native-aria packages along with a @gluestack-ui/utils package to npm.

"The compromised package was published by a compromised account of an authorized maintainer," Suraj Ahmed Choudhury [said](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/issues/2894#issuecomment-2955003750). "React Native ARIA is a frontend-only library. It does not execute any code in CLI or scripts post-install, meaning the likelihood of the malicious code executing on user systems is extremely low to none. Based on our current understanding and usage patterns, no system-level compromises are expected."

The maintainers also said they have also revoked GitHub repository access for all non-essential contributors, and enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for publishing and GitHub access.

### Malicious Packages Found on npm Unleash Destructive Features

The development comes as Socket discovered two rogue npm packages – express-api-sync and system-health-sync-api – that masquerade as legitimate utilities but implant wipers that can delete entire application directories.

Published by the account "botsailer" (email: anupm019@gmail[.]com), the packages were downloaded 112 and 861 times, respectively, before being taken down.

The first of the two packages, express-api-sync, claims to be an Express API to sync data between two databases. However, once installed and added by an unsuspecting developer to their application, it triggers the execution of malicious code upon receiving an HTTP request with a hard-coded key "DEFAULT\_123."

Upon receipt of the key, it executes the Unix command "rm -rf \*" to recursively delete all files from the current directory and below, including source code, configuration files, assets, and local databases.

The other package is a lot more sophisticated, acting both as an information stealer and a wiper, while also modifying its deletion commands based on whether the operating sys...
