Hi,

earlier this year in February 2022, we published a technical security advisory -
https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/multiple-critical-vulnerabilities-in-multiple-zyxel-devices/ - on
different critical vulnerabilities in Zyxel devices, resulting from insecure coding practices and insecure
configuration.

Those also included a highly critical unauthenticated buffer overflow vulnerability in the proprietary Zyxel web server
which allowed remote root access to the device. The only prerequisite for the
attacker: network-level access to the web interface, e.g. via Internet or LAN/WiFi.

We have just released a blog post giving an overview about the critical buffer overflow vulnerability on a higher
level, a list of the affected devices (it seems there still exist vulnerable devices
on the Internet). We have also developed a Metasploit module to verify whether the buffer overflow vulnerability can
still be exploited on one's own affected device.
