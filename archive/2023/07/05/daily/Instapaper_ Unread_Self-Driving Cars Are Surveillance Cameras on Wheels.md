## Self-Driving Cars Are Surveillance Cameras on Wheels

Police are [already using](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/self-driving-car-video-from-waymo-cruise-give-police-crime-evidence?sref=P6Q0mxvj) self-driving car footage as video evidence:

> While security cameras are commonplace in American cities, self-driving cars represent a new level of access for law enforcement ­ and a new method for encroachment on privacy, advocates say. Crisscrossing the city on their routes, self-driving cars capture a wider swath of footage. And it’s easier for law enforcement to turn to one company with a large repository of videos and a dedicated response team than to reach out to all the businesses in a neighborhood with security systems.
>
> “We’ve known for a long time that they are essentially surveillance cameras on wheels,” said Chris Gilliard, a fellow at the Social Science Research Council. “We’re supposed to be able to go about our business in our day-to-day lives without being surveilled unless we are suspected of a crime, and each little bit of this technology strips away that ability.”
>
> […]
>
> While self-driving services like Waymo and Cruise have yet to achieve the same level of market penetration as Ring, the wide range of video they capture while completing their routes presents other opportunities. In addition to the San Francisco homicide, Bloomberg’s review of court documents shows police have sought footage from Waymo and Cruise to help solve hit-and-runs, burglaries, aggravated assaults, a fatal collision and an attempted kidnapping.
>
> In all cases reviewed by Bloomberg, court records show that police collected footage from Cruise and Waymo shortly after obtaining a warrant. In several cases, Bloomberg could not determine whether the recordings had been used in the resulting prosecutions; in a few of the cases, law enforcement and attorneys said the footage had not played a part, or was only a formality. However, video evidence has become a lynchpin of criminal cases, meaning it’s likely only a matter of time.

The primary question is *why* the cars *store* the footage or any other sensor data that was intended for a wholly different purpose, namely driving the car. Past sensor inputs are useless for the task at hand – but very “useful” for the company that makes them.

Would you be fine with your non-self-driving car, or your lawn mower, or your fridge, or your toaster etc. etc. stored all sensor data with their timing for all government agencies to conveniently retrieve at whim? Beware, that includes your neighbor’s lawn mower.

@Peter A.

> The primary question is why the cars store the footage or any other sensor data

The same reason drivers, eg, Russians, preserve dash-cam recordings [1]. To proof who was responsible for an accident or other mishap. But for that aim, the data does not have to leave the possession of the owner.

Obviously, they also want the stuff to (re-)train their self-driving algorithms.

[1] ‘https://www.wired.com/2013/02/russian-dash-cams/

More fun:

> Users watching these [dash-cam] compilations are often pretty shocked. “In Russia the majority of drivers drive as if they’re immortal,” “Russian dashcam videos are better than Hollywood﻿,” – these are quite typical comments under Russian car DVR videos on the Internet. People tend to compare the world of Russian roads with videogames, especially concerning recorded fights between drivers. “Russia is like real life Grand Theft Auto!” Jon Stewart, the ex-host of American The Daily Show shouted while commenting on a video of two men confronting each other with a baseball bat and a hatchet.

@Winter: “for that aim, the data does not have to leave the possession of the owner”

You’re spot on, that’s the key point. One can choose to store or not to store, what to store, for how long, when to reveal the stored data and to whom.

It’s the difference between you sometimes taking a note or a photo, or recording a part of your life (sometimes inevitably including parts of other’s lives), and being able to safeguard or destroy it (to some degree) – and someone else (virtually) following you all the time taking notes, photographing and filming you, often surreptitiously, or by breaking your trust[1], and then giving it out to anybody, including any branch of the government.

I understand proactively taking evidence to help you win a potential case in an ineffective and/or corrupt system, such as not only Russians recording their drives (I feel sorry for them on that aspect). Same goes for home surveillance systems that one may install voluntarily if one thinks it would make their home more secure. Same for (consciously) recording or sharing your GNSS location. Etc., etc.

[1] such as asking for “diagnostic” data to be used “anonymously” for some good purpose like “improving service” for you – and then selling it or snitching on you

We’re talking evidence that could exonerate or convict someone, and it’s “only a formality”? WHAT??

@ ALL,

Please remember that these videos are actually “third party business records” of the vehical owner not the temporary driver. So the police do not actually require a warrant to access them just a request letter…

Hence the,
