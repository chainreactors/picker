üß† Quick Summary

In this post, I explain how I discovered a severe **authorization bypass vulnerability** in YouTube‚Äôs internal tool, **Video Builder** ([https://director.youtube.com](https://director.youtube.com/)). This tool allows advertisers to easily create and upload video ads to their YouTube channels.

Due to a missing authorization check in the backend, any user with access to this tool could upload a video to **any YouTube channel** by simply modifying the `channelId` parameter in a specific request. This meant that attackers could target **any verified or influential YouTube channel** and upload content without their permission.

Google acknowledged the vulnerability, resolved it quickly, and awarded me **$6,337** under their **Google Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP)**.

## üéÆ Background: What is YouTube Video Builder?

**YouTube Video Builder** is a lightweight video creation tool for businesses and advertisers. It helps create short promotional videos (typically 6‚Äì15 seconds) using static assets like logos, images, and text animations.

Key features:

* Templates for quick video generation
* Brand customization options
* Direct integration for uploading to a connected YouTube channel

The tool is available only via invitation or request, making it relatively unknown to the public.

REWARD PROOF

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Discovery Process

## 1. Gaining Access

I gained access to YouTube Video Builder via my Google Ads account. Once inside, I explored the video creation flow.

## 2. Creating a Sample Video

I selected a template, added sample brand assets (logo, image, and tagline), and moved through the creation steps.

## 3. Intercepting the Upload Request

During the final step (video upload), I clicked ‚ÄúSave Video‚Äù and intercepted the outgoing request using **Burp Suite**.

**Endpoint:**

```
POST https://director.youtube.com/videobuilder/_/rpc/Image2VideoUiService/UploadToYouTube
```

**Original payload:**

```
{
  "channelId": "UCabc123xyz...",
  "videoTitle": "Aditya Test Video",
  "videoPrivacy": "unlisted",
  ...
}
```

## 4. The Attack Idea

I had a simple but powerful thought:

> *‚ÄúWhat if I change the* `channelId` *to a channel I don't own?"*

I extracted a public YouTube channel ID (easily available from any channel URL).

## 5. Replaying with a Different Channel ID

I modified the payload to include a different `channelId`:

```
{
  "channelId": "UCnOtMyChAnNeL123",
  "videoTitle": "Test Attack Video",
  ...
}
```

I resent the request.

## 6. Success: Unauthorized Upload

The server responded successfully and returned:

```
{
  "videoId": "dEfaUlTxXyZ123"
}
```

This meant my video had been uploaded to the **targeted channel** without any form of authorization. The video was set to ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù and visible to anyone with the link.

## üéØ Real-World Impact

This bug could allow:

* Uploading defaming or malicious videos to **any channel**
* Damaging brand reputation or spreading misinformation
* Targeting high-profile influencers, businesses, or even political accounts

For example:

> *An attacker could upload a scam video to a verified channel and promote it using that channel‚Äôs reputation.*

Although the video would be unlisted, it would still be accessible to the channel owner and anyone with the video link.

üîç Root Cause Analysis

The vulnerability stemmed from a classic **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** issue.

## Problem:

The backend **did not validate** whether the user making the upload request was authorized to use the provided `channelId`.

## What Should Have Happened:

The server should verify that the authenticated user actually manages or owns the YouTube channel associated with the provided `channelId`.

## üí° How Google Could Have Prevented It

1. **Strict Backend Authorization**

* Validate ownership of `channelId` on the server side.

1. **Don‚Äôt Trust Client-Side Inputs**

* Never rely on client-submitted values for sensitive identifiers.

1. **Regular Security Audits of Internal Tools**

* Internal or invite-only tools must go through the same security checks as public-facing services.

## üî• Proof of Concept (PoC) Recap

1. Accessed YouTube Video Builder via Google Ads
2. Created a sample ad video
3. Intercepted final upload request
4. Replaced `channelId` with that of a public channel
5. Sent the request
6. Server responded with a valid `videoId` ‚Äî upload successful

## üìô Conclusion

This bug was simple in execution but had the potential for massive impact. It showed how trusting frontend data, even in internal tools, can lead to critical authorization issues.

## Key Takeaways:

* Always validate ownership and access at the backend
* Frontend controls are never enough
* Even restricted tools can have dangerous flaws
