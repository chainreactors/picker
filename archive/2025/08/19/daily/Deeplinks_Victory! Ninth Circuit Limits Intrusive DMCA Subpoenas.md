The Ninth Circuit upheld an important limitation on Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) subpoenas that other federal courts have recognized for more than two decades. The DMCA, a misguided anti-piracy law passed in the late nineties, created a bevy of powerful tools, ostensibly to help copyright holders fight online infringement. Unfortunately, the DMCA’s powerful protections are ripe for abuse by “copyright trolls,” unscrupulous litigants who abuse the system at everyone else’s expense.

The DMCA’s “notice and takedown” regime is one of these tools. Section 512 of the DMCA creates “safe harbors” that protect service providers from liability, so long as they disable access to content when a copyright holder notifies them that the content is infringing, and fulfill some other requirements. This gives copyright holders a quick and easy way to censor allegedly infringing content without going to court.

Section 512(h) is ostensibly designed to facilitate this system, by giving rightsholders a fast and easy way of identifying anonymous infringers. Section 512(h) allows copyright holders to obtain a judicial subpoena to unmask the identities of allegedly infringing anonymous internet users, just by asking a court clerk to issue one, and attaching a copy of the infringement notice. In other words, they can wield the court’s power to override an internet user’s right to anonymous speech, without permission from a judge.  It’s easy to see why these subpoenas are prone to misuse.
