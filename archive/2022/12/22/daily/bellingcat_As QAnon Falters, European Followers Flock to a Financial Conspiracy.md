# As QAnon Falters, European Followers Flock to a Financial Conspiracy

December 21, 2022

* [QAnon](/tag/qanon)

Imagine you’re a jaded stalwart of the [QAnon conspiracy](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/qanon/). The latest batch of ‘[drops](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/29/the-qanon-timeline/)’ – the cryptic posts into which you’ve read so much – aren’t quite as enticing, and you’re not even sure that Donald Trump will return to the Oval Office.

But you’re not ready to reassess your belief system. Luckily for you, there are other doomsday prophecies to keep you engaged. That’s how you ended up with billions of Zimbabwean dollars. Or Iraqi Dinars.

Whatever the currency, this scenario doesn’t seem so rare in those corners of the internet that are populated by Europe’s conspiracy theorists. New data shows that QAnon’s hold on the continent’s conspiracy discourse has begun to loosen at the same time that some of its European followers flock to a decades-old financial conspiracy.

That decades-old conspiracy is GESARA, which heralds a financial reset that will see billions of secret funds distributed to people across the globe and the erasure of all debts. Over the past year, Bellingcat and [Lighthouse Reports](https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/qanon-in-europe-tracing-a-viral-conspiracy/) have archived and analysed millions of messages from more than 2,000 conspiracist Telegram channels as part of a joint investigation into the spread of the dangerous QAnon conspiracy in Europe. A team of country-specific researchers selected an initial sample of channels in their respective countries that was then expanded using [snowball sampling](https://www.simplypsychology.org/snowball-sampling.html).

While these channels included QAnon terms, they were not specifically QAnon themed, many of which included a heady mix of other conspiracy theories. Researchers found an explosion of GESARA content across the collected channels at the same time as classic QAnon tropes like “[the Great Awakening](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/20/qanon-biden-inauguration-trump-antisemitism-white-nationalism)” have seemed to falter.

This resurgent popularity has rekindled GESARA’s decades-old prophecy of an imminent financial reset and created especially fertile ground for schemes that have seen hundreds across the continent invest in worthless (crypto-)currencies.

****What is GESARA/NESARA?****

NESARA (National Economic Security and Recovery Act) — known outside the US as GESARA (Global Economic Security and Recovery Act) — was a series of economic reforms proposed in the 1990s by Harvey Francis Bernard, a US engineering consultant. Bernard wrote down his reforms, which included a return to the gold standard, in a manuscript titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.

Years later, blogger Shaini Goodwin began writing about NESARA, extending its mythology to include the erasure of all debts and the abolishment of the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Goodwin originally promoted NESARA as part of OMEGA, a scam that defrauded investors of millions, [according](https://culteducation.com/group/897-dove-of-oneness-nesara/5759-snared-by-a-cybercult-queen.html) to reporting by The News Tribune.

As the [BBC reported in 2021](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct1xzv), GESARA has grown in popularity in recent years.

The link between the GESARA / NESARA and QAnon conspiracy ecosystems is not new.

GESARA / NESARA has been [described](https://themikerothschild.com/2020/03/19/nesara-reborn/) as a “grandfather” of QAnon, the conspiracy that casts Donald Trump as a white knight fighting a Satan-worshipping, child-killing “cabal.”

## European QAnon Meets A Vintage Conspiracy Theory

This July, a UK influencer and conspiracy theorist named Nicholas Veniamin posted an offer to his 150,000 followers on Telegram. For £‎350 (US$428) apiece, they could purchase a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar banknote.

The problem is that Zimbabwean dollars, at least as tender, are worthless. Zimbabwe abandoned the currency in favour of the US dollar in 2009, when soaring inflation reached an [estimated](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2009/5/cj29n2-8.pdf) 79.6 billion percent month-on-month and grocery shopping reportedly [involved](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/aug/17/Zimbabwenews.internationalnews) lugging around buckets of cash.

To understand how Veniamin is able to peddle worthless currency to thousands of followers, you have to understand the alluring prophecy which underpins GESARA. This ‘reset’, followers believe, will see billions of secret funds distributed to people across the globe, the erasure of all debts, and the revaluation of low-value currencies — including that 100 trillion dollar Zimbabwe banknote.

If most conspiracy theory Telegram channels rely on circular logic, then GESARA channels are especially recursive. GESARA influencers constantly herald an imminent financial reset only for the deadline to silently pass by, with a new deadline inevitably set.

A Dutch conspiracy channel announces the initiation of GESARA by October 22.

A Dutch-language GESARA channel announces that a “Global Currency Reset” will happen on May 23. Bellingcat has obscured the channel’s name to prevent its promotion.

The language of explicit GESARA channels in Europe often mirrors that of QAnon-focused channels. The rise of QAnon has seen GESARA followers peg the impending financial reset and the release of the GESARA / NESARA funds on Donald Trump’s defeat of a Satan-worshipping, paedophile cabal — a key pillar of QAnon mythology.

Messages archived by Bellingcat and Lighthouse Reports suggest that European QAnon followers have become increasingly exposed to GESARA.

GESARA keywords increasingly appear in European QAnon and conspiracy channels alongside links to GESARA influencers like Nicholas Veniamin.
