# Cracking ATT 2wire routers, what scheme?

Hi,

I am very familiar with cracking wifi. I was recently given a handful of pmk hashes to crack. I have cracked several of them using my usual methods. However, one I haven't cracked is called ATT-519. When I look up the Mac identifier, it says it belongs to 2wire.

I've googled and used OfferUp to see pictures of various 2wire routers and their password schemes. I haven't found really good candidates to base my attack on.

I've seen some that are 9/10/12/14 chars in length. I've already run hashcat against a massive pw list (8gb torrent) without success. From the few I did find online (by searching for ATT router or 2wire router images and zooming in), it SEEMS like the wifi passwords are often 10 chars (alphanumeric such as X9zKwLqO91) in length when the SSID is ATT-xxx. Whereas, the longer length passwords are often tied to default SSIDs like "ATT515190gway".

I know the older routers with default SSIDs of "2wireXXX" are most usually 9 number passwords and they're easier but I have no experience with these ATT routers and they're not local to me. The friend I'm cracking these for doesn't know anything else about these routers either.

I don't want to waste a lot of resources brute forcing numerics if that's not the scheme used in these. If anyone knows more about these, or knows anything useful about these (maybe a MAC->wifi password calculator) please share. Or if you have one of these and wouldn't mind sharing the default SSID/password so I can get an idea.

Thank you
