# AI-generated image watermarks can be easily removed, say researchers

Posted: July 24, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

Now that [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) can make fake images that look real, how can we know what’s legitimate and what isn’t? One of the primary ways has been the use of defensive watermarking, which means embedding invisible markers in AI-generated images to show they were made up. Now, researchers have broken that technology.

Generative AI isn’t just for writing emails or suggesting recipes. It can generate entire images from scratch. While most people use that for fun (making cartoons of your dog) or practicality (envisioning a woodworking project, say) some use it irresponsibly. One example is creating images that look like real creators’ content (producing an image ‘in the style of’ a particular artist).

Another is using it for misinformation, either intentionally or unintentionally. This image-based misinformation has grown exponentially in an AI-powered world, [according to Google researchers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11697). Misinformation can be playful or experimental, such as Katy Perry’s [deepfake attendance at the Met Gala](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/katy-perrys-rihanna-met-gala-fake-ai-images-spread-rcna151163), and the [puffer jacket Pope](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-puffer-jacket-fake-photos-deepfake-power-peril-of-ai/). But it can also be harmful, putting real people in situations that they didn’t consent to, creating false narratives for ideological, financial, or other purposes.

In the early days of AI image generation, people could recognize the fakes themselves. People in pictures having the wrong number of fingers was one giveaway, as were body parts like hands and arms that didn’t fit together well, especially when people were pictured close together. As AI generation got better, we could still rely on programs to detect small inconsistencies in the images. But those fake images get more convincing every day.

Generative AI companies have been taking action to stop this. [OpenAI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063954/ai-watermarks-dalle3-openai-content-credentials), [Google](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid), and others committed to embedding watermarks in their AI-generated images. These are digital fingerprints, invisible to the naked eye but easily detectable by software, that prove an image was generated by AI and therefore not real.

Now, researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada have [worked out a way to subvert this defensive watermarking](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-07-watermarks-defense-deepfakes.html). Andre Kassis and Urs Hengartner at the University’s Cheriton School of Computer Science have created a tool called UnMarker.

UnMarker removes those watermarks from images, making it impossible for watermark detectors to determine that an image has been artificially generated. The scientists say that the tool is universal, defeating all watermarking schemes. These include semantic watermarks, which alter the structure of the image itself. These are more deeply embedded in an image, and traditionally tougher to counter.

The tool capitalizes on two fundamental needs for watermarking tools. The first is that they mustn’t degrade the quality of the image. The second is that they must be immune to manipulation su...
