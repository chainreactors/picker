For years, the DEA secretly paid workers inside U.S. agencies and companies for access to user data, rather than going to a court to obtain a search warrant for such data. That included paying sources inside the parcel industry to open and reroute packages; airline industry sources who provided flight itineraries, dates of birth, and seat numbers; and workers at private bus companies who provided daily lists of passengers who bought tickets in cash.

Paying moles inside companies allowed the DEA to passively monitor some services for potential targets without the friction of going through the courts, where such broad surveillance could be denied outright. In some cases, the DEA used the information to seize money or drugs from people. But buying the information in the first place may in some cases skirt Fourth Amendment protections.

Now, a pair of bipartisan lawmakers are pushing the Department of Justice to tighten policies around confidential human sources that would ban the practice entirely across the DOJ, including the DEA and FBI.

After [the revelations of the DEA paying for information came to light](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2014/08/12/dea-paid-an-amtrak-secretary-for-confidential-passenger-information/) in 2014 and 2016 [reports from](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-seeks-answers-dea-payment-854460-amtrak-passenger-information) [watchdog bodies](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2016/a1633.pdf), the DEA said in its own letter to Senator Chuck Grassley that the agency had updated its policy to ban payments to employees of other agencies or quasi-government agencies. But recently Senator Ron Wyden’s (D-OR) office was told the DEA’s policy still allows agents to pay employees inside private companies for access to data. The new letter, led by Senator Wyden and also signed by Senator Cynthia M. Lummis (R-WY), aims to plug that loophole, which could see agents sidestepping the warrant process to simply purchase data from moles inside companies instead.

“The Congressional Research Service informed Senator Wyden’s office that DEA officials said the agency does not apply the prohibition on payment for information obtained in the course and scope of a source’s employment to employees of private companies,” [the letter reads](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23729538-wyden-letter-sources). The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is [a federal legislative branch](https://crsreports.congress.gov/Home/About) that provides Members of Congress with policy reports and more.

“The DOJ must explicitly prohibit these practices to ensure that all of its components, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) do not use confidential sources to avoid using appropriate legal processes to obtain Americans’ data,” the letter continues.

Ordinarily to obtain information from a company, the DEA has to go through the courts. That might involve an application for a search warrant, which is then approved by a judge. This is a fundamental part of the U.S. justice system, and is to ensure that the DEA has authority to request the data, that the request is not overbroad, and there are reasonable grounds to invade the privacy of the target, such as them concretely being suspected of a crime.
