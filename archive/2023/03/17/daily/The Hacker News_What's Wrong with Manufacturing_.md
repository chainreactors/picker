[![Cybersecurity for Manufacturing Industry](data:image/png;base64... "Cybersecurity for Manufacturing Industry")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSkAPCyLS5eRFeCDZ2d8aN_D0LuZ6iExaGaA3q5fbbWHsUk2sjzz06OpIzgSMPmrkcPSbtvealnJb9vFMneScx2P7mYcI_GKlOhksY43SGe-DFMF2DELVDFg4ZOrgmpjKYhdBjtE19Gp-Jix-vjbbpRj-KnNVHKlM_CMnVKieAfMUpVxO-kqu5h5Tt/s790-rw-e365/Featured.jpg)

In last year's edition of the [Security Navigator](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/security-navigator?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=media&utm_campaign=sn2023) we noted that the Manufacturing Industry appeared to be totally over-represented in our dataset of Cyber Extortion victims. Neither the number of businesses nor their average revenue particularly stood out to explain this.

Manufacturing was also the most represented Industry in our CyberSOC dataset – contributing more Incidents than any other sector.

We found this trend confirmed in 2023 – so much in fact that we decided to take a closer look. So let's examine some possible explanations.

And debunk them.

## **Hunting for possible explanations**

Manufacturing is still the most impacted industry in our Cyber Extortion dataset in 2023, as tracked by monitoring double-extortion leak sites. Indeed, this sector now represents more than 20% of all victims since we started observing the leak sites in the beginning of 2020.

[![Cybersecurity for Manufacturing Industry](data:image/png;base64... "Cybersecurity for Manufacturing Industry")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrggbHsrFvHJVuVojMsWGQvvWxF1J6RRQKhzvvBceQb15JKC_bhYtliko8M4tolqwA339-BjTR_yD4AwytZIXyutdt5_bPgWDbFh8lbtTVGDae8tUGXW0eAGUnOHz3Z2YbJu3RsbCBDj5QyMLJTIS-XKaBBaeax6MQXpYEgdjU9yTne3IROaMtlh9s/s790-rw-e365/1.jpg)

Approximately 28% of all our clients are from Manufacturing, contributing with an overall share of 31% of all potential incidents we investigated.

We note that 58% of the Incidents this industry deals with are internally caused, 32% were externally caused, 1% was classified as "Partner" or 3rd parties. When external threat actors had caused the security incident, we observed the top 3 threat actions were Web Attacks, Port Scanning and Phishing.

On the other hand, Manufacturing has the lowest apparent number of confirmed security vulnerabilities per IT Asset in our Vulnerability scanning dataset. Our pentesting teams in contrast report 4.81 CVSS findings per day, which is quite a bit above the average of 3.61 across all other industries.

**Several questions present themselves, which we will attempt to examine here:**

1. What part does Operation Technology play?
2. Are businesses in Manufacturing more vulnerable?
3. Is the Manufacturing sector being deliberately targeted more?
4. Do our Manufacturing clients experience more incidents?

## **What part does OT play?**

A tempting assumption to make is that businesses in the Manufacturing sector are compromised more often via notoriously insecure Operational Technology (OT) or Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Plants and factories can often not afford to be disrupted or shut down and that Manufacturing is therefore a soft target for extortionists.

It sure sounds plausible. The catch is: we don't see these theories supported in our data.

The attack against US Energy giant Colonial Pipeline was probably the most notable recent example of a successful attack against an industrial facility.

Discover the latest in cybersecurity with comprehensive "**[Security Navigator 2023](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/security-navigator?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=media&utm_campaign=sn2023)**" report. This research-driven report is based on 100% first-hand information from 17 global SOCs and 13 CyberSOCs of Orange Cyberdefense, the CERT, Epidemiology Labs and World Watch and provides a wealth of valuable information and insights into the current and future threat landscape.

In July this year US intelligence agencies even warned of a hacking toolset dubbed 'Pipedream' that is designed to target specific Industrial Control Systems. But it is not clear to us if or when these tools have ever been encountered in the wild. Apart from the infamous Stuxnet attack from 2010, one struggles to recall a single cyber security incident where the entry point was an OT system.

At Colonial Pipeline the backend 'conventional' administrative systems were compromised first. Looking more closely, this is the case for almost all reported incidents at industrial facilities.

## **Are businesses in the Manufacturing sector more vulnerable to attacks?**

To answer this questions we examined a set of 3 million vulnerability scan findings, and a sample of 1,400 Ethical Hacking reports.

We derived three metrics that facilitate somewhat normalized comparisons across the industries in our client base:

#### **VOC scanning findings per asset, time to patch, Pentest findings per day of testing.**

If we rank industries for their performance on each of those metrics and sort from worst to best, then our clients in the Manufacturing sector arrives in 5th place out of 12 comparable industries.

The chart below shows the overall \*ranking\* of our Manufacturing clients out of comparable industries.

#### **VOC unique findings/asset**

On this metric there were seven other industries that performed better than Manufacturing.

While we have a comparatively high number of assets from Manufacturing clients in our scanning dataset, we report far fewer Finding...
