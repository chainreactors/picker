## Deepfakes and the 2024 US Election

Interesting [analysis](https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem):

> We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project ([source](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html) for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.
>
> We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate *without* AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions.

This tracks with my analysis. People share as a form of social signaling. I send you a meme/article/clipping/photo to show that we are on the same team. Whether it is true, or misinformation, or actual propaganda, is of secondary importance. Sometimes it’s completely irrelevant. This is why fact checking doesn’t work. This is why “cheap fakes”—obviously fake photos and videos—are effective. This is why, as the authors of that analysis said, the demand side is the real problem.

I wonder if the demand side is the problem in all cases… (I don’t wonder, actually).

@Brian, this is the case specifically for AI generated content. Of course, misinformation really is an issue. It maliciously misleads those who are easily misled. But as the source says, item (2) applies – no AI would be necessary to effectively mislead people. All it takes is a talking head producing a lengthy, hardly coherent sermon about a variety of topics and a claim to be whatever expert they claim to be. (nearly) any person can do this without bothering about computing power limitations.

Please listen to what I believe and tell me what I want to hear.

So let me get this straight… AI isn’t an issue because all AI-generated fakes are just as easily generated (and to exactly the same believable-ness level) without AI?

There are a couple key points I’m making here… the “just as easily” part… and the “same believable-ness level” part… If it’s in any way easier to do with AI overall, or easier to make look as/more real, then you have a possible (soon coming, if not here already) issue of a greater volume of more realistic-looking fakes, because it becomes more accessible to make them. With greater volume of realistic-looking fakes, more people will believe them, and with more people believing them, it has an affect on society as a whole.

I’m harping on this because “nevertheless cheap to replicate without AI” does not necessarily mean the same thing as “just as easy to make without AI.” Money is not the only way to measure easiness. Actual less work to do, speed at which it can be done, or more accessible to the common man, are other ways to measure it. And have potentially different outcomes than just measuring money.

You can just say “well I’m not easily misled, so it’s someone else’s problem” but the fact is that everyone has biases, even you, smart guy. Therefore everyone has confirmation bias, even you. Everyone more easily sees the truth in what they already think is true, even with you. And everyone can be manipulated to some degree, even you. And this builds up over time for everyone, even for you. Meaning, a little manipulation now, a bit more later on, and a bit more later on, it adds up to quite a bit eventually. For everyone, even for you.

Would you like to be more manipulated or more free? Then be very careful about what you watch, listen to, do, or even think about. Everything has its effect.

@ Bruce, ALL,

The authors make three points in the part you quote.

But if we look at the first two,

> *“We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate without AI,”*

It begs the question,

“What is deceptive?”

For years the visual side of music has had “lipsyncing” done by amateurs and experts alike.

Is it actually,

“Deceptive when expected?”

Likewise even the best of models in photographs get “touched up” to remove small oft unimportant marks, blemishes and imperfections.

Likewise you can get apps for your phone that can smooth lines, slim things down and generally make someone look not just more attractive, but younger or less stressed or more confident.

They are all deliberate and willful deception, as technically they are all some form of “misrepresentation or fraud”, but does anyone actually care?

More and more I see “Shock Horror XXX is YYY” where YYY is almost “click-baity” to push product under eyeballs (See UK Daily Mail newspaper as a repeat offender of this behaviour).

Societally we have “white lies” that is “little untruths” such as answers to the age old “Do stripes make me look fat?”. Where the answer being sort is almost certainly not the truth but some sign of comfort or demonstration of affection.

Lets be honest even going back to pre-Nixon times in the US lies were told about candidates to try and vilify them in others minds.

Thus should we really care that AI is just a logical progression of vilification and deception that’s more than a half century old?

Thus people should try to put themselves in effect a decade or so in the future and take a “looking back” point of view.

Will we see what is currently AI deception as just “part of the game” or something that “Should have been stamped out and obliterated”.

In Russia and other similar types of authoritarian political system where “the leader” had to be...
