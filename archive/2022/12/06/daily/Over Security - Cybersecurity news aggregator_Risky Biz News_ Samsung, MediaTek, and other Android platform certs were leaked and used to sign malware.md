Platform certificates from major Android vendors and software makers have leaked and were used to sign malware, the Android Security Team discovered last month.

Platform certificates are digital certificates used by Android OEMs and ODMs to sign versions of the Android OS they deploy on their devices, their firmware, and official vendor apps they might ship to consumers. Because of the crucial role they play, any Android app signed by a platform cert usually gets the highest level of trust and access to an Android device.

Last month, the Android Security Team [found](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/issues/detail?id=100) several malware samples in the wild that were signed by platform certificates used by major vendors like Samsung, LG, MediaTek, and Revoview.

Since discovering the incident, the Android Security Team said it worked with the affected companies to revoke and rotate the leaked platform certificates.

> "OEM partners promptly implemented mitigation measures as soon as we reported the key compromise. End users will be protected by user mitigations implemented by OEM partners. Google has implemented broad detections for the malware in Build Test Suite, which scans system images. Google Play Protect also detects the malware."

It's unknown if the platform certificates were hacked from the vendors' infrastructure or if they were leaked to a threat actor by malicious insiders. Google has asked vendors to launch internal investigations.

While malware signed using the leaked platform certs was spotted in the wild, Google said none was uploaded on the official Play Store.

In a [blog post](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/12/02/leaked-android-platform-certificates-create-risks-for-users/) last week, security firm Rapid7 said that while the use of certificates to sign malware is usually the sign of a state-sponsored threat group, the malicious apps that were signed in this incident are run-of-the-mill adware.

"This finding suggests that these platform certificates may have been widely available, as state-sponsored actors tend to be more subtle in their approach to highly privileged malware," said Rapid7's Erick Galinkin.

### Breaches and hacks

**Rackspace security incident:** Cloud hosting platform Rackspace took down its hosted Microsoft Exchange email server infrastructure following what the company described as a "[security incident](https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2)." The incident took place on Friday, December 2, and Rackspace was still working on restoring affected services at the time of this newsletter on Monday morning. No confirmation yet that this is a ransomware attack. British security researcher [Kevin Beaumont believes](https://doublepulsar.com/rackspace-cloud-office-suffers-security-breach-958e6c755d7f) Rackspace's Exchange servers were most likely hacked using the ProxyNotShell vulnerability.

**Accuro hack:** New Zealand health insurer Accuro [said](https://www.accuro.co.nz/about/news/temporary-outage/) that hackers gained access to its systems in a security incident last week. The company said that while it has no evidence that customer data was accessed, it can't rule out this possibility and urged users to be vigilant of possible fraud.

**Ankr crypto-heist:** Cryptocurrency platform Binance said it paused its integration with the Ankr DeFi protocol after an attacker used a [leaked Ankr platform developer key](https://archive.ph/e9m0B) and minted Binance BNB coins worth more than [$4 billion](https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1598495860739948544) in fiat currency. The attacker is believed to have stolen roughly [$5 million](https://tokenhell.com/unknown-hacker-makes-away-with-5-million-from-ankr-protocol/) worth of cryptocurrency before Binance stopped in to cut off their access, although it appears that Binance did manage to [freeze $3 million](https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1598575867311132673) of this.

**CoinTracker email leak:** Cryptocurrency wallet [CoinTracker said](https://archive.ph/UO1lG) that a compromise of one of its service providers exposed a list of customer emails and referral links. CoinTracker said no other personal data was exposed and that hackers did not gain access to any of its infrastructure.

**FBI investigating DraftKings credential stuffing incident:** ESPN is [reporting](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/35156137/source-fbi-investigating-cyberattack-online-sportsbooks) that the FBI is investigating the credential stuffing attack that hit sports betting platform DraftKings last month and following which hackers stole more than $300,000 from the company's customers. Rival sports betting platform FanDuel also reported a [spike in account takeover attacks](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/21/draftkings-says-no-evidence-systems-were-breached-following-report-of-a-hack.html) at the same time as the DraftKings incident.

**ARSAT incident:** ARSAT, an Argentinian state-owned terrestrial and satellite telecommunications provider, [said](https://archive.ph/hPLS1) it suffered a security breach of its corporate network. Although the incident took place right before the Argentina-vs-Poland World Cup soccer match, ARSAT said customer service was not disrupted by the attack.

**Beeline hack:** Hackers have leaked the personal information for thousands of Beeline employees. Beeline—one of Russia's largest mobile telecommunications providers—confirmed the leak to Russian news outlet [Vedomosti](https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2022/12/01/953164-informatsiya-bilaina-utekla). The hackers claimed they obtained the data after accessing one of the company's internal LDAP servers. The same group previously leaked data from other major Russian organizations, such as the Russian state-owned postal service, travel booking platform Tutu, delivery service DeliveryClub, and online learning platform GeekBrains.
