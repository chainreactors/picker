AntiVirus products are some of the most widely used security protection systems. They are deployed as one of the lines of defense on PCs, tablets, and smartphone devices for home and business use. Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses, hence the
name. However, with the proliferation of other malware, antivirus software started to protect itself from other computer threats. In particular, modern antivirus software can protect users from
malicious browser helper objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers,
backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraud tools, adware, and
spyware. Some products also include protection from other computer threats, such as infected
and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), online
banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT), and botnet
DDoS attacks.

AntiVirus products provide two major functionalities - **detection** (the main focus of many AntiVirus vendors, and **labeling** (a by-product of the function of malware detection). The labeling provided by AntiVirus vendors has many applications in cybersecurity such as guiding efforts of disinfection
and countermeasures, intelligence gathering, and attack attribution, among others.  Furthermore, researchers rely on AV labels to establish a ground truth baseline to compare their detection and classification algorithms.

# Malware Detection Techniques

AntiVirus software uses multiple techniques to detect malware, each targeting different aspects of malicious behavior or characteristics. Some of these techniques are discussed in this section.

### Signature-Based Detection

A signature refers to a string of data or algorithms that is used to uniquely identify malware. The antivirus program disassembles the code of the infected file and searches for the pattern that belongs to a malware family. Signatures of the malware are maintained in a database and then further used for comparison in the detection process. This kind of detection technique is also known as string or pattern scanning or matching. By checking a program or file against a list of malware signatures (or definitions), antivirus software can
determine if the program or file contains malware. Most antivirus and Internet security
programs reference a database of malware signatures when scanning files for malware. This is an
effective way to detect known malware. However, when new malware is created, antivirus
software may not recognize them. Therefore, most antivirus programs automatically update
the virus signatures from an online database regularly (such as once a week).

### Heuristics-Based Detection

This method aims at generic malware detection by statically examining files for suspicious characteristics without an exact signature match. Rather than relying
on signatures or binary or code fingerprints, heuristic detection relies on complex algorithms that check for instructions, and specify actual patterns and
behaviors within the application, which may indicate that it is malicious. This works because malicious programs inevitably attempt to perform actions in a context that legitimate applications do not. Examples of suspicious behavior would include attempting to
drop files or disguise processes injecting or executing code in another process’s memory space. Because heuristic detection
looks for behavioral characteristics rather than relying on simple pattern-matching, they can detect and block new and
emerging threats for which a signature or fingerprint has yet to be released.

The majority of heuristic detections temporarily delay applications from starting while the code is executed in a virtual environment that is completely
isolated – or sandboxed - from the endpoint. If no suspicious behavior is observed, the computer is instructed to start
the application normally. If suspicious behavior is observed, the program execution is blocked. The entire process happens in
milliseconds and so has practically no impact on either the user experience or perceived performance. However, this method can also generate false positive matches when antivirus software detects a program behaving similarly to a malicious
program and incorrectly identifies it as a virus. This method is also known as an anomaly detection technique.

### Machine Learning-Based Detection

This method uses Machine Learning Models trained on vast datasets of malware and legitimate files. These models can identify malicious files based on patterns in code, structure, and behavior that are too complex for traditional algorithms. Machine-learning algorithms significantly improve detection time for modern threats, as they can analyze large amounts of data
significantly faster than any human would. When trained to accurately detect various types of malware behavior, machine-learning
algorithms yield a high detection rate, both for known and unknown samples. Incorporating machine learning into both static
(file-based) and dynamic (behavior-based) malware analysis significantly accelerates reactions against new malware samples,
offering protection even from previously unknown threats – APTs, zero-day attacks, and ransomware.

Neural Networks are some
of the most popular implementations of machine learning algorithms that are designed to increase malware detection rates using
repeated training sessions on popular malware categories. Allowing these algorithms to extract features from existing malware
samples or families enables them to learn to predict future malware based on shared similar features.

### Cloud-Based Detection

This method identifies malware by collecting data from protected computers while analyzing it on the provider's infrastructure instead of performing the analysis locally. This is usually done by capturing relevant details about the application and the context of its execution on the endpoint and providing them to the cloud engine for processing. The local AntiVirus software only needs to perform minimal processing. The vendor's cloud engine can derive patterns related to malware characteristics and behavior by correlating data from multiple systems. Cloud-based detection offers up-to-the-minute protection and visibility across the global threat landscape. It provides global users with real-time protection as well as...
