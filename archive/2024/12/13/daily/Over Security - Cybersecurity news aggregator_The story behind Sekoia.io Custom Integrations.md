Since launching in 2017, Sekoia.io has made a name for itself with its groundbreaking vision in threat detection, leveraging advanced analytics and smart machine learning. But the journey does not end there! Sekoia.io is always growing and improving its services to stay ahead of new cyber threats. The story behind Sekoia.io Custom Integrations is a testament to this commitment.

Just like every R&D team in the competitive world of cybersecurity, the folks at Sekoia.io are always finding new ways to work smarter and stay on top. Our Tech teams are constantly updating their methods to be more productive and keep our edge. Get ready to see creativity and teamwork in action as we come together to take on challenges and secure our digital future!

## How it started

For the past few years, [Sekoia.io](http://Sekoia.io)‚Äòs CTPO Georges Bossert, has brought the Technology and Product teams together for a special event away from our day-to-day workdesks. This exciting gathering, known as the ‚ÄúHackathon,‚Äù is a chance for our teams to dive deep and tackle a single feature from start to finish, all in just 72 hours!

This year, Head of Engineering Ga√´l Muller took up the challenge and set a bold goal: to **empower our customers to manage their private apps right within the Sekoia SOC platform**. The objective? To transform [Sekoia.io](http://sekoia.io/) into the best integration store on the market! It is all about teamwork, creativity, and making big ideas happen in a short timeframe.

## How it went

This year‚Äôs Hackathon welcomed 23 enthusiastic Sekoians from the Infrastructure, Integration, Engineering, Design, and Product teams to the stunning setting of **Perros-Guirec,** in French Britanny ‚ú® for four days and three nights filled with creativity, collaboration and (lots of) fun. Despite a rainy start, spirits were high as we officially kicked off the event!

The teams quickly dove into brainstorming sessions, tackling their unique challenges with gusto. Designers guided Front-End developers through initial versions of the Figma designs, while Back-End and Integration developers gathered upstairs to sketch out the high-level architecture and nail down the technical details of the solution. In another cozy living room, the Infrastructure team and our CISO mulled over the essential security features needed for our customers to sync and execute their own code on our platform. It is a tall order, but at [Sekoia.io](http://Sekoia.io), we thrive on challenges, especially when it comes to security‚Äî it is in our DNA!

As the day wrapped-up, the energy had not left the teams who were now up to prepare the stage for the evening. Homemade dinner was being cooked while karaoke stage was being set-up. Board games, console challenges, and lots of laughs gave the pace for an evening where the most courageous went for a moonlight swim in the freezing sea.

**The Hackathon success is also about the self-organized and managed spirit.**

Day two flew by in a flash! Everyone was laser-focused on their tasks, with Pull Requests merging at lightning speed. The rhythmic sound of fingers dancing over keyboards punctuated by periodic stand-up meetings kept the energy alive as teams celebrated their progress. With no major issues arising, confidence and excitement were palpable in the air.

As we hit the halfway point of the Hackathon, it was time to take a breather and soak in the breathtaking views of the ‚Äúsentier des douaniers‚Äù (the old customs trail, the perfect hike all along French coasts ü•æ). An ideal way to recharge for the challenges ahead!

Day three of the Hackathon is here, bringing a mix of anticipation and nerves! This is the day where everything comes together, and the success of the event truly hangs in the balance.

Despite some dark circles under their eyes, the team is fueled by copious amounts of coffee and delicious crepes, lifting the spirits that have been high since day one. All eyes are on the Frontend team as excitement builds: yesterday, their new page went live in the test system, and each refresh reveals new pieces coming to life in the browser!

Designers are excitedly preparing for an afternoon session where they will present the feature to a select group of customers. These lucky testers will get the first look at the new interface and provide crucial feedback that will help us validate our product hypotheses and uncover any dark spots. To guide us through this process, we are leveraging a tool called MAZE, which makes navigating user testing a breeze! After all, with such an aMAZIng team, we are determined to ensure our users do not get lost in the maze but instead find our new feature easily and intuitively!

As the first stand-up of the day rolls around, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. There are no surprises; we are right on track! The adjustments continue throughout the afternoon, with the energy and creativity still flowi...
