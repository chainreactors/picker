# Weekly Update 336

26 February 2023

Hey, it's double-Troy! I'm playing with the Insta360 Link cam, a gimbal-based model that can follow you around the room. It's tiny and pretty awesome for what it is, I'm doing some back-to-back with that and my usual Sony a6400 this week. A little note on that: during the live stream someone suggested there was some lag from that camera (very minor, they suggested), but others couldn't see it. I've just been watching a bit of the video while writing up this post and I reckon they're right. Try the 3:02 mark, for example, where on Insta360 Link I have my finger up but on the Sony a6400, I don't:

It's very minor, but it's just enough to notice. Anyway, see what you think, all that a much more in weekly update 336:
