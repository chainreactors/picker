Our team has worked for more than a year to develop the Mobile Development Kit for Windows, the framework that powers the SAP Service and Asset Manager application, and this is the first native Windows application developed using the cross-platform MDK.

This has been a true collaboration between design and engineering colleagues within our team and across SAP; working in parallel to design the first version of Fiori for Windows while implementing the native Windows components with an SAP look and experience.

We are pleased to share it with you.
