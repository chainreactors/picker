# Arizona Municipality Chooses Secureworks Taegis for a Game-Changing MDR Experience

When population growth coincided with rising threats, CISO Tony Bryson knew it was time to bring in security reinforcements — hear why this Taegis Titan CISO chose Secureworks

[Stacy Leidwinger](/author/Stacy-Leidwinger)

February 23, 2023

With cyber threats on the rise and a limited team, Tony Bryson, CISO for the town of Gilbert, Ariz. recognized that their approach to cybersecurity needed to change. As the fifth largest municipality in the state of Arizona, the town had experienced tremendous growth over the past decade with a population topping 277,000 people.

Over the years, the municipality had made strides to improve their security with point solutions from various vendors, but now Bryson had his attention focused on a more holistic solution that could pull these point solutions together to give greater visibility around where threats might be lingering and enable rapid action.

He wanted a managed solution built on extended detection and response (XDR) technology that could unify his view across specific point solutions and maximize his current investments, and he found what he needed in Secureworks Taegis™ ManagedXDR, a managed detection and response (MDR) offering built on a robust XDR platform. It’s this forward-thinking, proactive approach to cybersecurity that earns Bryson the title of Taegis Titan.

**Q1. What was the deciding factor in choosing Secureworks Taegis ManagedXDR?**

A1. The real-time monitoring is a very important thing that we could get from Taegis, but I would say what really made us make the jump to Taegis was the fact we would actually get real-time mitigation strategies that could be implemented. We can work with the Secureworks SOC to identify which playbooks get enacted, and what mitigation strategies Secureworks can take on our behalf.

**Q2: How has choosing this solution lead to savings in workforce costs?**

A2. We have a very small team supporting our municipality. We are able to keep our town safe from cyber threats with a small team because of the additional scale and support that Secureworks gives us. Taegis ManagedXDR is a force multiplier for us. For us to get this type of coverage and support without Taegis ManagedXDR, we would have to add eight to a dozen experienced security resources internally. For us, that’s a massive savings in workforce costs while increasing our level of security.

**Q3. How has the expert-led, proactive threat hunts complemented your proactive approach to cybersecurity?**

A3. We needed to find a better way to implement proactive security measures, not just reactive. The fact that we were able to get threat hunting as part of the solution, and not have to go invest in a different third-party service to perform the proactive threat hunts, increases the value of Secureworks going beyond just a monitoring service.
