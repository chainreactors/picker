# Google Chrome AI extensions deliver info-stealing malware in broad attack

Posted: January 9, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

Small businesses and boutique organizations should use caution when leaning on browser-friendly [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) tools to generate ideas, content, and marketing copy, as a set of Google Chrome extensions were recently compromised to deliver info-stealing [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) disguised as legitimate updates.

Analyzed by researchers at Extension Total, the cybercriminal campaign has managed to take over the accounts of at least 36 Google Chrome extensions that provide AI and [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) services. The compromised extensions include “Bard AI Chat,” “ChatGPT for Google Meet,” “ChatGPT App,” “ChatGPT Quick Access,” “VPNCity,” “Internxt VPN,” [and more](https://www.extensiontotal.com/cyberhaven-incident-live), which are used by an estimated total of 2.6 million people.

Though these browser extensions borrow the names of the most popular AI tools available today, they are third-party tools that are not developed by Open AI—the company behind ChatGPT—or Google.

In response to the attack, many of the compromised browser extensions removed their tools from the Google Chrome web store to protect users. However, other extensions remain available and in the control of cybercriminals, making them dangerous to download.

There isn’t a startup, small business, or solo practitioner today who can run their operations without a web browser, and the most popular web browser in the world—[by far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers)—is Google Chrome.

But this cybercriminal campaign has not compromised Google Chrome itself.

Instead, it has compromised a series of extensions for Google Chrome that could prove attractive to many small businesses looking to harness AI, whether to write email newsletters, edit blogs, or even get ideas for marketing strategies in the new year. These third-party browser extensions, when they were still available, allowed users to directly ask questions to AI tools without needing to navigate away from a current web page.

But with the new attack, those same browser extensions are now delivering fraudulent updates that carry malicious code that can steal an employee’s data.

According to [an investigation published](https://www.cyberhaven.com/engineering-blog/cyberhavens-preliminary-analysis-of-the-recent-malicious-chrome-extension) by one of the compromised browser extension companies, the malware used in this attack sought data for Facebook Ads accounts. That may sound like a narrow goal, but considering that so many businesses rely on promotion and visibility through Facebook Ads, it isn’t uncommon that this information might be stored on an employee’s computer.

For a full list of compromised extensions, [visit here](https://www.extensiontotal.com/cyberhaven-incident-live).

Until fixes are released for every compromised extension, warn your employees about which browser extensions are safe to use, and consider creating a policy about only trusting first-party browser extensions for work.
