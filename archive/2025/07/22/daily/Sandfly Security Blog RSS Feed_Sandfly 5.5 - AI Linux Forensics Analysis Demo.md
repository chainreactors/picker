Sandfly 5.5 has powerful new AI integration to allow teams to quickly analyze Linux security events and forensics. This new feature brings an expert-level security analyst to your team using Sandfly's high quality agentless data.

In the video below, Sandfly founder Craig Rowland discusses the new feature and demonstrates how it works on a system infected with the BPFDoor malware.
