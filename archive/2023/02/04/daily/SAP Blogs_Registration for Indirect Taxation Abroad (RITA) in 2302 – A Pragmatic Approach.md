When SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2202 was released, we provided [a fairly extensive blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/03/31/registration-for-indirect-taxation-abroad-with-sap-s-4hana-cloud-2202/) about Registration for Indirect Taxation Abroad (RITA), letting you know what RITA is, how it basically works, and how it could benefit you.

Since then, we've added to our modest "RITA library" with an [OpenSAP Podcast](https://podcast.opensap.info/inside-sap/2022/09/21/inside-sap-s-4hana-episode-74-registration-of-indirect-taxation-abroad-with-sap-s-4hana-cloud-at-thevaluechain/) and some [additional content](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/25/rita-registration-for-indirect-taxation-abroad-more-than-just-a-nice-name/) explaining RITA in more detail.

We've also been fortunate enough to get quite a bit of feedback regarding RITA, and we want to take this post to address some recurring questions or points that are unclear.

This post covers five topics. First, we'll talk briefly about RITA for users with a Solution Builder landscape who will be doing the activation through the Manage Your Solution app. Second, we'll show you a different way to test RITA with minimal disruption when you're adapting your tax account determinations. Third, we'll quickly address activation in the CBC landscape. Fourth, we'll talk a bit more about the specific restrictions that are in place during your RITA migration, how they're resolved, and what system behavior you can expect in subsequent migrations. And fifth, we’ll provide some information about where RITA is available and in what constellations of reporting and company code countries/regions.

1. **Activating RITA via Manage Your Solution**

We want to make clear at the outset that anyone using SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, can certainly activate RITA (with SAP’s support) if it suits their business needs. You would do so primarily using the Manage Your Solution app in your system.

Have a look at the following graphic, which outlines the basic value proposition of RITA in the Solution Builder and CBC system landscapes:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Slide1.png)

Now, it's clear that right now, you can do more with RITA in the CBC landscape, but you nevertheless achieve substantial functionality with RITA in the Solution Builder landscape, right from the moment you activate the feature. The principal distinction is that CBC users can create a plant in a country/region that differs from the company code country/region (point 7), which in turn enables you to operate different end-to-end process-oriented solutions orchestrated by standard business processes (point 8). These additional capabilities are only available for customers taking part in the Early Adopter Care program. (For more information, please see [SAP Early Adopter Care](https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/2754).)

There is a way to achieve a similar outcome in the Solution Builder landscape: Let's assume you want to use RITA to run a sell from stock abroad process. On the sales order level, the country of the plant is defaulted to the tax reporting country, but this default value (tax\_country) can be overwritten using the value of the tax departure country from the sales order header. This change can be made manually or using a BAdI, but you need to be aware that changing this value in the header changes the value of the tax country for all items in that sales order. This may not always be your desired outcome. This workaround lets you bypass the "foreign plant problem" and still have your relevant postings recorded correctly, that is, with a tax country that differs from the company code country. But not only is it somewhat inelegant, it also puts you in a position where you need to have this workaround tested and validated by your tax experts, to make sure you're not creating any reporting errors.  (This, obviously, is not a recommendation; it's merely a recognition of what some customers are doing.) For more information, you should have a look at the following links for [the BAdIs](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4H...
