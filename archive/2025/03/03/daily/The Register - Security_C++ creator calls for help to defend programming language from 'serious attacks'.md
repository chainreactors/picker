## Bjarne Stroustrup wants standards body to respond to memory-safety push as Rust monsters lurk at the door

Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, has issued a call for the C++ community to defend the programming language, which has been shunned by cybersecurity agencies and technical experts in recent years for its memory safety shortcomings.

C and C++ are built around manual memory management, which can result in memory safety errors, such as out of bounds reads and writes, though both languages can be written and combined with tools and libraries to help minimize that risk. These sorts of bugs, when they do crop up, represent the [majority](https://www.memorysafety.org/docs/memory-safety/) of vulnerabilities in large codebases.

With the high-profile, financially damaging exploitation of these flaws, industry and government cybersecurity experts over the past three or four years have been discouraging the use of C and C++ while evangelizing languages with better memory safety, like Rust, Go, C#, Java, Swift, Python, and JavaScript.
