I've mentioned in a previous post that the product structure for SAP EHS will change in January and there will be a new product called Workplace Safety. This new product will be a consolidation of Incident Management, Health and Safety, and Management of Change. It will be available on premise, in a private cloud, and in the public cloud.

While it is planned to update all marketing and solution material based on the consolidation, I wanted to point you to key executive-level item to help introduce the Workplace Safety.

Here is the link to the new solution brief just released on sap.com.

Feedback welcome.

Thanks
