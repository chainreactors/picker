You arrive at the office, power up your system, and panic sets in. Every file is locked, and every system is frozen. A ransom demand flashes on your screen: "Pay $2 million in Bitcoin within 48 hours or lose everything."

And the worst part is that even after paying, there's no guarantee you'll get your data back. Many victims hand over the money, only to receive nothing in return, or worse, get hit again.

This isn't a rare case. Ransomware attacks are [crippling businesses](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interlock-ransomware-attack-analysis/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top3_ransomware&utm_content=blog&utm_term=060225) worldwide, from hospitals and banks to small companies. The only way to stop the damage is by proactively analyzing suspicious files and links before they can be executed.

Below, we break down the top three ransomware families active in 2025: LockBit, Lynx, and Virlock, and find out how interactive analysis helps businesses detect and stop them before it's too late.

## LockBit: Teasing a Comeback in 2025

LockBit is one of the most notorious ransomware groups, known for its highly efficient encryption, double extortion tactics, and ability to evade traditional security measures. Operating under a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)model, it enables affiliates to distribute the malware, leading to widespread attacks across various industries.

#### **Latest attacks and activity:**

* **London Drugs (May 2024):** LockBit targeted Canadian retailer London Drugs, forcing the closure of all its locations across Canada. Hackers demanded $25 million, leaking some employee data after the company refused to pay.
* **University Hospital Center, Zagreb (June 2024):** Disrupted Croatia's largest hospital, forcing staff to revert to manual operations while attackers claimed to have exfiltrated medical records.
* **Evolve Bank & Trust (June 2024):** Breached sensitive financial data, with hackers falsely claiming to have Federal Reserve information. The attack raised concerns due to Evolve's ties with major fintech firms.

#### **LockBit sample:**

Let's take a closer look at a LockBit ransomware sample inside ANY.RUN's secure sandbox to discover its key behaviors.

| File icons changed inside ANY.RUN sandbox |

Inside the Interactive Sandbox, we notice the first thing that stands out: file icons changing to the LockBit logo. This is an immediate sign of ransomware infection.

This is followed by a ransom note inside the sandbox, stating that your files have been stolen and encrypted. The message is clear: Pay the ransom, or the data will be published on a TOR website.

This type of analysis is important for businesses as it allows them to understand how ransomware spreads, identify weak points in their security, and take proactive steps to block similar threats before they cause financial and operational damage.

For a more in-depth breakdown of the attack tactics, you can also click on the ATT&CK button in the upper-right corner of the sandbox. This provides detailed insights into each tactic, helping teams fine-tune their defenses and strengthen response strategies.
