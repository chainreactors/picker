People who have fun at work are more likely to have a higher emotional quotient (EQ). The office air is filled with positive energy and people want to give their best to a task. Many types of research related to employee engagement have also iterated that employees who have a fun and supportive environment with social activities at regular intervals in a year are 30% more productive. All these concepts circle back to ‚ÄúAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy‚Äù.

We, at the CXS APM team had fun, learning, and engagement in the People Experience week (June 12-15, 2023). It was our time to thrive!
> ‚ÄúWe wanted to use the People Experience Week to create a sense of belonging - with the Scrum Team, Line of Business and SAP, through formal team workshops and informal fun activities.‚Äù - Mr. Dinesh Rao, Vice President

On the fun side, we had activities for people to try their luck at Tambola, scout the SAP Labs Bangalore campus for clues to seek a Treasure, indulge in delicious delicacies with the team at the Potluck and come together to celebrate the team with Indian ethnic wear.
> ‚ÄúThe People Experience week was engaging. I enjoyed both learning and fun activities. Especially, the amazing treasure hunt. We ran all over the campus to look for clues. I absolutely loved every moment of it.‚Äù - Mr. Muthu Hariharan, Developer

On the learning side, we had sessions such as focusing on test pyramid, planning for Q3 and the efforts involved, scalability and PERF, AUNITS, QUNITS, updating design artefacts and restructuring the application‚Äôs Wiki page, and onboarding new talents.
> ‚ÄúI was upset at the beginning that I could not be a part of the PX week in office due to a family reason. But the CXS APM team made sure that I did not feel left out and I could participate in most of the events from my home! Kudos to the effort." - Ms. Chetali Shah, Developer Associate

CXS APM team - PX week

The People Experience was a success, and the SAP Labs Bangalore campus was bustling with people and energy. Many employees made sure to be in office during this week. It was just like the pre-pandemic days!
