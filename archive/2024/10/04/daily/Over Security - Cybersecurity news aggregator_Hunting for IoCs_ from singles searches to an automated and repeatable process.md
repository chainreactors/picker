Understanding cyber threats is crucial for protecting your organisation from cybercriminal activities.

At Sekoia, we’ve embraced this by developing a comprehensive solution that combines [Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://www.sekoia.io/en/product/cti/) (The Sekoia Intelligence product) with our [detection platform](https://www.sekoia.io/en/product/xdr/), Sekoia Defend, into a single SaaS platform.

However, for CTI to be truly effective, it needs to be seamlessly integrated into your daily security operations. A key component of CTI is IoCs (Indicators of Compromise), which allow organizations to identify potential threats, hidden in their logs. Indicators of Compromise are aimed to be operationalized, meaning that organizations must leverage them in their day-to-day security operations. IoCs can be used for proactive detection or for looking at past presence of an indicator on the logs of the organization (retro hunting).

When based on accurate, relevant data, these practices significantly enhance threat detection, providing dynamic insights and valuable context to help analysts identify and understand the threats they face.

**Manually searching for IoCs is no longer sustainable**

While the concept of matching IoCs to detect malicious behavior seems simple, conducting this process at scale is a significant challenge.

Indeed, manually searching through logs and security events for thousands, or even millions, of Indicators of Compromise is a time-consuming and resource-intensive task.

Fortunately, solutions like Sekoia Defend are transforming how companies conduct IoCs hunting by automating and scaling these operations. This blog article explores the advantages of automated IoC hunting with Sekoia Defend and how it enables businesses to better defend against cyber threats.

## **How Sekoia can help you scale in IoC hunting and retro hunting**

Sekoia is redefining how companies approach IoC matching through its advanced Defend platform. Unlike traditional solutions that rely heavily on manual processes, Sekoia offers an automated and scalable way to match millions of IoCs in real time and retroactively.

Here’s how Sekoia magic works out:

**1 Benefit natively from Sekoia IoCs and avoid complex integration of third-party CTI**

First of all, IoC hunting requires IoCs. Sekoia eliminates the need for complex integrations and multiple licensing costs by including natively an access to our commercial-grade database of IoCs, curated and contextualized by our own CTI analysts.

We provide the detection engine AND the CTI.

*Sekoia Defend CTI database includes millions of IoCs from all type*

Sekoia Intelligence (CTI) contains a comprehensive list of contextualized IoCs, including IPs, URLs, domains names and file hashes, that is solely built to reinforce your detection capabilities and help you detect proactively cyber-threats. Each IoC is linked to the threat that it is representing. This context will benefit security analysts in their day to day operations and help them go faster in the qualification of eventual security incidents.

Eliminate the need for complex manual integrations operations of a CTI feed in your detection engine by having your CTI (IoCs included), directly in your detection platform.

**2 Automated IoCs detection at scale and without manual operations**

One of the most significant limitations of other SIEM and XDR solutions is to rely on manual processes for IoCs matching. Analysts are often burdened with sifting through large volumes of security logs and large volumes of IoCs, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

Quite often, one needs to select the proper IoCs to detect and build a dedicated search to look for IoCs in the logs coming from the organization. Such process can be complex and time-consuming.

Sekoia Defend eliminates this bottleneck by automating the detection of millions of IoCs across your entire in...
