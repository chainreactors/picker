## The state of MSP cybersecurity

As the attack surface gets [bigger and bigger for businesses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-insider/anatomy-of-an-external-attack-surface-2/the-global-attack-surface-may-be-bigger-than-most-think/), it’s become clear that Managed Service Providers (MSPs) need a solution that both grows their business and meets the security needs of their customers.

But there’s a problem.

Constrained staff resources, skyrocketing costs, and the complexities of managing multiple solutions all make it difficult for MSPs to adapt to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape, leading to lengthy incident response times and business inefficiencies that limit growth.

In fact, [Kaseya’s 2022 MSP Benchmark Survey](https://www.kaseya.com/resource/2022-msp-benchmark-survey-results/) shows that the second and third most common business challenges for MSPs right now are security and hiring, respectively.

* In 2022, **39 percent of all ransomware attacks targeted service providers**, followed by 12 percent for healthcare and 9 percent for the manufacturing industry.
* Many MSPs must support multiple tools in various environments with limited people. **Multiple licenses and vendors equals higher cost and less visibility.**
* MSPs need to maintain **multiple compliance requirements** for their customers, including HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

## Malwarebytes OneView

Enter Malwarebytes [OneView](https://www.malwarebytes.com/partners/managed-service-providers), a powerful and affordable security management platform that gives MSP security teams maximum control. For Value-added Resellers (VARs), Malwarebytes [Nebula](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/cloud) is the equivalent platform.

#### Precise, thorough remediation

As threats occur, OneView and Nebula offer intuitive and automated controls for rapid response powered by our award-winning Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology. We offer seven layers of protection, multi-mode isolation, 72-hour ransomware rollback, and more.

#### Single multi-tenant console

OneView’s multi-tenancy enables MSPs to streamline operations with centralized management of customer server and workstation endpoints, license subscriptions, reporting, and global policies.

#### Subscription management

Intuitive design in OneView allows MSPs to easily track and manage customer license subscriptions across sites and provide a higher level of service and attention.

#### Integrations

With native integrations into leading remote monitoring and management (RMM) and professional services automation (PSA) platforms, Malwarebytes OneView enables your MSP team to streamline operations.

## Constantly expanding

Malwarebytes has only continued to build upon both OneView for MSPs and Nebula for Value-Added Resellers (VARs), adding three new modules that simplify breach prevention within the same cloud interface MSPs already trust for detection and remediation:

#### Vulnerability and Patch Management

Enables MSPs to take control of their full vulnerability assessment and patching process, helping ensure defenses are up to date across their clients’ environments.

#### DNS Filtering

Regulate access to websites and other content on company-managed networks, which in turn reinforces the security of company data.

#### Application Block

Protects endpoints by preventing unauthorized software from executing across your clients’ sites.

For VARs, Malwarebytes Mobile Security is a new offering in Nebula which provides unified protection for Chromebooks, Android, and iOS mobile devices.

We plan to continue expanding OneView and Nebula with further product innovation, including adding more modules and in-platform integrations for OneView with other top remote monitoring and management (RMM) and professional services automation (PSA) platforms.

## Managed Detection And Response (MDR) For MSPs

Gartner reports that, by 2025, [50 percent of organizations will be using Managed Detection and Response (MDR)](https://www.alertlogic.com/resources/industry-reports/gartner-market-guide-for-managed-detection-and-response-services/?cq_cmp=13039017102&cq_con=138763518646&cq_term=&cq_med=&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_pos=&cq_plt=gp&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=MT%20-%20Nonbrand%20-%20Broad&utm_content=DSA%20-%20Gartner%20MDR%7C616114035010&utm_term=&_bt=616114035010&_bm=&_bn=g&gclid=Cj0KCQjw94WZBhDtARIsAKxWG-8kEGSxHW7BzVTaX5EatKGKk3idb5ltHIv2Rdhl_N29waTqMWTu3j0aAri3EALw_wcB) services for threat monitoring, detection, and response functions that offer threat containment capabilities.

In other words, [MDR is shaping out to be table stakes for any MSP provider](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/business/2022/09/3-ways-mdr-can-drive-business-growth-for-msps) in the coming years—but many MSPs lack staff or budget to build MDR programs in-house.

Launched last year, our purpose-built managed detection and response (MDR) offering for MSPs helps alleviate these challenges.
