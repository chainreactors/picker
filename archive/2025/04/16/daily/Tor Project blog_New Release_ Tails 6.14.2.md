# New Release: Tails 6.14.2

This release is an emergency release to fix security vulnerabilities in the
Linux kernel and the implementation of the Perl programming language.

## Changes and updates

* Update *Linux* to 6.1.133, which fixes [multiple security vulnerabilities](https://www.debian.org/security/2025/dsa-5900-1) that may lead to a privilege escalation or information leaks.
* Update *perl* to 5.36.0-7+deb12u2, which fixes a [heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability](https://www.debian.org/security/2025/dsa-5902-1), which may result in denial of service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

For more details, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).

## Get Tails 6.14.2

### To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

* Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 6.0 or later to 6.14.2.
* If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an automatic upgrade, please try to do a [manual upgrade](https://tails.net/doc/upgrade/#manual).

### To install Tails 6.14.2 on a new USB stick

Follow our installation instructions:

* [Install from Windows](https://tails.net/install/windows/)
* [Install from macOS](https://tails.net/install/mac/)
* [Install from Linux](https://tails.net/install/linux/)
* [Install from Debian or Ubuntu using the command line and GnuPG](https://tails.net/install/expert/)

The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if you install instead of
upgrading.

### To download only

If you don't need installation or upgrade instructions, you can download Tails
6.14.2 directly:

* [For USB sticks (USB image)](https://tails.net/install/download/)
