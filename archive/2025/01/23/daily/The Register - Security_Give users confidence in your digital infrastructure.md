# Give users confidence in your digital infrastructure

## Why Digital Trust and crypto-agility are essential to authentication and data security

Sponsored Post Research firm IDC estimates that over 53 percent of organizations are now mostly or completely digital native.

It's a situation that brings considerable advantages but also challenges in safeguarding the high volumes of sensitive data which constantly traverse multiple on- and off-premises locations and end user devices. The good news is that those challenges could be solved with crypto-agility, automation, and quantum-safe encryption.

You can find out more by tuning in to this [webinar](https://digicert.ondemand.goldcast.io/on-demand/35f1acde-9c7c-4425-8302-f871df11f7c8) where you'll hear Jennifer Glenn, Research Director for the IDC Security and Trust Group at IDC, in discussion with Senior Director and Digital Trust Specialist at DigiCert Dean Coclin. Jennifer and Dean explore IDC's recently published white paper – 'The evolution of Digital Business' – and consider how best to manage data security across the multiple, different types of connections used by the average enterprise.
