The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has [officially launched](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-establishes-ransomware-vulnerability-warning-pilot-program) this week the [Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/Ransomware-Vulnerability-Warning-Pilot) (RVWP) program.

CISA says this new program will have two main tasks. The first is to proactively scan the networks of critical infrastructure entities in order to identify systems that are vulnerable to common entry vectors used by ransomware gangs.

The second is for CISA to notify companies of their exposure and help secure vulnerable systems before they get hacked. CISA says the notifications will be made by regional staff members, either by email or phone call.

Although they announced it this week, the agency says the new RVWP program already started operations on January 30 this year.

CISA launched the RVWP program under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA), which President Biden signed into law in March 2022.

On a personal note/advice, while RVWP is an admirable attempt to boost security across US critical sector companies, please don't cancel your vulnerability management licenses. It's not a panacea.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Euler Finance crypto-heist:** DeFi platform Euler Finance was hacked for $197 million worth of cryptocurrency assets after a threat actor exploited a vulnerability in its codebase. In a [post-mortem](https://medium.com/%40omniscia.io/euler-finance-incident-post-mortem-1ce077c28454) of the hack, Euler says the threat actor used a flash-loan attack and a bug in its donations feature to exfiltrate legitimate funds they loaned from the platform to an account they controlled. According to a blockchain investigator named [ZachXBT](https://archive.ph/7EVvh), the Euler exploiter is most likely a malicious entity and not a security researcher, as they also tried to exploit other platforms in the past months. The Euler hack ranks as the [26th](https://de.fi/rekt-database) largest cryptocurrency heist of all time.

**STALKER 2 extortion update:** In our [last edition](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-bec-loses-top-spot), we covered how a Russian hacker was trying to extort Ukrainian gaming company GSC Game World, threatening to leak content from its upcoming game unless the company apologized to Russians and re-added its Russian language pack back to the game. Let's just say that GSC is [not having it](https://archive.ph/xF5dw), and they don't care about the hacker's threats since they have more important things to deal with, such as missile strikes from their "friendly neighbor.":

> "We are a Ukrainian company, and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile."

**Amazon Ring security incident:** The ALPHV (BlackCat) ransomware gang claims to have breached Ring, an Amazon-owned company that makes highly popular smart doorbells and security cameras. Amazon told *[Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjvd9q/ransomware-group-claims-hack-of-amazons-ring)* they have no evidence a ransomware attack took place, but the company did not rule out data theft and a possible subsequent extortion attempt.

**Marshall Amps ransomware incident:** The Black Basta ransomware gang has [taken credit](https://thecyberexpress.com/marshall-hacked-black-basta-ransomware-group/) for breaching the network of Marshall, a British musical instruments company mostly known for its electric guitar amps.

**Saint Kitts and Nevis ransomware incident:** The RansomHouse ransomware cartel has taken credit for an attack on the government of the Caribbean nation Saint Kitts and Nevis. This is the same ransomware gang that hit the Pacific state of Vanuatu in November of last year, an incident the country needed months to recover. Saint Kitts and Nevis officials have yet to confirm the incident.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Kali Linux Purple edition:** The Kali Linux project has released [Kali Purple](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/kali-purple/documentation/-/wikis/home), a version of the Kali Linux operating system that includes features and toolkits typically used by defensive security teams, also known as blue or purple teams. More than 100 defensive tools are included with the new Kali Purple distro, such as Elasticsearch SIEM, CyberChef, Suricata IDS, and more.

### **Government, politics, and policy**

**New UK National Protective Security Authority:** The UK government has [announced](https://www.mi5.gov.uk/news/new-body-will-help-the-uk-combat-national-security-threats) this week the creation of a new security agency. Named the [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk/) (NPSA), the agency will be tasked with helping UK businesses combat national security threats, such as state-sponsored attempts to steal their research and sensitive information. According to the UK government, the new NPSA will absorb the responsibilities of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, will operate under the MI5, and collaborate with the National Cyber Security Centre and the National Counter Terrorism Security Office.

**Russian to build GitHub alternative:** The Russian Ministry of Digital Development wants to use a reserve it created 16 years ago to fund a Russian source code hosting platform. To build its GitHub-like clone, the Russian government has chosen ANO Open S...
