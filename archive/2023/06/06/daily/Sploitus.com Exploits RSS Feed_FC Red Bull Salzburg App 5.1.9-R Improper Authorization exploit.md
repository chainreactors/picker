(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The "FC Red Bull Salzburg App" app for Android exposes an activity called
"at.redbullsalzburg.android.AppMode.Default.Splash.SplashActivity".

This activity aims to show the contents of a given URL within the app's context.
However, the app does not properly validate the URL and the intent's data URI,
which an unauthenticated attacker can abuse to load arbitrary contents into the
app by either tricking the user into opening a specifically crafted link or using
a malicious app on the same device.

The specific problem here is the assumed trust between the user having the app
installed and what the app is actually doing/displaying to the user. So if the
user sees the app being loaded and automatically redirecting to another page, it
can be assumed that the user also trusts the loaded page.

6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
There are two ways to exploit this vulnerability:

1. Via the app's custom URI scheme "fcrbs" followed by any arbitrary URL:
fcrbs://www.rcesecurity.com

2. Via an explicit intent invocation:
Intent i = new Intent();
i.setComponent(new ComponentName("laola.redbull", "at.redbullsalzburg.android.AppMode.Default.Splash.SplashActivity"));
i.setData(Uri.parse("https://www.rcesecurity.com"));
startActivity(i);

7. SOLUTION
===========
None. Uninstall the app.
