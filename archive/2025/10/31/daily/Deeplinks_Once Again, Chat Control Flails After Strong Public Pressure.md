The European Union Council [pushed for a dangerous plan](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0) to scan encrypted messages, and once again, people around the world loudly called out the risks, leading to the current Danish presidency [to withdraw the plan](https://www.euractiv.com/news/danish-presidency-backs-away-from-chat-control/).
