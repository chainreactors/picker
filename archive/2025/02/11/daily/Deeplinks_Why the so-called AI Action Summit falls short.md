Ever since Chat-GPT’s debut, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the center of worldwide discussions on the promises and perils of new technologies. This has spawned a flurry of debates on the governance and regulation of large language models and “generative” AI, which have, among others, resulted in the Biden administration’s [executive order on AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14110) and [international guiding principles](https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100573471.pdf) for the development of generative AI and influenced Europe’s [AI Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1689). As part of that global policy discussion, the UK government hosted the [AI Safety Summit in 2023](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2023/11/08/the-ai-safety-summit-and-its-critics-00126171), which was followed in 2024 by the [AI Seoul Summit](https://www.gov.uk/government/topical-events/ai-seoul-summit-2024), leading up to this year’s [AI Action Summit](https://www.elysee.fr/en/sommet-pour-l-action-sur-l-ia) hosted by France.

As heads of states and CEOs are heading to Paris for the AI Action Summit, the summit’s shortcomings are becoming glaringly obvious. The summit, which is hosted by the French government, has been [described](https://www.techuk.org/resource/ai-safety.html) as a “pivotal moment in shaping the future of artificial intelligence governance”. However, a closer look at its agenda and the voices it will amplify tells a different story.
