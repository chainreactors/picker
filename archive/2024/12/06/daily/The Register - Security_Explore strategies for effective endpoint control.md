Webinar Managing endpoints in today's dynamic IT environments is becoming increasingly complex.

With a growing number of devices and constant software updates, IT teams can find themselves overwhelmed by manual patching and vulnerability management processes. On [December 9th at 9am PT/12PM ET/6pm GMT](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32986/automating-endpoint-management), join The Register's Tim Phillips as he explores how automation is transforming endpoint management with Harman Kaur from Tanium.

Tim and Harman will address some of the challenges organizations face in endpoint management and discuss the extent to which automation can offer a scalable solution. Topics will include:

- **Tackling endpoint complexity**: Learn how modern IT environments, with diverse devices and frequent updates, create challenges that traditional tools struggle to handle.

- **Improving response times with automation**: Discover how automating routine tasks like patch management and vulnerability remediation can ensure endpoints remain protected without draining resources.

- **Adopting real-time endpoint solutions**: Explore how tools that provide instant visibility and control over your endpoints can simplify operations and strengthen security.

This session should prove useful for IT leaders looking to reduce operational overhead and improve their organization's security posture. By leveraging automation, you can focus on strategic initiatives instead of getting bogged down by repetitive tasks.

[Register for the webinar here](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32986/automating-endpoint-management) to learn how automation can help revolutionize endpoint management in your organization. Don't miss an opportunity to gain insights from industry experts and stay ahead in the evolving IT landscape.
