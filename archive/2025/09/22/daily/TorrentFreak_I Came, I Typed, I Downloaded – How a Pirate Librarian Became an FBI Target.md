# I Came, I Typed, I Downloaded – How a Pirate Librarian Became an FBI Target

Online piracy is in the midst of an identity crisis. Sites born with one name tend to discard them quite quickly, before adopting a series of others, hoping to stay one step ahead of the law. Site operators, meanwhile, no longer court the gaze of the media, certainly not under their real names while revealing their future piracy plans. In 2010, things were somewhat different; once considered a public good, sharing books today can trigger an FBI investigation.

In April 2011, a modest Russian‑language news portal, ‘bal‑con.ru’, ran an interview with two young entrepreneurs. The men were quietly working to solve a problem, identified by both as a barrier to book consumption in Russia.

“We found it strange that existing book websites on the Russian internet had plateaued at the level of the mid-20th century. They were incredibly inconvenient to use, requiring users to wade through vast lists of categories and authors,” the men complained.

“And yet, it was so tempting to just type the book you wanted into a search engine and download it immediately.”

## The Pieces Move Into Position

In early January 2010, ideas of how to fix these problems began to take shape. Suitable technology to conveniently search for books, especially in large expanding libraries, had yet to arrive. Then in the mid-2000s, convenient e-readers began to gain traction.

“Our country loves to read, and so the demand for such devices was quite substantial,” the entrepreneurs recalled.

In parallel, another important development was underway: mass digitization of all types of books and, crucially, improving availability online.

“Our old book websites weren’t ready for this. The information on the pages was so cluttered that finding the book you were looking for became quite problematic. Moreover, people were gradually becoming accustomed to the minimalist and user-friendly interfaces of popular search engines.

“So why not create a similar search engine, but for books? After all, users value their time above all else; they value results, not sifting through tables of contents and author lists.”

## I Came, I Typed, I Downloaded

The solutions to these problems, and others that would in time prove highly controversial, were built by the men and presented in a site known locally as Букфи. It had a simple but compelling USP.

“We will save the user from an unnecessary waste of time, giving him only what he wants – a link to the book,” the men recalled.

Who came up with the slogan “Пришел, набрал, скачал” (*loosely – I Came, I Typed, I Downloaded*) still isn’t clear but for those in search of books, Букфи did its best to provide the answers.

In the West, the answers were supplied in English on BookFinder (Bukfi), a site operating from a URL that will likely feel familiar to millions of modern-day book pirates even today. With Bookfi.org, the men would soon have an international hit on their hands.

## Living The Dream

“Bookfi.org is a free electronic library. We believe that books are the property of society, their access should not be limited,” the interviewer at [bal‑con.ru](http://literature.bal-con.ru/bookfi_org/) was informed.

“We want to create the largest library, both artistic and scientific, reference, and technical literature. To begin with, our library must be the largest in the Runet. Subsequently, we plan to expand and become the largest library on the Internet.”

After the men embarked on their quest, tracking developments became less straightforward.

Representing one half of the entrepreneurial duo, the fate of Vladislav Chikhira isn’t clear. But for his partner in crime – quite literally according to rapidly changing attitudes to piracy in the West – the impossible dream certainly wasn’t impossible, nor was it a typical dream. At times, in fact, it looked more like a nightmare.

As Bookfi developed and morphed this way and that, site variants including B-OK.org also made their mark on the growing and increasingly global ‘shadow library’ scene.

The impact of the variant known as Z-Library was huge; it would see the other half of the Bukfi duo, St. Petersburg resident Anton Napolsky, transformed from an eBook search problem-solver a decade or so earlier, into the prime target of an international manhunt led by the FBI.

## Z-Library: The End of the Beginning

The law enforcement operation against Z-Library, carried out by the Postal Inspection Service, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Justice, is well documented, at least up to a point. Around November 4, 2022, a [wave of suspensions](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/) targeted Z-Library’s domains, including the prominent z-lib.org, b-ok.org, and 3lib.net.

Within days the scale of the operation became more clear. Over 130 domains with [links to Z-Library](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-aftermath-reveals-that-the-feds-seized-dozens-of-domain-names-221107/) had been disabled; in time, the running total would exceed 350.

Meanwhile, news began to emerge of a lawsuit in the United States, [which accused two Russian nationals](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/) – Anton Napolsky and his partner Valeriia Ermakova – of criminal copyright infringement, wire fraud, and money laundering.

As previously reported, the alleged operators of Z-Library had already been arrested in Argentina, from where authorities in the United States planned to extradite them, ostensibly to stand trial in the criminal prosecution of Z-Library.

## From Little Acorns Mighty Disputes Grow

Even during the interview on April 4, 2011, signs of Bukfi’s upward trajectory were difficult to ignore. In the previous month alone, almost 19,000 additional titles were uploaded to the site. Official site stats reported 880,419 books, written by 124,539 authors, all available for free download.

While still a large collection, it was no match for the 12 million titles eventually boasted by Z-Library, the site born from Bukfi’s DNA. There’s no doubt the scale aggravated increasingly frustrated rightsholders, and fuelled the criminal prosecution in 2022, but perhaps surprisingly, relationships hadn’t always been so frosty.

In 2011, Chikhira and Napolsky revealed that their site was hosted in Amsterdam, with a nod towards the favorable legal environment of the day. Yet, copyright disputes were nearly always settled in favor of copyright holders, in part due to communication that aimed to solve their differences.

“With several publishers and rights owners, we have established friendly relations, which allows us to put popular books on the si...
