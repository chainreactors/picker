As the last and final step of our journey to process analytics blog post series we are looking into process governance and its impact for your operational and more importantly customer excellence. Earlier this year we started looking into [10 steps for successful journey to process analytics](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/12/10-steps-for-successful-journey-to-process-analytics-bringing-together-the-worlds-of-process-analysis-and-design-and-experience/).

Today’s process and journey professionals are challenged with focusing on people experience including customers, employees and suppliers and govern enterprise process management activities, managing process lifecycles and ensuring that processes are reviewed regularly – while establishing process ownership and automation potential within the organization. Although the concept may initially appear to be complex, some structured steps can significantly increase inherent simplicity. Please continue reading for a deeper understanding.

The key components of process governance include the following:

* Defining critical business processes

* Establishing roles and responsibilities

* Implementing the right technology for monitoring and improving processes

* Engaging with stakeholders

* Continuously reviewing and updating processes

Overall, these key components can help ensure that an organization's business processes are aligned with its strategic goals and objectives. They allow a consistent and efficient process execution and free up resources to elevate customer centricity by including experience-driven analytics and mining results.

## Defining critical business processes

The definition of critical business processes involves identifying the specific processes and journeys that are critical to the organization's success and defining them in clear and specific terms. Critical business processes are the most essential activities that a company must carry out to operate effectively and achieve its goals. These processes often involve the management of key resources such as financial assets, human capital, and information, and are typically vital to the overall success of the organization. Examples of critical business processes include inventory management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management which ideally includes experience-driven process and journey analysis. Ensuring the smooth and efficient functioning of these processes, resulting in end-to-end customer journeys is crucial for a business to survive and thrive in today's competitive marketplace. Therefore, it is important for companies to carefully design and continually review and optimize their critical business processes to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive.

The definition of these processes is a key management task, but all critical processes and journeys should be mapped and modeled based on common standards within a process management solution. We shared best practices in step 4 ([better model customer journeys](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/29/whats-in-a-successful-journey-leverage-journey-modeling-to-achieve-process-and-experience-excellence-at-scale/)) and step 5 ([better model your business processes)](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/10/5-reasons-why-process-modeling-is-the-operational-backbone-of-your-journey-to-process-analytics-initiatives/) within our blog post series.

## Establishing roles and responsibilities

This involves defining the specific individuals or teams who are responsible for each process or journey, as well as their specific responsibilities and authority. In between process management solution administrators, process and journey owners, collaborators and business users, roles and responsibilities must be defined and documented clearly. A clear access strategy based on need-to-know-principle is industry best practice and can be taken one step further with role-based dashboards. Enterprise process management solutions offer options for process administrators to create dashboards tailored to specific user groups or roles.

Process and journey modelers can be provided with specific insights to their roles helping them to understand process performance and people experience better. We recommend adding journey experts as part of the diagram approval workflow to add their review based on customer, employees, and supplier experience.

## Implementing the right technology for monitoring and improving processes

Choosing the right technology is highly influenced by your business goals and transformation targets but it should include setting performance metrics and regularly reviewing and analyzing data to identify opportunities for improvement. Both operational and customer excellence should be included into the journey and process performance analysis to not only achieve best practice, but also to have your customers choose you over other options in your market. It also involves conducting regular audits to ensure that processes are being executed in accordance with established stan...
