# Display all images from an online repository

Hello everyone

Sorry if my question is unfit, but in short, I've this weird question from an online test for which I now have the answer, but not the explanation.

The question presents me an online repository with 100 images which are all supposed to be encrypted. I'm asked to find where is the rendez-vous point and what encryption mode was used.
Here's the repository/folder: <https://epreuves.pix.fr/message-chiffre/message-chiffre.html?mode=e>

The answer are "Restaurant" and "ECB". Indeed, some images clearly reads "Rendez-vous at the restaurant" and they all have "ECB" in their name. There always seems to be 4 of such images, randomly distributed among the 100 images everytime the page is refreshed, so sometimes they are at the very end of the list.

Hence my problem: I don't understand \*how\* I'm supposed to be able in 5 minutes to open all the images in another tab, check them, find on with the message, and understand it's "encrypted" in ECB.
Images cannot be downloaded as far as I know, so I'm trying to display them quickly one way or another. So I could see a snapshot of the pictures and find more easily.

The method to answer might be completly different, maybe there's is something in the inspector allowing to get such information, or a knowledge to have about the ecryptions methods that's supposed to lead me to find it has to be an ECB and then check for ECB pictures, but really, I have no idea, and the explanation they offered is simply a link to a video explaining ECB.

EDIT: for further context

The test is online, but passed in an actual room on given computers. Some questions might allow you to exit webpage, but obviously

This question is part of a certificate centered around digital usages. There are 16 skills which you can train on a online platform, they go from sending a mail, to finding a specific file in folder, sort data in a .ods file, code in HTML/CSS... The more you train, the more you level up in the skill, the more the questions get hard. Once you feel ready, you can register for a live session to pass a test which uses your levels on the online platform to send you questions that are similar to what you did already. This is a level 5 question and is supposed to be between intermediate/advanced level, since it goes up to level 7 (and soon 8).

So, I'm supposed to be able to do this, I just don't know how, and the only explanation I'm offered by the platform is a video about ECB. Since the message is actually visible on the picture, I was looking for a way to visualize the images since I believe this is what is expected from me.

A "similar" question I just saw is actually the same, but the answer differs: the rendez-vous point is at the backery. So I might just CTRL+F in the folder and look for ECB file and open a random one, but next time the encryption mode by be different too. Or not, maybe the question is actually centered about a knowledge around the ECB that should point at looking for a file with ECB in the name (since it's given in the names), which would explain the video, though the video didn't help me much.

Also, it might be possible that the question is badly designed.
