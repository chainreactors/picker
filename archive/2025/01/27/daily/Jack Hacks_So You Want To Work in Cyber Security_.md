It goes without saying that being a Professional Penetration Tester is *considered* to be one of the “cooler” jobs in InfoSec. I mean, let’s be honest here - who wouldn’t want to break into buildings, and hack companies like Elliot from [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot), or carry out crazy hacks against banks and casinos like in the [Oceans Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_%28film_series%29), all while doing it legally?

While it might seem that being a hacker for hire is all fun and games after watching a ton of episodes of Mr. Robot - which it is - it also has its downsides like every other job.

Working as a security consultant, I get asked a lot of questions on how to break into security or penetration testing, and what skills one must need to achieve such a job. Unfortunately, a lot of those asking me these questions are hoping for a “**one shot solution**” such as *“If you learn this and this you’ll be golden!”* Unfortunately, and I hate to break it to you, it really isn’t that easy….

* First of all, to work in Security you need to be willing to continuously learn new things on the fly and or quickly at home.
* Secondly, you need to have a strong foundational understanding of network and web security, as well as an understanding of at least one coding and scripting language.
* Third of all, you need to have decent soft skills - ones that will allow you to communicate with your team and clients, and ones that will allow you to write professional reports.
* Fourth of all, you need to be willing to accept the fact that sometimes the work or projects you’ll be doing will be boring or repetitive.

> **NOTE**: Before you continue reading, take note of this. The previous iteration of this blog post has been active since 2018 and has been widely shared in the security community to many beginners. A lot has changed in security since then, including my knowledge. As such, I have opted to re-write a good chunk of the blog post in order to ensure that it’s up to date with today’s standards, and that it answers many questions that beginners have. This post is specifically focused around becoming a pentester, but whether you’re going into defense or offense, the advice given here applies to everyone.

> One thing I want to highlight prior to this post is… don’t be discouraged when you don’t get a security position fresh out of college or when transitioning from another field. This field has advanced so far and so fast that you seriously need to have a solid understanding of fundamentals and core technical concepts to stand a chance.

> I’ve said this before and I will say it again - **SECURITY IS NOT AN ENTRY LEVEL FIELD**! You can call me a gatekeeper, or whatever, but I’m just being realistic. It will take a lot of time and dedication to break into security if you have little to no experience, but I do hope this blog will help point you in the right direction and help you achieve your goals.

With that being said, let’s get into the nitty gritty details of breaking into security!

## Understanding The Fundamentals

Before we dive into the technical skills required to be a successful pentester or even have a successful security career, it’s crucial to first cover the most important aspect of security: **the fundamentals**.

No matter how sophisticated the tools and techniques at your disposal may be, without a solid understanding of the fundamentals of computers and security, you won’t be able to effectively analyze, attack or even defend systems. The fundamentals form the foundation upon which all technical knowledge is built. Mastering these principles ensures that you can approach each task you do with a clear understanding of why certain actions are necessary and how they impact the security landscape as a whole. Essentially, if you deeply understand a specific technology and how it works, it’s so much easier to attack and defend that technology than if you scraped the surface by learning the most common misconfigurations and exploits.

Let’s first start by covering the essential skills that you need to understand. These fundamental skills will serve as the foundation for a successful career in security.

So what are these “core fundamentals” that everyone in security should know?

* **Networking**
  + **IP Addresses**: Understand both IPv4 and IPv6 and how they are used.
  + **Ports**: Understand common ports and the services they correspond to (HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, etc.).
  + **CIDR Notation**: Understand how to define and calculate network ranges using CIDR.
  + **TCP/IP Stack**: Understand the layers in the TCP/IP model as well as how and what type of data flows through each layer.
  + **Subnetting**: Understand how to divide networks into smaller subnets and calculate network masks.
  + **DNS**: Understand how the Domain Name System works by knowing how domain names are resolved into IP addresses and vice versa.
  + **Routing, Switching, and Firewalls**: Understand how routers and switches work to direct network traffic and how firewalls (and VLANS) are used to isolate traffic.
* **Encryption and Cryptography**:
  + **Basic Cryptography**: Understand the difference between symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption, know what hashing is, and what Diffie-Hellman is.
  + **SSL/TLS**: Understand how SSL/TLS work and how they are used to encrypt network traffic.
  + **Common Algorithms**: Become familiar with common encryption algorithms like AES, RC4, RSA, and hashing algorithms such as SHA1, and MD5.
* **Operating System Knowledge**:
  + **Windows Internals**: Understand the basics like file systems, user accounts, the registry, event logs, kernel, userland, and basics around process and memory management.
  + **Linux Internals**: Become familiar with the file system structure, user permissions, processes, and simple things like daemons.
  + **Command Line Proficiency**: Become familiar with system commands and learn how to use the Windows Command Prompt and Linux Bash Terminal.
* **Web Applications**:
  + **Basics**: Understand HTTP/HTTPS, request-response cycles, REST APIs, and common web architectures.
  + **Session Management**: Understand how sessions are managed, including cookies, tokens, and secure session handling.
  + **Backend Basics**: Understand a common web application stack, and how data is handled on the backend of the application via technologies like SQL.
* **Active Directory**:
  + **Directory Structure**: Understand the organizational structure of Active Directory (AD), such as domains, forests, and organizational units (OUs).
  + **User and Group Management**: Understand how users accounts and groups are managed, and understand the basic permissions within AD.
  + **Authentication Protocols**: Become familiar with and understand how NTLM and Kerberos works, and how they are used to authenticate users.
* **Basic Malware and Threats**:
  + **Malware Types**: Understand the different types of malware such as viruses, worms, ransomware, rootkits, and how they can infect systems.
  + **Threat Vectors**: Understand the different threat vectors and attack types such as phishing, social engineering, impersonation, etc.
* **Common Attacks and Vulnerabilities**...
