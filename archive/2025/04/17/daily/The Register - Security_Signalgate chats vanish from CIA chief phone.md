## Extraordinary rendition of data, or just dropped it out of a helicopter?

CIA Director John Ratcliffe's smartphone has almost no trace left of the infamous Signalgate chat – the one in which he and other top US national security officials discussed a secret upcoming military operation in a group Signal conversation a journalist was inadvertently added to.

That's according to the spy agency's own chief data officer Hurley Blankenship, who was tasked with preserving the [group chat](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/24/signal_atlantic_security_disaster/) on his boss's phone after a judge demanded the messages be retained.

Non-profit American Oversight had asked James Boasberg, Washington DC's chief federal district judge, to make that order as part of [its lawsuit](https://americanoversight.org/litigation/american-oversight-v-hegseth-gabbard-ratcliffe-bessent-rubio-and-nara-regarding-military-actions-planned-on-signal-messaging-app/) against those officials as well as the government: The independent watchdog claims Team Trump broke federal record-keeping rules by discussing military plans on the app and setting at least some of the messages to auto-delete.
