## Using LLMs to pick programs, people, contracts to cut is bad enough – but doing it with Musk's Grok? Yikes

Updated A group of 48 House Democrats is concerned that Elon Musk's cost-trimmers at DOGE are being careless in their use of AI to help figure out where to slash, creating security risks and giving the oligarch's artificial intelligence lab an inside track to train its models on government info.

Led by Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA), Mike Levin (D-CA), and Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), the Dems wrote a [stern letter](https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=6476) to the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB), saying that [DOGE](https://search.theregister.com/?q=DOGE)'s reported use of AI runs afoul of several federal laws and the OMB's own AI directives, and is unlikely to be in compliance with [FedRAMP standards](https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5/cloud-service-providers/) for cloud software security.

Beyond that, the Reps believe Musk, who as well as SpaceX and Tesla runs [OpenAI rival xAI](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/31/xai_acquires_x/), is self-dealing by using his own Grok-2 AI model to ingest government data.
