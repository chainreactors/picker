# FBI Seizes Gaming Piracy Domains Including ‘Pre-Release’ Target NSW2U

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has seized the domain names of several gaming-related pirate sites, including NSW2U.com, which has been Nintendo's nemesis for years. The operation was carried out in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, including the Dutch fiscal police. It is not immediately clear whether the action is linked to any arrests or indictments.

Nintendo and other gaming companies are doing everything in their power to stop the public from playing pirated games.

This includes sending a steady stream of cease-and-desist notices, as well as filing lawsuits. And in some rare cases, law enforcement agencies are stepping up to help.

## Feds Seize Gaming Piracy Domains

Today, [the FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/services) seized several domain names linked to well-known game piracy websites, including NSW2U.com, Game-2u.com, Bigngame.com, and ps4pkg.com. Instead of an overview of pirated games, visitors are now greeted with a domain seizure banner.

“This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 2323 issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia as part of a law enforcement operation and action,” the banner reads.

The action was carried out by the FBI in collaboration with the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service ([FIOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_Information_and_Investigation_Service)). To effectively seize the domain names, the nameservers were updated to point to fbi.seized.gov, which has been used for similar interventions in the past.

The domains in question are known pirate sites and NSW2U.com was listed as a [notorious pirate site](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-trade-representative-lists-the-most-notorious-piracy-threats-250108/) by the U.S. Trade Representative at the beginning of the year, with the other three targeted domains receiving a mention as “related sites.”

*From USTR’s January 2025 report*

![ustr comment](https://torrentfreak.com/images/NSW2U.jpg)

The USTR typically relies on rightsholders for input, and in this case, the Entertainment Software Association ([ESA](https://www.theesa.com/)) explicitly connected these domains. In their recommendation, ESA mentioned that NSW2U links to game-2u.com, ps4pkg.com, and BigNGame.com, which also make various pirated games available.

The connection between the domains isn’t far-fetched, as some of the links were part of the navigational structure of the site. NSW2U is mainly focused on Nintendo Switch releases, and it connected visitors to the other domains that specialized in other platforms.

## Pre-Release Link

According to the software association, which represents Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, NSW2U offered thousands of links to pirated games. These included many high-profile titles that leaked before their official release dates.

“This ‘pre-release’ piracy is particularly harmful to ESA member companies because it allows site users to download a pirated copy of a video game before consumers have the opportunity to choose to buy a lawful copy,” ESA wrote in its recommendation.

To our knowledge, none of the agencies involved has publicly confirmed or commented on the matter yet. In the past, similar seizures have resulted in arrests and indictments, [as in the case of Z-Library](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/), for example. However, this is not always the case, as last year’s [StreamEast seizures](https://torrentfreak.com/feds-seize-domain-names-of-sports-streaming-site-streameast-240819/) took place without any additional public action.

It’s also possible that more seizures will follow in the coming hours or days. If that happens, or if any new information becomes available, we will update this article accordingly.

**Update:** these domain names were also seized: mgnetu.com, nsw2u.com and nswdl.com.

**Update:** Another domain was added, ps5pkg.net.
