# “A dare, a challenge, a bit of fun:” Children are hacking their own schools’ systems, says study

Posted: September 16, 2025

As if ransomware wasn’t enough of a security problem for the sector, educational institutions also need to worry about their own students, a recent study shows.

Last week, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) published a report about the “[insider threat of students”](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/09/insider-threat-of-students-leading-to-increasing-number-of-cyber-attacks-in-schools). Here are a few key points:

* Over half of school insider cyberattacks were caused by students.
* Almost a third of insider attack incidents caused by students involved guessing weak passwords or finding them jotted down on bits of paper.
* Teen hackers are not breaking in, they are logging in.

The conclusion of the ICO is that:

> “Children are hacking into their schools’ computer systems – and it may set them up for a life of cyber crime.”

The ICO examined a total of 215 personal data breach reports caused by insider attacks from the education sector between January 2022 and August 2024. They found that students were responsible for 57% of them, and that students covered 97% of the incidents that were caused by stolen login details.

The British National Crime Agency (NCA) [reported](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/one-in-five-children-found-to-engage-in-illegal-activity-online) about a survey of children aged 10-16 which showed that 20% engage in behaviors that violate the Computer Misuse Act, which criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems and data. It adds a warning:

> “The consequences of committing Computer Misuse Act offences are serious. In addition to being arrested and potentially given a criminal record, those caught can have their phone or computer taken away from them, risk expulsion from school, and face limits on their internet use, career opportunities and international travel.”

The reasons that children provided for hacking included dares, notoriety, financial gain, revenge and rivalries. Security experts also [mention](https://www.darkreading.com/insider-threats/students-inside-threat-education-sector) cases of students altering grades or using staff credentials.

While the ICO report highlights a troubling trend in the UK, US data shows it faces similar problems. A March 2025 [Center for Internet Security survey](https://learn.cisecurity.org/2025-k12-cybersecurity-report-download) found 82% of K-12 schools experienced a cyber incident between July 2023 and December 2024, and security analysts say [students p](https://www.darkreading.com/insider-threats/students-inside-threat-education-sector)ose an inside threat to the education sector.

In one high-profile US prosecution, a [19-year-old faced charges in connection with the 2024 PowerSchool compromise](https://www.k12dive.com/news/college-student-charged-in-connection-with-powerschool-data-breach/748747) that exposed millions of records, student and teacher data. In the end, that incident that led to [extortion attempts against districts and caused major operational disruption](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-school-districts-facing-extortion-attempt-after-hack-software-provider-says-2025-05-07).
