Packers and Crypters in Malware
and How to Remove Them

In this article, we’ll explore the most common types of protectors—packers and crypters—along with simple ways to detect and remove them.

We’ll also introduce some useful tools to simplify the process and improve your malware analysis skills.

## What Are Protectors and What Types Are There?

Protectors are tools designed to complicate code analysis, making it harder to detect and examine malware. Two of the most common types of protectors are **packers** and **crypters**.

### 1. Packers

Packers are utilities that package one or more files into a single executable, often adding compression. This process makes static and dynamic detection more difficult, a tactic many types of malware exploit.

Certain malware, like those written in scripting languages (e.g., Python or JavaScript) or relying on non-standard libraries, require packing to function properly by including interpreters and necessary libraries.

Classic examples of packers include installers like NSI and MSI, UPX, MPress, and self-extracting archives (SFX) made with tools like 7zip or WinRAR.

Packers generally don’t protect application data, making it relatively easy to extract them at runtime in a sandbox or remove the packer using static tools.

### 2. Crypters

Crypters take protection a step further by encrypting the executable’s contents, often adding layers of packing and obfuscation. Designed to obscure code, crypters make analysis more complex and time-consuming. Examples of crypters include NetReactor, Themida, and VmProtect.

**Main Protection Methods of Crypters:**

1. Dynamic unpacking in memory to avoid leaving any disk trace.

2. **Encryption of files, data, and code**, with decryption at runtime.

3. **Code Obfuscation**: Changes the structure and sequence of instructions, transforming (meta)data into unreadable or meaningless characters.

4. **Virtualization**: Transforms code into pseudo-instructions that are either regenerated or interpreted at runtime.

Note that without virtualization, code is usually weakly protected and can often be restored to its original or near-original state.

## Identifying Packers: Simple Techniques and Useful Tools

Detecting packers can be simplified with a few straightforward techniques and specialized tools like **DIE (Detect It Easy)**. DIE notifies users when a packer is detected, making it a quick solution for initial identification.

Let’s consider the [following sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/d32288b8-e0d8-40f1-9895-23686b2f7e0c/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=packers_and_crypters&utm_term=301024&utm_content=linktoservice). When analyzing it with DIE v3.10, we can observe the presence of the MPRESS packer.

Opening the sample in DIE reveals section names that indicate packing.

Packers like **UPX** and **MPRESS** often create sections with distinctive names, such as MPRESS1 and MPRESS2, which help analysts identify their usage.

We can also examine **PE (Portable Executable) information** in the **Static Discovering** window inside ANY.RUN sandbox. This provides further details to help identify these packers and their specific characteristics.

We can identify UPX through section names. In certain cases, packers like **VMProtect** and **Themida** can also be identified by their distinct section names.

Sections, such as .vmp0, indicate VMProtect ([see example](https://app.any.run/tasks/d5f7021d-41b4-441f-85d1-48cf149c6489/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=packers_...
