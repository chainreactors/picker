## Leader in Malware Analysis Tools and System Security

## Users Love Us

G2 has awarded us the **Users Love Us** badge after we received over 20 reviews with an average rating of 4.0 stars or higher. We’re very grateful for your positive feedback and appreciation!

## What Our Users Say

Your feedback is extremely valuable to us — it helps us stay focused on your needs and move the products in the right direction. Here’s what some of our users have to say on G2:

> ANY.RUN is great for quick analysis of the files, emails, links, etc. What makes ANY.RUN better than the others is that you can interact with the sandbox client while analyzing potential threats. It highlights all potential threats and attack vectors and really helps to quickly understand whether there is a potential threat or not. Also, it provides great reporting. I would recommend it to everyone.

> **Miloš K**., CISO.

> I was using the any.run for a while now and I can tell that it is one of the best interactive online sandbox available in the market today. The analysis results are much better and deeper compared to other tools.
>
> **Abin B**., Lead Analyst.

> When considering competitive sandboxes, none of them can boast of a better system for tracking malicious activity. Also worth noting is the incredible list YARA rules. I think there are no downsides to it, it’s an ideal service.
>
> **John S**., Malware Reverser.
