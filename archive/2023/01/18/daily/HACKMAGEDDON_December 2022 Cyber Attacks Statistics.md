After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/29/1-15-december-2022-cyber-attack-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/01/12/16-31-december-2022-cyber-attack-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of December 2022 where I have collected and analyzed 267 events, a value slightly lower than November, but in line with the latest months, a value that confirms the overall high level of cyber activity that has characterized the end of 2022.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, once again above 80% (**82%** vs. **86%** in November). The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** are up to **7.9%**from **6.3%**. **Hacktivism** goes down to **3.7%**from **5.1%**, the same value of **Cyber Warfare**, up from **1.5%**, of the previous month.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, and once again the growing number of ransomware attacks push its percentage above 40%, to  **40.4%** from 43.8% from 34.7%, ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers**, down to **10.1%** from **14%**, and the exploitation of of **Vulnerabilities** at number three, among the known attack techniques, with **8,2%**, a value almost double than November (4%). **Targeted Attacks** are immediately behind with **6.4%** from **4.4%** of November.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, up to **24.3%** from 19.1% of November, ahead of governments (**10.5%** vs. 10.7% in November), the same value of **Healthcare**, which is in line with the previous month, when it was 11%).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cyber-Attacks-Statistics-IG-November-2022-R.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
