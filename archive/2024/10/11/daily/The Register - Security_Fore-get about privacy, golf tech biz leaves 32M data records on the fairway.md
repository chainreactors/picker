Nearly 32 million records belonging to users of tech from Trackman were left exposed to the internet, sitting in a non-password protected database, for an undetermined amount of time, according to researcher Jeremiah Fowler.

Trackman is a technology company that uses Doppler radar to analyze golf swings and shots. The PGA Tour, pro golfers, and amateurs use its products. In addition to the thousands of professionals, and 10,000-plus coaches and club-fitters, the company [claims](https://www.trackman.com/references) 90 of the world's top 100 players use Trackman tech, along with manufacturers including Bridgestone and Callaway, and major broadcasting companies like Golf Channel, ESPN, BBC, NHK, and CNN World.

While it's very good at tracking golf balls at major tournaments and the Olympics, it appears that protecting users' data may be trickier – leaving their data online in this way puts users at risk of device hacking, social engineering and phishing attacks, as well as other digital crimes.
