# Weekly Update 325

11 December 2022

For the first time in I don't know how long, I couldn't do this live. Turns out both cell and wifi in Lapland are, with the benefit of hindsight, exactly what you'd expect from a remote location in the Arctic circle. The rest of the place was pretty amazing though, and a good deal of this week's content has gone to that. Plus, there's the whole "Australia becoming the world's most cyber-secure country" goal which deserves discussion. Oh - and the tweet with *that* pic I discuss - I'll just leave that one here üòä
