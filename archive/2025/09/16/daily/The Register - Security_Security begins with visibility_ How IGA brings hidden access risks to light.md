Partner Content From the moment users log onto their machines, access rights shape their experience. Access rights determine which apps they can run, which directories they can open, and what information they can retrieve.

Yet despite their crucial role in IT administration, many organizations have no clear picture of their own access landscape. The main problem is scale. Admins have dozens of IT systems and hundreds of employees, contractors and guests to handle. They can't manage the sheer number of privileges in a professional IT environment through manual governance processes like emails, checklists, and spreadsheets.

Those access needs evolve over time. Users get more privileges as they take on new roles and projects. They also no longer need some of their old access rights, but those are commonly overlooked. Those ghost privileges remain active far longer than intended, even past the point where their owner has left your organization. This gradual buildup of excess privileges...
