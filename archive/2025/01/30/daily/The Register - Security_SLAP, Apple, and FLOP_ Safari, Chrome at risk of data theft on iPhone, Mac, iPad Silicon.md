## It's another cousin of Spectre, here to read your email, browsing history, and more

Many recent Apple laptops, desktops, tablets, and phones powered by Cupertino's homegrown Silicon processors can be exploited to reveal email content, browsing behavior, and other sensitive data through two newly identified side-channel attacks on Chrome and Safari.

On Tuesday, security researchers Jason Kim, Jalen Chuang, and Daniel Genkin from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, and Yuval Yarom from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, published papers describing two speculative-execution attacks dubbed [SLAP](https://predictors.fail/files/SLAP.pdf) [PDF] and [FLOP](https://predictors.fail/files/FLOP.pdf) [PDF].

These attacks exploit weaknesses in Apple's Arm-compatible processor designs to extract information from memory that should be off limits. In practice, that means a malicious webpage in one Chrome or Safari browser tab snooping on a page in another tab and stealing its sensitive information, such as emails being read and what have you.
