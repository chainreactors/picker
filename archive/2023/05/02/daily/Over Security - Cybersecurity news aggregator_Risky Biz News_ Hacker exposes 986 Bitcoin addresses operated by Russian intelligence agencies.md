A suspected hacker has exposed 986 Bitcoin addresses allegedly operated by Russia's three main intelligence services—the Foreign Military Intelligence Agency (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and Federal Security Service (FSB).

The hack and subsequent leak were discovered by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis. The company believes the hacker gained access to the private keys of several GRU wallets.

Between February 12 and March 14 last year, the hacker then proceeded to send transactions to other wallets. Each transaction contained a note in the OP\_RETURN field identifying the recipients as a GRU, SVR, or FSB account.

Calling themselves the "GRU Khakir," the hacker claims the agencies use the Bitcoin addresses for hacking operations.

Once Russia invaded Ukraine, the hacker stopped exposing GRU, SVR, and FSB blockchain addresses and began sending funds to wallets raising donations for Ukraine's war effort.

Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus conference last week, Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager says he believes the hack-and-leak are real because the hacker didn't send small transactions that would have gone unnoticed but burned more than $300,000 of Bitcoin in the process.

"Our hypothesis is that the OP\_RETURN sender did this to make the discovery of the transactions, and the accusations associated with them, more likely," the company also wrote in a [report](https://archive.ph/0RG40).

Three of the 986 Bitcoin addresses that received funds were previously known to have been used by Russian intelligence in past operations, such as for the SolarWinds hack and to lease servers for the DCLeaks website.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**DOJ SolarWinds hack:** Kim Zetter [reports](https://www.wired.com/story/solarwinds-hack-public-disclosure/) for Wired that the US Department of Justice detected the breach related to the SolarWinds supply chain attack in May of 2020, six months before the incident became widely known in December of that year. Despite the early discovery, the DOJ's security team and experts from Mandiant and Microsoft could not determine the significance of the DOJ breach and the larger attack. The SolarWinds hacks became widely known after hackers also breached Mandiant and Microsoft's own networks, leading the two companies to focus more investigative efforts on the intrusions.

**0VIX crypto-heist:** A hacker has stolen roughly $2 million worth of cryptocurrency using a [flash-loan attack](https://archive.ph/1gH6q) on the 0VIX platform. The incident caused users to panic and withdraw more than 75% of the platform's funds, according to *[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/28/defi-protocol-0vix-loses-nearly-2m-in-flash-loan-exploit/)*.

**Casenet leak:** The state of Missouri's judicial records website left exposed documents containing the Social Security numbers and personal information of thousands of Missourians, the [Saint Louis Post-Dispatch](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/court-records-online-include-private-information-for-thousands-of-missouri-residents/article_f5b23bce-e44c-11ed-a554-33728de7a460.html) discovered. Missouri Supreme Court officials acknowledged the leak and fixed the Casenet website.

**Americold breach:** Cold storage company Americold has been hacked, and several of its IT systems have been down for almost a week, according to an email the company sent customers. The company says it suffered a network breach on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday last week and is still investigating the incident. It expects IT systems to be down throughout the week.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Firefox Private Network EoL:** Mozilla will discontinue its [Firefox Private Network](https://fpn.firefox.com/) browser extension on [June 15 this year](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/secure-proxy/pull/985/commits/372514517bdd99d7480d6d77a14a7f347a2612b2). Launched [in 2019](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-launches-firefox-vpn-extension-for-us-users/), FPN is a browser extension that funnels the user's web traffic through Mozilla's servers, acting as a proxy system. The extension was only available to US users, never made it out of beta stage development, and was eventually replaced with Mozilla's VPN desktop app, a superior product that could protect a user's entire traffic and not just their web activity.

**GnuPG's ADSK:** The GnuPG project has added a new feature named [Additional Decryption SubKey (ADSK)](https://gnupg.org/blog/20230321-adsk.html) that acts like its name implies—as a second decryption key. GnuPG says it developed this feature to allow companies to decrypt the email communications of employees who are absent from their jobs, have left the company, or to decrypt emails for archival purposes.

> "Another use case for ADSKs is to split keys between several devices (e.g. desktop and mobile). For example the secret part of the key for the mobile device could be on a token for additional security but on the desktop the key is on-disk because the desktop is less likely lost or stolen. The ADSK of a lost device could then be revoked and a new one generated for a new device."

**Bing better at censorship than Chinese search engines:** Researchers with CitizenLab [analyzed](https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/a-comparison-of-search-censorship-in-china/) the search results of eight search engines that serve the Chinese market (Baidu, Baidu Zhidao, Bilibili, Microsoft Bing, Douyin, Jingdong, Sogou, and Weibo). Surprisingly, while Baidu had the most censorship rules, CitizenLab says Microsoft's Bing ran broader political censorship rules that "affected more search results than Baidu."

**Chrome 113:** Google started rolling out early versions of its [Chrome v113](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/04/early-stable-update-for-desktop.html) browser update to users last week. The rest of Chrome users will receive the update ...
