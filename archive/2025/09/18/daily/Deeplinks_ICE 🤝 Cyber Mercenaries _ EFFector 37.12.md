It's easy to keep up with the fight for digital privacy and free expression. Our [EFFector newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector/37/12) delivers bite-sized updates, stories, and actions you can take to stay informed and help out.

In this latest issue, we show¬†how libraries and schools can [safeguard their computers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/libraries-schools-why-organizations-should-install-privacy-badger)¬†with¬†Privacy Badger; highlight¬†the dangers of unaccountable corporations and billionaires [buying surveillance tech for police](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/san-francisco-gets-invasive-billionaire-bought-surveillance-hq);¬†and share news that EFF‚Äôs Executive Director, Cindy Cohn, will be [stepping down in mid-2026](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/executive-director-cindy-cohn-will-step-down-after-25-years-eff) after more than two decades of leadership.

Catch the conversation on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/auEIohzk6YQ) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.12_202509).
