A Mexican drug cartel spies on the FBI using traffic cameras and spyware ‚Äî because ‚Äúubiquitous technical surveillance‚Äù is no longer just for dystopian thrillers. Graham digs into a chilling new US Justice Department report that shows how surveillance tech was weaponised to deadly effect.

Meanwhile, Carole checks the rear-view mirror on the driverless car industry. Whatever happened to those million Tesla robotaxis Elon Musk promised by 2020? Spoiler: they‚Äôre here ‚Äî sort of ‚Äî but they sometimes drive into oncoming traffic.

Plus: Leighton House, heatwave survival gadgets, and an unflushable toilet situation (not what you think).

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
