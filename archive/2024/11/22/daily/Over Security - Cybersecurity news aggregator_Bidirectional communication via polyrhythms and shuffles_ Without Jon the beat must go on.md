# Bidirectional communication via polyrhythms and shuffles: Without Jon the beat must go on

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Bidirectional communication is foundational to a well-built team regardless of environment. It’s critical in information security to be able to drive a conversation up the ladder and down and not lose the critical elements. One of the most difficult challenges that cyber security teams face is making sure that everyone that is in a decision-making space is aware of the highly technical challenges that the evolving threat landscape dictates. Navigating the challenges that come in continually evolving the team and it’s tools to defend is often a much greater challenge. I’m going to help you with those conversations. In both directions. By talking about drumming. I know, I don’t have the pro wrestling takes that Jon came to the table with, so you’re going to have to run with me Constant Reader.

I’m going to choose drumming to outline an easy way to identify some complex issues and talk about them in both directions and drumming is a little easier to identify for non-musicians and FAR less contentious than a spicy guitar opinion. Ok, so let’s start with a simple concept.

Sounds difficult. Is difficult.
Sounds difficult. Is easy.
Sounds easy. Is difficult.
Sounds easy. Is easy.

Sounds difficult. Is difficult. This one is easy – Tomas Haake from Meshuggah playing Bleed is a perfect example. Polyrhythms, stamina, speed, interdependence, and complexity. This sounds difficult. It is difficult. Only the criminally insane attempt to learn how to play this song.

Sounds easy. Is easy. Take Phil Rudd and pick any AC/DC song from Back in Black. The perfect example of sounds easy, is easy. Perfectly in the pocket.

Sounds easy. Is difficult. This one is harder and will cause someone to wellackshully and I assure you I do not care. I’m going to give two examples, Jeff Porcaro of Toto playing Rosanna and Vinnie Colaiuta playing Seven Days with Sting. Both of these songs are immensely easy to listen to and don’t seem like there’s anything challenging going on. Until you try to play along, then you cry and examine all the choices you’ve made in life.

Sounds difficult. Is easy. This is going to be a sticky situation, but I’d say that you could throw on anything by Travis Barker and Dave Lombardo. Bring it haters. I’m not saying that they are bad drummers – simply that what they do sounds more difficult than it is.

Ok William, but how does this help me at all?

When you have information security meetings with people in your organization take a second as you look at the agenda, and your conversation in specific, and think about the groupings above and determine what kind of drumming you are hearing. Depending on your environment and team the topics will fall naturally into these categories – it can be patch and vulnerability management,  EOL devices that need to be replaced, endpoint detection and response, deciding what traffic is actionable and defining that in your SIEM, forensic analysis, threat hunting, event response, the conversations are as malleable as the threat landscape.

It’s easy to isolate the things in your environment that are very difficult to defend AND take a skilled defender and complex tooling to defend. Those conversations flow with either junior analysts or C-Level executives. This is the “Sounds difficult. Is difficult.” type of conversation. Ditto the “Sounds easy. Is easy.” conversations are easy to have in either direction. The most difficult topics to convey fall into the “Sounds difficult. Is easy.” or “Sounds easy. Is difficult.” In my experience these conversations are usually much easier to deliver in one direction and much more difficult in the other. Jazz guys enjoy the nuance of Colaiuta and can’t wrap their minds around Lombardo while metalheads love him and don’t want to be bothered by ghost notes. By taking a moment to dissect your topic and determine where you are going to run into the “Sounds difficult. Is easy.” or the “Sounds easy. Is difficult.” situation it will allow you to prepare for those more challenging conversations so that you can craft a narrative to best capture the nuance that might be lost in a highly technical conversation with a C-Level exec, or the motivation for waiting for the next financial quarter for new tooling that the analysts really need.

I’m not going to lie - you can prepare this way and things can still fall on deaf ears, they can still underestimate the lift required because people are fallible but if you prepare just a bit and know your audience you can drag your C-Level into a discussion on polyrhythm and pull your junior analyst up with a little Vinnie Colaiuta and make them all feel like Phil Rudd.

## The one big thing

Cisco Talos discovered a new information stealing campaign operated by a Vietnamese-speaking threat actor targeting government and education entities in Europe and Asia. [PXA Stealer](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-pxa-stealer/) targets victims’ sensitive information, including credentials for various online accounts, VPN and FTP clients, financial information, browser cookies, and data from gaming software. PXA Stealer also has the capability to decrypt the victim’s browser master password and uses it to steal the stored credentials of various online accounts.

## Why do I care?

Harvested credentials can allow attackers direct access to your environment without the need to exploit vulnerabilities or face any of your defensive architecture – they can just log in. [Cisco Talos Inciden...
