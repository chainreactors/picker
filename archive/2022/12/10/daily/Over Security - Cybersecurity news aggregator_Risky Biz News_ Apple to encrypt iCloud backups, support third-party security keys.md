Apple users got an early holiday gift from the company, which [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/12/apple-advances-user-security-with-powerful-new-data-protections/) on Wednesday that it was adding three new security features to its services.

None of the features are neither new or groundbreaking, but they're something that privacy and security professionals have been asking Apple to roll out for years.

The first feature is named **iMessage Contact Key Verification**, and this works by showing alerts inside encrypted iMessage conversations whenever a new device is added to a participant's account. Apple hopes the feature will alert users whenever a threat actor gains access to an Apple account and tries to surreptitiously spy on ongoing conversations.

The second is named **Security Keys for Apple ID**, and just like its name implies, Apple will now allow you to use hardware-based security keys to secure Apple ID accounts. This is genuinely good news, as hardware security keys are considered one of the most secure forms of 2FA today. The other good news—Apple says that 95% of its Apple ID users have a form of 2FA enabled, which puts the company in the same rarified air of 2FA adoption, right next to Google.

Finally, the third and most positively welcomed feature is **Advanced Data Protection for iCloud**, which lets users encrypt their iCloud data, including iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, and others. According to an [Apple documentation page](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f/web), 23 different iCloud data categories can be encrypted.

The feature is also opt-in, so users will have to manually enable it.

Furthermore, Advanced Data Protection for iCloud uses an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) scheme, meaning there's a chance that if you lose access to your devices, you may lose all your encrypted backups and their respective data.

This new feature, in particular, is bound to generate the most drama out of the three. Why? Because Apple won't be able to access or decrypt this data anymore, which puts the company on a direct and fast-tracked collision line with law enforcement agencies all over the world. Will it cause problems for the company? We don't know, but Meta, which rolled out encrypted backups for WhatsApp [more than a year ago](https://archive.ph/bFxnk), doesn't seem to have had any major tussles with law enforcement on the topic so far.

Until now, iCloud data has been "one court order away" from law enforcement investigations, as Albert Fox Cahn, Executive Director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said in a [statement](https://www.stopspying.org/latest-news/2022/12/7/stop-welcomes-apple-icloud-privacy-updates-as-essential-amp-overdue) on Wednesday.

The FBI has already [expressed its displeasure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/12/07/icloud-apple-encryption/) with Apple's announcement.

Fox Cahn also points out that leaving the feature as opt-in will leave most users' data still available for abuse, especially to oppressive and autocratic regimes. On the other hand, the feature can also cause some catastrophic data losses if turned on without a user's knowledge—so Apple most definitely made the right decision here.

Further, as one user points out in a [HackerNews comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33898104), this is also huge news for Apple users, as it shows that the company is willing to sacrifice some of its ad business interests for their privacy and security.

> "*BUT*, perhaps the *BIGGEST* news here is that Apple is making a backup statement to what they've been saying for years and what they've recently gotten negative attention on: They don't want your data. They're not Goodle/FB/Amazon. They're giving you 2TB+ of space and you can encrypt it to the point that you'll lose your data and they don't care -- they don't want to mine your data, they don't want to know what you store on there, the don't care to scan your pictures with AI 20 different ways, they don't want to monetize it, etc, etc., just pay them money for their service and transactionally they give you [the] only thing that you want in return -- [a] reliable, secure, private service."

According to Apple, Advanced Data Protection for iCloud will be available for beta testers starting this week and for US users by the end of the year. The feature, along with the other two, will be available to worldwide users in early 2023.

Overall, this is very good news for Apple users. Cryptographer and Johns Hopkins University professor Matthew Green, one of Apple's biggest critics, called the news a "[big deal](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2022/12/07/apple-icloud-and-why-encrypted-backup-is-the-only-privacy-issue/)." If Apple managed to impress Green, we'll count it as a win.

In the meantime, we're gonna be patiently waiting for the first real-world contact between Apple's Advanced Data Protection for iCloud and [Australia's Assistance and Access Act 2018 law](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/data-encryption).

### Breaches and hacks

**Turkey charges journalist over their own data breach:** The Turkish government has [filed charges](https://www.turkishminute.com/2022/12/07/rkish-journalist-faces-12-years-in-prison-for-announcing-personal-data-leak/) against İbrahim Haskoloğlu, a local journalist who discovered a breach of a government portal. Haskoloğlu was previously [detained in April](https://cpj.org/2022/04/turkish-journalist-ibrahim-haskologlu-arrested-over-coverage-of-alleged-hacking/) earlier this year after he [tweeted](https://archive.ph/aYioT) redacted photos of the ID cards of several Turkish political figures, including President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Haskoloğlu said he received the data from a hacking group that claimed to have breached Turkey's e-government portal. He said he published the photos after the government refused to admit the incident. Earlier this week, [Haskoloğlu sa...
