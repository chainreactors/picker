# Qantas: Breach affects 6 million people, “significant” amount of data likely taken

Posted: July 2, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Australia’s largest airline Qantas has [confirmed](https://www.qantasnewsroom.com.au/media-releases/qantas-cyber-incident/) that cybercriminals have gained access to a third party customer servicing platform that contained 6 million customer service records.

Qantas says the breach occurred after a cybercriminal targeted a call centre and managed to gain access to the third party platform, presumably via social engineering.

The airline reassured customers by saying all Qantas systems remain secure, and that there would be “no impact to Qantas’ operations or the safety of the airline. However, Qantas anticipates that a large amount of data has been taken:

> “We are continuing to investigate the proportion of the data that has been stolen, though we expect it will be significant.”

An initial review has confirmed the data includes:

* Customers’ names
* Email addresses
* Phone numbers
* Birth dates
* Frequent flyer numbers

Fortunately, credit card details, personal financial information and passport details were not held in the breached system.

The airline responded quickly by isolating the affected system, notifying customers, and working with the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the Australian Federal Police, and independent cybersecurity experts.

The breach at a third party provider is extra painful since [Qantas concluded](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/qantas-is-embedding-secure-by-design-practices-across-the-group-611573) an uplift of third and fourth-party cyber-risk governance processes in 2024. In a report released at the time, the airline explained:

> “Third- and fourth-party cyber risk involves managing cyber risks from our direct suppliers (third parties) and their suppliers (fourth parties), who can affect our supply chain directly or indirectly through cyber incidents.”

No group has claimed responsibility for the cyberattack yet, which is normal if it is a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware). But it’s noteable that this weekend the FBI put out a warning on social media about ransomware attacks targeting airlines.

> “The FBI has recently observed the cybercriminal group Scattered Spider expanding its targeting to include the airline sector. These actors rely on [social engineering techniques](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering), often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access. These techniques frequently involve methods to bypass multi-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) (MFA), such as convincing help desk services to add unauthorized MFA devices to compromised accounts. They target large corporations and their third-party IT providers, which means anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk.

The FBI is actively working with aviation and industry partners to address this activity and assist victims. Early reporting allows the FBI to engage promptly, share intelligence across the industry, and prevent further compromis...
