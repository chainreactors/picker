# A fresh coat for Snowflake: a website refresh to help more people get online

At its core, Snowflake is a piece of technology that transforms ordinary internet users into censorship-fighting allies. It's as painless and hassle-free as opening a new browser-tab, allowing anyone [to open a lifeline for blocked internet users](https://blog.torproject.org/snowflake-daily-operations/). That's why we've given the [Snowflake website](https://snowflake.torproject.org/) a much-needed refresh to make it clearer, more accessible, and easier to navigate.

Alongside the efforts of Tor's community, sysadmin and UX/UI teams, the revamp was made possible by the contributions of a [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/gsoc-previous-years#3-snowflake-landing-page-revamp), Ashish Soni. He remains passionate about open-source and continues to contribute and build impactful projects in the tech community. We talked to him about his experience working with the Tor Project and what motivated him to contribute to Snowflake specifically.

### How did you first learn about Snowflake? Do you still run a Snowflake proxy and what's been your experience with it?

I first discovered Snowflake through the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) website. Its mission to bypass censorship using Tor while helping people stay connected through its peer-to-peer nature immediately intrigued me. But even before joining the program, I had done research and engaged with the Tor community, and experimented with its extension, web embeds, and proxies. While I don't run a proxy, I often talk about Snowflake at events and conferences I go to, and it always amazes people how this tool empowers internet freedom.

### Did anything in your background, studies, or personal interests draw you toward privacy and anti-censorship tools?

During my college studies, I had a subject on security that introduced me to encryption, network security, and privacy-focused technologies. This sparked my interest in anti-censorship tools, leading me to explore projects like Snowflake. I already use the Tor Browser and Orbot and have seen firsthand how other tools like VPNs help protect online freedom.Â

### What didn't work about the previous website and how did you come up with the improvements you wanted to make?Â

The previous Snowflake website had several usability issues---its design felt outdated, the wording was often confusing, and many users struggled to understand how Snowflake proxies and clients worked. It also lacked essential features like a proper FAQ section and wasn't mobile-friendly, making navigation difficult. Based on user feedback, we focused on creating a cleaner, more accessible design with clear explanations, a responsive layout, and better content structure. Additionally, we aimed to simplify maintenance so future contributors could update it seamlessly.

### Looking at the finished product, how do you feel about the project? Would you consider this a success? Was everything accomplished that you set out to do?

We consider this project a success. Comparing the old website to the new one, the overall look and feel have been completely transformed, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. During the summer, we successfully completed around 90% of the planned tasks, significantly improving accessibility, navigation, and the overall user experience. While there's always room for further enhancements, the key goals were met, making the project a meaningful upgrade.

### Now that you've worked on a censorship-circumvention tool, do you feel more connected or invested in online freedom initiatives?

Yes, working on Snowflake deepened my understanding of online censorship and strengthened my commitment to digital freedom. It reinforced the importance of open-source tools in protecting access to information, and I hope to contribute more to similar initiatives in the future.

### Any words of wisdom for others who are interested in GSoC or contributing to the Tor Project?

For anyone interested in GSoC or contributing to the Tor Project, I'd suggest exploring the projects early, understanding their impact, and engaging with the community. The Tor Project has a welcoming environment, and asking questions or contributing small fixes can be a great way to start.

When working on a project, creativity, curiosity, and thinking outside the box are what truly make a contribution valuable. For GSoC, having a clear plan, setting milestones, and actively communicating with mentors will help ensure a successful experience. Most importantly, be open to learning---there's a lot to gain beyond just coding!

## Thank you, Ashish.Â
