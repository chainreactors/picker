# Why Secure Email is Essential Following FBI Encryption Warning

December 6th, 2024

Recently, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI [issued a stark warning](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694) urging Americans to use encrypted messaging apps to safeguard their communications against escalating cybersecurity threats. The FBI encryption warning highlights the growing risks posed by cyberattacks in everyday life, and it raises a critical question for healthcare providers, payers, and suppliers: Are your email communications secure?

While messaging apps are essential for some communications, email remains one of the most widely used channels for sharing sensitive information, particularly in healthcare. Unencrypted email exposes organizations to the same, if not greater, risks as unsecured text messaging. With sensitive patient data at stake, ensuring email encryption is not just a best practice—it’s a necessity in today’s world.

### The Dangers of Unencrypted Email

For healthcare organizations, email serves as a vital communication tool for sharing Protected Health Information (PHI), scheduling appointments, managing patient care, renewing health plans, and buying new products. Yet, unencrypted emails are alarmingly vulnerable to breaches. Hackers can intercept messages, access sensitive health information, and exploit it for financial gain or identity theft.

The consequences of an email breach for healthcare companies are severe:

* **Financial Penalties**: HIPAA violations can result in fines ranging from thousands to millions of dollars.
* **Loss of Trust**: A breach damages your reputation, eroding patient engagement and retention.
* **Operational Disruption**: A breach often results in system downtime and costly remediation efforts.

Given these risks and the almost contsant increase in cyberattacks worldwide, healthcare organizations must prioritize encrypted email to maintain compliance, protect patient data, and avoid catastrophic fallout.

### FBI Encryption Warning: A Wake-Up Call for Healthcare Providers

The recent FBI encryption warning serves as a timely reminder that end-to-end encryption is a fundamental defense against cyberattacks. While the public may focus on encrypted messaging apps for personal use, healthcare entities must take a broader view. Every email sent without encryption is an opportunity for bad actors to strike.

Consider these scenarios:

1. **PHI in Transit**: Emails containing medical records or billing information are especially vulnerable if sent over an unsecured network.
2. **Phishing Attacks**: Unencrypted communications are more susceptible to phishing schemes that can compromise entire systems.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: [HIPAA mandates](https://luxsci.com/blog/navigating-hipaa-regulations.html) the protection of PHI, making encryption an essential part of patient and customer engagement strategies.

“Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible,” said Jeff Greene, executive assistant director for cybersecurity at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CSIA), recently told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694).
