I was asked recently to do a security audit on a website by a friend. Although they didn’t specify their concerns, the URL they sent me was the start of the payment flow.
FYI TL;DR version
The site is for a far right political group and hosted behind Cloudflare through an outfit called nation builder. Seems that they provide hosting services to the far right, and host a wide range of sites that at a glance seem likely to promote hate speech and the full range of ~isms. I checked to see if Cloudflare allowed this kind of site and found that there is considerable criticism of them for doing so. Aside from which their security sucks, starting with legacy TLS and JS libraries.

re:

You didn’t tell them about those vulns, did you? Thanks. We will “fix up” the site later! Ha.

More seriously, cloudflare has rightly earned criticism for some of their practices. But, disagreeable speech is not illegal. Did the web site you evaluated have any CSAM or incitement for violence or any other such prohibited words? If the site content fits within cloudflare’s ToS, good enough.

**Is Musk DOGiE the biggest waste?**

I doubt that this will surprise some, but others might like to see their suspicions supported,

<https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/08/doges-efficiency-theater-wasted-21-7-billion-while-destroying-life-saving-programs-based-on-conspiracy-theories/>

$21.7 billion is as they say “a lot of cabbage”, wasted on “Efficiency Theater”. The question that almost immediately comes to mind is of course “Who’s pocket?” got deeper because of it, with the second being “How much got slid across over the Oval Office desk?”

The article unfortunately does not say anything in depth but does point out a lot of it was to now jobless federal workers who if they had not taken the money would have been terminated with prejudice anyway.

What the article does however go into is the expected atleast 14million avoidable deaths that will be on Musk’s hands nearly 5million of which will be babies and toddlers and other children under 5 years old,

> *“The richest man in the world, put in charge of government efficiency, made life-and-death decisions based on conspiracy theories from fringe social media accounts. What could go wrong?*
>
> Well, everything, as it turns out.
>
> DOGE’s crown jewel achievement was completely destroying USAID based on—and I feel the need to repeat this—conspiracy theories. A study published in The Lancet found that USAID had prevented 92 million deaths between 2001 and 2021. The agency’s destruction is now projected to cause 14 million avoidable deaths over the next five years, including 4.5 million children under age 5.
>
> This is blood on the hands of Musk and the ridiculous nonsense peddlers he believed, rather than talking to actual experts.”

My “simple maths” suggests that it’s more likely to be over 23million avoidable deaths on Musk’s hands.

He oft behaves like a baby having a fit of conniption hurling toys out the pram, hence why I call him “Hell-on Rusk” whilst others are less polite.

I’m sure new names are popping up as you read this.

@ Bruce,

You’ve expressed an interest in certain types of photography in the past.

Well the short list for “The Royal Maritime Greenwich”(RMG) Astronomy Photographer of the year is up, and some are realy stunning and would look good on any wall,

<https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/galleries/2025-shortlist>

If peeps happen to be in London this weekend they might want to pop over and see 100 of the over 5000 photos entered displayed on light boxes,

Musk was just following orders. Orders that were written in Project-2025. These are the real baby murderers.

The conservatives say they want more babies, But only the right kind of babies. Other babies should be gotten rid of.

=Japan has secured its biggest arms export deal ever through its new Mogami-class frigate.
The $6.5 billion sale will see Australia acquiring 11 of the stealth warships The Mogami sale is a breakthrough for Japan’s weapons export industry, which Tokyo is
trying to grow after lifting a decadeslong self-imposed ban on foreign arms sales.

The 427-foot Mogami frigates are some of the world’s newest warships. Built in 2019, the
first of these vessels only entered service in Japan in 2022.

The vessels are armed with two Type 17 anti-ship cruise missile launchers, a 16-cell
vertical launch system, two .50 caliber machine gun turrets, two Type 12 torpedo tubes, a five-inch main gun, and space at the rear for a Seah...
