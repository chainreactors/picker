[-] Microsoft Windows Contact file / Remote Code Execution (Resurrected
2022)  / CVE-2022-44666

Back in 2018 I discovered three related Windows remote code execution
vulnerabilities affecting both VCF and Contact files. They were purchased
by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (@thezdi) from me and received candidate
identifiers ZDI-CAN-6920 and ZDI-CAN-7591. Microsoft as usual denied a fix
and it was subsequently dropped as a zero day on January 10, 2019 in
coordination with the ZDI program.

Almost five years passed, until researcher j00sean resurrected the flaws to
add additional protocol vectors LDAP etc. Microsoft finally decided to
patch and assign CVE-2022-44666 even though the vulnerabilities are exactly
the same.

Old 2019 advisories:
=====================
1) Windows VCF RCE

2) Windows Contact HTML injection

3) Windows Contact RCE
