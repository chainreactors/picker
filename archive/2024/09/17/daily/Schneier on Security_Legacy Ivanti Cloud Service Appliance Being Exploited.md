## Legacy Ivanti Cloud Service Appliance Being Exploited

CISA wants everyone—and government agencies in particular—to [remove or upgrade](https://therecord.media/cisa-urges-federal-agencies-remove-ivanti-product) an Ivanti Cloud Service Appliance (CSA) that is no longer being supported.

Welcome to the security nightmare that is the Internet of Things.

EDITED TO ADD (10/12): The Cloud Service Appliance isn’t an actual appliance, but software you install on a computer. So it’s not IoT.

Not so much an IoT nightmare as a bad sysadmin nightmare. It’s an old product that’s end of life, and the company that supports it is still in business, just not supporting anything older than the current version. It was not a surprise that it was end of life, either. The affected sysadmins should know what hardware is on their networks, and what software is running on that hardware.

Not that they do. Here at $Corp I was on a project a couple of years ago to update some things related to the timecard system and a couple sysadmins were surprised to hear from us that the software was running on their servers, and had been for years.

CSA 5.0 only became available a couple of weeks before 4.6 went EOL.

4.6 was based on CentOS 7. I guess Ivanti missed or ignored the CentOS EOL.

Neither inspires confidence in Ivanti.

> Welcome to the security nightmare that is the Internet of Things.

What Things? You seem to have been misled by the word “appliance”. As the story makes clear, it’s not a Thing, it’s a piece of software, CSA 4.6, which is end-of-life and has a vulnerability: customers should have upgraded to CSA 5.0. The old story of not bothering to keep your software up-to-date.

@ ALL,

Three questions to think about with IoT, domestic electronics, white goods, cars and much else,

1, If you buy a physical item / box and plug it in / use it, is it an appliance, is it software, or is it in some kind of curious superposition of both?

2, If you have purchased and payed for a physical item from a single source, can the supplier prevent you from using it at whim?

3, If you have purchased and payed for a physical item can you at will change the software on it?

When you look into these questions in many jurisdictions you will find that physical devices with software are not something you should have anything to do with, because they have so many Catch-22 issues you are actually purchasing legal liability for yourself…

Now consider that the software may not work consistently for you as a user. That is it either does not behave in a reasonably deterministic way, or it does not “work the same way twice” with the same user input.

Who carries the liability on such things?

After all if you turn the wheel clockwise and the vehicle goes to the left not the right apparently randomly from time to time who is to blame for any consequences of you turning the wheel?

Back in times past with “driven animals” this sort of thing happened quite frequently, but the speeds involved usually made things a nuisance rather than a danger.

The usual way to solve such things in the past was to look for the “controling mind” and “entity agency” then apply the curious “reasonableness test”.

Software and the deterministic physical devices it can make behave apparently inconsistently challenges the meanings of “agency” and “reasonable”.

Take AI LLM’s with ML, it has been claimed that we do not have the ability to “open the box and predictably discern the behaviours in advance” even though the actual system by which they function is claimed to be provably deterministic at all levels.

In the sense of the alleged Chinese Curse, we now all “live in interesting times” and the guard labour and legal professions are going to get things wrong. In part because they have lost the way of thinking correctly, and similarly in part because legislators are at best fallible and care not to reason things through in lets be polite and call it their haste to be seen to be authoritative.

A lot of people do not know how to update their things. They do not know that a router, a fridge, a washing machine, televisions and security cameras require updating, or how to.

Not all of these devices perform automatic updates. Some can be easily exploited via WIFI.

Many IoT devices run EoL operating systems and additional third party software.

Manufacturers often release updates for exploits after customer systems are penetrated.

OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-8190)

A cyber threat actor could exploit this vulnerability to take control of an affected system.  …provides *“access to the device running the CSA.”*

And indeed customers had been penetrated (their networks anyway).
