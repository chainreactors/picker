# Been scammed online? Here’s what to do

Posted: June 9, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Unfortunately, people getting scammed online is a frequent event. Scammers are getting better at [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) and are using [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) to sound more authentic and eliminate any spelling errors.

It really can happen to anyone, so there’s no need to feel embarrassed if you have been scammed. Importantly, acting quickly can limit the damage. So here are some things you can do if you’ve been scammed.

### 1. Stop all communication immediately

Cut off contact with the scammer. Don’t reply to messages or calls, as this can prevent further manipulation or requests for even more money or information.

### 2. Secure your accounts

Change the passwords on all your online accounts, especially financial and email accounts. Use strong, unique passwords and enable [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa) wherever possible. Start with the ones the scammer may have gained access to, but don’t stop there and check all your important accounts as well.

### 3. Monitor your financial statements

Check your bank, credit card, and payment service accounts for unauthorized transactions. Report suspicious activity to your banks and credit card company immediately to freeze or reverse fraudulent charges. Let them know what went down and find out how they can help you.

### 4. Avoid sponsored search results

It’s really important that you don’t click on sponsored search results when searching for help with resolving a scam. This kind of topic is seen by scammers as a perfect opportunity to scam you even more and they are known to outbid the rightful owners of certain brands. If you’re using a search engine, type the domain name yourself or scroll down to the regular search results.

### 5. Place fraud alerts and check credit reports

Contact credit bureaus to place fraud alerts on your file. This warns lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts. Regularly review your credit reports for unfamiliar activity. If this is an option where you live, [add a security freeze](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/), more commonly called a credit freeze, to all of your credit reports for free.

* In the US, for a credit freeze contact [Experian](https://www.experian.com/help/credit-freeze/), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/), and [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze).
* In Canada, for credit monitoring and alerts contact [Equifax Canada](https://www.equifax.ca/personal/products/equifax-consumer-credit-report) and [TransUnion Canada](https://www.transunion.ca/).
* In the UK, for credit reports and monitoring contact [Experian](https://www.experian.co.uk/), [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/), and [TransUnion UK](https://www.transunion.co.uk/consumer/get-your-credit-report).

### 6. Try to recover your lost funds

Sadly, recovering your lost funds will not always be possible. However, you may have some options:

* If you paid the scammer by credit card, request a chargeback through your card provider.
* If you paid via bank transfer or wire,...
