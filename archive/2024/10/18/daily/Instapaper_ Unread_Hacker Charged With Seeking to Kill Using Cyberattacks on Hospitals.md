# Hacker Charged With Seeking to Kill Using Cyberattacks on Hospitals

The US has accused two brothers of being part of the hacker group Anonymous Sudan, which allegedly went on a wild cyberattack spree that hit hundreds of targets—and, for one of the two men, even put lives at risk.

For hackers seeking to maximize chaos, so-called denial-of-service attacks that knock targets offline with waves off junk traffic are typically more of a blunt cudgel than a weapon of mass destruction. But according to the US Department of Justice, a pair of Sudanese brothers allegedly behind the hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan launched a spree of those crude [cyberattacks](https://www.wired.com/category/security/cyberattacks-hacks/) that was both powerful and cruel enough in its choice of victims—extending to dozens of hospitals in multiple countries, Israel’s missile alert system, and hundreds of other digital services—that one of them is now being charged not only with criminal hacking but also with the rare added allegation of seeking to cause physical injury and death.

On Wednesday the DOJ unsealed charges against brothers Ahmed and Alaa Omer, who allegedly launched a punishing bombardment of more than 35,000 distributed denial-of-service, or [DDoS, attacks](https://www.wired.com/2016/01/hacker-lexicon-what-are-dos-and-ddos-attacks/#:~:text=TL%253BDR%253A%2520A%2520DoS%252C,various%2520locations%2520on%2520the%2520internet.) against hundreds of organizations, taking down websites and other networked systems as part of both their own ideologically motivated hacktivism, as a means of extortion, or on behalf of clients of a cyberattack-for-hire service they ran for profit. According to US prosecutors and the FBI, their victims included Microsoft's Azure cloud services, OpenAI's ChatGPT, video game and media companies, airports, and even the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of Justice itself.

“We declare cyber war on the United States,” Ahmed Omer posted in a message to Anonymous Sudan's Telegram channel in April of last year, according to the indictment. "The United States will be our primary target.”

Anonymous Sudan also targeted hospitals in the US, Denmark, Sweden, and India. In at least one case in February, prosecutors say, the attacks on Cedars-Sinai Health Systems in Los Angeles caused hours of downtime for health care services that diverted patients to other hospitals. In that Los Angeles incident, the Justice Department claims that one of the two hackers explicitly sought to cause potentially deadly harm.

“Bomb our hospitals in Gaza, we shut down yours too, eye for eye,” Ahmed Omer allegedly wrote on Telegram in the midst of the attack. As a result of those hospital attacks, prosecutors are bringing charges against Ahmed Ohmer that carry a potential life sentence, which prosecutors describe as the most severe criminal charges ever brought against a hacker accused of denial-of-service attacks.

In earlier cases, US authorities claim, the hackers used cyberattacks to disrupt Israel's Tzeva Adom or “Code Red” missile alert app, tearing the system offline in the midst of deadly rocket attacks by Hamas, including during Hamas's attacks on October 7th of last year.

“The actions taken by this group were callous and brazen,” Martin Estrada, a US attorney for the Central District of California and lead prosecutor in the case, told reporters in a conference call. “This group was motivated by their extremist ideology, essentially a Sudanese nationalist ideology.”

Despite publicizing its charges against the two men, Estrada declined to make clear the whereabouts of the two alleged hackers—though he noted that they are in custody. An FBI affidavit accompanying the indictment states that an FBI agent, Elliott Peterson, interviewed both of the Omer brothers and that Ahmed Omer admitted to being an Anonymous Sudan administrator.

Law enforcement agencies also appear to have carried out an operation to take down Anonymous Sudan's infrastructure in March of this year, which prevented the group from carrying out further attacks. The Telegram channel where the group boasted of its targeting and advertised its for-profit attack service went entirely silent around that time and has since ceased to exist. “Anonymous Sudan in name and in operation is effectively dead,” says Chad Seaman, a principal security researcher for tech firm Akamai and a member of [Big Pipes, a working group focused on DDoS](https://www.wired.com/story/big-pipes-ddos-for-hire-fbi/) that closely tracked the group and collaborated with law enforcement in its investigation.

From mid-2023 until that takedown, Anonymous Sudan distinguished itself among self-proclaimed hacktivists with a series of shockingly large and high-profile DDoS attacks. In June of last year, for instance, it [pummeled Microsoft's Azure cloud services for days](https://qz.com/microsoft-outlook-azure-hack-anonymous-sudan-1850552671), knocking it intermittently offline and demanding a million-dollar ransom to stop. It also repeatedly took down OpenAI's ChatGPT in December and wrote on Telegram that it was targeting the company [due to the pro-Israeli posts of one of its employees](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/16/chatgpt-hacking-group-anonymous-sudan).

Anonymous Sudan has at times, in fact, appeared to have formal or informal ties to anti-Israel forces: According to prosecutors, it [launched disruptive cyberattacks](https://www.wired.com/story/israel-hamas-war-hacktivism/) that targeted Israel's Tzeva Adom missile alert system on October 7, 2023, in the midst of [attacks by the militant wing of Hamas](https://www.wired.com/story/israel...
