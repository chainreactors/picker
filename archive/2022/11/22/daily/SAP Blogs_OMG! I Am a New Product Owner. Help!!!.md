If you are reading this blog, there is the possibility that you are a new Product Owner searching for resources to better understand the role. My guess is that you have read the Scrum Guide only to be underwhelmed by the lack of guidance it provides regarding the Product Owner role.

You see, there was a time when the Product Owner was not considered part of the traditional Scrum team. The notion was that developers make up the Scrum team and the Product Owner, although heavily engaged with the Scrum, was not necessarily “part of the team.” In recent years, opinions have changed, and Product Owners find themselves not only part of the Scrum team, but a leader of the Agile movement. This blog’s aim is to present a realistic correspondence between a new Product Owner and a seasoned Agile coach. The correspondence platform pivots between email, instant messaging, and dialog, to make it more realistic to the reader.

Hey Jim,

It was great catching up at the last social hour. Enjoyed the SAP Agile transformation conversation and how your role as Agile coach will help new teams adjust. What a coincidence that I have recently been assigned a new project and the team will leverage the Scrum framework as their working process. I have been assigned the role of Product Owner, but I am not sure what my responsibilities to the customer and team are? I have read the Scrum Guide, but it feels a bit empty regarding how I can ensure I “maximize the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team”

Do you have time to help me understand this new role?

Honestly, I am lost on this one, so any help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Kim

Hey Kim,

Congratulations! I am more than happy to help work with you to help you understand the role of Product Owner.

I am going to start a weekly call for us to have a dedicated time to discuss your journey into the new role. I intentionally use the word “journey.” It will take time to get comfortable with the Product Owner role and with the mindset shifts that come along with it.

Let us take a step back a bit by considering the following questions:

1) What does the new role mean to you?

2) How can you help the team with their agile transformation?

In the meantime, I would recommend that you visit the [Dojo](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/how-sap-built-a-dojo-community-of-practice-to-support-a-cultural-shift-to-devops/) and start work on the Agile domain with a focus on completing the green belt. There are a lot of useful resources that will help you better understand the Agile fundamentals. You may even find help with the answers to the questions I asked above.

Looking forward to our conversation,

Jim

**OCTOBER 10TH - THE MS TEAMS MEETING HAS STARTED**

“Hi Jim”

“Hi Kim, how has the Product Owner journey been for you so far?”

“Thank you for the recommendation to visit the Dojo. I have started working through the Agile green belt curriculum and I find it extremely useful. I have been considering your questions and think I have a better understanding of what is expected of me.”

“Sounds good. What does the role mean to you so far?”

“I will be working with the customer more closely than I have on previous projects. I will be in constant communication with the customers and stakeholders to ruthlessly set priorities, surface risks and ensure that the products we are building are high quality. We will work together to build a narrative for our upcoming sprints and capture that narrative in our product backlog. This narrative will be represented by crafting “user stories”. These user stories will be hosted in the team’s product backlog.”

“You’re on the right path. The team needs to deliver customer value every sprint based on the customer priorities. Product Owners negotiate with the customer to ensure the team can deliver. They also surface any risks with the customer up front and work through them during the development process. You mentioned the product backlog. What does the product backlog mean to you?”

“The product backlog must also be high quality if we are anticipating the creation of high-quality products.”

“Yes! The product backlog acts as the team’s North star in the Scrum team’s product development journey. If the product backlog is low quality, it becomes subjective, and the team could lose sight of the priorities that were agreed upon. What are your next steps with the project?”

“I have been assigned a ScrumMaster and anticipate having my first call with the customer next week. My goal is to establish our first sprint goals and start the team’s first sprint shortly after.”

“Sounds like a plan. Feel free to reach out to me after your first sprint is underway”

“I will! Thanks again for the collaboration. Talk to you soon.

**MS TEAMS CHAT**

Kim: Hi Jim. The first sprint is well underway! The ScrumMaster is doing an excellent job leading the team through the Scrum events, but the team is pushing back against the number of Scrum meetings that have been scheduled. Any advice?

Jim: Hi Kim. You mentioned that you have found direct value in the Dojo Agile domain. Have you considered having the team achieve their green belt in the Agile domain as well?

Kim: Hmmm, that is not something I considered.

Jim: It may give you common...
