In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events (8.92 events/day) with a threat landscape dominated by **malware** with **26%**, a value slightly lower than 29% of the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/08/05/16-28-february-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/), and once again ahead of **ransomware**, down to **16%** from 21%, and **targeted attacks** with **11%**, down from 17% of March H2.

In terms of **initial access** techniques, **phishing** was still the preferred weapon with **18%**, up from 15%, ahead of the **exploitation** of generic software vulnerabilities (**9%**) and **rogue apps**(**8%**).

**Cyber crime** led the **motivations** chart with **68%**, the same value of the previous timeline, ahead of **cyber espionage** (**14%** down from 19%), and **hacktivism** with **3%**, down from 5%.

**Healthcare organizations** lead the chart of the most targeted sectors with **13%** (excluding the operations targeting multiple sectors at once), ahead of **financial**targets and organizations working in the **technology** space, both at **7%.**

Besides these trends, as always the timeline is rich of interesting events, such as [mega breaches](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2024/12/18/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-2024/) and attacks against organizations in the fintech space, so my final suggestion does not change: browse the timeline for the details of the events collected in this fortnight.
