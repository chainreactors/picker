From a historic [ban on police using face recognition](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco.html), to landmark [CCOPS](https://www.eff.org/issues/community-control-police-surveillance-ccops) [legislation](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/your-sfpd/policies/19b-surveillance-technology-policies), to the first ban in the United States of [police deploying deadly force via robot](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/victory-san-francisco-bans-killer-robotsfor-now), for several years San Francisco has been leading the way on necessary reforms over how police use technology.
