 Hello Reader,

                So today is Podcast day but I'm not going to post an episode today, instead I'm going to tell you about how the podcasts will proceed going forward.

Podcasts:

1. Forensic Lunch - The overly technical, fully nerdy and all around good for you show that dives deep into the latest and greatest tools, research and techniques is coming back.

2. The Test Kitchen - The long form test videos will alternate with the lunch. The test kitchen is coming to the cloud and other places as we look to expand our knowledge where no forensicator has fully documented before.

3. Surviving The Breach - Once a month Erik Harssema and I will be keeping things at a higher level. Surviving the Breach is a podcast devoted to helping business leaders deal with all of the things after the technical investigation is done. From materiality, privilege issues, auditors and boards we are going to talk through the all the things you need you (or your boss) to know when the worst has come to bear.

I'm excited about all three of these podcasts as it will give me some variety on topics but I'm most excited to try my hand at speaking outside of the church of DFIR and seeing if we can reach the ears of the non technical. I've found that it's very easy for all of us to agree on technical facts, but getting those who control budgets and make decisions to be informed could possibly do the most good for those around them.

The first episode will be published 1/13/25 and will be a discussion on determining whether or a breach is material or not for publicly traded companies.
