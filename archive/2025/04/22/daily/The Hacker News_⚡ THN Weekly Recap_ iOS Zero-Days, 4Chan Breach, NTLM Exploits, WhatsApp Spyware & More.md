Can a harmless click really lead to a full-blown cyberattack?

Surprisingly, yes ‚Äî and that's exactly what we saw in last week's activity. Hackers are getting better at hiding inside everyday actions: opening a file, running a project, or logging in like normal. No loud alerts. No obvious red flags. Just quiet entry through small gaps ‚Äî like a misconfigured pipeline, a trusted browser feature, or reused login tokens. These aren't just tech issues ‚Äî they're habits being exploited.

Let's walk through the biggest updates from the week and what they mean for your security.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Recently Patched Windows Flaw Comes Under Active Exploitation** ‚Äî A recently patched security flaw affecting [Windows NTLM has been exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/cve-2025-24054-under-active.html) by malicious actors to leak NTLM hashes or user passwords and infiltrate systems since March 19, 2025. The flaw, CVE-2025-24054 (CVSS score: 6.5), is a hash disclosure spoofing bug that was fixed by Microsoft last month as part of its Patch Tuesday updates. The security flaw is assessed to be a variant of CVE-2024-43451 (CVSS score: 6.5), which was patched by Microsoft in November 2024 and has also been weaponized in the wild in attacks targeting Ukraine and Colombia by threat actors like UAC-0194 and Blind Eagle.

## Stop AI-Powered Threats and Protect Sensitive Data with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI

Companies need to rethink how they protect their private and public use of AI and how they defend against AI-powered attacks. Traditional firewalls, VPNs, and public-facing IPs expose your attack surface and are no match in the AI era. It's time for a modern approach with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI.](https://thehackernews.uk/better-security-legacy-systems-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **North Korea Targets Crypto Developers with Fake Python Coding Challenges** ‚Äî The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Slow Pisces (aka Jade Sleet, PUKCHONG, TraderTraitor, and UNC4899) is [targeting](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/crypto-developers-targeted-by-python.html) developers, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector, to deliver new stealer malware under the guise of a coding assignment. These challenges require developers to run a compromised project, infecting their systems using malware named RN Loader and RN Stealer. Jade Sleet is one of the several North Korean threat activity clusters to leverage job opportunity-themed lures as a malware distributor vector, the others being Operation Dream Job, Contagious Interview, Alluring Pisces, and Moonstone Sleet.
* **Mustang Panda Targets Myanmar with New Tooling** ‚Äî The China-linked threat actor known as Mustang Panda [targeted](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/mustang-panda-targets-myanmar-with.html) an unspecified organization in Myanmar with an updated version of its signature backdoor, TONESHELL, in addition to debuting four new attack tools: two keyloggers (PAKLOG and CorKLOG), a utility for facilitating lateral movement (StarProxy), and a driver to evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) software (SplatCloak). The findings demonstrate the continued evolution of the threat actor's tradecraft to sidestep detection.
* **European Diplomats Targeted in GRAPELOADER Attacks** ‚Äî The Russian state-sponsored threat actor known as APT29 has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/apt29-deploys-grapeloader-malware.html) to an advanced phishing campaign that's targeting diplomatic entities across Europe with a new variant of WINELOADER and a previously unreported malware loader codenamed GRAPELOADER. The attacks involve the use of phishing emails that employ wine-tasting lures to entice message recipients into opening booby-trapped ZIP archives that lead to GRAPELOADER, a malware loader that's capable of downloading and retrieving the next stage payload.
* **Apple Fixes Two Actively Exploited iOS Flaws Used in Sophisticated Targeted Attacks** ‚Äî Apple has [released fixes](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/apple-patches-two-actively-exploited.html) to address two security flaws that it said have come under active exploitation in the wild. The flaws, a memory corruption vulnerability in the Core Audio framework (CVE-2025-31200) and an unspecified vulnerability in RPAC (CVE-2025-31201), are said to have been weaponized in an "extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS." However, the exact details surrounding the nature of the exploitation and who may have been targeted are not known. The issues have been addressed in iOS 18.4.1, iPadOS 18.4.1, macOS Sequoia 15.4.1, tvOS 18.4.1, and visionOS 2.4.1.
* **UNC5174 Targets Linux Systems with SNOWLIGHT and VShell** ‚Äî A cyberspy crew with ties to China's Ministry of State Security has [infected](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/chinese-hackers-target-linux-systems.html) global organizations with a stealthy remote access trojan (RAT) called VShell to enable its espionage and access resale campaigns. The attacks, attributed to UNC5174, use a mix of custom and open-source malware, including a dropper named SNOWLIGHT that paves the way for the in-memory malware VShell. Besides using VShell, UNC5174 has also used a new command-and-control infrastructure since January 2025. Primary targets of the campaign consis...
