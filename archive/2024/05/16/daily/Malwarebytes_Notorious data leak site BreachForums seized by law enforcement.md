# Notorious data leak site BreachForums seized by law enforcement

Posted: May 15, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

BreachForums—probably the largest [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web) marketplace for stolen data to be leaked and sold—has been seized by law enforcement.

Now, both the regular and the TOR domain of BreachForums are plastered with a message telling visitors the site is now under control of the FBI.

![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Seized_notice.jpeg)

The FBI [said](https://breachforums.ic3.gov/) BreachForums and its predecessor Raidforums was:

> “…operating as a clear-net marketplace for cybercriminals to buy, sell, and trade contraband, including stolen access devices, means of identification, [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) tools, breached databases, and other illegal services.”

Raidforums ran from early 2015 until February 2022. The first iteration of BreachForums was then set up in March 2022 and ran until March 2023, when US law enforcement [arrested the alleged operator](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/alleged-breachforums-owner-pompompurin-arrested-on-cybercrime-charges/), “Pompompurin”, in New York.

A new administrator then rose to the occasion and said they were working on a plan to get the forum through the problems caused by that arrest. But on March 21, 2023, the new administrator announced the decision to shut BreachForums down.

Another forum administrator going by the account name “Baphomet” then took over.

According to [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seize-breachforums-hacking-forum-used-to-leak-stolen-data/), the FBI has also seized the site’s Telegram channel, with law enforcement sending messages to the channel on behalf of the forum’s operator “Baphomet”.

[![Message to BreachForum's Telegram channel that says "This Telegram chat is under control of the FBI. The BreachForums website has been taken down by the FBI and DOJ with assistance from international partners. We are reviewing the site's backend data. If you have information to report about cyber criminal activity on BreachForums please contact us."](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/telegram-seizure.webp)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seize-breachforums-hacking-forum-used-to-leak-stolen-data/)

BreachForums was in use just last week for a big name breach when a cybercriminal [put up for sale](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/dell-notifies-customers-about-data-breach) breached customer data taken from Dell between 2017-2024.
