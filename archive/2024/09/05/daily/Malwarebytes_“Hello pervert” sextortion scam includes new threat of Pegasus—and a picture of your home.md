# “Hello pervert” sextortion scam includes new threat of Pegasus—and a picture of your home

Posted: September 4, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

After using passwords obtained from one of the countless breaches as a lure to trick victims into paying, the “Hello pervert” [sextortion](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/financial-sextortion-scams-on-the-rise) scammers have recently introduced two new pressure tactics: Name-dropping the infamous [Pegasus spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/pegasus-spyware-creator-ordered-to-reveal-code-used-to-spy-on-whatsapp-users) and adding pictures of your home environment.

They do this to add credibility to the false claims that the scammers have been watching your online behavior and caught you red-handed during activities that you would like to keep private amongst your friends and family.

The email usually starts with “Hello pervert” and then goes on to claim that the target has been watching pornographic content. The scammers often claim to have footage of what you were watching and what you were doing while watching.

To stop the sender from spreading the incriminating footage, the target will have to pay the scammer, or else they will send it to everyone in their email contacts list.

More recently, scammers have started increasing their threats by mentioning a powerful [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) called “Pegasus.” Several versions of these [scam emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/phishing-email) have included the following text:

> Have you heard of Pegasus? This is a spyware program that installs on computers and smartphones and allows hackers to monitor the activity of device owners. It provides access to your webcam, messengers, emails, call records, etc. It works well on [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus), iOS, and Windows.

Though Pegasus is indeed a powerfully invasive spyware tool, the threat of its use, as included in these scam emails, is entirely empty. This is because Pegasus has never been observed outside of a surveillance campaign carried out, specifically, by governments. Time and time again, Pegasus has been used by oppressive government regimes to [spy on political dissidents, human rights activists, and watchdog journalists](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/07/pegasus-spyware-has-been-here-for-years-we-must-stop-ignoring-it). There is essentially no proof that such a closely-guarded spyware has ended up in the hands of everyday scammers.

But the pressure tactics don’t end with Pegasus, as many of these emails include an old (or active) password that a scam target has used in the past. Here, this isn’t some act of advanced [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker). Instead, it is likely that the scammers bought your password from other cybercriminals that obtained them during one of the countless [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) that hit company after company every week.

When scammers have access to such data, it may also include your physical address. With that knowledge, scammers have increased their threats by simply adding a photograph of your personal neighborhood by looking it up online. For most places in inhabited area...
