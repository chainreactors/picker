Over the past decade, banks have not escaped the rising tide of ever-increasing sophisticated cyberattacks, and many of them have been hacked and lost billions of US dollars in serious intrusions, with the most famous threat actors that pulled off successful bank heists including the likes of [Carbanak](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/the-great-bank-robbery-carbanak-apt/3598/) and the [Lazarus Group North Korean APT](https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware).

The common thread across all recent major bank cyber-heists was that they usually targeted organizations in North America and Europe before attackers switched their targeting to Asia and Latin America. But as banks elsewhere have seriously upgraded their network defenses, threat actors are now turning their eyes toward Africa, a region that has been left relatively unscathed in previous years.

According to a [joint report](https://explore.group-ib.com/opera1er-eng/report-opera1er-eng) published this week by security firm Group-IB and Orange's CERT team, a French-speaking cybergroup group tracked as [OPERA1ER](https://www.group-ib.com/resources/threat-research/opera1er.html) (*also known as [Common Raven](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/common_raven) or the [DESKTOP-group](http://c-apt-ure.blogspot.com/2022/01/who-is-desktop-group.html)*) has been wreaking havoc across the continent for four years, between 2018 and 2021.

Researchers said they linked the group to 35 intrusions at different organizations across 15 countries, with most of the attacks targeting African banks.

Group-IB and Orange researchers said that while the group used basic phishing attacks and off-the-shelf remote access trojans to gain an initial foothold in their victim's networks, OPERA1ER has exhibited both restraint and patience.

Some intrusions lasted months, as the group moved laterally across bank systems while they observed and mapped the internal network topology before springing their attack.

[Rustam Mirkasymov](https://twitter.com/ta1ien), Head of Group-IB's Threat Research in Europe, told *RiskyBizNews* that the group typically waited and sought to identify and compromise bank systems that handled money transfers.

Once they reached these sensitive systems, the group would work with a network of around 400 money mules to orchestrate a coordinated transfer of funds from bank accounts to mule accounts, with the money mules withdrawing the stolen funds from their accounts via ATMs in a coordinated ATM cash-out before bank employees could react.

Mirkasymov said they linked OPERA1ER intrusions to bank heists totaling $11 million, but the group is suspected of stealing more than $30 million, although not all incidents have been formally confirmed.

### Breaches and hacks

**Ransomware attack cripples 75 German schools:** Seventy-five schools across Bavaria—with 55 schools in Munich alone—have been cut off from their internal databases after a [ransomware attack](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/hackerangriff-wurde-mutmasslich-durch-phishing-mail-ausgeloest%2CTLYjv4x) hit a server operated by the Munich-Land province. Officials said they discovered the ransomware attack as soon as it happened, after a mysterious server restart, and shut down the affected system until remediation. Officials believe the attacker gained access to the server after phishing one of their employees.

**Ransomware cripples Polish hospital:** A ransomware attack this week has crippled the activity of a major hospital in Lodz, Poland's third-largest city. According to [local media](https://www.rynekzdrowia.pl/E-zdrowie/Atak-hakerow-na-Centrum-Zdrowia-Matki-Polki-NFZ-ma-pieniadze-na-cyberbezpieczenstwo%2C238737%2C7.html), the attack took down the hospital's entire IT network, forcing doctors to issue prescriptions on paper. Tomographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and other computerized testing equipment have been down since the attack, but [officials](https://twitter.com/MZ_GOV_PL/status/1588143550683906048) hope to have everything back up by the end of the week. The attack comes two weeks after the Polish government made more than 200 million zlots (~$41.5 million) available to healthcare organizations as a [cybersecurity upgrade fund](https://www.nfz.gov.pl/aktualnosci/aktualnosci-centrali/bezpieczne-dane-pacjentow-sa-pieniadze-z-nfz-dla-szpitali-na-cyberbezpieczenstwo%2C8278.html).

**Boeing subsidiary ransomware attack:** [Jeppesen](https://liveandletsfly.com/boeing-jeppesen-ransomware-attack/), a wholly owned Boeing subsidiary that builds aircraft navigation databases and flight planning applications, also appears to be dealing with a ransomware attack.

**Deribit crypto-heist:** Cryptocurrency exchange Deribit [said](https://archive.ph/1Jekc) it was hacked this week after a threat actor hacked its hot wallet and stole $28 million worth of cryptocurrency.

**Skyward crypto-heist:** DeFi platform Skyward Finance [confirmed](https://archive.ph/GYIqR) on Wednesday a [report](https://archive.ph/VSHEV) that a hacker exploited a vulnerability in its smart contract and stole $3 million worth of cryptocurrency.
