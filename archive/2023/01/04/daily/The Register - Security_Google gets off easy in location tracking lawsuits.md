## $29.5 million and we don't have to admit wrongdoing? Where do we sign?

Google has settled two more of the many location tracking lawsuits it had been facing over the past year, and this time the search giant is getting an even better deal: just $29.5 million to resolve complaints filed in Indiana and Washington DC with no admission of wrongdoing.

The cases filed in the Midwestern state and the capital are similar to those settled elsewhere in the US in the last 12 months and center on allegations that Google deceived users into handing over location data, which it then turned into billions in advertising dollars.

Karl Racine, attorney general of Washington DC until his term ended yesterday, called the settlement [[PDF](https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-12/2022.12.29%20DC-Google%20Settlement%20Agreement%20%5Bfor%20signature%5D.pdf)] a win because "Google must also make clear to consumers how their location data is collected, stored, and used."
