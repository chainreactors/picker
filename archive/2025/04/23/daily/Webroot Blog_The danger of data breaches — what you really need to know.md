In today’s digital world, your personal data is like cold hard cash, and that’s why cyberthieves are always looking for ways to steal it. Whether it’s an email address, a credit card number, or even medical records, your [personal information](https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information) is incredibly valuable in the wrong hands.

For hackers, breaking into a company database is like hitting the mother lode, giving them access to millions of personal records. Why? Because whether you know it or not, many companies are collecting and storing your private data. Think about all the information you hand over when you order something online, like your full name, your credit card number, your home address, and maybe even your birthdate just to snag an extra discount. If a company you do business with becomes part of a data breach, cybercriminals may have full access to your confidential information.

Unfortunately, data breaches are on the rise and affecting more companies and consumers than ever. In 2024, more than 1.3 billion people received notices that their information was exposed in a data breach. Chances are you’ve received at least one of these letters, which means you have been put at risk for identity theft and major financial losses.

## What are data breaches and how do they happen?

Data breaches occur when sensitive, protected, or confidential data is hacked or leaked from a company or organization. Sometimes businesses are targeted because they have outdated or weak security. While no industry is immune, some sectors are more likely to become victims of breaches because of the sensitive nature of the data they handle. Here are some of the most likely targets for access to consumer data:

* **Healthcare organizations**: Healthcare companies are a prime target for cybercrime due to the large amounts of sensitive data they store, which includes personal information and medical records. In 2024, there were 14 data breaches involving 1 million or more healthcare records. The [largest breach](https://www.hipaajournal.com/biggest-healthcare-data-breaches-2024/#:~:text=Change%20Healthcare&text=Prior%20to%20encrypting%20files%2C%20the,paid%20a%20%2422%20million%20ransom.) affected an estimated 190 million people and a ransom of 22 million dollars was collected by the hackers.
* **Financial services industry:** Banks, insurance companies and other financial organizations offer a wealth of opportunity for hackers who can use stolen bank account and credit card information for their own financial gain. In 2024, mortgage lender LoanDepot was the victim of a cyberattack that compromised the information of more than [16 million individuals](https://www.securityweek.com/ransomware-attack-cost-loandepot-27-million/).
* **Retail and e-commerce:** [Retail and ecommerce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/10/10/shoppers-face-a-growing-risk-from-cybercrime-and-retailers-must-do-more/) businesses are vulnerable to breaches because they handle and store vast amounts of customer payment information, including addresses, credit card numbers and more. Many retailers operate both brick-and-mortar stores and ecommerce platforms and rely on a variety of mobile apps, PoS (point-of-sale) systems, and cloud-based platforms, which creates more entry points for hackers to exploit.
* **Tech companies**: With access to user data, software systems and intellectual property, tech firms are frequent targets. [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/06/20/has-apple-been-hacked-hacker-claims-june-2024-breach-exposes-source-code/), Twitter and Meta have all reportedly been victims of cyberattacks.
* **Government agencies**: Because government organizations store highly sensitive information, social security numbers, they are considered especially high-value targets for cyberattacks.

## The most-wanted data

The type of information stolen in data breaches varies depending on the organization, but here’s a list of the kind of data cybercriminals are seeking:

* **Emails and passwords**
* **Payment and credit card information**
* **Medical records and health data**
* **Social Security numbers**
* **Driver’s license numbers**
* **Banking details and account numbers**

## What hackers do with your data

Once data is exposed in a breach, cybercriminals will test your usernames and password combinations across thousands of sites, knowing that most people recycle their emails and passwords. Here are just some of the ways hackers exploit your stolen information:

* **Identity theft**: Hackers use your personal info to impersonate you. They can open accounts in your name, apply for loans, and even file false tax returns.
* **Selling it on the dark web**: Stolen data is frequently sold to the highest bidder on dark web marketplaces. This makes it accessible to a worldwide network of criminals.
* **Phishing and social engineering**: Using your personal information, scammers can craft more convincing [phishing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams) emails or messages to trick you into giving up even more sensitive details, like passwords and PIN numbers.
* **Financial exploitation**: When your credit card numbers or bank account details are compromised, cyber thieves can use that information to make financial transactions in your name. They can rack up charg...
