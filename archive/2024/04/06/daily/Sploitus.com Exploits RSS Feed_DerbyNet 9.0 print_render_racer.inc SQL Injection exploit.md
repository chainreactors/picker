CVE ID: CVE-2024-30923

Description:
An SQL Injection vulnerability has been discovered in DerbyNet version 9.0, specifically within the `print/render/racer.inc` component. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and disclose sensitive information by exploiting improper sanitization of the `where` clause in Racer Document Rendering.

Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection

Vendor of Product: DerbyNet - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base: DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component: print/render/racer.inc

Attack Type: Remote

Impact:
- Code execution: True
- Information Disclosure: True

Attack Vectors:
The vulnerability is present in the `print/render/racer.inc` component of DerbyNet, due to insufficient sanitization of the `where` parameter within the URL. Attackers can manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL commands through the `where` parameter, as demonstrated in the following URL:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/render-document.php/award/GoldCupAwardDocument?where=1`

This manipulation could lead to unauthorized access to database information and potential code execution on the server hosting the application.
