# Sandfly Security Named Finalist in CyberShark Pitch Competition

27 August 2025

News

*At Black Hat 2025, a panel of CISOs evaluated pitches from emerging cybersecurity companies and recognized Sandfly Security as a round 2 finalist*

Sandfly Security has been [selected as a finalist in the 2025 CyberShark Pitch Competition](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250827020572/en/CyberShark-Pitch-Competition-Names-Finalists-from-Second-Round-of-2025-Event-Series). A panel of CISO judges from a range of industries, including technology, financial services, healthcare, and retail evaluated our pitch at Black Hat 2025 and voted to advance Sandfly based on our agentless endpoint detection and response (EDR) for Linux.

## **Linux security needs a fundamentally different approach**

![](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)![](data:image/jpeg;base64...)![](https://www.datocms-assets.com/56687/1756319960-sandfly.png?auto=format&dpr=2&q=60&w=920)

This recognition validates what our customers already know: traditional agent-based EDR solutions have many problems supporting Linux. Linux is not Windows, and shoehorning Windows antivirus approaches onto Linux creates performance impacts, compatibility issues, and coverage gaps.

The CISO judges recognized that Sandfly’s innovative Sandfly's agentless architecture addresses the problems that plague Linux security:

* **Instant deployment** without compromising system stability or needing endpoint agents
* **Widest compatibility** across nearly all Linux distributions, from modern cloud systems to those over a decade old
* **Lowest performance impact** with no kernel drivers or related risks
* **Universal coverage** including embedded systems, appliances, and air-gapped networks

## **What's Next**

On October 16, 2025, Sandfly will advance to the final round of the competition. More than 3,000 CyberRisk Collaborative members are invited to judge the final round.

## **Experience Drama-Free Linux Security**

Don't wait for October. Try Sandfly's agentless Linux security today – no agents, no performance impact, no drama.
