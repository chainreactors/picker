# Nyx

This repository contains an overview of the Nyx project. The Nyx project consists of its core component, a modified version of QEMU that allows to take and reset VM snapshots thousands of times per second, a modified version of KVM to enabled nested fuzzing and Intel-PT tracing during fuzzing, as well as some auxilary tools such as Spec-Fuzzer, a fuzzer specificially designed for fuzzing complex interactive targets. Spec-Fuzzer is capable of fuzzing anything that runs inside of KVM. This includes applications, kernels and even hypervisors - Nyx can be used to easily build fuzzers for almost anything.

## Repositories

Nyx framework consists in total of the following modules.

#### Core

* [libnyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/libnyx) - a library that you can readily use to run, snapshot and restore VMs to build your own fuzzers.
* [packer](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/packer) - a tool that allows to bundle and pack targets into the type of VM we mostly use for ring-3 fuzzing.
* [QEMU-Nyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/QEMU-Nyx) - a modified version of QEMU that allows to take and restore snapshot, as well as communication via shared memory and hypercalls.
* [KVM-Nyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/KVM-Nyx) - a modified version of KVM that enables Nyx's ability to use Intel-PT.
* [libxdc](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/libxdc) - the fastest Int...
