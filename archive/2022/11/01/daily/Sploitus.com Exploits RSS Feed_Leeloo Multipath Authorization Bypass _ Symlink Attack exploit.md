========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We discovered two local vulnerabilities (an authorization bypass and a
symlink attack) in multipathd, a daemon that is running as root in the
default installation of (for example) Ubuntu Server:

https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/device-mapper-multipathing-introduction
https://github.com/opensvc/multipath-tools

We combined these two vulnerabilities with a third vulnerability, in
another package that is also installed by default on Ubuntu Server, and
obtained full root privileges on Ubuntu Server 22.04; other releases are
probably also exploitable. We will publish this third vulnerability, and
the complete details of this local privilege escalation, in an upcoming
advisory.

The authorization bypass (CVE-2022-41974) was introduced in February
2017 (version 0.7.0) by commit 9acda0c ("Perform socket client uid check
on IPC commands"), but earlier versions perform no authorization checks
at all: any unprivileged local user can issue any privileged command to
multipathd.

The symlink attack (CVE-2022-41973) was introduced in May 2018 (version
0.7.7) by commit 65d0a63 ("functions to indicate mapping failure in
/dev/shm"); the vulnerable code was hardened significantly in May 2020
(version 0.8.5) by commit 40ee3ea ("simplify failed wwid code"), but it
remains exploitable nonetheless.

========================================================================
CVE-2022-41974: Authorization bypass
========================================================================

The multipathd daemon listens for client connections on an abstract Unix
socket (conveniently, the multipathd binary itself can act as a client,
if executed with non-option arguments; we use this feature extensively
in this advisory to connect and send commands to the multipathd daemon):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ps -ef | grep 'multipath[d]'
root 377 1 0 13:55 ? 00:00:00 /sbin/multipathd -d -s

$ ss -l -x | grep 'multipathd'
u_str LISTEN 0 4096 @/org/kernel/linux/storage/multipathd 18105
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The commands sent by a client to multipathd are composed of keywords,
and internally, each keyword is identified by a different bit; for
example, "list" is 1 (1<<0), "add" is 2 (1<<1), and "path" (which
requires a parameter) is 65536 (1<<16):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
155 load_keys (void)
...
163 r += add_key(keys, "list", LIST, 0);
164 r += add_key(keys, "show", LIST, 0);
165 r += add_key(keys, "add", ADD, 0);
...
183 r += add_key(keys, "path", PATH, 1);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
53 #define LIST (1ULL << __LIST)
54 #define ADD (1ULL << __ADD)
..
69 #define PATH (1ULL << __PATH)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 enum {
7 __LIST, /* 0 */
8 __ADD,
..
23 __PATH,
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In turn, each command is associated with a handler (a C function) by its
fingerprint -- the bitwise OR of its constituent keywords; for example,
the command "list path PARAM" is associated with cli_list_path() by the
fingerprint 65537 (LIST+PATH=1+65536), and the command "add path PARAM"
is associated with cli_add_path() by the fingerprint 65538
(ADD+PATH=2+65536):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1522 void init_handler_callbacks(void)
....
1527 set_handler_callback(LIST+PATH, cli_list_path);
....
1549 set_handler_callback(ADD+PATH, cli_add_path);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
321 static uint64_t
322 fingerprint(const struct _vector *vec)
...
325 uint64_t fp = 0;
...
331 vector_foreach_slot(vec, kw, i)
332 fp += kw->code;
333
334 return fp;
------------------------------------------------------------------------
89 static struct handler *
90 find_handler (uint64_t fp)
..
95 vector_foreach_slot (handlers, h, i)
96 if (h->fingerprint == fp)
97 return h;
98
99 return NULL;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When multipathd receives a command from a client, it first performs an
authentication check and an authorization check (both at line 491):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
431 static int client_state_machine(struct client *c, struct vectors *vecs,
...
485 case CLT_PARSE:
486 c->error = parse_cmd(c);
487 if (!c->error) {
...
491 if (!c->is_root && kw->code != LIST) {
492 c->error = -EPERM;
...
495 }
496 }
497 if (c->error)
...
501 else
502 set_client_state(c, CLT_WORK);
...
522 case CLT_WORK:
523 c->error = execute_handler(c, vecs);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Authentication: if the client's UID (obtained from SO_PEERCRED) is 0
(i.e., if is_root is true), then the client is privileged; otherwise,
it is unprivileged.

- Authorization: if the client is privileged, it is allowed to execute
any commands; otherwise, only unprivileged LIST commands are allowed
(i.e., commands whose first keyword is either "list" or "show").

Attentive readers may have noticed that multipathd does not, in fact,
calculate the fingerprint of a command by bitwise-ORing its constituent
keywords, but by arithmetic-ADDing them (at line 332). While these two
operations are equivalent if no keyword is repeated, we (attackers) can
send a seemingly unprivileged command (whose first keyword is "list")
but whose fingerprint matches a privileged command (by repeating the
"list" keyword): we can exploit this flaw to bypass multipathd's
authorization check.

For example, we are not allowed to execute "add path PARAM" (whose
fingerprint is 2+65536=65538) because the first keyword is not "list",
but we are allowed to execute the equivalent "list list path PARAM"
(whose fingerprint is also 1+1+65536=65538, instead of 1|1|65536=65537)
because the first keyword is "list" (the multipathd daemon below replies
"blacklisted" because PARAM is an invalid path, not because the command
is denied):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ multipathd add path PARAM
permission deny: need to be root

$ multipathd list list path PARAM
blacklisted
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This authorization bypass greatly enlarges the attack surface of
multipathd: 34 privileged command handlers become available to local
attackers, in addition to the 23 unprivileged command handlers that are
normally available. We audited only a few of these command handlers,
because we quickly discovered a low-hanging vulnerability (a symlink
attack) in one of them.

========================================================================
CVE-2022-41973: Symlink attack
========================================================================

multipathd operates insecurely, as root, in /dev/shm (a sticky,
world-writable directory similar to /tmp). The vulnerable code (in
mark_failed_wwid()) may be executed during the normal lifetime of
multipathd, but a local attacker can force its execution by exploiting
the authorization bypass CVE-2022-41...
