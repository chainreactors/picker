## Friday Squid Blogging: Chinese Squid Fishing

China [claims](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202210/07/WS633fd992a310fd2b29e7b371.html) that it is “engaging in responsible squid fishing”:

> Chen Xinjun, dean of the College of Marine Sciences at Shanghai Ocean University, made the remarks in response to recent accusations by foreign reporters and actor Leonardo DiCaprio that China is depleting its own fish stock and that Chinese boats have sailed to other waters to continue deep-sea fishing, particularly near Ecuador, affecting local fish stocks in the South American nation.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Israeli cyber intel firm shines bright light on new, shadowy cybercrime collective

<https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-cyber-intel-firm-shines-bright-light-on-new-shadowy-cybercrime-collective/>

“There is a very thriving community of threat actors that are earning billions of dollars every year from cyberattacks — which is the new form of being a thief, a burglar, where you can take something that is not yours and try to make money off of it,” says Yochai Corem, CEO of Cyberint Technologies Ltd., an Israel-based company specializing in cyber-intelligence.

Many illicit enterprises only offer one or two services — things like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which overload a webpage with traffic to take down servers, or hacking databases — but Atlas offered a full menu of services.

Its DDoS attacks were one of its most popular services, and it provided solid proof of execution for €20 ($19.52) per victim, Gihon found. Atlas also offered leaked databases from all over the world, and in different sectors like finance, government, education, manufacturing, and tech, starting at €15 ($14.64).

Most notably, the group appeared to be organized much like a spy agency unit: a top-down hierarchy where only its leader, Mr. Eagle, seemed to know the full scope of the operation at play, while the rest of the threat actors are essentially hired guns carrying out tasks based on specific capabilities but on a need-to-know basis.”

This might be of interest to folks around here. Specific to England and Wales.

@ pup vas / vas pup, ALL,

Re : Russian Federation claims at UN.

> now RF claims in UN that UK did it or participate in it. US exonerated.

I guess you are refereing to this story,

‘https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/royal-navy-slams-russia-for-accusing-uk-of-blowing-up-nord-stream/

Let’s be honest the Russian Federation is frequently making claims, most of which have no actual evidence, circumstantial evidence, or even substance. Just as the US has done frequently with the gang of four, but only one at a time cyber attackers (China, Iran, North Korea, Russia). Even when we know that France, India and Pakistan have very definately cyber-attacked the US.

It’s why you need to do a “follow the money” type analysis. As I pointed out if you look at it from a rational actor perspective it was very unlikely to be Russia, with nothing to gain by it and a lot to loose by taking the pipe lines off of the table. If you analyze the UK we are overly dependent on natural gas as our primary energy source, and we are piping it in from Norway. The loss of the Nord Streams immediately has a significant effect on the price and availability of Norwegian gad thus for the UK it would be “shooting themselves in the foot”.

You can go around a whole list of nations including Iran and China, and you find that the US gains the most both politically abd economically by the destruction of both Nord Stream pipelines, also some other Eastern EU nations might benifit via “transit fees”.

But you also need to consider a basic “truth” that the UK and US have stratigic plans to destroy nearly all infrastructure in and around Africa, Australia, China, the EU, Middle East, Russia, UK, US and most other parts of the globe. That is infrastructure of potential friend or foe alike, it’s part of the nature of “statehood” and goes back long before “The Prince”, “Art of War”, etc.

Remember that “Great Britain and France” the respecive eaters of beef and frogs legs… Also harbingers of sexual disease and all sorts of other ills and pestilence have been fighting like “brother and sister” for centuries dragging the rest of the world in it’s wake. And… more recently have been pouring fresh fuel on what had become a smoldering pile of vanities, not a bonfire it might become again, in the very near future. Most nations have a rival nation they scrap against, but will gladly stand side by side against another foe. The secret to statehood success is knowing which way to turn the knife, and where the most mortal of wounds can be struck quickly and surely and knowing that your friends rather more than your foes know you know this as well, after all what else is diplomacy realy all about…

So my advice is keep an eye on the “money trail” and who is acting in their own best interests as rational or apparently irrational actors with respect to any given audience.

@Clive

There was gut feeling on my side on that. U...
