## Abstract

> In this talk, weâll dissect common anti-forensics strategiesâlike USN Journal deletion, shellbag clearing, timestamp manipulation, and disabling access time updatesâand reveal how they are often executed ineffectively or misunderstood.

> From registry edits like masking user account activity to configuring Windows EFS, weâll examine why these techniques often fail against modern investigative workflows and how defenders use these âfootprints of erasureâ to uncover malicious intent.

> Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of what works and what doesnât and how to identify these techniques during incident response. Whether youâre an IR consultant, security analyst, or blue teamer, this talk offers actionable knowledge to outsmart adversarial anti-forensics tactics.
