[Threat Spotlight](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-spotlight/)

* Cisco Talos has observed an ongoing malware campaign that seeks to infect victims with a multi-stage malware framework, implemented in PowerShell and C#, which we are referring to as “PS1Bot.”
* PS1Bot features a modular design, with several modules delivered used to perform a variety of malicious activities on infected systems, including information theft, keylogging, reconnaissance and the establishment of persistent system access.
* PS1Bot has been designed with stealth in mind, minimizing persistent artifacts left on infected systems and incorporating in-memory execution techniques to facilitate execution of follow-on modules without requiring them to be written to disk.
* PS1Bot distribution campaigns have been extremely active since early 2025, with new samples being observed frequently throughout the year.
* The information stealer module implementation leverages wordlists embedded into the stealer to enumerate files containing passwords and seed phrases that can be used to access cryptocurrency wallets, which the stealer also attempts to exfiltrate from infected systems.

## Campaign Overview

Cisco Talos has been monitoring an ongoing malware campaign that has been active throughout 2025. The campaign appears to be leveraging malvertising to direct victims to a multi-stage malware framework, implemented in PowerShell and C#, that possesses robust functionality, including the ability to deliver follow-on modules including an information stealer, keylogger, screen capture collector and more. It also establishes persistence to continue operations following system reboots. The design of this malware framework appears to attempt to minimize artifacts left on infected systems by facilitating the delivery and execution of modules in-memory, without requiring them to be written to disk. Due to similarities in the design and implementation with the malware family [AHK Bot](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/highlighting-ta866-asylum-ambuscade/), we are referring to this PowerShell-based malware as “PS1Bot.”

This campaign has been extremely active, with new samples being observed continuously over the past several months. The cluster of malicious activity associated with this campaign also overlaps with prior reporting, including reporting on [Skitnet](https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/skitnet/overview#heading-1000). While Talos has not observed delivery of the Skitnet binary in any of the infection chains we analyzed, the PowerShell implementation described in that reporting appears to match the components delivered throughout the infection chain in this case as well. We have also observed significant overlap in the C2 infrastructure used in both cases. Likewise, we have observed code and indicator overlap with previously [reported](https://x.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1882448037030584611) malvertising campaigns.

### Delivery

The victim is initially delivered a compressed archive. The file names Talos observed in the wild are consistent with what is typically seen during search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and/or malvertising campaigns, where the file name matches the keyword phrase being targeted in the campaigns:

* chapter 8 medicare benefit policy manual.zip
* Counting Canadian Money Worksheets Pdf.zip.e49
* zebra gx430t manual.zip.081
* kosher food list pdf (1).zip.c9a
* pambu panchangam 2024-25 pdf.zip.a7a

Prior [reporting](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1mf8o87/seo_poisoning_leading_to_malware/) on social media further strengthens this assessment, where researchers have observed the malvertising campaigns leading to the compressed archives delivered in this campaign.

Inside of the compressed archive is a single file called “FULL DOCUMENT.js” that functions as a downloader, retrieving the next stage of the infection. In the cases analyzed, the JS file contained VBScript, which employed a variety of obfuscation methods throughout 2025. Below is an example of one of the more simplistic examples observed recently.

### Stage 1 retrieval

When executed, the malware retrieves a JScript scriptlet from an attacker controlled server, the contents of which are then executed.

Figure 2. Example JScript scriptlet contents.

This script is responsible for performing the environmental setup needed for subsequent malware operations to function properly. This includes writing a PowerShell script to `C:\ProgramData\` (`ntu.ps1` in this case) and executing the script contents written to the file created in the previous step and redacted for space in the previous screenshot. This PowerShell script obtains the serial number of the C:\ drive and uses it to construct a URL, which it uses to attempt to establish a connection to the command and control (C2) server to retrieve additional malicious content to execute. Any PowerShell content received is then passed to Invoke-Expression (IEX) and executed within the existing PowerShell process. This is repeated in a loop with `Sleep()` delays added between each i...
