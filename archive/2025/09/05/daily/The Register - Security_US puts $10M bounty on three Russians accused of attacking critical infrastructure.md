## Seven-year-old Cisco vuln that remains inexplicably unpatched is their way in

The US State Department has put a $10 million bounty on the heads of three Russians accused of being intelligence agents hacking America's critical infrastructure - primarily via old Cisco kit, it seems.

The alert directly connects them to reports of the Russian Federal Security Service's (FSB) Center 16 - aka Berserk Bear - accused of using a flaw (CVE-2018-0171) Cisco [patched](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2) in 2018, but attackers recently exploited it in the Salt Typhoon hacking campaign, which the FBI [warns](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/28/fbi_cyber_cop_salt_typhoon/) stole data from 'nearly every American,' though investigators attribute the attack to the Chinese.

Prosecutors accuse Marat Valeryevich Tyukov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov, and Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulovof, of targeting over 500 energy companies in 135 countries, using the ancient Cisco flaw to hijack thousands of networking devices to harvest information and install malware.
