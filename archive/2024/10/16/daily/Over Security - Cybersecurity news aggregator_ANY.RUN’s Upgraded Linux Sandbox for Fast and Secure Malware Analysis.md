ANY.RUN’s Upgraded Linux Sandbox
for Fast and Secure Malware Analysis

At [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=updated_linux&utm_term=151024&utm_content=linktolanding), we’re always working to improve our services, and this time, we’ve focused on making our [Linux sandbox](https://any.run/platforms/linux/) even better. We’ve fine-tuned every detail to ensure it runs as smoothly and reliably as our [Windows](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows-10-sandbox/) environment.

From bug fixes to feature enhancements, our Linux sandbox is now more powerful and stable than ever, giving you a seamless experience when analyzing Linux malware.

## What’s Updated in ANY.RUN’s Linux Sandbox?

We’ve packed our latest update with powerful new features and improvements that upgrade both performance and usability.

Here’s what’s new in our Linux sandbox and how these enhancements benefit you:

**Stable Chrome browser by default**: We’ve integrated a stable version of Chrome as the default browser for Linux environments. This ensures smoother, faster browsing and more reliable interaction with suspicious websites during your analysis sessions.

**Improved process tree performance**: We’ve eliminated the lag that previously occurred when navigating the [process tree](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/advanced-process-details/). Now, you can explore process details without any delays, making malware behavior analysis much more efficient.

**Additional file uploads for Linux**: This means that you can now upload files in real time while an analysis session is running, enabling a more dynamic investigation process. Instead of having to restart or set up a new session for each file, you can simply upload more files during the current session.

**File events tracking**: This feature allows users to monitor and log every action the malware performs on files within the Linux sandbox environment. For example, if the malware creates, modifies, deletes, or moves files, those actions are now captured and presented in the analysis report.

Now you can get a clearer view of how the malware interacts with the file system, providing deeper insights into the malware’s behavior and making it easier to trace malicious activities.

**Clipboard feature**: A new clipboard function has been introduced, allowing you to copy and paste content directly within the sandbox. This small addition significantly improves workflow and efficiency during interactive sessions.

*VM Clipboard in Linux sandbox*

**Improved Locale (OS Language) selection:** We’ve enhanced the **Locale (OS Language) choice** feature in the Linux sandbox, making it more reliable and error-free. Now, during configuration, you can easily select the desired locale from the dropdown menu, ensuring that the operating system language is set correctly for your analysis session.

This improvement is crucial because malware often behaves differently depending on the system’s language settings. For example, some malware may only activate in specific locales, or attackers may target systems based on region-specific characteristics. By choosing the correct...
