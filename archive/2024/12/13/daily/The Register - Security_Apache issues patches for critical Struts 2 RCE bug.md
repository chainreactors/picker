We now know the remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 disclosed back in November carries a near-maximum severity rating following the publication of the CVE.

According to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which published the CVE on Wednesday, Apache scored CVE-2024-53677 a 9.5 using the CVSSv4 framework while Tenable noted a 9.8 rating using CVSSv3 – take your pick.

Considering remote attackers could exploit the vulnerability without requiring any privileges, combined with the high impact to system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, it's likely the Apache Foundation withheld the juiciest details to allow customers to upgrade to a safe version (Struts 6.4.0 or greater).
