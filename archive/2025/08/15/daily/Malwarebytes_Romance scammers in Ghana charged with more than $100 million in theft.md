# Romance scammers in Ghana charged with more than $100 million in theft

Posted: August 14, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The [Department of Justice (DOJ) extradited and indicted 4 Ghanaian nationals](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghanaian-nationals-extradited-roles-criminal-organization-stole-more-100-million) for allegedly stealing more than $100 million, mainly through romance scams and [business email compromises](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/business-email-compromise-attack-imitates-vendors-targets-supply-chains).

According to a [report from Comparitech](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/romance-scams), nearly 59,000 Americans fell victim to romance scams in 2024, losing an estimated $697.3 million. Our own research from last year showed that [10% of romance scam victims lose more than $10,000](https://www.malwarebytes.com/press/2024/09/25/malwarebytes-research-reveals-10-of-romance-scam-victims-lose-more-than-10000). The overall true cost is believed to be vastly higher than official reports, as many cases go unreported due to victims’ shame and difficulty tracing scammers.

Many of the scammers work offshore from countries where the chances of them getting apprehended are slim. But US Attorney Jay Clayton stated:

> “Offshore scammers should know that we, the FBI, and our law enforcement partners will work around the world to combat online fraud and bring perpetrators to justice.”

The four men are [accused](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1410596/dl?inline) of being leaders of a criminal organization based in Ghana which committed romance scams and business email compromises against individuals and businesses located across the US.

Their victims were mostly older men and women tricked into believing they were engaging in a romantic relationship online. These “relationships” sometimes start as a [harmless text](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/that-seemingly-innocent-text-is-probably-a-scam) or by a direct message on social media and dating apps. Soon the scammer will suggest to take the conversation to a more secure platform like WhatsApp or Telegram.

The scammers will take the time to get to know you and assess what the best approach is to deceive you. Most of the time they are after your money, but sometimes they are after [information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/dating-app-scammer-cons-former-us-army-colonel-into-leaking-national-secrets). These scammers may also use other people, who are often [younger, as money mules](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/12/children-and-young-adults-the-next-generation-money-mules).

The people entailed in romance scams are courted and lavished with attention, until it’s time to cash in. Then the scammer suddenly needs money for travel, an illness, or other made-up reasons. Some scammers also lure victims with a supposed, great investment opportunity that you can’t afford to miss—which will turn out great for them, not the victim.

The four Ghanaian men are facing multiple charges including wire fraud, money laundering, receiving stolen money and more. In total each is facing a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison if convicted on all the charges.

## Stay safe from romance scammers

The scale of losses from romance scams often eclipses that of many other types of reported consumer fraud or internet crime, demonstrating...
