The **Moscow Rules** are a set of guidelines developed during the Cold War for clandestine operations in hostile environments, particularly in Moscow, where the KGB’s surveillance capabilities were unparalleled. These rules served as a survival manual for CIA operatives operating behind the Iron Curtain, emphasizing adaptability, vigilance, and the ability to think on one’s feet.

How this may apply to the general public now, as most of us are not in Moscow, is that we are finding ourselves more and more surveilled not by the government (though, this may be changing) but by the companies that we interact with online. Every social media platform owned by a corporation, every web site that is forcing cookies and collecting personal information for targeted ads, and every system that is collecting data for sale to other corporations.

Your mileage may vary….

**Actionable Tips:**

**Principle:** Have a backup plan for contingencies.
**Actionable Tips:**

* Use two-factor authentication (2FA) for all critical accounts.
* Keep offline backups of essential data in case of ransomware or account lockouts.
* Maintain secondary, secure communication channels for emergencies.

#### **7. Blend In**

**Principle:** Avoid drawing unnecessary attention to yourself.
**Actionable Tips:**

**Actionable Tips:**

* Use strong, unique passwords and a password manager to keep them organized.
* Be mindful of malware risks by avoiding suspicious downloads or apps.
* Regularly audit your digital presence for signs of compromise, such as unexpected login attempts.

---

#### **9. Minimize Your Exposure**

**Principle:** Reduce your attack surface online.
**Actionable Tips:**

* Disable cookies and tracking whenever possible using browser settings or privacy extensions.
* Limit the number of apps and platforms you use; only join those necessary and trustworthy.
* Avoid sharing sensitive information like your address, financial details, or personal identifiers online.

---

#### **10. Be Prepared to Act Fast**

**Principle:** React quickly to potential risks or breaches.
**Actionable Tips:**

* Familiarize yourself with account recovery processes for key platforms.
* Report suspicious behavior or accounts to platform administrators immediately.
* Have a crisis response plan, such as contacting your bank or credit agency if financial data is compromised.
