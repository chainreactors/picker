Okay, I'll admit that the title is a little cringy, and some would even think that I stole it from [Bahubali 2: The Conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baahubali_2%3A_The_Conclusion) ![:winking_face:](/html/@3DE12A51D4EA9511721B4713FD383281/emoticons/1f609.png ":winking_face:") However, I believe it's a fitting title for this blog post since, with this, I would like to conclude [SAP Inside Track Bengaluru 2022](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/16/sap-inside-track-bengaluru-oct-1st-2022/) by thanking all the organisers, volunteers, speakers, and sponsors and maybe sharing some of the highlights.

# Core Team

For us, it was our first-time experience organising the SAP Inside Track (In-Person), and I believe we did a great job of pulling this off within two weeks by forming the core team and getting speakers & sponsors. It was all thanks to the dedicated effort from the core team; I especially want to thank syambabu.allu & lalitmohan7443, who did a lot of important work by spending their time even at the weekends to help organise this event. Many thanks to vijay.simha  & pavankumarjagadeesh89, who spent many late nights helping with various activities. Appreciate krishnakishor.kammaje2  & sriprasadshivaramabhat for all the suggestions & help from their earlier community events experience.

For any event, the most challenging part is the logistics & the venue, which was taken care of by abhishek.chatterjee. Also, thanks to him for reigniting the SIT events in India :).Thanks to pvn.pavankumar, [Mohammed AK Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makrao/) & Pushpendra for helping with SIT event planning and different activities on the event day.

Many thanks to srinibhumireddy & praveenpadegal, who volunteered to help us at the event venue with the badges.

Without these folks, it would have been impossible to do this event in 2 weeks with a great in-person experience.

# Speakers

sindhu.gangadharan gave an inspiring keynote to kick off the event, emphasising community-based peer-to-peer learning and encouraging everyone to take part in more community events, followed by off-stage interactions & conversations. Of course, there were a lot of selfies ![:winking_face:](/html/@3DE12A51D4EA9511721B4713FD383281/emoticons/1f609.png ":winking_face:")

After the keynote, we had a total of 9 sessions with 12 speakers. Really appreciate them for presenting a session with an impossible short notice of 2 weeks. They covered a wide range of topics such as SAP CX, AppGyver, SAP BTP Extension Suite, ABAP RAP, SAP BTP Integration Suite etc. There was also a fireside chat with the SAP Mentor - krishnakishor.kammaje2, SAP Champion - ruthvik.chowdary2  & head of Mindset Consulting, India - Parvathy Sankar, which was quite a motivating session and the highlight of this event.

Check out this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/14/sap-inside-track-bengaluru-2022-meet-the-speakers-and-get-their-presentations/) from syambabu.allu to get the presentations and links to speakers' social media profiles.

# Sponsors

For any in-person event, finding the venue is challenging, and thanks to SAP Labs, Bengaluru, for sponsoring the place and food. For the experience part, AARINI, Arohak & SCMChamps covered it with goodies :). SAP Press books, a long-time sponsor for SAP Inside Tracks, sponsored the books for the draw. Check out the winners [here](https://twitter.com/sitBLR/status/1580130257092296704). Badges, books & banners were sponsored by Virinchy**.**

# Event Feedback Summary

Around 150 folks had registered in the first 3 days, and about 40 were still on the waiting list before we closed the registrations. On the event day, around 120 turned up, which was quite a good turnout. This number alone might not be enough...
