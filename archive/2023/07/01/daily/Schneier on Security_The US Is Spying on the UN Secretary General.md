## The US Is Spying on the UN Secretary General

The *Washington Post* is [reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/15/united-nations-leaked-documents/) that the US is spying on the UN Secretary General.

> The reports on Guterres appear to contain the secretary general’s personal conversations with aides regarding diplomatic encounters. They indicate that the United States relied on spying powers granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to gather the intercepts.

Lots of details about different conversations in the article, which are based on classified documents leaked on Discord by Jack Teixeira.

There will probably a lot of faux outrage at this, but spying on foreign leaders is a perfectly legitimate use of the NSA’s capabilities and authorities. (If the NSA didn’t spy on the UN Secretary General, we should fire it and replace it with a more competent NSA.) It’s the bulk surveillance of whole populations that should outrage us.

He’s chummy with Lavrov. A good target for collection.

@ Bruce, ALL,

> “There will probably a lot of faux outrage at this, but spying on foreign leaders is a perfectly legitimate use of the NSA’s capabilities and authorities.”

I suspect the outrage will be genuine but not about the NSA, but the hypocrisy involved.

Most Western Nations spy on each other, but have the good sense not to,

1, Make it obvious to all.

I’m realy not sure who the US Politicals are trying to kid, I can only think that they think the US population is in the main “Dumber than a stump”. Or worse don’t care because they know there is nothing the US citizens can do to stop them.

The problem I see for Jo(e) Citizen in the US is getting rid of their politicians who are most certainly not working for them…

It’s probable the lack of foresight, or “dumbness”, is located somewhere in the congress, state politicians, and amongst a few within the supreme court.

“Across the country, math scores saw their largest decreases ever. Reading scores dropped to 1992 levels. Nearly four in 10 eighth graders failed to grasp basic math concepts. Not a single state saw a notable improvement in their average test scores, with some simply treading water at best.”

“The declines in reading were more pronounced for lower performing students, but dropped across all percentiles.”

<https://www.nationsreportcard.gov>

“Most concerning, however, are the gaps between students.”

“Confirming what many had feared, racial inequities appear to have widened during the pandemic.”

No part of the country was exempt. Every region saw test scores slide, and every state saw declines in at least one subject.

In this 1 academic year (2021-22) alone, 1600+ books were irregularly banned from school districts across America.

“We did entertain the viewpoint from ban advocates that the books being banned are largely driven by age-inappropriate content. This viewpoint does not align with publisher provided maturity ratings [in 98.4% of cases].”

Irregular bans tend to be ideologically driven. They are supplemental to and fall outside of the standard book exclusion process (e.g. standard exclusions prevent books that promote violent, hateful, or “mature/17+” topics from being placed on school bookshelves).

News at Ten. UN Sec. Gen. talks to people; some of them are not very nice. Who knew?

This is comparable to Jack Anderson blowing the NSA capability to eavesdrop the radiotelephones of the Soviet Politburo in the early 1970s. Not helpful.

The more important question surely is why did a junior AF analyst need to know about political intelligence from a sensitive source about a sensitive target. Therefore, why did he even have access?

Sir David Ormand (one time head of GCHQ, and one-time head of the Joint Intelligence Committee) describes briefing Mrs Thatcher with the intercepted signals instructing the Argentinian fleet to sail, this on the day before the Falklands invasion in 1982. The signals decrypts were hand-carried and shown to the Secretary of State for Defence and the Prime Minister by Ormand personally (he was the Whitehall liaison). (This is described In the book “How Spies Think”, which by the way is an excellent description of how to think about the conflicting, noisy, inconsistent intelligence that is civil servants and politicians have to deal with.)

A useful contrast

The US has been spying on UN Secretaries General since Dag Hammarskjöld 65 years ago.

Do you all like podcasts? The WaPo has two excellent episodes on the Jack Teixeira leaks. See [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/the-gamers-behind-a-leak-of-state-secrets/) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/the-topsecret-document-leak-panicking-us-officials/).

Regarding UNSG Guterres, I’m [amused](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65257957) at a statement made by his spokesman. Guterres said he was not surprised that people were spying on him, but more at the “malfeasance or incompetence that allows for such private conversations to be distorted and become public.” Ooh touché.
