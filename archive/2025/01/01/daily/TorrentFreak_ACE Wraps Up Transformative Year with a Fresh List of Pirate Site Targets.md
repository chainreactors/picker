# ACE Wraps Up Transformative Year with a Fresh List of Pirate Site Targets

Anti-piracy coalition ACE wraps up a transformative and successful year. Despite major shifts in leadership, the MPA-backed coalition of media companies secured key victories, including the high-profile takedown of the Fmovies piracy network. ACE also reported a number of other successes and has already set its sights on new 'pirate' targets for the coming year.

The Alliance for Entertainment and Creativity ([ACE](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/)) bundled the powers and pockets of dozens of entertainment companies, and were joined by many more in the years that followed.

While skeptics may have dismissed the launch of yet another anti-piracy group, ACE was and is a grand success. The group has industry members and law enforcement contacts all over the globe, allowing it to pool intelligence and take action more effectively than ever before.

## 2024: A Transformative Year

The past year has been eventful for ACE on many fronts. The Alliance waved goodbye to its main boss, Jan Van Voorn, [who left](https://torrentfreak.com/ip-house-takes-global-ip-anti-piracy-protection-to-a-new-level-240508/) to work on a new IP-protection startup, IP-House. While his expertise will be missed, several key hires aim to fill the gap.

In June, Larissa Knapp was announced as the alliance’s new Global Chief of Content Protection. Knapp brings a wealth of experience from her [27 years at the FBI](https://torrentfreak.com/top-fbi-official-now-heads-the-worlds-leading-anti-piracy-coalition-240628/). As one of the highest-ranking officials, she managed over 2,000 personnel.

Other hires announced this year also bring much to the table, including former Assistant U.S. Attorney Marissa Bostick, who also served as Deputy Director for the Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit. As the MPA’s new Head of Global Litigation, Bostick will also oversee international litigation related to ACE activity.

Bryan Willett, a former FBI agent, is another key addition to the team. He will serve as the MPA’s VP Content Protection Enforcement for the Americas region, where he will develop and oversee ACE’s internet enforcement strategy, aiming to further curb online piracy.

## 2024: Landmark Shutdowns

While expanding the team is crucial for the future of ACE, the Alliance’s core objective of shutting down piracy operations remains unchanged. And 2024 saw no shortage of accomplishments on that front.

Looking back, the [shutdown of the Fmovies piracy ring](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-piracy-ring-was-shut-down-by-vietnam-assisted-by-ace-240829/), together with Vietnamese authorities, stands out. This impacted many popular pirate brands, including Aniwave, Soap2dayx2, Zoroxtv, Fboxz, Animesuge, Cinezone, and many others.

These sites, which were wiped out overnight, collectively received [billions of visits](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-sites-billions-of-visits-wiped-out-in-hours-sifting-the-fmovies-wreckage-240828/) per year. The Vietnamese authorities are [prosecuting](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-piracy-mastermind-confesses-authorities-confirm-prosecution-241113/) the alleged mastermind of the Fmovies operation, which may bring more details to the forefront in the coming year.

There were many other key shutdowns in the past year too. In January, ACE shut down a [football piracy](https://torrentfreak.com/ace-shuts-huge-football-piracy-ring-total-destruction-tbc-240122/) streaming operation, in May IPTV sellers had their [domains seized](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-iptv-seller-domain-names-taken-over-in-bulk-by-ace-mpa-240521/), Animeflix was pushed offline [in July](https://torrentfreak.com/popular-pirate-site-animeflix-shuts-down-voluntarily-240705/), and in September Egypt’s largest pirate site [‘Laroza’ was toppled](https://torrentfreak.com/ace-helps-egypt-to-dismantle-the-regions-largest-piracy-site-240912/).

Toward the end of the year, popular anime site Animefenix [shut down ‘voluntarily’](https://torrentfreak.com/animefenix-shuts-down-gogoanime-anitaku-freezes-in-time-241202/) citing legal pressure. The same happened to [Braflix](https://torrentfreak.com/braflix-to-shut-down-pirate-site-throws-the-towel-citing-legal-pressure-241104/) a few weeks earlier. Neither site mentioned ACE in their farewell messages but since both domains now redirect to ACE’s “Watch Legally” page, it’s not hard to guess where the pressure came from.

The above is just a selection of ACE’s actions. In total, several hundreds of domains were either seized or shut down by the group over the past twelve months. And there are no signs that enforcement activity will slow down anytime soon.

## 2025: Fresh & Familiar Targets

Just before Christmas, MPA and ACE went back to court, with Larissa Knapp requesting several DMCA subpoenas at a California federal court. Through the subpoenas, ACE wants Cloudflare and the .to domain registry (Tonic) to share information related to numerous domain names.

“This would include the individuals’ names, physical addresses, IP addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, payment information, account updates and account history,” Knapp writes.

These targets are all related to pirate streaming sites, services, or apps, some with dozens of millions of monthly visits. Anime site Anitaku is the most prominent target, with more than 158 million visits in November. Other sites like Gimy, Aniworld, and Faselhds also attract significant traffic.

The subpoenas target a total of 39 pirate streaming domains. ACE and the MPA hope that, through their requests for information, they can learn more about the identities and whereabouts of the operators.

**Some high traffic targets ([full list here](#all))**

| Domain | Monthly Visits |
| --- | --- |
|
|  |
| Anitaku.bz | 158 million |
| Gimy.ai | 43 million |
| Aniworld.to | 31 million |
| Faselhds.care | 29 million |
| Animeunity.to | 20 million |

This is not the first time that some of these sites have been targeted by ACE. An older Anitaku domain was listed in a subpoena a few months ago. While new uploads to the site were [stalled recently](https://torrentfreak.com/animefenix-shuts-down-gogoanime-anitaku-freezes-in-time-241202/), it remains online.

These subpoenas are standard practice by now. In several cases, site operators try to avoid being identified by using false information. However, history has also shown that these efforts can pay off.

In any case, the list of fresh targets shows what MPA and ACE’s priorities are. It’s clear that they are pushing full steam ahead with their enforcement efforts in the new year.
