![The CMMC Countdown, Part 4](/content/images/size/w2000/2024/12/fireworks--new-years-countdown-2025--a-lock-wrapped-in-a-bow.png)

This picture of a New Year's celebration and a lock wrapped with a bow was created by Microsoft Copilot.

The CMMC Final Rule became effective on December 16, 2024. We will finish reviewing the remaining five-pointers to ensure we can obtain a conditional CMMC certificate if we cannot achieve a 110 score.

## CMMC Action Plan continued

### PS.L2-3.9.2

> Ensure that organizational systems containing CUI are protected during and after personnel actions such as terminations and transfers.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] a policy and/or process for terminating system access and any credentials coincident with personnel actions is established;
> [b] system access and credentials are terminated consistent with personnel actions such as termination or transfer; and
> [c] the system is protected during and after personnel transfer actions.

Consider creating onboarding, offboarding, and transfer procedures. These procedures should define how all access is revoked upon termination and how some access is granted and revoked during a transfer. For a transfer, personnel should gain access to CUI when they transfer into a role that requires it. Conversely, access to CUI should be revoked when they transfer to a role where CUI access is unnecessary.

### PE.L2-3.10.1

> Limit physical access to organizational systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] authorized individuals allowed physical access are identified;
> [b] physical access to organizational systems is limited to authorized individuals;
> [c] physical access to equipment is limited to authorized individuals; and
> [d] physical access to operating environments is limited to authorized individuals

Consider having a separate CMMC environment, as mentioned in previous posts. You could show your access list if you have an access control system, like a badge reader. Consider writing a procedure that describes how the access list is reviewed and updated. Consider maintaining an inventory list of the CUI devices in your CMMC environment and writing a procedure for updating that list. You should be able to leverage your procedures from the AC domain to show how access is granted to these devices. The inventory list should also identify the networking equipment and security systems and how access to them is restricted to the personnel responsible for maintaining them, such as the IT team.

### PE.L2-3.10.2

> Protect and monitor the physical facility and support infrastructure for organizational systems.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] the physical facility where organizational systems reside is protected;
> [b] the support infrastructure for organizational systems is protected;
> [c] the physical facility where organizational systems reside is monitored; and
> [d] the support infrastructure for organizational systems is monitored.

We can show the access logs generated by the access control system identified in PE.L2-3.10.1. If you rely on a physical key and a video system, like Ring, consider creating a key distribution log, filling out the log to check out the key, and collecting the video logs. That way, you can show who is authorized to lock and unlock the door and show video surveillance at the door.

### CA.L2-3.12.1

> Periodically assess the security controls in organizational systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.
>
> Determine if:
> We can show the access logs generated by the access control system identified in PE.L2-3.10.1. If you rely on a physical key and a video system like Ring, consider creating a form where keys are checked in and out and showing the video logs.
> [a] the frequency of security control assessments is defined; and
> [b] security controls are assessed with the defined frequency to determine if the controls are effective in their application.

The CMMC controls must be certified by a C3PAO every three years. Within those three years, a yearly SPRS score must be submitted. Consider doing a quarterly self-assessment for one-fourth of the CMMC controls or a yearly one for one-third. You will have self-assessed each control after one year or three years, whichever frequency you choose. Consider defining the schedule in the SSP. Keep a formal record of each self-assessment and consider having them signed by your leadership. Document any findings in the POAM.

### CA.L2-3.12.3

> Monitor security controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] security controls are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of those controls.

Consider setting up monitoring tools that automatically assess your organization's security posture. You can use tools like Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Intune, Nessus, and Greenbone.

### SC.L2-3.13.1

> Monitor, control, and protect communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of organizational systems.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] the external system boundary is defined;
> [b] key internal system boundaries are defined;
> [c] communications are monitored at the external system boundary;
> [d] communications are monitored at key internal boundaries;
> [e] communications are controlled at the external system boundary;
> [f] communications are controlled at key internal boundaries;
> [g] communications are protected at the external system boundary; and
> [h] communications are protected at key internal boundaries.

Consider creating a drawing that describes your organizational network. An external system boundary could be your on-site firewall and VPN connection for remote users. Your internal system boundaries could include any VLANs that segregate system resources. The monitoring could be syslog events sent to a SIEM. The controls could be your firewall rules and network ACLs. The protection could be SSL and VPN encryption. Consider implementing web content filtering as an additional layer.

### SC.L2-3.13.2

> Employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational systems.
>
> Determine if:
>
> [a] architectural designs that promote effective information security are identified;
> [b] software development techniques that promote effective information security are identified;
> [c] systems engineering principles that promote effective information security are identified;
> [d] identified architectural designs that promote effective information security are employed;
> [e] identified software development techniques that promote effective information security are employed; and
> [f] identified systems engineering ...
