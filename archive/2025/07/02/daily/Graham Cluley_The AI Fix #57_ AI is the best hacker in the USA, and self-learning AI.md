In episode 57 of The AI Fix, our hosts discover an AI ‚Äúdream recorder‚Äù, Mark Zuckerberg tantalises OpenAI staff with $100 million signing bonuses, Graham finds out why robot butlers sit in chairs, Wikipedia holds the line against AI slop, an AI cat collar can tell you if your cat is annoyed by its AI cat collar, and some German scientists accidentally create a new AI Fix slogan.

Graham reveals that an AI is now the most successful bug bounty hunter in the USA, and Mark discovers an AI that can retrain itself.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
