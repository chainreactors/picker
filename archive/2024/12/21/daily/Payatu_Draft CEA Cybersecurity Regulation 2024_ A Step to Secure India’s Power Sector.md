## Introduction

As India’s power sector becomes increasingly dependent on digital technologies and faces a sharp rise in cyber threats, **the Central Electricity Authority (CEA)**  has released **the Draft CEA Cyber Security Regulations, 2024**. It is a critical step in strengthening India’s critical power infrastructure. The draft is subject to consultation with various stakeholders, and the final rules have not yet been issued. Building on the CEA (Cyber Security in Power Sector) Guidelines, 2021, the draft expands its scope with a stronger focus on incident response, vendor security, and, operational technology (OT) systems.
