In the previous part, we focused on the input boxes in the booking form. However, when I was sending the request, something caught my attention. I decided to understand and test it .

So , after forwarding the first request.

The `Order_id` parameter grabbed my interest. It looks like it might be **Base64** encoded, so let's decode it and see what we uncover.

Letâ€™s use [**CyberChef**](https://cyberchef.org/) as our decoding tool, or we can simply right-click it and decode it in Burp Suite.

It seems to be the same order number that appears on the screen after successfully submitting the order.

Letâ€™s send this request to Burp Suite **Repeater** and experiment with it. It might be vulnerable to some form of **Broken Access Control** based on my knowledge.

First, letâ€™s send the same request and check if we get the same page.

Intuitively, we should.

As we decoded the order value and discovered that it is `42069`, letâ€™s experiment with this number to see if we can access orders belonging to other users.

For example, we can change it from `42069`to `42066`and observe what happens.

**But hereâ€™s the trick**: we need to encode the number in `Base64`before sending it. If we donâ€™t , and send it as is, the request will be rejected.

As you can see, something interesting occurred .We gained access to another order submitted by someone else named`Raymundo Linney`with the email address `lavina81@heller.com`.

This access was not supposed to be available, illustrating an example of [**Broken Access Control**](https://owasp.org/www-community/Broken_Access_Control) .

> And , we did it ! We uncovered a **BAC** vulnerability.

Next, letâ€™s explore further. As weâ€™ve already covered the login form and the booking feature, we have two more areas to test: the **Our Menu** feature and **Our Locations** page.

Starting with the **menu** page, it appears to be a standard page with the menu and no clickable elements or parameters to manipulate manually.

So, letâ€™s turn on **Burp Proxy** and see if we can uncover any hidden aspects.

After examining the initial requests, which included only CSS files, Google Fonts API, and other normal files, we found something interesting in the last request. This HTTP request is asking for the resource located at `/reviews.php` via the `loader.php` script on the server, with a parameter named `f` specifying the file name.

```
GET /fastfoodhackings/api/loader.php?f=/reviews.php HTTP/1.1
```

Letâ€™s send this request to **Repeater** and experiment with it to see what we uncover.

So, after rendering the request and seeing its content, it contains some client reviews.

This led me to test for a [**Path Traversal Vulnerability**](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) or [**LFI (Local File Inclusion)**](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion) to see if it exists. Unfortunately, my intuition was wrong this time, and I didnâ€™t find anything. The parameter is not vulnerable.

Letâ€™s restart our thinking and approach this from a different angle. Itâ€™s time to think more outside the box.

What can we extract from this directory? I remember something we didnâ€™t give importance to earlier: the **/admin** directory that redirects us to the home page. Letâ€™s try to access it from here and see if it loads.

Interestingly, `admin.php` didn't give us anything, but `admin` did.

As you can see, we received a valid response that we didnâ€™t get earlier. It displays a message telling us that we are not allowed to view this page. However, I believe we can find a way to bypass this restriction.

Wait a minute ðŸ¤¨ how does this page know that we are not allowed to see its content?ðŸ¤” Have you asked yourself this question before ?

Something must be telling the web app that we are strangers and not authorized to access ...
