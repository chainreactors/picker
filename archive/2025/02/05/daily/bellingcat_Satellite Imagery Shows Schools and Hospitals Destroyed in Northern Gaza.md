# Satellite Imagery Shows Schools and Hospitals Destroyed in Northern Gaza

February 4, 2025

Thousands of people have begun [returning to their abandoned homes](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/g-s1-44882/palestinians-gaza-israel-lebanon-hamas) in northern Gaza after Israeli forces opened the Netzarim corridor, which separates the northern and southern parts of the territory, on Monday, Jan. 27.

Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in Gaza following more than a year of negotiations. The deal was announced on Jan. 15 and went into effect four days later.

“We want to return home … Even though my house is destroyed, I miss my land and my place,” one Palestinian from the Al Shati Refugee Camp [told CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/27/middleeast/palestinians-return-north-gaza-intl-hnk/index.html).

But satellite imagery and new images from the ground show that in large parts of North Gaza, there are no homes left to return to, while schools and hospitals which have served as shelters during the conflict have also been hit badly.

A Nov. 29 [UN report](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/population-and-internal-displacement-7-october-2023-gaza-strip) identified 50 sites for internally displaced people (IDP) in North Gaza. According to an investigation by Bellingcat, more than 80 percent of these sites, mostly schools, have been damaged or destroyed during a three-month-long military operation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that began in October.

Satellite imagery, photos, and videos from the ground [show](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/12/23/gaza-north-israel-jabalya-palestinians/) [vast](https://www.ft.com/content/8d0f5f49-9ab1-43b0-be1c-5a077e4e7e29?accessToken=zwAAAZUD91pykdOND19JmrFDsNO-HFoHfk5-KQE.MEYCIQCYi3B-p4KnRshPr1ka7dQXay36FasQcJK6sftjQJyoNQIhAJFY-UgkEUmxp0eOs7tAq-31nhkdmZyIteDcTl9_jMWs&segmentId=7f77079b-377f-2b7f-7f27-6da36f81e7fe) [destruction](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/18/jabaliya-refugee-camp-gaza-destruction-idf) in the governorate’s three main cities: Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabaliya.

## Schools, Hospitals and Camps Destroyed

Schools have [historically served as shelters](https://www.unicef.org/sop/stories/gaza-schools-equipped-shelters-preparation-future-emergencies) for displaced people during past conflicts in the Gaza Strip. Of the 50 sites in the November UN report, 45 were schools, two were hospitals or health centres, and three were tent camps set up during the summer. These sites are marked on the report’s map with brown lines and the label “IDP Site Extent”.

*Scroll and zoom to see damage in North Gaza in each date tab. The first image is from Oct. 14, 2024, after Israeli forces had already started a renewed operation in the area. The second image is from Dec. 2024, after large-scale demolitions took place throughout the area. The latest image is from Jan. 24, 2025, at the onset of the ceasefire, with groups of Palestinians returning to the area visible on the streets.****Blue*** *outlines are former IDP sites identified by the UN that we assessed undamaged.* ***Orange** outlines are former IDP sites with nearby damage or damage on the grounds.* ***Red*** *outlines are former IDP sites that have been heavily damaged by fire or completely destroyed.*

The report didn’t include three major hospitals in North Gaza: Kamal Adwan Hospital, Indonesian Hospital and Al Awda Hospital. While the first two [were out of operation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/4/israel-orders-evacuation-of-gazas-critical-indonesian-al-awda-hospitals#:~:text=Israel%2DPalestine%20conflict-,Indonesian%20Hospital%20in%20north%20Gaza%20is%20out%20of%20service%3A%20Gaza,of%20service%20by%20Israel's%20offensive.&text=The%20Indonesian%20Hospital%20in%20north,Gaza%20Ministry%20of%20Health%20said.) in early January due to the IDF’s military operation, they had previously [housed patients](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-storm-into-gaza-hospital-expel-some-staff-displaced-people-its-2024-12-06/) and IDPs.

Of these 50 sites marked by the UN, only eight appear to not have visible damage based on the Jan. 24 SkySat imagery from Planet Labs. Twenty-eight have been heavily damaged or destroyed, and 14 appear damaged or show signs of destruction in close proximity compared to earlier imagery.

There are indications of extensive fires at several heavily damaged sites. The three tent camps visible in satellite imagery before the October operation have been completely destroyed. The largest one had about 250 tents. After this camp was destroyed, the IDF set up a military position on the site with berms and armoured vehicles visible in satellite imagery.

*Before and after satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the location where a large tent camp for internally displaced people was previously located on the outskirts of Jabaliya in North Gaza. After the IDF began an operation in the area, the tents were cleared and a military position was set up.*

When asked about the IDP sites, the IDF said Hamas “systematically violates international law” and uses civilians as human shields.

## Torched Schools

At least 14 schools that previously served as IDP sites in the UN report show fire damage in both satellite imagery and on-the-ground photos and videos shared online.

Five of the destroyed schools sit within 500m of the Indonesian Hospital, which has had a heavy IDF presence since October, with fighting taking place nearby. Satellite imagery shows that the Kuwait School, Beit Lahia Preparatory Girls Schools A & B, Al Hertani Secondary School, Hamad Ibn Khalifa Secondary Girls School and Aleppo Schools A & B all appear to have fire damage or have been partly demolished.

*Before and after satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the area of North Gaza near the Indonesian Hospital. Between October and January, tents for internally displaced people were removed, and multiple schools were either heavily damaged or destroyed.*

A drone video [shared on Oct. 19](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1847644148355993827) by the IDF’s Arabic spokesperson on X shows the Kuwait School in the background of groups of displaced Palestinians and an IDF armoured vehicle. Another drone video [shared four days later, ...
