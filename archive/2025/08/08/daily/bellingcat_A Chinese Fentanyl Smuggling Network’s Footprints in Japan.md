# A Chinese Fentanyl Smuggling Network’s Footprints in Japan

Earlier this year, a man and a woman stood trial in a New York courtroom on charges related to the illicit drugs trade. They had been arrested as part of an undercover sting by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) after more than 200 kilograms of precursor chemicals used to make the synthetic opioid fentanyl were shipped from China to the US. It was enough to make 25 million deadly doses of the drug, authorities said.

The Chinese nationals were also accused of conspiring to import tonne-quantities of fentanyl precursors to the US, where tens of thousands of people die from opioid overdoses every year. After a two-week trial, a Manhattan jury [found the pair guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-chinese-chemical-company-executives-convicted-and-multiple-websites-and-0) of conspiracy to import fentanyl precursors and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Qingzhou “Bruce” Wang, 36, and Yiyi “Chiron” Chen, 32, worked for Hubei Amarvel Biotech (AmarvelBio), a chemical firm based in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They were arrested in 2023 after being lured from China to Fiji as part of a DEA operation and subsequently extradited to the US. The case marked the first time US authorities prosecuted Chinese company executives for trafficking fentanyl precursors.

*AmarvelBio’s principal executive Qingzhou Wang and marketing manager Yiyi Chen “conspired to import massive amounts of fentanyl precursors … with callous disregard for the effect that such deadly chemicals would ultimately have here in the United States,” US Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon* [*said*](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-chinese-chemical-company-executives-convicted-and-multiple-websites-and-0)*. Source: DEA*

But court documents showed there may be links to another East Asian country. Bellingcat was contacted by the Japanese newspaper *Nikkei*, which was investigating AmarvelBio’s connection to Japan, suspecting the country was being used as a command post for the cross-border smuggling operation.

*Nikkei* was looking into Xia Fengzhi, a Chinese man [referred to](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67523539/143/united-states-v-hubei-amarvel-biotech-co-ltd/) in the New York legal proceedings as “the boss in Japan”. It had found an individual by that name who was [listed as the owner](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Fentanyl-s-Hidden-Routes/The-Japan-boss-at-the-center-of-a-fentanyl-web) of a Chinese company selling raw chemical materials called Fushikai Trading Co Ltd, which according to *Nikkei* was active under the brand name “Firsky”. A website for Firsky China included [a certificate](https://web.archive.org/web/20250610105500im_/https%3A//shopcdnpro.grainajz.com/83/upload/ad/7dec68ae4b09ae7cf9ba5af761d6d5fe621f479b393da8c971c06fb6d6393031.jpg) for Fushikai Trading with the same identification code seen on Fushikai’s corporate records. The company, according to its [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240527205941/https%3A//www.firsky-cn.com/Company-profile), was a wholly owned subsidiary of Firsky Co. Ltd., which was registered in Nagoya, an industrial city in central Japan.

*Nikkei* pulled the corporate records for Firsky in Japan, which showed Xia headed the company. Records obtained by *Nikkei* also showed that the Chinese company’s supervisor was listed as Qingzhou Wang, the same name as one of the two AmarvelBio executives convicted in the US.

*Nikkei* asked Bellingcat’s financial investigations team to leverage its expertise in open source research to independently verify the Japanese company’s connection to AmarvelBio. Our investigation uncovered evidence showing the two companies are not only part of the same international smuggling network – they are effectively one and the same. This is how we did it.

## The Japan Connection

Linking AmarvelBio and Firsky through domain records was not possible because both websites were registered through a provider that uses privacy protection, which conceals personal details from the public. However, information obtained by US law enforcement can become public during court proceedings.

A CourtListener [search](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=%22amarvelbio.com%22%20AND%20docket_id%3A67523540&type=r&order_by=score%20desc) for “amarvelbio.com” returned multiple results, including [an exhibit](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67523540/104/5/united-states-v-hubei-amarvel-biotech-co-ltd/) from the federal case against AmarvelBio. This contained subpoenaed domain registration data, which showed that convicted AmarvelBio employee Yiyi “Chiron” Chen registered a number of domains, including for AmarvelBio, its “[sister company](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67523539/143/united-states-v-hubei-amarvel-biotech-co-ltd/)” Wuhan Wingroup, and Firsky (in both China and Japan).

Another domain (firskytech.com) that was not included in the documents available on CourtListener was [registered](https://www.whoxy.com/firskytech.com) months after Chen’s 2023 arrest and remains online as of publication. This website lists an address in Wuhan and describes itself as a wholly Japanese-owned supplier of “high purity” chemical intermediates. While its registration details remain priv...
