### Top Malware Types: Highlights

Q4 2024 saw significant changes in the most detected malware types compared to previous quarters.

* **Stealers** took the lead with 25,341 detections, continuing their dominance as the top malware threat. This marks a significant rise from 16,511 detections in Q3, reflecting an increase of 53.5% in Stealer activity. [In Q2](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-q2-2024/), Stealers had 3,640 detections, meaning their activity more than doubled from Q2 to Q4.
