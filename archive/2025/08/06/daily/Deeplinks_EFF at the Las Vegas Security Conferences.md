It’s time for EFF’s annual journey to Las Vegas for the summer security conferences: BSidesLV, Black Hat USA, and DEF CON. Our lawyers, activists, and technologists are always excited to support this community of security researchers and tinkerers—the folks who push computer security forward (and somehow survive the Vegas heat in their signature black hoodies).

As in past years, EFF attorneys will be on-site to assist speakers and attendees. If you have legal concerns about an upcoming talk or sensitive infosec research—during the Las Vegas conferences or anytime—don’t hesitate to reach out at info@eff.org. Share a brief summary of the issue, and we’ll do our best to connect you with the right resources. You can also learn more about our work supporting technologists on our Coders’ Rights Project page.

Be sure to swing by the expo areas at all three conferences to say hello to your friendly neighborhood EFF staffers! You’ll probably spot us in the halls, but we’d love for you to stop by our booths to catch up on our latest work, get on our action alerts list, or [become an EFF member](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/VirtualVegas--DL)! For the whole week, we’ll have our limited-edition DEF CON 33 t-shirt on hand—I can’t wait to see them take over each conference!
