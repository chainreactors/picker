Companies operate in the context of many national and international rules and regulations when they produce or sell products. They must ensure that the products they operate within different business processes (such as selling, producing, researching, and so on) meet all regulations such as laws, industry standards, and company standards. Companies must also ensure that the information on the safety data sheets and labels of the products is available and maintained appropriately.

In the following blog – **part 3**, I will give you an engineering expert view of some selected highlights of our SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition, and SAP S/4HANA for Product Compliance | 2022 release, to show you how you can improve the management of legally required safety data sheet information for products and how you can improve the creation and management of label information for products.

# Organizing basic data and compliance assessments through managing work views

A work view provides an overview of compliance-relevant information that is available in the system for bulk material. The *Manage Work Views* app defines work views to gather information according to expertise and regulation (specific to a country or region). These work views are centrally maintained and available to all users. Only authorized users can modify these work views.
