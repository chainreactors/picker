# Identity: the new security perimeter

## What to do when your MFA is mercilessly attacked by hackers

[Elizabeth Coles](/Author/Elizabeth-Coles "Read more by this author")

Webinar Threat actors are always looking for that easy way in by testing weak spots, and user identities are one of their favourite targets.

Multi factor authentication (MFA), that stalwart defender of the login, is attacked mercilessly for example. And while additional security layers can ward off these attacks, what's the cost to the end user experience?

There's another way to go. New frameworks such as Shared Signals can help, alongside the judicious application of machine learning to identity threat detection and response systems (ITDR). And there's also digital, verifiable credentials which offer hope for a new approach to identity security that can keep users and organizations safer and better protected.

You can find out more by joining our Register webinar on [17 July 2024 at 5pm BST/12pm ET/9am PT](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/28912/the-new-meaning-of-identity-security). You'll hear Cisco's Sami Laine (Principal Security Strategist) and Josh Green (Technical Strategist) explain the dynamics that are driving identity security and review the components within Cisco Duo's solution, such as Identity Intelligence, Shared Signals and Risk-Based Access Policies.

By making MFA invisible, your users will think that MFA requirements have been retired when they are, in fact, working as hard as ever.

Sign up to access the webinar [here](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/28912/the-new-meaning-of-identity-security) and we'll send you a reminder when it's time to watch.
