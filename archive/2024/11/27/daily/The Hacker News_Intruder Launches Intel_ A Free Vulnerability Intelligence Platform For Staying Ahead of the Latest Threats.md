When CVEs go viral, separating critical vulnerabilities from the noise is essential to protecting your organization. That's why Intruder, a leader in attack surface management, built [Intel](https://intel.intruder.io/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=p_referral&utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Cintel) (**now known as [cvemon](https://cvemon.intruder.io/)**) - a free vulnerability intelligence platform designed to help you act fast and prioritize real threats.

## What is Intel?

Intel was created to fill a gap in the resources available for tracking emerging vulnerabilities. When one of Intruder's go-to tools shut down last year, the team set out to build a solution that would not only meet their needs but also benefit the wider infosec community.

Intel tracks the top trending CVEs from the past 24 hours and assigns each a 'hype score' - a rating out of 100, benchmarked against the year's highest levels. Alongside real-time insights, Intel features expert commentary from Intruder's Security team and consolidates the latest information from trusted sources like NVD and CISA, all in one place.

## 5 Ways Intel Helps You Stay Ahead

1. **Keep on top of trends:** Instantly see which vulnerabilities are gaining traction on social media, ensuring you're always aware of potentially high-risk CVEs. [See what's trending today.](https://intel.intruder.io/trends?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=p_referral&utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Cintel)
2. **Understand the hype:** Intel doesn't just show you what's trending - it puts it into perspective. The hype score helps you quickly gauge and contextualize the attention a CVE is receiving.
3. **Expert human context:** With analysis from Intruder's Security team, you can better understand the real impact of critical CVEs to assess whether your environment may be at risk.
4. **Centralized CVE insights:** Intel streamlines your research by providing the latest information in one place, including risk scores, known exploits, and more.
5. **Real-time updates:** Never miss a trending CVE with Intel's RSS feed, which delivers hourly updates straight to your dashboards.
