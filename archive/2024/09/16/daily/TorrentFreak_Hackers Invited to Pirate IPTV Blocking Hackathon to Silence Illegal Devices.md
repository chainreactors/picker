# Hackers Invited to Pirate IPTV Blocking Hackathon to Silence Illegal Devices

In recent years Brazil's telecoms agency has claimed significant success in its mission to prevent pirate set-top boxes from accessing premium content. Whether Anatel is feeling a little vulnerable, or would simply like some new blocking ideas, is up for debate. However, in roughly ten days' time, hackers will descend on São Paulo for a two-day hackathon. Cash prizes await those who manage to disable pirate IPTV devices to the extent they can no longer communicate with their owners.

[![hackathon-brasil-s](https://torrentfreak.com/images/hackathon-brasil-s.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/hackathon-brasil-s.png)Android-based set-top devices have saturated the market in recent years, and it’s not uncommon for households to have several; downstairs, upstairs, and probably at least one in a drawer.

These devices, including the ubiquitous Amazon Firestick, are mostly content agnostic and equally capable of streaming video from legal sources such as Netflix or BBC iPlayer, or from unlicensed IPTV platforms.

The problem for rightsholders and governments hoping to curtail consumption of pirated content, is that the devices themselves are overwhelmingly legal. It’s the presence of piracy software installed on devices and the nature of the content consumed that tips the scale one way or the other. As a result, no realistic blanket banning solution exists, although Brazil has come up with a partial solution.

## Devices Illegal By Default

The set-top device [situation](http://telecoms regulator Anatel (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações)) in Brazil is relatively straightforward. Unless telecoms regulator Anatel (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações) authorizes a device type for importation, distribution, and sale, that device cannot be used legally in Brazil.

Anatel says its conformity assessment ensures that consumers only have access to products (typically electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, set-top boxes, routers, etc) that have been tested for quality and safety.

Set-top boxes without a Technical Conformity Certificate are illegal regardless of the content consumed. That eliminates a lot of red tape when Anatel decides to seize well over a million devices to curtail piracy, because all seizures are carried out on straightforward health and safety grounds.

For devices that enter the local market without certification, Anatel regularly reports various actions to remove them. In 2023, Anatel revealed its new anti-piracy lab, where intelligence meets site-blocking measures to disrupt supply and consumption of pirated content.

*The Anatel Anti-Piracy Lab (Image credit: [Anatel](https://www.gov.br/anatel/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/anatel-inaugura-laboratorio-antipirataria-1))*[![Anatel-AP-Lab](https://torrentfreak.com/images/Anatel-AP-Lab.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/Anatel-AP-Lab.png)

Most famously, the regulator said it had [blocked 80% of all pirate set-top boxes](https://torrentfreak.com/brazil-regulator-claims-80-of-pirate-tv-boxes-were-blocked-last-week-231030/) in Brazil during October 2023. To this background of ongoing success, Anatel is now promoting a competition where hackers can test their skills to determine who has the best *non-certified* pirate set-top box blocking skills in Brazil.

## Anatel Teams Up With Hackathon Brasil

If any cynics out there think that the real point of the hackathon is to shore up IPTV blocking measures in Brazil with fresh ideas and techniques, Anatel isn’t even trying to hide it.

“The National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) and the Hackathon Brasil Community will hold the first TV Box Hackathon focused on developing innovative solutions for blocking irregular [non-certified] TV Boxes,” an [announcement](https://www.gov.br/anatel/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/anatel-e-hackathon-brasil-realizam-maratona-de-desenvolvimento-de-ferramenta-de-bloqueio-de-tv-box-irregulares) on the government’s website reads.

“The developer marathon will take place on September 28 and 29 and represents an important project for the industry, regulated sector and academia, highlighting Anatel’s role in the state of the art of technological innovation.”

[![android-lock](https://torrentfreak.com/images/android-lock.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/android-lock.png)A dedicated information page on Hackathon Brazil begins by outlining the prevalence of IoT devices and growing concerns over security.

Noting that devices without certification “pose risks to consumers and to Brazil’s telecommunications infrastructure,” more specific concerns include operating system vulnerabilities, malware, spyware (hidden screenshot capture and screenshare actions), plus the ability to execute code on other devices within a LAN.

## The Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It

Whether those who choose to sign up will receive more detailed instruction is unclear, but the main goal isn’t difficult to understand.

*So the challenge is this: by understanding how these non-approved devices work, you must develop an approach that is capable of interrupting the exchange of data that occurs between the devices and their users.*

Given the difficulties Anatel faces in tackling millions of these devices, mostly located inside people’s homes, the winners of the hackathon are unlikely to find success by physically attacking a device with wire, solder, or a modified ROM. Any solution must scale but before that, there’s the question of how to gain mass access to devices.

The masters of access at scale are those who manage to build botnets using malware that users often willingly (although unknowingly) install themselves because they believe the software does something else. Coincidentally or not, for many years Brazil has been heavily targeted by botnets running on cheap, compromised Android set-top boxes.

[According to a report](https://www.eset.com/blog/consumer/better-to-watch-troy-than-have-trojan-malware-on-your-android-tv/) from cybersecurity firm ESET, malware that disproportionately targets Brazil regularly arrives disguised as legitimate or illegitimate streaming apps.

Further research shows that the dangers cited by Anatel [relate directly to this type of malware](https://news.drweb.com/show/?lng=en&i=14743), including the ability to infect other devices in a network, typically cheap IoT devices with poor security. Cybersecurity companies charge millions of dollars to solve problems smaller than this.

## Winners’ Rewards

Anyone interested in registering has until September 20th to fill in their details on the [official Hackathon Brasil site](https://hackathonbrasil.com.br/hackathon-tv-box/) and for those who come out on top at the end of the event, prizes are as follows:
