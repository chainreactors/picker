 The [**SAP Mentor Spotlight Interview Series**](https://community.sap.com/programs/spotlight-interviews) highlights key strategic topics and provides insights from SAP Mentors and SAP leaders on turning ideas into innovative approaches that impact people, processes, and technology. |

Closing the gap between the “vision” and “reality” requires planning and execution.

For any IT or business challenge to succeed, it is important to have a determined perspective, dedicated people, and a defined process.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/DiegoCircleProfile.png)To address the gap, there are three key considerations:

* **Vision** – What is the desired result?

* **Strategy** – What will push the vision forward?

* **Execution** – What tactical next steps are required?

Visionary efforts can breakdown due to a lack of buy-in across the organization with stakeholders. Important initiatives can be overwhelming and cause organizations to struggle to get started.

A shared vision with a very specific roadmap should be developed to address the great divide between the idea and achieving tangible results. When teams collaborate, enable buy-in early, and provide proof points (e.g., pilots or proof of concepts), there is a better chance to build the vision into reality.

For diego.dora, SAP Mentor and Managing Director at Diff Consulting, he has a passion for finding effective ways to close the gap between the “vision” and “reality” with customers. He has traveled many career journeys centered around a simple principle of “always learning and adapting.”

It was a lot of fun to catchup with Diego from his home office in Texas.

**Stacey Fish (SF): Hi Diego! Your career journey started at the early age of 13 at your high school in Argentina, specializing in computer sciences. Next, you had great university experiences at the National University of La Matanza, where you were involved in research at the Laboratory of Open-Source Technology. From these earlier interests, what inspired you to branch out and start your own consulting firm?**

**Diego Dora (DD):** Thanks Stacey! I had been in the SAP space for 17+ years, the last +10 years working mainly in the DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) region with SAP’s latest technologies. **![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/Diego1.png)**

Realizing that there is an increasing demand for proper adoption of some of these technologies,
I decided to start Diff Consulting to explore new opportunities.

Currently, I see huge potential in the Cloud development, Infrastructure and Integration space:

* [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://community.sap.com/topics/business-technology-platform), leveraging services to extend and integrate other SAP systems like SAP SuccessFactors, SAP S/4HANA, and mobile solutions

* SAP Integrations with 3rd party systems like ServiceNow

* Cloud Native Development integrated with services from Hyperscalers

* Advising companies in Foundation & Governance, Centers of Excellence, and Enterprise Architecture

There has been a revolution of new technologies and I’m here to enable customers. I look forward to working with SAP and Hyperscalers to help customers in the United States and Canada markets.

**SF:** **As the host of the podcast series, "**[**Cloudicorns**](https://www.youtube.com/c/Cloudicorns/featured)**,” what are some of the cloud technology topics that interest you? I see you have covered IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) vs. PaaS (Platform as a Service), as well as other topics of SaaS (Software as a Service), SAP ABAP, and SAP Project System? How did the idea get started?**

**DD:** As a person who started developing in C programing language more than 25 years ago, everything about useful NEW technologies fascinates me. The idea of creating the podcast came as an opportunity to share some of the knowledge that my cohost and I are constantly acquiring and provide a perspective that can help beginners and seasoned professionals.

We can easily create parallels and analogies between the Old and the New world, finding relationships and providing meaningful explanations to all colleagues from the Community who are interested in these topics.

My favorite topics these days are around Cloud Native Development, K8s (*Kubernetes* – open-source platform), Machine Learning, and System Automation. I use my personal time to learn non-SAP topics to then bring those ideas, mix them up, and come up with a new view of current SAP topics.**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/Diego2.png)**

**SF:** **What does it mean to you to be part of the SAP Mentors program?**

**DD:** For me, it is an opportunity to share my expertise, but even more imp...
