## Measuring the Attack/Defense Balance

“Who’s winning on the internet, the attackers or the defenders?”

I’m asked this all the time, and I can only ever give a qualitative hand-wavy answer. But Jason Healey and Tarang Jain’s latest Lawfare piece has [amassed data](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/are-cyber-defenders-winning).

The essay provides the first framework for metrics about how we are all doing collectively—and not just how an individual network is doing. Healey wrote to me in email:

> The work rests on three key insights: (1) defenders need a framework (based in threat, vulnerability, and consequence) to categorize the flood of potentially relevant security metrics; (2) trends are what matter, not specifics; and (3) to start, we should avoid getting bogged down in collecting data and just use what’s already being reported by amazing teams at Verizon, Cyentia, Mandiant, IBM, FBI, and so many others.
>
> The surprising conclusion: there’s a long way to go, but we’re doing better than we think. There are substantial improvements across threat operations, threat ecosystem and organizations, and software vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, we’re still not seeing increases in consequence. And since cost imposition is leading to a survival-of-the-fittest contest, we’re stuck with perhaps fewer but fiercer predators.

And this is just the start. From the report:

> Our project is proceeding in three phases—­the initial framework presented here is only phase one. In phase two, the goal is to create a more complete catalog of indicators across threat, vulnerability, and consequence; encourage cybersecurity companies (and others with data) to report defensibility-relevant statistics in time-series, mapped to the catalog; and drive improved analysis and reporting.

This is really good, and important, work.

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “Who’s winning on the internet, the attackers or the defenders?”

Is a question with actually a simple answer,

“Neither and both, like a pendulum and flywheel that both balance, and provide momentum toward advancement.”

I’m known for saying,

“Technology is agnostic to use a directing mind puts it to, whether that is seen as good or bad by an observer depends on their point of view at any given moment in time”

Thus the three important elements of the advancement are,

1, The using / directing entity.

All of which change with time.

People also need to be mindful that neither good nor bad can exist in isolation one requires the other for judgment. Thus they form a line or spectrum by which all technology can be measured at that point in time.

Which is what,

> “The essay provides the first framework for metrics about how we are all doing collectively—and not just how an individual network is doing.”

Is in effect trying to quantify, but is in danger of missing the change of time and environment.

Also there is a reason we are “drowning in metrics” but we are not achieving anything with them.

There a “value” is not meaningful untill it can be not just accurately and independently quantitized but meaningfully compared.

That is they have to allow for meaningful ratios to be given so that progress or advancement in any given direction can be independently checked and used for test and analysis.

Without which the metrics are not even worth the paper they are noted on.

Continued existence shows the defenders are winning. If the attackers were winning, the Internet would have joined usenet in the queue to the trash compactor.

@jbmartin6

The internet will continue to exist for a while yet: the attackers need it to work their deeds on. Usenet was just a subset that died when something better came along.

Attackers need to find one flaw.
Defenders must find and fix all flaws.

I’m with @Swede on this one. The attackers always have a huge financial advantage, because they only need to find one crack, one loose stone, while the defenders have to build an entire fortress.

This is not helped by those who make operating systems cheerfully denying any responsibility (or liability) for cracks in the wall – imagine how a castle contractor who built a cracked castle would be treated in the Middle Ages – and how today by the governments who let them, even when their own castles turn out cracked.

There are solutions to this. Make such that those who do find and exploit such cracks are subject to discovery and punishment so that it’s no longer worth their time to look for cracks anymore.

For example, a couple handfuls of Saudi Arabians took advantage of lax airline security to kill a few thousand people, and then the USA went all punitive and in return killed several thousand Afghans, tens of thousands of Iraqis, and several thousand more of their own people in an attempt to punish them for it. Maybe one or two Saudis.

Erf, maybe that’s a bad example. Anyhow, point being that in asymmetric warfare, there may be other influences that can be brought to bear.

Swede, Jon, ALL,

With regards,

> “Attackers need to find one flaw. Defenders must find and fix all flaws.”

Actually not true at all.

All you have to do is prevent the attackers reaching any and all flaws, and I’ve mentioned this repeatedly one way or another on this blog and in other places.

Go back to the translations of Sun Tzu and you will find two comments that are relevant,

1, Know you and your enemy.
2, Pick your battles and the ground you fight your enemy on.

In modern warfare these often get poorly translated to,

1, Have good intelligence.
2, Occupy the high ground.

Sun Tzu pointed out that battles are lost before they start if you do not know...
