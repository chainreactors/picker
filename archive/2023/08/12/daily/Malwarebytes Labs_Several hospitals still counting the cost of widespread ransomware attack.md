## Several hospitals still counting the cost of widespread ransomware attack

August 11, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

The 16 hospitals struck down by ransomware last week are [still dealing with the fallout from the attack](https://therecord.media/prospect-hospitals-still-recovering). The healthcare facilities located in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode island, and California had the ransomware attack confirmed by the FBI. Issues started to emerge last Thursday with [patients diverted to other locations](https://apnews.com/article/cyberattack-hospital-emergency-outage-4c808c1dad8686458ecbeababd08fecf) and some operations put on hold.

The AP reported that staff were forced to resort to pen and paper and manually running records to different departments. When dealing with potentially critical health issues, every second counts, and this is especially the case where so much critical healthcare equipment is reliant on networks and interconnected digital systems.

A recent Facebook update from Waterbury Hospital, CT reads as follows:

> Our computer systems continue to be down throughout the network. We are following downtime procedures including the use of paper records. The outage has affected some of our outpatient services, mostly diagnostic imaging and blood draw and some patient appointments. We have contacted and will continue to contact any affected patients.

The post also states that a diagnostic radiology department is affected.

At the time of the attack, no ransomware group had claimed responsibility for the network breach. Now, according to The Record, several sources told Recorded Future News that the ransomware group behind this widespread attack is Rhysida. It’s standard practice that law enforcement will not comment on a ransomware group directly while an investigation is taking place.

What’s interesting given the alleged claims from sources is that the US Department of Health and Human Services recently [published a warning](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/rhysida-ransomware-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf) to hospitals last week about this specific group. The document said about Rhysida:

> Rhysida is a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that has emerged since May 2023. The group drops an eponymous ransomware via phishing attacks and Cobalt Strike to breach targets’ networks and deploy their payloads. The group threatens to publicly distribute the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid. Rhysida is still in early stages of development, as indicated by the lack of advanced features and the program name Rhysida-0.1.
>
> The ransomware also leaves PDF notes on the affected folders, instructing the victims to contact the group via their portal and pay in Bitcoin. Its victims are distributed throughout several countries across Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. They primarily attack education, government, manufacturing, and technology and managed service provider sectors; however, there has been recent attacks against the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector.

The HHS notes that the ransomware is relatively new. When it first made an appearance on our Ransomware Review in [July of this year](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/ransomware-review-july-2023/), we said the following:

> Rhysida, a new ransomware gang claiming to be a “cybersecurity team,” has been in operation since May 17, 2023, making headlines for their high-profile attack against the [Chilean Army](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1663255077413322767?lang=en).
>
> The gang published a whopping eighteen victims on their leak site in June, making it one of the most prolific newcomer...
