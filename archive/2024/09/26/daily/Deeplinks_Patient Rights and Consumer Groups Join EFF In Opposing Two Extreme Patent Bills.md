**Update 11/19/24: The Senate Judiciary Committee is still scheduled to vote on the PREVAIL Act on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2024. Please express your continued opposition through our action center, linked below.**

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is set to vote this Thursday on two bills that could significantly empower patent trolls. The Patent Eligibility Restoration Act (PERA) would bring back many of the abstract computer patents that have been barred for the past 10 years [under Supreme Court precedent](https://www.eff.org/alice). Meanwhile, the PREVAIL Act would severely limit how the public can challenge wrongly granted patents at the patent office.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-we-can-t-afford-to-bring-back-the-worst-patents/)

[Tell Congress: No New Bills For Patent Trolls](https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-we-can-t-afford-to-bring-back-the-worst-patents/)

EFF has sent letters to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing both of these bills. The letters are co-signed by a wide variety of civil society groups, think tanks, startups, and business groups that oppose these misguided bills.
