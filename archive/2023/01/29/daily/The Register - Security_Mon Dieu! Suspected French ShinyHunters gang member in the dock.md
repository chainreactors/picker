A French citizen was scheduled to appear before a US court on Friday on a nine-count indictment related to his alleged involvement in the ShinyHunters cybercrime gang that trafficked in identity and corporate data theft and sometimes extortion.

Twenty-one-year-old Sebastien Raoult, aka Sezyo Kaizen, was [arrested](https://www.barrons.com/news/morocco-detains-frenchman-wanted-in-us-over-cybercrime-police-source-01659108606?tesla=y) last year in Morocco and extradited to the US this week. Raoult and two co-conspirators were indicted on nine counts — conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of wire fraud and three counts of aggravated identity theft — by a grand jury in 2021.

Since early 2020, the ShinyHunters crew has stolen "millions of customer records" and sold sensitive data belonging to more than 60 companies in Washington state and elsewhere around the world, according to the US Attorney's office.
