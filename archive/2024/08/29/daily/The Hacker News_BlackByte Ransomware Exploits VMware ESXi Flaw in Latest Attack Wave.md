[![BlackByte Ransomware](data:image/png;base64... "BlackByte Ransomware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlKhe5sw0WQsQoa12iQy671uO8guaKaOo1E48OYxBYSMVanH5vSqOLNzV4CjgLJ20-3VKvtzuXfKo_j65xtwlJL7SVO90_Se4WKZc30XIUQgvuDcb-0OQc_TaQ9pgYsE6gAvZfHNpV0gKjXQns8qb6Bn8fAoA90m3UKgCKfVVOdH6mVKHX0kYcc6apPYaJ/s790-rw-e365/ransomware.png)

The threat actors behind the BlackByte ransomware group have been observed likely exploiting a recently patched security flaw impacting VMware ESXi hypervisors, while also leveraging various vulnerable drivers to disarm security protections.

"The BlackByte ransomware group continues to leverage tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that have formed the foundation of its tradecraft since its inception, continuously iterating its use of vulnerable drivers to bypass security protections and deploying a self-propagating, wormable ransomware encryptor," Cisco Talos said in a technical [report](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/blackbyte-blends-tried-and-true-tradecraft-with-newly-disclosed-vulnerabilities-to-support-ongoing-attacks/) shared with The Hacker News.

The exploitation of [CVE-2024-37085](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/vmware-esxi-flaw-exploited-by.html), an authentication bypass vulnerability in VMware ESXi that has also been weaponized by other ransomware groups, is a sign that the e-crime group is pivoting from established approaches.

BlackByte [made](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-spotlight/ransomware-spotlight-blackbyte) its debut in the second half of 2021 and is purported to be one of the autonomous ransomware offshoots to have emerged in the months leading up to [shutdown of the infamous Conti](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/conti-ransomware-gang-shut-down-after.html) ransomware crew.

The ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group has a [history](https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/blackbyte-20-ransomware-infiltrate.html) of exploiting [ProxyShell](https://redcanary.com/blog/threat-intelligence/blackbyte-ransomware/) vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server to obtain initial access, while avoiding systems that use Russian and a number of Eastern European languages.

Like RaaS groups, it also leverages [double extortion](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blackbyte-ransomware/) as part of attacks, adopting a name-and-shame approach via a data leak site operated on the dark web to pressurize victims into paying up. Multiple variants of the ransomware, [written in C, .NET, and Go](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/analysis-blackbyte-ransomware-s-go-based-variants), have been observed in the wild to date.

While a [decryptor](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/blackbyte-ransomware-pt-1-in-depth-analysis/) for BlackByte was released by Trustwave in October 2021, the group has continued to refine its modus operandi, even going to the extent of employing a custom tool named [ExByte](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/12/blackbyte-ransomware-takes-an-extra-bite-using-double-extortion-methods) for data exfiltration prior to commencing encryption.

An advisory [released](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2022/02/15/fbi-and-usss-release-advisory-blackbyte-ransomware) by the U.S. government in early 2022 attributed the RaaS group to financially motivated attacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors, including financial, food and agriculture, and government facilities.

One of the important aspects of their attacks is the use of vulnerable drivers to terminate security processes and bypass controls, a technique known as bring your own vulnerable driver ([BYOVD](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/ransomware-hackers-using-aukill-tool-to.html)).

Cisco Talos, which investigated a recent BlackByte ransomware attack, said the intrusion was likely facilitated using valid credentials to access the victim organization's VPN. It's believed that the initial access was obtained through a brute-force attack.

"Given BlackByte's history of exploiting public-facing vulnerabilities for initial access, the use of VPN for remote access may represent a slight shift in technique or could represent opportunism," security researchers James Nutland, Craig Jackson, Terryn Valikodath, and Brennan Evans said. "The use of the victim's VPN for remote access also affords the adversary other advantages, including reduced visibility from the organization's EDR."

The threat actor subsequently managed to escalate their privileges, using the permissions to access the organization's VMware vCenter server to create and add new accounts to an Active Directory group named ESX Admins. This, Talos said, was done by exploiting [CVE-2024-37085](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/vmware-esxi-flaw-exploited-by.html), which enables an attacker to gain administrator privileges on the hypervisor by creating a group with that name and adding any user to it.

This privilege could then be abused to control virtual machines (VMs), modify host server's configuration, and gain unauthorized access to system logs, diagnostics, and performance monitoring tools.

Talos pointed out that the exploitation of the flaw took place within days of public disclosure, highlighting the speed at which threat actors refine their tactics to incorporate newly disclosed vulnerabilities into their...
