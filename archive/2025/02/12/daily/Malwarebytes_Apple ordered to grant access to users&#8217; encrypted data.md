# Apple ordered to grant access to users’ encrypted data

Posted: February 11, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Last week, an article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/) revealed the UK had secretly ordered Apple to provide blanket access to protected [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) backups around the world. Since then, privacy focused groups have uttered their objections.

The UK government has demanded to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service. However, Apple itself doesn’t have access to it at the moment, only the holder of the Apple account can access data stored in this way.

Neither the Home Office nor Apple responded on the record to queries about the demand served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) , but the [BBC confirmed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g288yldko) that it had heard the same information from reliable sources.

[Privacy International](https://privacyinternational.org/press-release/5520/press-release-united-kingdom-goes-after-apples-encrypted-data) said the demand is a “misguided attempt” that uses disproportionate government powers to access encrypted data, which may:

> “Set a damaging precedent and encourage abusive regimes around the world to take similar actions.”

The [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all) stated:

> “Encryption is one of the best ways we have to reclaim our privacy and security in a digital world filled with cyberattacks and security breaches, and there’s no way to weaken it in order to only provide access to the good guys.”

The main goal for the Home Office is an optional feature that turns on end-to-end encryption for backups and other data stored in iCloud. This feature is called Advanced Data Protection. Enabling Advanced Data Protection (ADP), protects the majority of your iCloud data — including iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, and more — using end-to-end encryption.

For some time, these backups presented law enforcement agencies with a loophole to obtain access to data otherwise not available to them on iPhones with device encryption enabled. If the user hasn’t enabled ADP, this loophole still exists.

The EFF recommends users should turn off the option to create iCloud backups should the UK get its way. As the EFF has said before, and we agree, there is no [backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor) that only works for the “good guys” and only targets “bad guys.” It’s all or nothing, and the bad guys will have enough money to find alternatives, while regular users may run out of free options if governments keep doing this.

## What can I do?

How you wish to proceed after this news is obviously up to you, but we have some options you may be interested in. If you think Apple will stand up against the UK’s Home Office you can enable iCloud backup and Advanced Data Protection.

But if you want to find another place for your backups, these instructions may come in handy.

## **How to turn off iCloud backups**

### **On iPhone or iPad**

* Tap **Settings** > {username} > **iCloud On your iPhone or iPad**.
* This will list the devices with iCloud Backup turned on.
* To delete a backup, tap the name of a device, then tap **Turn Off and Delete from iCloud** (or...
