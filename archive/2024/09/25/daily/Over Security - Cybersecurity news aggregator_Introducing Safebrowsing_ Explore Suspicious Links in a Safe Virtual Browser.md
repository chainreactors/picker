Introducing Safebrowsing: Explore Suspicious Links in a Safe Virtual Browser

Current security measures against phishing links focus on automated checks and timely blocking before they reach users. Yet, some links still make it to their targets, leaving them vulnerable as they often have no simple, fast, and reliable tool at hand to check these links at the final stage.

To address this security gap, we created **Safebrowsing**, which makes it easy to safely and easily open any link and manually verify its content.

## What is Safebrowsing?

Safebrowsing offers a fully-interactive browser in the cloud that lets you open and navigate any website as you normally would in a completely isolated and secure environment. This ensures that any malicious activity encountered during browsing is contained and does not affect your local systems or network.

With Safebrowsing, you can launch a quick and secure virtual browser session to manually explore potentially harmful URLs. The service identifies malicious content in real time using [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=safebrowsing&utm_term=240924&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s proprietary technology and notifies you about it.

After each session, you receive a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) along with a detailed threat report.

Safebrowsing gives you the ability to follow the entire chain of attack in a safebrowser when facing phishing threats and get an in-depth network traffic analysis, including:

* Connections

* DNS and HTTP requests

* Network threats identified by Suricata IDS

Free beta of Safebrowsing is available to all ANY.RUN users

## How it works

Safebrowsing is built to be simple and effective, letting you quickly run analysis in three steps:

### **Step 1**: Submit URL

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/malUrlforsb-1024x576.png)

You enter the URL of the website you want to analyze and hit “Browse”.

### **Step 2:** Interact and Examine Threats

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/interface_sb-1024x576.png)

You interact with the website, clicking links, opening tabs, solving CAPTCHAs, and seeing what happens after each step with your own eyes.

While you explore, the service monitors the websites for any malicious content and lets you know about the danger.

### **Step 3:** Collect IOCs

Once you finish, the service generates a report outlining detected threats and suspicious activities, as well as lets you export packet data in PCAP.

## How is Safebrowsing different from the ANY.RUN sandbox?

Unlike our [advanced malware sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=safebrowsing&utm_term=240924&utm_content=linktolanding), Safebrowsing focuses exclusively on URL analysis.

It provides a less complex interface that eliminates the need for in-depth system monitoring and file system access, which makes it easy-to-use for non-experts. Yet, ANY.RUN’s signature interactivity is still there.

## How is Safebrowsing different from a URL scanner?

Compared to URL scanners that simply check any given URL against a database of known malicious URLs, Safebrowsing provides a fully interactive environment for exploring websites.

## What are possible use cases for Safebrowsing?

Safebrowsing is a universal tool that can be of great hel...
