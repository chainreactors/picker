Someone hacked Elmo's X account on Sunday, making it appear as if the lovable Sesame Street monster with the habit of referring to themselves in the third-person spewed a series of now-removed antisemitic, racist, and anti-Trump posts.

Sesame Workshop, the makers of Sesame Street, declined to specifically answer *The Register*'s questions about the compromise, including who hijacked Elmo, and how they took over the account.

A spokesperson, however, emailed us the following statement: "Elmo's X account was briefly compromised yesterday by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts. The account has since been secured."
