As hackers from nation-states and criminal gangs alike cause chaos, make money and even prepare for potential future conflicts with the United States, NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin traveled to a small New England town to learn more about how water operators are defending their systems from digital attacks.
