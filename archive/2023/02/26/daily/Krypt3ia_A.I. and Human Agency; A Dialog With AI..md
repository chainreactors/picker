*This article is part of an ongoing experiment with the use of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) for developing primers on cyber security topics.*

This morning, I was thinking about how to use ChatGPT as a tool rather than as an oracle, but more as a Cassandra. As I was watching the Friends reunion and having a bout of nostalgia, it came to me that my primary concern with AI, now, and in the future, is that human agency will likely disappear, or be relinquished by humanity to take a path of least resistance in life, instead of working hard at something. Think about it, we usually, as a species try to take the path of least resistance to lessen our burden, right? I mean, that’s how man became a tool user and stole fire. So, now we have the new Cyber Prometheus in ourselves stealing AI from the universe and giving it to ourselves to make life, well, easier.

I have been having discussions with A.Friend about all this too, so my mind is already in the AI trenches so to speak, but, in using the tool, I have seen its limitations, and its potentials. This morning, while pondering all this and commenting on Mastodon about my fears of loss of agency, YouTube alerted me to a new post by Wisecrack (linked below) on the notion I have been pondering, in their own way on how, as many pundits are pumping out posts about, will ChatGPT kill YouTuber content and put writers and creators out of jobs. I then decided to have the discussion with ChatGPT about agency and the causal effects from it potentially if we allow it to happen.

The resulting post below was completely generated by the AI with prompts from me, giving direction and refining it, but, you can see how with the right interaction, you can really pump out usable content in minutes as opposed to writing out a post over an hour or more.

Of course, the rub is, when the AI can do this with a single prompt effectively, and puts the blogger out of business.. What then?

***Postulate cause and effects on human society if AI removes their agency and compare between AI causing loss of human agency over the technology we already have today such as smartphones and the internet***

The possibility of AI causing a loss of human agency is a growing concern, as the technology advances and becomes more integrated into our daily lives. However, it is important to recognize that there are already technologies in existence, such as smartphones and the internet, which have changed the way we interact with the world around us and could also potentially impact our agency.

Smartphones and the internet have undoubtedly brought about many benefits, such as instant access to information, improved communication, and increased productivity. However, they have also been criticized for their potential to limit human agency in various ways. For example:

1. Addiction: Smartphones and the internet have been associated with addiction, leading to a lack of control over their use and potentially limiting human agency.
2. Social isolation: Social media platforms and online interactions have been criticized for replacing face-to-face interactions, leading to social isolation and a potential loss of agency in personal relationships.
3. Data privacy: The collection and use of personal data by tech companies without user consent has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for a loss of agency over one’s own personal information.
4. Filter bubbles: Algorithms used by search engines and social media platforms to personalize content can limit exposure to diverse viewpoints, potentially leading to a loss of agency over the information that individuals consume.
5. Disinformation: The spread of fake news and misinformation on the internet has the potential to limit agency by influencing public opinion and decision-making processes.

While the impact of these technologies on human agency may not be as dramatic as the hypothetical scenario of AI removing human agency entirely, they are still important considerations as we navigate the use of technology in our lives.

Comparatively, AI has the potential to impact human agency on a much larger scale, as it is designed to make decisions and take actions without human intervention. The possibility of AI making decisions based on data patterns and pre-determined algorithms could lead to a lack of transparency, accountability, and ultimately a loss of human agency.

However, it is important to recognize that the potential impact of AI on human agency is not predetermined. It is up to us to shape the development and deployment of AI in a way that supports and augments human agency, rather than limiting it. This includes designing AI systems with transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in mind, educating the public about AI, and collaborating across fields to ensure that AI benefits everyone in society.

***Write a blog post with one thousand words that talks about how AI will remove human agency***

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, transforming the way we interact with technology and changing the landscape of several industries. While the advancements in AI have been met with excitement and optimism, some experts have raised concerns that these technologies could eventually remove human agency and lead to a future where machines make all decisions. In this blog post, we will explore the idea of AI removing human agency, examining the current state of AI and its potential future impact on society.

Before delving into the topic, it is essential to understand what is meant by the term human agency. In the context of this post, human agency refers to the ability of humans to make decisions and take actions based on their own free will and personal values. It is the capacity for individuals to have control over their own lives, make choices, and exert power over their environments.

The idea of AI removing human agency is not new. It has been a topic of discussion among experts and scholars for several years. However, it has gained more attention in recent times, with the rapid advancements in AI and the increasing use of these technologies in various sectors. Some experts argue that as AI becomes more intelligent and capable, it will eventually reach a point where it can make all decisions without human intervention. This could lead to a future where humans are no longer in control of their own lives, and machines make all choices for them.

One area where AI is already making significant inroads is in the field of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars are becoming more common, and many experts predict that they will become the norm in the not-too-distant future. While autonomous vehicles have the potential to make our roads safer and more efficient, they also raise questions about human agency. If a self-driving car makes a mistake or causes an accident, who is responsible? The car itself, or the humans who designed and programmed it? If machines are making decisions that affect human lives, how can we ensure that they are making the right choices?

Another area where AI is having a significant impact is in the job market. Automation and robotics are increasingly replacing human workers in many industries, and this trend is likely to continue in the future. While this has the potential to increase efficiency and productivity, it also raises questions about human agency. If machines are doing all the work, what is left for humans to do? Will we become obsolete, or will we find new roles and ways to contribute to society?

The potential impact of AI on human agency is not limited to the areas mentioned above. As AI continues to advance, it is likely to affect man...
