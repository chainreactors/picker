In today’s world, both small businesses and everyday consumers face a growing number of cyber threats. From [ransomware](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-ransomware) attacks to [phishing](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-phishing) scams, hackers are becoming more sophisticated. OpenText’s **2024 Threat Hunter Perspective** sheds light on what’s coming next and how to protect yourself. Whether you’re running a small business or managing personal data at home, here’s what you need to know.

## Nation-states are teaming up with cybercrime gangs

Cybercrime is no longer just about lone hackers. Now, nation-states like **Russia** and **China** are working with organized [cybercrime](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-cybercrime) groups to launch highly targeted attacks on businesses, governments, and even individuals.

* **Russia** has been particularly active, coordinating with groups like [Killnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killnet) to attack critical infrastructure in countries supporting Ukraine.
* **China** is focusing on its political goals in the South China Sea, often collaborating with cybercrime rings like [Storm-0558](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/#:~:text=The%20objective%20of%20most%20Storm,campaigns%2C%20and%20OAuth%20token%20attacks.).

**For SMBs:** Be aware that even smaller businesses can be collateral damage in nation-state cyber wars, especially if you’re part of a critical supply chain. Strengthen your security measures to avoid becoming an easy target.

**For consumers:** Stay alert to potential phishing attacks or scams related to global events. Hackers often exploit moments of political tension or publicized aid efforts.

## Timing is everything for hackers

One of the key insights from the report is how hackers choose the most disruptive moments to strike. Whether it’s during an election, the holiday season, a big sporting event, or a major business transaction, cybercriminals wait for the right moment to maximize damage.

[![Fever chart showing spike in cyber attacks followiing announcement of military aid for Ukraine](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23125053/2024-threat-hunter-fever-chart.png)](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/23125053/2024-threat-hunter-fever-chart.png)

For example, businesses supporting Ukraine saw a significant increase in attacks within 24-48 hours of announcing aid. This shows that hackers pay attention to the news—and use it to time their attacks for maximum chaos.

**For SMBs:** Be especially vigilant during peak business times or important events, like product launches, financial closings, or holiday seasons. These are moments when your business may be more vulnerable due to distractions or heavy workloads.

**For consumers:** During holidays or big events (like the Super Bowl or Black Friday), be cautious of unexpected emails, texts, or promotions. Scammers love to take advantage of busy times to trick people into clicking malicious links.

## Top cyber threats you need to know about in 2024

The OpenText report highlights some of the most dangerous cyber threats we’ll be facing this year. Whether you run a small business or manage your own personal data, these threats are ones to watch out for:

* **Killnet** and **Storm0558** (nation-state-linked groups)
* [**Akira**](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-109a) and **[Black Basta](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-131a)** (ransomware gangs targeting businesses of all sizes)

These groups are known for launching ransomware attacks, where they lock down your systems or steal data, demanding a hefty ransom to get it back.

**For SMBs:** Invest in ransomware prevention and always back up your data. Having regular backups means you can recover without having to pay a ransom.

**For consumers:** Keep personal backups of important files (photos, documents, etc.) on an external drive or in the cloud. That way, even if your devices get infected, you won’t lose everything.

## What to expect this fall: U.S. election and beyond

With the U.S. presidential election in fall 2024, the cyber landscape is expected to get even more dangerous. Cybercriminals and nation-states alike will likely target key services and use misinformation to influence the public.

In addition, the report predicts an increase in attacks on critical infrastructure—things like power grids, water systems, and hospitals—throughout 2024, as part of the growing cyber arms race.

**For SMBs:** Be prepared for increased cyber activity around major political events, as hackers may use the chaos to launch broader attacks. Ensure your cybersecurity measures are updated and your employees are trained to spot phishing attempts.

**For consumers:** Be skeptical of political content online, especially as we approach the election. [Deepfake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) videos and fake news are expected to rise, making it harder to tell fact from fiction.

## AI: Both a help and a threat

AI is playing a bigger role in cybersecurity, but it’s also giving hackers new tools. Cybercriminals are using AI to create more convincing scams, such as deepfake videos and phishing emails that are harder to detect. But at the same time, AI can hel...
