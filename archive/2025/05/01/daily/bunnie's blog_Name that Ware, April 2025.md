## Name that Ware, April 2025

The Ware for this month is shown below:

![](https://bunniefoo.com/ntw/ntw_april_2025.jpg)

It’s a tiny portion of a much larger ware, but for various reasons I think this is sufficient for someone to guess at least the type of ware this came from, if not the exact make/model.

There’s a particularly interesting bit about this ware, which you can see in the center of the left module – a tiny bit of wire that is out of place! It’s pretty rare to find small manufacturing defects like this in the wild. So far, this defect hasn’t caused a functional issue but I suppose some day it may. I wonder if this is a so-called “tin whisker” (i.e., a piece of metal that will keep growing with time until it causes a fault), or if it is just an errant bit of metal left over as an artifact of the manufacturing process. Only time will tell, I suppose!

   Looks like one of those cute, 4-digit 7-segment “smart” displays where the segment LEDs are cast into these transparent epoxy “bubbles” to optically magnify them.

   Definitely “bubble” 7-seg LED displays. Used in calculators and the occasional wristwatch back in the 70s. The actual LED dies aren’t really visible – they’ll be between the prongs of the fork-like metal areas, one per segment. Made by a number of manufacturers (like HP – one of theirs is the HP 5082-7400).

   The thing that stands out here is that the epoxy bubbles aren’t tinted red, which is a little unusual; haven’t got any like that in my collection

   Separately, I heard Big Clive refer to those little unwanted strands of metal sneaking into things – especially PCBs – as “oh there’s a wee George Michael, a Careless Whisker”, and that’s stuck with me

     one contact \_fork\_ per segment – these look like they have 4 LED dies per vertical segment, 3 per horizontal. You can just about see the dies (dices? Chips?) if you zoom in

       Yes, from the construction I suspect one would see dots, not lines like most of these things. The only ones like this I can find are Litronix but I could not find something exactly like this (4 and 3).

   It’s two digits of a 7-segment LED bubble display. Likely something like NSA1166 or similar. I grabbed one when a NOS lot was on sale at Jameco

     I think you are right on the manufacturer side, the unique design pattern of the diode layout (inverse) and the gold plated theme strongly suggest this is a National Semiconductor bubble 7segment LED display. Base on the datasheet

     <https://www.datasheet.live/pdfviewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpdf.datasheet.live%2Ff5e95fdf%2Fnational.com%2FNSA0038.pdf>

     This seem to be NSA0038 or some earlier series as it only 7 segment with a DP.

     I dug out my NS1166. While similar, it’s not a match.

   Lol, I have one of these! It immediately looked familiar. I’m sure this was used in a calculator, however there is nothing to indicate a manufacturer.

   Curiously, the manufacturing quality is pretty sloppy with mine as well. The silicon wafers are not exactly cut straight, there is a noticeable scratch across one of the segments, and on the other side of that same segment they welded the bond wire basically on top of one of the LED chips :-o
   The imprint next to the red LED (error indicator?) says something like Y58 to a logo consisting of an S or two, and 1275. So I’d guess it is week #12 in 1975? If that S is a manufacturer’s logo, I’m lost.
   Looking up 1975 vintage manufacturers, I came across this collector’s site: <https://www.crazywatches.pl/trafalgar-led-1975> which might also contain the display the NTW picture is taken from.

   I’ve got a few of these as well! I’ve always loved the way they look, there’s a certain charm to the distorted little digits. Mine are in a big old hunk of HP test equipment, obtained off of Ebay for 1/1000th the price it sold for new 30 years ago and somehow still working after a bit of tinkering. It also features some alphanumeric displays in a similar package using neat little 5×7 LED arrays.

   Unfortunately a quick look with a microscope confirms that the dies in mine aren’t identical to these :) Hopefully someone can track down exactly where they came from.

   I enjoy how we all dig into our little troves of this stuff when this sort of ware comes up. I have a few of the National displays (NSA1588a, NSA1298 and an unmarked integrated one with 16 segments per digit), and some Litronix, H-P, and no name ones. No exact matches, though.
   With the exception of some very early displays like the Monsanto MAN-1, none of these use individual LED dies for the segments. The ware pictured and all of the Nationals have a monolithic substrate for each digit made of GaAs into which a dopant is diffused (later impl...
