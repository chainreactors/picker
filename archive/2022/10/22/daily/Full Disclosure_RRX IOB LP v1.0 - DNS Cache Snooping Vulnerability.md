Technical Details & Description:
================================
A dns cache snooping vulnerability has been discovered in the official Rhein Ruhr Express (RRX IOB Landing Page 1.0 -
Open Source Software) with Hotspot Siemens Portal.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to determine resolved sites and name servers to followup with manipulative
interactions.

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to determine which domains have recently been resolved via this name server,
and therefore which hosts have been recently visited.
For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company utilizes the online services of a particular
financial institution, they would be able to use this attack
to build a statistical model regarding company usage of that financial institution. Of course, the attack can also be
usead to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns, external
mail servers, and more. If this is an internal DNS server not accessible to outside networks, attacks would be limited
to the internal network. This may include employees,
consultants and potentially users on a guest network or WiFi connection if supported.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The dns cache snooping vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with wifi guest access without user
interaction or privileged user account.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to
continue.

--- PoC Session Logs ---
Sent a non-recursive query for test.com
and received 1 answer: dnsmasq-2.75
93.184.216.34

Hosts
53 / udp / dns
192.168.44.1

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Improve the cache management via dns to ensure no manipulations can take place.
Contact the manufacturer siemens to resolve the issue by an automated or manual patch.
2022-10-09: Vendor Fix/Patch by Check (Service Developer Team)
The patching process will be delivered by siemens during train maintenance and will take at least until 2022 Q2-Q3 to
be rolled out on all trains (40+).

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the web vulnerability in the siemens hotspot rxx wifi is estimated as medium.
