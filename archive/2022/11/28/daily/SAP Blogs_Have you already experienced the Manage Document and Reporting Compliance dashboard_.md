As tax authorities across the world continue to introduce more demanding requirements transitioning from periodic statutory reports to continuous transaction control, business processes are extended by additional steps that send business documents to tax authorities for registration and approval prior sending to business partners.

The **Manage Document and Reporting Compliance** dashboard offers a unified and harmonized way of analyzing the latest compliance status originating from Document and Reporting Compliance processes for different legal mandates, such as electronic invoicing, real-time reporting, and statutory reporting. With this dashboard, you can make your life easier by seeing the progress of document processes and reporting with tax authorities in real-time, identifying approaching reporting deadlines that require prompt actions and any failing document that needs to be acted prior submission to authorities.

Besides gaining visibility, you can navigate from the dashboard to different Fiori applications, such as the [**Manage Electronic Documents**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/08/a-walkthrough-of-sap-document-and-reporting-compliance-drc-app-manage-electronic-documents/?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed) for electronic document processing or the [**Run Advanced Compliance Reports**](https://share.video.sap.com/media/t/1_enke9ntr) **to easily correct** any open issues with full traceability to business transactions.

But how can you do that? First, you may access the **Manage Document and Reporting Compliance** dashboard with the same authorization concept available for its navigation apps. For a comprehensive list of authorization roles per card and existing features, please refer to the [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/search?q=%22Manage%20Document%20and%20Reporting%20Compliance%22&locale=en-US&format=standard,html,pdf,others) for your desired release.

You can access the dashboard in different ways.

Via the front-end menu:

* HOME-> Globalization - Electronic Documents -> Manage Document and Reporting Compliance

or

* HOME-> Statutory Reporting -> Manage Document and Reporting Compliance

Via search app starting filter:

Figure 1: Search the Manage Document and Reporting Compliance App

Since the 2208 CE and the 2022 OP FPS0 release, there is also an integration feature that allows data display and navigation from the *Documents – Communication Progress* and *Documents – Action Required* cards to the **Manage Electronic Documents** Fiori app, the latest cockpit for electronic documents processing.

To access this feature, add the field **Document Compliance App** – available by clicking on the **Adapt Filter** button – to your overview page.

Figure 2: Document Compliance App Filter

From the **Document Compliance App** field, you can choose the target application which would be preferred for accessing and taking action upon electronic documents. You can choose the **eDocument Cockpit** app or the **Manage Electronic Documents** app.

By selecting the **Manage Electronic Documents** app, the document cards will automatically update their data considering this application. All documents existing navigation features and filters will now apply to this configuration

Figure 3: Select your Document Compliance App

Important to notice that only documents from enabled countries by **Manage Electronic Documents** are displayed, once this app is selected, via the **Document Compliance App** filter.

In this example, **Manage Electronic Documents** is selected as your *Document Compliance App.*

Figure 4: Communication Status and Action Required of Electronic Documents

You may now navigate to your e-documents and take action. For example, you can click on the *Italy Fattura XML* to have more details on the *Action Required* documents.

Figure 5: Manage Electronic Documents

Next, from the **Manage Electronic Documents** app, you can check the e-documents according to your selection.

In case you would like to use the **Manage Electronic Documents** app by default the next time you access the Manage Document and Reporting Compliance dashboard, you can create a variant, and set it as default for your user following the process below:

Figure 6: Add a new default variant

Save your new variant by choosing *Standard* view and *Save As.*

*![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/09/blog_img7.png)*

Figure 7: Save default variant

After you choose *Save* and set it as default, you will already have your predefined filter configurations the next time you access the **Manage Document and Reporting Compliance** dashboard.

In this post, you have walked through the Manage Document and Reporting Compliance dashboard and learned how to navigate from the cards to different applications of Document and Reporting Compliance. You have also learned how to save variants to start your own workspace with preferred filters.
