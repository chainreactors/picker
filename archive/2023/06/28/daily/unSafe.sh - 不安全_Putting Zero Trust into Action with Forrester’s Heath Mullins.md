Today, securing hybrid workers and the data they need to access is a challenge that faces both government and commercial customers alike. Implementing a true Zero Trust infrastructure, a concept that at its core is built on the premise of not trusting anyone or anything, will go a long way to getting organizations there.

Moving from the Zero Trust concept to implementation was the basis of [a recent fireside chat](https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/webcasts/putting-zero-trust-action-secure-hybrid-workforce) I participated in with Forrester Senior Analyst [Heath Mullins](https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/heath-mullins/BIO18364).

Many security professionals understand that Zero Trust done right helps protect all aspects of an organization. But getting to that point continues to be a challenge even for businesses and government agencies with ample resources.

Our lively fireside chat went beyond the concepts to discuss tangible steps forward, tackling topics like:

**Where to start:**

* Two key places: 1. Understanding network dependencies and 2. Tackling data visibility

**How to start:**

* Conduct a thorough assessment to find dependencies
* Assess what you have: Cloud properties, data centers, remote access users, etc.; Doing so will help understand overlap and duplication
* Sharpen your data visibility (discovery, classification, data tagging, etc.); [Data Classification](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/forcepoint-data-classification?_bt=633281200782&_bk=forcepoint%20data%20classification&_bm=p&_bn=g&_bg=146783769521&sf_src_cmpid=77015f0000001Q8L&utm_term=forcepoint%20data%20classification&utm_campaign=NAM_-_BRN_-_Brand_Terms_-_Search&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search_pd&utm_content=brand_terms_search_cam=770037328&hsa_acc=4948252953&hsa_cam=770037328&hsa_grp=146783769521&hsa_ad=633281200782&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-1716403148155&hsa_kw=forcepoint%20data%20classification&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7uSkBhDGARIsAMCZNJumMb51z2FdkCrI6GONWFiS5gFTbu2cjWs71A7qm5lVkBiaVtQXw8IaAjgnEALw_wcB) contributes to getting data tagging off the ground

**Benefits of micro-segmentation:**

* Gives organizations the ability to see everywhere from cloud to on-prem to hybrid worker
* Allows for protecting down to the application level
* Biggest problem with micro segmentation: You have to be a network shop to fully implement

**Role of new tools like RBI and CDR**

* 2014 - 15: Started as a way to protect CEO
* Necessary since attackers have shifted from C-suite to lower-level employees

**The shift from point products to platforms**

* In 2013 or 2014, platforms were the focus; didn't work initially because of vendor lock-in fears; trended to best-of breed
* Zero Trust paradigm is causing a shift back to the platform side
* Operationally, it's much easier to train SOC teams on one platform

**Role of Analytics in Zero Trust**

* UEBA indicators = Understanding typical behaviors at employee level
* However, understanding needs to go beyond indicators: engagement with management, co-workers, etc.
* Did this person access something they're allowed to, but shouldn't or if they're accessing frequently – that could be a red flag
