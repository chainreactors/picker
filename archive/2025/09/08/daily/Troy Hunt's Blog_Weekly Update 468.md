# Weekly Update 468

07 September 2025

I only just realised, as I prepared this accompanying blog post, that I didn't talk about one of the points in the overview: food. One of my fondest memories as a child living in Singapore and now as an adult visiting there is the food. It's one of those rare places where the food at every level is just exceptional, and even a basic outing is a treat. As a kid, the most common "fast food" I'd eat was from local "hawker centres", probably what many people would call street food, but never in the "I'm not sure what my night will look like after eating it" kind of way. Noodles, satay, BBQ pork, and all that sort of thing. Or on the pricier side, no visit back is complete without Singapore chilli crab, which served as our final meal on Thursday before we jumped on the plane home. And that's one of the great joys of travel - the ability to experience the differences that make these trips so much more enjoyable. The last time I remember thinking how exceptional the food was was in Reykjavik earlier this year. I think it's time to pay Stefan another visit ðŸ¤¤
