# Senderbase.org redirects to end in April

[Announcements](/category/announcements/)

As of April 20, 2023, we are decommissioning SenderBase.org and any attempts to visit that web page will fail.

Talos Intelligence’s website (TalosIntelligence.com) has served as the replacement for SenderBase.org for many years, with TalosIntelligence.com providing the same information as SenderBase.org once did. Since that time, visitors to SenderBase.org have been automatically redirected to TalosIntelligence.com, and the redirect from SenderBase.org is finally being removed on April 20, 2023. After that, attempts to visit SenderBase.org will fail.

Any users still utilizing bookmarks or links pointing to Senderbase.org should update these to ensure they still work appropriately.

Thank you for assisting us in this process.
