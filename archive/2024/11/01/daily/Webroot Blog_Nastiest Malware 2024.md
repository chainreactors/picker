As we look back on the cybersecurity landscape of 2024, it’s clear that the world of digital threats continues to evolve at an alarming pace in parallel with AI. This year has seen ransomware groups adapt and innovate, pushing the boundaries of their malicious capabilities and evasiveness from law enforcement. In our annual “Nastiest Malware” report, now in its sixth year, we’ve observed a steady increase in both the number and sophistication of malware attacks. The ransomware sector, in particular, has witnessed the emergence of “business models,” with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) dominating the scene. Elite ransomware authors have concluded that profit sharing and risk mitigation are key contributors to their consistent success and evasion of authorities.

The [saga of LockBit](https://community.opentextcybersecurity.com/cybersecurity-standpoint-174/lockbit-saga-continues-return-of-the-fbi-357646) in 2024 exemplifies the resilience and adaptability of these cybercriminal groups. Despite a major law enforcement operation in February, dubbed “Operation Cronos,” which saw the FBI and international partners seize LockBit’s infrastructure and obtain over 7,000 decryption keys, the group managed to resurface within days. This cat-and-mouse game between LockBit and law enforcement agencies has continued throughout the year, with the group’s leader even taunting the FBI, claiming that their efforts only make LockBit stronger. The LockBit story underscores a crucial point: while law enforcement operations can disrupt cybercriminal activities, they often fall short of delivering a knockout blow. These groups have become adept at rebuilding their infrastructure, rebranding when necessary, and continuing their operations with minimal downtime.

As we detail our analysis of the six most notorious ransomware and malware groups that have dominated headlines in 2024, it’s important to note that the threat landscape extends beyond just these actors. The rise of AI-driven phishing and social engineering, increased targeting of critical infrastructure, and the emergence of more sophisticated fileless malware are all trends that have shaped the cybersecurity battlefield this year.

In this report, we’ll explore how these groups have evolved, their most significant attacks, and the broader implications for cybersecurity. We’ll also provide updated survival tips for both businesses and individual users, reflecting the ever-changing nature of these threats.

## Ransomware

Over the past decade, ransomware has established itself as the pinnacle of cybercriminal exploits. It is the most successful and lucrative avenue for monetizing a breach of a victim. Every year we see more and more data stolen and higher ransom demands dominating headlines. Each ransomware group on our Nastiest Malware list utilizes the double-extortion method where the data stolen is leveraged for leak potential on dark web leak sites. The impending damage to brand and reputation that comes with the public disclosure of a breach are massive threats to companies of any size. Not to mention the impending regulatory fines that come with the breach. This strategy has shown it’s resilience over the past few years since it became mainstream and it seems to be as robust as ever. Let’s take a look at what the payment numbers look like so far in 2024.

We’ve seen a drop-off from the highs last year – fueled by Cl0p ransomware group making over $100 Million in a few months in late 2023. But when we zoom out you can see that it will be going up over time. This time next year we anticipate the amounts to be higher than what they are now. Some of this will be fueled by inflation, some will be an increase in effectiveness in tactics, and some by the anticipated 2025 “bull run” price spike in crypto – the only payment method these criminals accept.

Looking at the payment resolution rates – meaning the percentage of people that end up paying the ransom, we can see a slight increase during this year. Zooming out the trend does indicate an overall decline which is good news and reflects that the industry is taking serious precautions in their security posture. We expect that this slight increase is only temporary and will continue the trend of decreasing for next year.

[![Pie chart showing companies by size that have been impacted by ransomware.

One nasty change this year is the increase of ransomware attacks on smaller sized businesses. The market share of ransomware attacks on business with under 100 employees is now almost **40%**. While the media headlines of record breaking ransoms against fortune 500 companies will always take center stage, the small to mid market has always been the bread and butter for cybercriminals. The amount of effort and return on investment of time is too good for criminals not to b...
