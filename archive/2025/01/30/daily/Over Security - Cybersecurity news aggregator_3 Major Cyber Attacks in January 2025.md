3 Major Cyber Attacks in January 2025

Our cyber threat analysts detected and explored a number of malware campaigns this January. Here are the three most dangerous attacks dissected with the aid of [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cyber_attacks_jan_25&utm_term=290125&utm_content=linktolanding) and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/).

## Fake YouTube links redirect users to phishing pages

[*Original post on X*](https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1877364257496473802)

Using the Uniform Resource Identifier authority (URI), phishers obfuscate links and place a legitimate resource address, like http://youtube, at the beginning of URLs to deceive users and make the link appear authentic and safe.

Not just YouTube is getting abused. We’ll keep monitoring and sharing the details with you, so your company can make effective decisions to address the threat.

Watch how the attack unveils in our Interactive Sandbox and gather [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) for setting up your security systems.

* Technically, the URI Scheme replaces the userinfo field (user:pass) with a domain name: foo:// <user:pass> @ domain . Zone.

* Storm 1747 domain infrastructure — checkers, redirectors and main pages — has a standard template for Tycoon 2FA phishkit installed.

* The technique of replacing user info is also employed by various other phishing kits, such as Mamba 2FA and EvilProxy.

To study the behavior and indicators of all these malware samples, use ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox.

## Phishers use fake online shops with surveys to steal credit card information

[Original post on X](https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1879883672263803060)

The new phishing scheme we named FoxWhoops targets American e-commerce customers with fake sites promising a reward for completing a survey

The attack utilizes a system of checks. Users who fail them are sent to a Fox News RSS page or a page with a ‘Whoops!’ image. Those who pass the checks are offered to enter their bank card info to purchase the ‘reward’ at a discount.

A number of examples of such attacks have been submitted in our sandbox:

* [Fake Market](https://app.any.run/browses/566dac16-0dee-4343-9dc7-ad9e6c71a780/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cyber_attacks_jan_25&utm_term=290125&utm_content=linktoservice)

* [FoxNews RSS](https://app.any.run/tasks/e5bab257-0de4-4ef9-801e-756b88598649/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cyber_attacks_jan_25&utm_term=290125&utm_content=linktoservice)

* [Whoops!](https://app.any.run/tasks/28b68210-807f-4beb-bd6c-720fc0c61f8f/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=cyber_attacks_jan_25&utm_term=290125&utm_content=linktoservice)

Checks and redirects:

1. A script detects scanning by Google, Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, etc.
2. If the first check is passed, the script triggers a redirect
3. If the second check is passed, the user is redirected to...
