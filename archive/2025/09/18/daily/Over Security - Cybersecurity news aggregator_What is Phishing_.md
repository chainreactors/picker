Phishing is a serious threat to any industry. We have seen this topic appear in the news more each day. You might have already received a fraudulent email from what seemed to be your bank or even seen the hacking that took place during the [2016 US presidential election](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44825345). But what do you know about phishing?

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information like login information or other personal identification information (PII), which is any data that could potentially identify a specific individual, such as:

* usernames,
* passwords,
* credit card details,
* SSN (Social Security Number),
* bank account information,
* email,
* phone number,
* secret question answers

Even partial information can increase the chances of success to subsequent social engineering attacks.

In a [phishing attack](https://sucuri.net/guides/phishing-attacks/), something lures the victim pretending to be a trustworthy entity, such as:

* banks
* electronic communicators
* internet providers
* retail companies
* shops and others

In recent years, attackers have expanded beyond email into messaging apps like WhatsApp, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and even video conferencing invites, where phishing links are embedded directly into chat or calendar events.

## Types of Phishing

[Phishing](https://blog.sucuri.net/tag/phishing) attempts happen in many ways.

### Deceptive Email Campaigns

Email phishing is a term used in technology to refer to the fraudulent practice of sending emails apparently from a known or trusted sender with the objective of inducing victims to reveal confidential information.

Phishing can be a targeted act or not. We can assume that pretty much everybody has already received a phishing scam via email. Nowadays, it is easier for us not to notice these emails since the anti-spam technology has evolved. Most of these messages are blocked from ever reaching our inboxes.

In September, [we showed a phishing campaign](https://blog.sucuri.net/2018/09/wordpress-database-upgrade-phishing-campaign.html) which informed WordPress site owners that their database required an update.

![Fake WordPress Database Upgrade Message](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/wordpress_database_upgrade_message-644x650.jpg)

Fake WordPress Database Upgrade Message

The phishing page was created on a hacked legitimate WordPress website. When clicking on the “Upgrade” button, a fake [WordPress login page](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/10/how-to-secure-the-wordpress-login-page.html) opens to collect the user credentials.

As part of email phishing, fake website pages are designed to look and sound authentic. Phish emails usually say that you need to provide/verify/view something urgently and they provide you with a link. This link then leads you to the fake web pages.

Without these emails, there would not be many visitors for the phishing pages with the exception of phishing messages in social networks and SMS.

Carefully crafted phishing login pages convince users they are logging into a valid service. When users fail to notice the login page is fake, attackers receive their login details or credit card information. The stolen credentials and personal information are then used to perform identity theft and fraudulent activities.

Here is an example of a fake page we found on a [compromised website](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/08/evasion-techniques-phishing-attacks.html) during an incident response. We identified a phishing directory called “login-apple-account” on a customers website. When accessing the path via HTTP, users were led to a very convincing spoof of the Apple ID website:

### Phishing in Google Docs

Phishing campaigns in Google Docs are a part of phishing email campaigns when hackers add malicious links to online documents.

It’s quite common to share Google Docs documents, so many people assume it is normal for an organization to share them via Google Drive. When peo...
