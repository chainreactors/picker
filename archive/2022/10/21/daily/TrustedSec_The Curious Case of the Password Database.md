Nowadays, password managers are king. We use password managers to secure our most sensitive credentials to a myriad of services and sites; a compromise of the password manager could prove devastating.

Due to recently [*disclosed critical Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs*](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/issues-fixed.html)) involving ManageEngine's Password Manager Pro software, a client came to us at TrustedSec, wondering: *If an attacker gained access to our Password Manager Pro server, would our passwords be compromised?*

![Scooby Doo meme](https://www.trustedsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kaun1-meme.jpg)

Since the client was assured that data within the Password Manager Pro server was encrypted, our answer was assuredly, "No." Right? We set off to find out!

The [*recent CVEs affecting the Password Manager Pro software*](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/cisa-warns-of-hackers-exploiting-recent.html) were some of the worst kind: Remote Code Execution (RCE). For the sake of this engagement, we were focused not so much on the initial attack vector, but rather on the extent of the post-exploitation possibilities. Simply, with access to the system's data, could we recover the encrypted secrets stored within?

We started with access an attacker would presumably have:

* [*Password Manager Pro v10.5*](https://archives2.manageengine.com/passwordmanagerpro/10501/)

Note: Mid-engagement, we identified some newly published work by [*smaury at Shielder*](https://www.shielder.com/blog/2022/09/how-to-decrypt-manage-engine-pmp-passwords-for-fun-and-domain-admin-a-red-teaming-tale/) regarding tearing apart Password Manager Pro. The timing was astounding. Our collective articles may look similar; but our approaches, experience, and code differ. We highly suggest checking out his terrific write-up regarding this topic.

## Step 1 - Application Enumeration

We staged an instance of Linux running ManageEngineâ€™s Password Manager Pro version 10.5 to replicate the client's environment. After fetching the [*application software*](https://archives2.manageengine.com/passwordmanagerpro/10501/) and initiating a [*restore*](https://www.manageengine.com/products/passwordmanagerpro/help/disaster_recovery.html), we started by analyzing the running processes and identifying key information. The application was running Java and PostgreSQL as the primary components.

TrustedSec then explored the Password Manager Pro application directory, revealing a collection of Java JAR application and configuration files. By reading application documentation, TrustedSec identified the username and encrypted database password stored in the ***database-params.conf*** file.

The ***pmp\_key.key*** file reveals the PMP key, which will come in handy later.
