Representatives from the US and UK governments have banned the use of Chinese networking and surveillance equipment, citing "national security"-related fears as the grounds for their decisions.

In the US, the US Federal Trade Commission has [banned](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-bans-authorizations-devices-pose-national-security-threat) the import and sale of networking and video surveillance equipment from Chinese companies Dahua, Hikvision, Huawei, and ZTE.

In the UK, the Parliament has [instructed](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2022-11-24/hcws386?module=inline&pgtype=article) government departments to cease the deployment of security cameras from Chinese companies on "sensitive sites" such as government buildings and military bases.

British officials said that Chinese-made security cameras should not be connected to core networks and that government departments should also consider removing and replacing existing equipment even before "scheduled upgrades."

Both the US and UK bans come after the intelligence agencies in both countries previously warned against the use of equipment from Chinese companies, cautioning that Chinese equipment could be used for digital surveillance, digital sabotage, and economic espionage.

Both Dahua and Hickvision had already lost a large chunk of their market in the US after the US Treasury [sanctioned both companies](https://ipvm.com/reports/sanction-hikua) for providing the Chinese government with facial recognition and video tagging solutions in the government's Uyghurs oppression efforts.

The UK ban does not any vendors, but human rights advocates in the country have been railing against the same two aforementioned companies for years—although, the UK government appears to anticipate that other vendors and state-owned companies might be involved in the same shenannigans or susceptible to government pressure via its [broad and dangerous National Intelligence Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China).

Chinese state-owned CCTV firms Hikvision & Dahua are facilitating human rights abuses abroad.
They must be banned in the UK.

### Breaches and hacks

**Twitter data leak:** A [vulnerability](https://hackerone.com/reports/1439026) reported via the HackerOne platform was used to mass-harvest the account details of Twitter users, including private information such as phone numbers and email addresses. An initial dataset compiled via this vulnerability and containing the details of more than [5.4 million Twitter accounts](https://restoreprivacy.com/twitter-vulnerability-exposes-5-million-accounts/) was allegedly traded on underground hacking forums earlier this year, while an even larger [second dataset](https://mastodon.social/%40chadloder%40kolektiva.social/109406381951931639) has also popped up on hacking forums over the past few days.[According to](https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/25/massive-twitter-data-breach/) [reports](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/54-million-twitter-users-stolen-data-leaked-online-more-shared-privately/), this second dataset allegedly contains details on tens of millions of Twitter accounts.

**No WhatsApp breach:** A threat actor has been circulating an alleged leak of WhatsApp data. It's fake. It's just a list of phone numbers, [according to Alon Gal of Hudson Rock](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alon-gal-utb_whatsapp-notabreach-stopscrapingyoulittleshits-activity-7001821915610800128-nSR_/).

**Zwijndrecht police ransomed:** The Ragnar Locker ransomware gang has hacked and is now extorting the police department of the Belgian city of Zwijndrecht. The group [claims](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/11/24/hacking-politie-zwijndrecht/) to have obtained information detailing thousands of license plates, speeding fines, and even criminal investigations, ranging from 2006 to September 2022. Police officials said they detected the attempt to encrypt their servers and shut down their network for two weeks while they investigated and restored services. Ragnar Locker has [already leaked some of the files](https://www.hln.be/zwijndrecht/een-van-de-grootste-datalekken-bij-politie-ooit-hacker-gooit-flitsboetes-nummerplaten-en-zelfs-fotos-van-mishandelde-kinderen-op-straat~ab10b42d/) on their dark web leak site.

**Fars news agency hack:** Iranian hacktivist group Black Reward said it hacked and wiped the servers of Fars News, an Iranian news agency managed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The agency's website was also defaced with a message of support for anti-government protesters. Fars News and Iranian government officials [confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-fars-news-agency-hit-by-cyberattacks-blames-israel/) the hack and blamed the incident on Israel and other foreign countries. On the other side of this constant Iran-Israel "hacktivism" duel, Israel also [confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iranian-hackers-post-footage-of-jerusalem-attack-obtained-from-major-security-agency/) last week that an Iranian hacking group known as Moses' Staff breached an Israeli security company and stole and released footage of [last week's twin bombings at Jerusalem bus stops](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63726676).
