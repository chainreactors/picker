In episode 13 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, meat avatar Cluley learns that AI doesn‚Äôt pose an existential threat to humanity and tells meat avatar Stockley how cybersex is about to get very, very weird. Our hosts also learn that men lie on their dating profiles, hear ChatGPT steal somebody‚Äôs voice, and discover an AI that rick rolls its users.

Graham tells Mark about AI‚Äôs political ambitions and discovers what ChatGPT has in common with the reluctant ruler of the universe, while Mark introduces Graham to the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
