Federal Bureau of Investigation [(FBI)](https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisa-fbi-releases-ttps-iocs-used-by-phobos-ransomware-group/) has published its annual Internet Crime Report for 2023, highlighting a significant 22% increase in losses due to cybercrime, amounting to over $12.5 billion

This surge underscores cyber criminals’ growing sophistication and audacity in exploiting digital vulnerabilities.

The Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a pivotal arm of the FBI dedicated to combating [cybercrime](https://cybersecuritynews.com/ai-powered-cybercrime-tools/), registered an unprecedented 880,418 complaints from the American public in 2023.

This figure marks a nearly 10% increase in the number of complaints received and represents a staggering 22% rise in financial losses compared to the previous year.

Timothy Langan, Executive Assistant Director at the FBI, emphasized the conservative nature of these figures, suggesting the actual scope of cybercrime is likely much broader.

The IC3 serves as a central hub for victims to [report](https://www.ic3.gov/media/pdf/annualreport/2023_ic3report.pdf) cybercrime and for the FBI to collect data, advance investigations, and identify changes in the threat landscape.

![IC3's Role in Combating Cyber Crime](https://cybersecuritynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-18-608x1024.png)

## **Ransomware on the Raise**

In 2023, ransomware incidents saw an 18% increase in complaints, with reported losses soaring by 74% from $34.3 million in 2022 to $59.6 million.

Cybercriminals continue evolving tactics, deploying multiple ransomware variants against the same victim and using data-destruction methods to pressure negotiations.

BEC scams remained a significant threat in 2023, with 21,489 complaints leading to over $2.9 billion in adjusted losses.

This sophisticated scam targets businesses and individuals by compromising legitimate business email accounts to conduct unauthorized fund transfers.

## **Investment Fraud Tops the Charts**

Investment fraud was the costliest crime type tracked by the IC3 in 2023, with losses climbing from $3.31 billion in 2022 to $4.57 billion—a staggering 38% increase.

Victims aged 30 to 49 were the most likely to report losses from investment [scams.](https://cybersecuritynews.com/tech-support-scams-against-pc-users-remain-a-threat/)
