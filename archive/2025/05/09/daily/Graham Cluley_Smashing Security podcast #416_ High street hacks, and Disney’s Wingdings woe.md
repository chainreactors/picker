Brits face empty shelves and suspended meal deals as cybercriminals hit major high street retailers, and a terminated Disney employee gets revenge with a little help with Wingdings. Plus Graham challenges Carole to a game of ‚ÄúMalware or metal?‚Äù, and we wonder just happens when you have sex on top of a piano?

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Plus! Don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with Jon Cho of Dashlane.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
