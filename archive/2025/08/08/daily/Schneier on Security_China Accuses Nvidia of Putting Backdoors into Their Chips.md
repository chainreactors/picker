## China Accuses Nvidia of Putting Backdoors into Their Chips

The government of China has accused Nvidia of inserting a [backdoor](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/china-claims-nvidia-built-backdoor-into-h20-chip-designed-for-chinese-market/) into their H20 chips:

> China’s cyber regulator on Thursday said it had held a meeting with Nvidia over what it called “serious security issues” with the company’s artificial intelligence chips. It said US AI experts had “revealed that Nvidia’s computing chips have location tracking and can remotely shut down the technology.”

@ Bruce,

Is what China is claiming or it is claimed that china is claiming actually possible?

Think a moment on

“It said US AI experts had “revealed that Nvidia’s computing chips have location tracking and can remotely shut down the technology”

There are three points to note,

1, US AI experts had revealed…

So the Chinese claims are based on unsubstantiated “US AI experts” claims…

So firstly :- we’ve no way to know if there is any truth involved.

Secondly have a think on how the chips can do location tracking.

We know China blocks / jams / subverts the US GPS system and other non Chinese GNSS[1] systems like the European Galileo.

We also know China keeps certain details about it’s system restricted. Unlike the other current systems the augmented Be Dou System has not just SMS style messaging in real time, it also communicates two-way with the user terminal thus performs surveillance on all users in range of a ground based base system.

But consider these supposed backdoor chips. They are designed to be used in racks that are effectively Faraday Shields that are in buildings that in turn are Faraday Shields.

What sort of geo-nav system is going to work?

But now likewise consider the “remote shutdown” claim. It would need to work with a command system that would have to use either Radio systems or Wired Systems. Both of which are fairly easy to defend against for non-civilian use.

So I’m not seeing anything that I’d consider anything other than “alleged” in these claims.

Which “technically” makes me rather more than the “skeptical” of,

> *“Paul Triolo, a China tech expert and partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, said he was “skeptical” about the claims of a deliberate back door being built into Nvidia hardware, pointing to the lack of detail in the announcement.”*

What appears to be happening with this Nvidia H20 chip is the nonsense of the US Legislators.

It’s been shown that Nvidia are actually key to the US economy and even bigger than “To big to Fail” financial institutions.

Put in political terms,

“If it ails Nvidia, then the entire US gets sick.”

The flip side of which is kind of,

“If it’s good for Nvidia then the US economy hangs in there for another day.”

Which flies in the opposite direction to political mantra on China Policy…

Thus a legal “fig-leaf” is required to hide the embarrassment of the executive member being held up to ridicule for it’s short comings.

Hence the effectively impossible “tracking and switch off” ideas.

Thus I suspect China knowing this full well is “flipping the bird” as they have nothing to lose by it and quite a lot to gain. Whilst the opposite can be said of the US…

I guess we are going to have to pop the popcorn in the air frier, sit back and watch the “roasting process” as various people get grilled.

[1] Currently there are four “Global Navigation Satellite Systems” in full operation three of which are single nation military sponsored systems of,

1 US “Global Positioning System”(GPS).
2, Russian GLONASS.
3, Chinese “Bei Dou Sytstem” (BDS).

And the civilian multination

4, EU Galileo

An overview comparison of the four can be read at,

What is not noted is that Galileo is odd in other respects. The design and original development was done in the UK by Surrey Satellite Systems and the atomic clocks quite a few of which have failed were designed and manufactured by a Swiss company. Neither the UK or Switzerland are members of the EU, which security wise has created political issues.

@clive
I may have misunderstood but I believe Asus claim to have such technology:
“Absolute Persistence
A core component of the Absolute Platform – leveraging its privileged position in the firmware of more than 600 million endpoints

Unique, patented technology
Absolute Persistence® technology is already embedded in over 600 million devices as a result of Absolute’s partnership with close to 30 international system manufacturers. Once activated, this technology is fiercely resilient and is the only security solution that will survive attempts to disable it, even if the device is re-imaged, the hard drive is replaced, or the firmware is updated.

No other technology can do this.”

Pot : Kettle : Black

This story has all the hearsay and inuendo of Fox News stories about Chinese backdoors …

@tdar that’s unrelated technology. That’s fairly standard remote management technology. It wouldn’t work in a server farm in China that blocks remote connections, which means the technology would either do nothing (fail-enabled mode) or disable the chip entirely (fail-disabled mode). Typically this isn’t found on a GPU, since it’s for remotely managing the entire computer, e.g. to upgrade to the latest OS version to disable malware.

There’s a lot about this that doesn’t pass the sniff test. Why US AI experts and not cybersecurity experts? How would remote shutdown work if the GPU is inside a computer (and not handling networking) and can’t receive remote commands?
