## Squid Dominated the Oceans in the Late Cretaceous

New [research](https://www.courthousenews.com/3d-imaging-reveals-that-ancient-squids-dominated-oceans/):

> One reason the early years of squids has been such a mystery is because squids’ lack of hard shells made their fossils hard to come by. Undeterred, the team instead focused on finding ancient squid beaks—hard mouthparts with high fossilization potential that could help the team figure out how squids evolved.
>
> With that in mind, the team developed an advanced fossil discovery technique that completely digitized rocks with all their embedded fossils in complete 3D form. Upon using that technique on Late Cretaceous rocks from Japan, the team identified 1,000 fossilized cephalopod beaks hidden inside the rocks, which included 263 squid specimens and 40 previously unknown squid species.
>
> The team said the number of squid fossils they found vastly outnumbered the number of bony fishes and ammonites, which are extinct shelled relatives of squids that are considered among the most successful swimmers of the Mesozoic era.

“Forty previously unknown squid species.” Wow.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ ALL,

There is apparently a preliminary report in on the Air India crash,

<https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/11/india/air-india-crash-report-intl-latam>

The provisional finding being,

> *“The aircraft had reached an airspeed of 180 knots when both engines’ fuel cutoff switches were “transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec,” according to the report”*

I’ll leave it for others to read the article.

Many (10x? 100x?) more species existed and went extinct than are currently living, so it’s not surprising finding previously unknown species of fossil squid.

If you know a paleontologist, chances are pretty good that they’ve named a species after you, because they need to come up with *lots* of new species names.

The 3D imaging part is pretty awesome. Alternative is soaking in (mild) acid to dissolve the rock, but not the fossils, then sort through the result “by hand” (under a microscope).

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Flashback to the 1980’s and DRM war.**

Sone of us lived through the “Digital Rights Management”(DRM) wars of the 1990’s. Where those seeking to protect their digital rights hid messages in noise they xalled “Watermarks”. That they “added” to digital media using techniques very similar to “Low Probability of Intercept”(LPI) “Spread Spectrum”(SS) Techniques.

Each time the Pro-DRM people would come up with a new Watermark / “rights protection method” the Anti-DRM researchers would come up with ways to either remove it or nullify it.

Eventually Prof Ross J Anderson and his group at the UK Cambridge Computer labs came up with an Anti-DRM method that the Pro-DRM people effectively gave up against.

Without going into details[1] the Anti-DRM method added tiny two dimensional twists to the image. Not enough to upset the human eye, but enough to upset the DRM Signature detecting methods thus nullify Property rights Watermarks.

Well back then it was the Evil Disney Corp and Co that were the enemy… Today it’s Alphabet/Google, Meta, Microsoft, and even Apple as well as many Governments.

With artists trying to protect their work against AI Systems “scanning the world” and ignoring any kind of creator “Intellectual Property”(IP) rights.

So in a way a form of role reversal with agnostic technology in the divide between the waring factions. With the AI side apparently run by latter-day sociopaths.

<https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/11/defenses_against_ai_scrapers_beaten/>

> *“Some visual artists, concerned about copyright violations and the possibility that AI-generated images will destroy the demand for their work, have taken to using software that adds “adversarial perturbations” – data patterns that will make AI model predictions misfire. Now, researchers have described a method to beat those perturbations in a paper [PDF] titled, “LightShed: Defeating Perturbation-based Image Copyright Protections.””*

One odd thing is,

> *“”We view LightShed primarily as an awareness effort to highlight weaknesses in existing protection schemes, and we have conducted our work under strict responsible disclosure protocols, which is required by the conference as well,” said Hanna Foerster, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge and one of the authors, in an email to The Register.”*

I find it odd that the references on Hanna Foerster’s paper do not include any of Ross J. Andersons highly relevant papers from the mid to late 1990’s on Watermarking. Being as she is from what was Ross’s laboratory, I find it odd that she did not mention him.

[1] I would have given a link that used to be up on Ross’s home page. But he apparently tided things up in line with not supporting “closed journals” behind PayWalls and quite a few pre-2005 papers and earlier appear to have gone. However one of his DRM Watermark papers is sort of available at,

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Another UK flashback to National ID Cards.**

Apparently the current UK Government have decided via their usual nonsense that massively expensive IT contracts through unreliable insecure vendors is the way to make everyone and their most minor and also intimate activities known and held on a massive Database.

It’s sometimes known as “Blairite twaddle” for good reasons, yet he can not let it go,

<https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14582903/Labour-MPs-ministers-digital-ID-Brits-grip-illegal-immigration-boost-economy.html>

But the real reason originally was it was a way the political party Tony Blair was the leader off used to avo...
