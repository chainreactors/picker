Microsoft on Sunday [released](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/) security patches for an [actively exploited security flaw in SharePoint](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/critical-microsoft-sharepoint-flaw.html) and also disclosed details of another vulnerability that it said has been addressed with "more robust protections."

The tech giant acknowledged it's "aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers by exploiting vulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update."

[CVE-2025-53770](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770) (CVSS score: 9.8), as the exploited vulnerability is tracked, concerns a case of remote code execution that arises due to the deserialization of untrusted data in on-premise versions of Microsoft SharePoint Server.

The newly disclosed shortcoming is a spoofing flaw in SharePoint ([CVE-2025-53771](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53771), CVSS score: 7.1). Viettel Cyber Security and an anonymous researcher has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug.

"Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('path traversal') in Microsoft Office SharePoint allows an authorized attacker to perform spoofing over a network," Microsoft said in an advisory released on July 20, 2025.

Microsoft also noted that CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 are related to two other SharePoint vulnerabilities documented by CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, which could be chained to achieve remote code execution. The exploit chain, referred to as ToolShell, was patched as part of the company's July 2025 Patch Tuesday update.

"The update for CVE-2025-53770 includes more robust protections than the update for CVE-2025-49704," the Windows maker said. "The update for CVE-2025-53771 includes more robust protections than the update for CVE-2025-49706."

It's worth noting that Microsoft previously characterized CVE-2025-53770 as a variant of CVE-2025-49706. When reached for comment about this discrepancy, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Hacker News that "it is prioritizing getting updates out to customers while also correcting any content inaccuracies as necessary."

The company also said that the current published content is correct and that the previous inconsistency does not impact the company's guidance for customers.

Both the identified flaws apply to on-premises SharePoint Servers only, and do not impact SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365. The issues have been addressed in the versions below (for now) -

* Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 ([16.0.10417.20027](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/description-of-the-security-update-for-sharepoint-server-2019-july-8-2025-kb5002741-d860f51b-fcdf-41e4-89de-9ce487c06548))
* Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 ([16.0.5508.1000](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/description-of-the-security-update-for-sharepoint-enterprise-server-2016-july-8-2025-kb5002744-9196e240-c76d-4bb0-b16c-6f7d6645a1f0))
* [Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108285)
* [Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Core](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108286)
* [Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Language Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108287)
* [Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108288)
* [Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 Language Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108289)

To mitigate potential attacks, customers are recommended to -

* Use supported versions of on-premises SharePoint Server (SharePoint Server 2016, 2019, and SharePoint Subscription Edition)
* Apply the latest security updates
* Ensure the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is turned on and enable [Full Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration) for optimal protection, along with an appropriate antivirus solution such as Defender Antivirus
* Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint protection, or equivalent threat solutions
* Rotate SharePoint Server ASP.NET machine keys

"After applying the latest security updates above or enabling AMSI, it is critical that customers rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys and restart IIS on all SharePoint servers," Microsoft said. "If you cannot enable AMSI, you will need to rotate your keys after you install the new security update."

The development comes as Eye Security told The Hacker News that at least 54 organizations have been compromised, including banks, universities, and government entities. Active exploitation is said to have commenced around July 18, according to the company.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for its part, [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/07/20/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770-toolshell-catalog) CVE-2025-53770 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to apply the fixes by July 21, 2025.
