## üïµÔ∏è A Normal Day, An Abnormal Entry

It was just another busy evening. Rush hour. As I queued at the metro station, something unusual caught my attention.

A man ahead of me approached the entry gate.

* He didn‚Äôt scan a card.
* He didn‚Äôt carry a token.
* Instead, he held a **small device**, possibly a **key fob or smart tool**.

He waved it subtly in front of the RFID reader.

> *‚úÖ The gate opened ‚Äî without any official card or beep pattern from a metro token.*

No alarm. No flag. Just a seamless bypass.

## üîç Initial Doubt ‚Üí Deeper Observation

Was it a coincidence? A staff override? A glitch?

But over the next few days, I saw this pattern again ‚Äî similar devices used by individuals who:

* Didn‚Äôt tap any card visibly.
* Didn‚Äôt visit the token counters.
* Simply ‚Äúwaved‚Äù and entered.

Clearly, something more technical was happening.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Hypothesis: NFC UID-Based Gate Exploitation

Modern metro gates use **13.56 MHz NFC tech** like:

* MIFARE Classic (insecure)
* MIFARE DESFire (more secure)
* Other RFID-based tokens

In insecure implementations, gates only validate:

* The **UID (Unique Identifier)** of a card/token
* Not the **cryptographic handshake** with backend servers

## üß® That‚Äôs where the problem begins.

If the gate trusts only the UID ‚Äî
 Then any tool that can **emulate or clone a valid UID** can easily **fool** the system.

## üß™ Technical Breakdown: How The Exploit Might Work

## üîß Tools Involved:

Tool Purpose Risk Level **Flipper Zero** Portable NFC/RFID emulator ‚ö†Ô∏è High **Proxmark3** Clone & sniff MIFARE cards üõ†Ô∏è Research **ChameleonMini** UID replay & real-time emulation üî• Critical **Custom Keyfobs** Pre-flashed clones sold online ‚ùóMedium

## üì≤ Attack Steps (Theoretical):

1. **Scan** a valid metro card‚Äôs UID (once)
2. **Store** the UID into device memory

**3. Replay** the UID using NFC emulator

4. Metro gate identifies valid UID ‚Üí Gate opens

No balance check. No backend token verification. Just UID = access.

## üîì Other Possibilities: Debug Mode Abuse

Metro gates used by maintenance staff may have:

* **Magnetic override ports**
* **IR triggers**
* **BLE test apps**
* **NFC developer modes**

If such **debug triggers** are not secured or are hardcoded, tools like Flipper Zero can:

* Emulate **NFC debug triggers**
* Send ‚Äú**Open Gate**‚Äù command in maintenance protocol

> *This leads to a gate opening* ***without any valid ticket****, just like what I observed.*

## üìâ Real-World Risks

This isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúcool trick‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **critical infrastructure vulnerability**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact Breakdown:

* üí∏ **Revenue Leakage:** Millions per year in unpaid entries
* üë§ **Zero Traceability:** Logs show ‚Äúvalid UID‚Äù but no ticket
* üßë‚Äçüíª **Insider Abuse:** Maintenance staff may leak tools/methods
* ü™ß **No Deterrent:** No alarms, no CCTV alerts, no logs
* üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Mass Exploitability:** Tools easily available online

## üîê Solutions for Metro Systems

To avoid such UID-based or debug-based bypasses:

Solution Description ‚úÖ Cryptographic Authentication Use DESFire EV2/EV3 with AES-based challenge üîÑ Dynamic UIDs / Session IDs Tokens should rotate UID or use session key üß† Gate-to-Server Sync Don‚Äôt make offline UID decisions üì° Tamper Detection Alert on unknown debug/NFC tools üìä Behavioral Monitoring Detect UID overuse or time-based patterns

## üì¢ Ethical Disclosure Attempt

I tried to report this through:

* Official metro feedback form
* Social media (DM to metro‚Äôs account)
* Customer helpline
* But ‚Äî no concrete response yet.

> *‚ö†Ô∏è I did not clone or replay any UID myself.
>  I only observed behavior, researched tools, and documented the possibilities.*

## üß† The Bigger Picture

Most people think metro systems are ‚Äúunhackable‚Äù because they‚Äôre physical.
 But this case shows: **if the software trust model is weak, physical access is meaningless.**

> *What‚Äôs stopping someone from mass distributing pre-cloned UID tokens?
>  Or making an app that turns a phone into a metro entry bypass tool?*

Nothing ‚Äî if gate logic is weak.
