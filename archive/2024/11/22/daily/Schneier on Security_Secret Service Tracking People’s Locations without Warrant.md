## Secret Service Tracking People‚Äôs Locations without Warrant

This feels [important](https://www.404media.co/email/f459caa7-1a58-4f31-a9ba-3cb53a5046a4/):

> The Secret Service has used a technology called Locate X which uses location data harvested from ordinary apps installed on phones. Because users agreed to an opaque terms of service page, the Secret Service believes it doesn‚Äôt need a warrant.

> *Because users agreed to an opaque terms of service page‚Ä¶*

This one is the very reason I do not have a smartphone. We have no control over them. The core at this problem is not terms of service being opaque, it is that we have only two choices: accept them or install nothing (and ‚Äúnothing‚Äù here means exactly that, all smartphone ‚Äúapps‚Äù are tracking code specialized on stealing anything they can from us while tracking our movements).

No, the problem is not some apps having obscure terms of service; the problem is that there are no privacy-friendly alternatives for most of these apps. We need a healthy ecosystem, with privacy friendly smartphone operating systems and apps that allow us work without compromising our privacy.

‚Ä¶and then it enters in the game the ‚Äúcertified‚Äù operating systems running on the modems of those smartphones. Operating systems running on small computers inside our phones that are able to dump any range of memory on the device and can be accessed from cell towers using digital certificates whose private part is stored in the modem firmware.

Thinking on it twice, the problem are not the apps either. It is the entire industry, working together with TLAs and governments around the world to run massive spying networks on citizens.

There is even a branch of business now built on it: private corporations whose business model is developing spyware for governments targeting dangerous terrorists (let us say security experts, journalists, academics, human rights organizations and so on) and data brokers.

A truly Orwellian nightmare, it isn‚Äôt?

@Who

> *We have no control over [smartphones].*

Yet we are given the illusion of control. I choose carefully apps that can operate with data and location services OFF, i.e. no ads required. I have paid for the ‚Äúad-free‚Äù version of some apps. But being a hardware guy brought up with switches that can be seen to stop current flowing, I have nagging doubts about touching a spot on a screen to see a message saying ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù. Oh, really? What is actually going on in the unseen depths? That is my small version of an Orwellian nightmare.

As for

> *the entire industry, working together with TLAs and governments around the world to run massive spying networks on citizens.*

this is the problem of governments seeing the world in terms of ‚Äúus, or them‚Äù, which is beyond the scope of this blog.

Big-tech *is* the cybersecurity problem.

I thought this take by Cory Doctorow last week was quite cogent

Sounds like you need to use FDroid or something‚Ä¶. ? Rather than throwing the house out with the bath water.

I‚Äôm frequently glad that I use LineageOS with F-Droid and no gapps. And no apps outside of F-droid. This is one of these times.

For the government it is illegal. They know they‚Äôre breaking the law without consequences.

There is no regulation enforcing data privacy. Accordingly there is no market incentive.

Who?

Not if you leave your phone at home while doing your assassinations or whatever. Also don‚Äôt print out the plan in your office at the presidential palace.

‚ÄúBaby and bath water‚Äù comes to mind üôÇ

My main phone has playstore disabled, no google account connected, and I only install apps from F-Droid.

Specifically, you will appreciate reading <https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/> to see why this is safe.

You can get a pretty good set of tools which do not spy on you but are, nevertheless, useful to have. GPS is always disabled, since I don‚Äôt have Google maps anyway it‚Äôs not an issue.

At that point, what anyone can get from my phone in the context of this thread, they can get even from a non-smartphone ‚Äî by asking the telco which tower I am near etc.

A short sample of apps I have: Firefox, Antennapod (podcasts), Feeder (RSS feeds), NewPipe (youtube), KDE Connect and Syncthing (transfer files b...
