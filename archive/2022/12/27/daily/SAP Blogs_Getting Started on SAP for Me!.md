The SAP ONE Support Launchpad will be transitioning to SAP for Me in 2023:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/PBLOG.png)

[SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/home) will become the new single-entry point to SAP´s support. The customer portal makes managing support-related tasks simpler by using a set of digital self-service features to easily request support and resolve issues, with an end-to-end view of the personalized product portfolio.

**SAP for Me is made for you.**

Get the latest updates on your Transition to SAP for Me on [My Support](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support.html?anchorId=section_1207951584):

SAP has created a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4rtSZCqSg) and offers [Support Webcasts](https://webinars.sap.com/sap-support/en/home) in multiple languages.

To access SAP for me you must have an existing S-User or Universal ID with linked S-Users. Please note that some capabilities will require special authorisations.

* Find out more information on authorisations and who you can contact to request them: [About the user, authorization and administrator concept](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/my-support/help-for-sap-support-applications/concept-users_authorizations_administrators.html) and [SAP Knowledge Base Article 2981882](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002981882).

* If you have an S-User and see a message on the card that you aren't authorized: In the message, select Company Administrators to open a list of Admins at your company. Select the name of an admin, then select Send E-Mail to request access. You can find your super administrators in the dashboard “Users & Contacts”. By clicking in “My Important Contacts” you will see the list of all the S-Users with special roles for each installation. In the column “Function” you can see who the Super Administrators are. Read this blog to find out more: [How to find your Super Administrators](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/03/how-to-find-your-super-administrator/#:~:text=By%20clicking%20in%20%E2%80%9CMy%20important,who%20the%20Super%20Administrators%20are).

There is also a lot more information on [SAP for Me | SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/topics/sap-for-me) where you can read about “Getting Started” and what it will mean if you are an SAP Partner.
