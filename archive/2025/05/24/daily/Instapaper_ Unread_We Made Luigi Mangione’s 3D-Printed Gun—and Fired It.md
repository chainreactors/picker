# We Made Luigi Mangione’s 3D-Printed Gun—and Fired It

In the wake of Luigi Mangione’s alleged killing of a health care CEO with a partially 3D-printed pistol, we built and tested the exact same model of weapon ourselves. And it was entirely legal.

For the last hour, in a backroom of a gun range in Arabi, Louisiana, I’ve been building [Luigi Mangione](https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/)’s gun. Well, not *his*, in the literal sense. The not-quite-finished firearm in my hands is very much mine: I was the one who pushed “print” on a 3D printer the prior evening and then, this morning, pulled the gun’s finished frame out of that mini-fridge-sized appliance. And I’m the one now struggling with the trickier task of attaching to that precisely contoured chunk of matte-black plastic all the metal and polymer components that will make it a fully functioning, semi-automatic pistol.

This weapon I’m constructing is, however, intended to be an exact clone of the partially 3D-printed gun that Mangione [allegedly used to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-united-healthcare-3d-printed-gun-fmda-chairmanwon-v1/) in New York City in December, down to the stippling on the weapon’s plastic grip. I’ve come to this makeshift workshop on the outskirts of New Orleans with the goal of printing, assembling, and test-firing that very same model of handgun, complete with the 3D-printed silencer Mangione allegedly screwed to its muzzle.

The intention of this experiment is to see for myself just how far 3D-printed guns have come. I want to know if it’s true that the apparent murder weapon in the most high-profile assassination in recent memory can, in 2025, be made in the privacy of a garage by essentially anyone, without facing any gun control whatsoever or even breaking any laws.

The 3D printing, it turns out, was the easy part. Now I’m in the midst of the finicky process—something like assembling a very small piece of Ikea furniture—of building onto my homemade handgun frame the rest of a gun’s components, all ordered off the internet. This includes everything from the trigger assembly to the slide and barrel that ride on top of the Glock-style pistol’s plastic-printed body.

My guide on this journey, given that I have very little idea what I’m doing, is a 3D-printed-gun aficionado and YouTuber who calls himself Print Shoot Repeat, or PSR. He’s sitting to my right—dressed in a black hoodie along with the trademark black mask and mirror goggles that he wears to protect his identity—patiently offering instructions as I fumble with small parts.

As I approach the final step in the gun’s assembly, he shows me how to pull its trigger so that the slide can fit onto metal rails I’ve slotted into my printed frame. Then PSR watches as I struggle to pull that top half of the firearm into position. Suddenly, the slide seems to stop resisting and slips into place.

“Yep, now pull it back as hard as you can,” PSR tells me through his mask. I yank back on the chunk of metal, exposing the empty chamber that will soon be filled by a 9-millimeter round. “Now let it go.”

The spring-loaded slide snaps forward with a loud click. Only then do I notice that all the people in the room—the video crew filming all of this and the gun range employees who have become curious about our experiment—are standing up to watch the somewhat unnerving moment when a new DIY firearm comes into being.

“Alright. Now we’ve got a gun,” PSR says. “Just make sure you don’t point it at anyone.”

As strange as this experience may have been, it felt familiar. That’s because, 10 years ago, I had done it all before.

In 2015, in a quiet backroom of WIRED’s San Francisco office, [I made an AR-15 “ghost gun”](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/i-made-an-untraceable-ar-15-ghost-gun/)—a fully functioning semi-automatic rifle. Just like the Glock-style handgun I would construct in Louisiana a decade later, that rifle was a “ghost gun” in the sense that it had no serial number and was built entirely in private, without any background check, without showing anyone ID, and without making any government agency aware of its existence.

Ghost guns take advantage of a kind of loophole in US federal gun control laws: Only the central component of a firearm onto which all its other components are attached—known as the lower receiver for an AR-15 or the frame for a Glock-style handgun—is regulated as *the gun*. Make that one piece yourself at home, and you can buy the rest online in a few clicks, putting weapon components like barrels, slides, and triggers into your shopping cart without facing the slightest regulatory speed bump.

To test just how easy it was to build a ghost gun back in 2015, I made the lower receiver of an AR-15 three different ways: I 3D-printed it out of plastic; used a computer-controlled milling machine to carve one out of aluminum (or more accurately, to finish carving it, since I started with an 80 percent finished lower receiver, or “80 percent lower,” designed to almost—but not quite—meet the legal definition of that part); and even tried the more old-school technique of drilling out the same aluminum 80 percent lower with a manual drill press.

I was somewhat surprised at the time when a gunsmith I showed all three parts to warned me that my 3D-printed lowe...
