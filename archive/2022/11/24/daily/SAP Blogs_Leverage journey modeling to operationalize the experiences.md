## A customer journey map is a good start but not enough.

Improving customer experience and how customers engage with business processes often starts with mapping journeys. Mapping a customer or employee journey is a straightforward task that can happen in a workshop or two. Different stakeholders from several departments come together and list what steps customers go through, the touchpoints, their pain points, and their sentiment. Sounds straightforward and easy, right? What is the result of that exercise? A nice visual piece of art that they look at and share through emails or messaging apps, and then everyone forgets about it. Including the operational layer is one fundamental step to make this exercise valuable for operationalizing the customer or employee experience.

With this blog post, we are continuing our series on a [j](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/12/10-steps-for-successful-journey-to-process-analytics-bringing-together-the-worlds-of-process-analysis-and-design-and-experience/)[ourney to process analytics](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/12/10-steps-for-successful-journey-to-process-analytics-bringing-together-the-worlds-of-process-analysis-and-design-and-experience/). Now that you have defined the journey, persona, journey steps, and touchpoints, the next step is to bring an inside-out and analytical view into the model. We will explain why operationalizing the experience matters – and which elements you need to make this a reality.

**Operationalizing experience**

Once you have the outside-in view visualizing your customers, employees, or suppliers' experience, the alignment with the operational side of your business starts; on each journey step, you want to know which processes, IT systems, and organizational units are involved in impacting this experience. The customer experience team, process professionals, and owners collaborate to investigate the negative experience from the start until the end of each journey, both from outside-in and inside-out perspectives, to trigger customer-centric process transformations and improvements.

With SAP Signavio Journey Modeler, you can link your processes to the journey steps they are related to. The best part is that IT systems and organizational units involved in those processes are auto-populated from the linked journeys without any manual effort. Once you decide which journey steps need improvement, the next step is clear: to collaborate with process owners and organizational units to improve the processes and, eventually, the experience.

Moreover, quantifying the complexity of the underlying processes enables you to identify critical processes, people, and systems on your path to experience excellence. So, you can prioritize processes based on complexity and their effect on the perceived experience. The journey complexity score empowers you to do so by providing an overview of how many processes, departments, and people in your company are involved and interact with each other until the journey is complete. Know when complexity negatively impacts the experience to identify improvement areas or give attention to complex but critical processes required for desired outcomes.
