[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

If there’s one thing that threat actors love, it’s chaos. Headlines in the news that provoke an emotional response make excellent phishing lures because the intense feelings invoked by a provocative subject line cause our critical thinking faculties to be bypassed. Without cautious reflection, we’re likely to engage with bait, fall for the lure and “click the link” rather than pausing to ask ourselves what the headline’s writer is trying to achieve.

Economic disruption also works in the bad guys’ favor. In budgetary crises, investments in cyber defenses may be postponed or the hiring of sorely needed additional team members delayed. Alternatively, an end-of-life device that is still functional despite obsolescence and many unpatched vulnerabilities may get an additional year of operation before replacement.

In such a climate, security teams are often asked to do more with less. However, security can be improved simply by getting the basics right and addressing gaps that don’t require investment. Patching might be time-consuming, but it doesn’t require extra budget. Prioritize removing the most exploited vulnerabilities as listed in our [2024 Year in Review](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2024yearinreview/) report. Next, review your MFA implementation, ensuring that it is deployed everywhere throughout the organization and that it can’t be bypassed.

When times are tough, focus on getting the basics right and fixing what can be fixed without needing costly investment. Each vulnerability fixed, each weakness remediated helps move the security posture forwards and makes your organization a tougher target for the bad guys who in turn are more likely to seek easier quarry.

## The one big thing

We are continuing our discussion of Talos' [2024 Year in Review](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2024yearinreview/) report, looking at each section in detail. This week, let’s examine the [evolution of email lures](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/year-in-review-exploring-vulnerabilities-email-threats-and-adversary-tooling/) and the nature of the most frequently targeted vulnerabilities.

### Why do I care?

In a world of limited resources, effective defense requires identifying areas that are more likely to be targeted by threat actors and prioritizing shoring up these areas. Not all vulnerabilities or systems are exploited equally, and remediating the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities maximizes security effectiveness.

### So now what?

Educate users on the types of social engineering that threat actors are currently using in email lures. Social engineering is not static but constantly changing to try and outwit unwary targets.

Exploitation of the Shellshock series of vulnerabilities should not be continuing for over 10 years since disclosure. Aggressively identify systems within your IT estate that are vulnerable to this attack and urgently patch them.
