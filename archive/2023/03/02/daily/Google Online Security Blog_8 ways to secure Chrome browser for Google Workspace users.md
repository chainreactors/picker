## 1. Bring Chrome under Cloud Management

Your journey towards keeping your Google Workspace users and data safe, starts with bringing your Chrome browsers under Cloud Management at no additional cost. [Chrome Browser Cloud Management](https://chromeenterprise.google/browser/management/) is a single destination for applying Chrome Browser policies and security controls across Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. You also get deep visibility into your browser fleet including which browsers are out of date, which extensions your users are using and bringing insight to potential security blindspots in your enterprise.

Managing Chrome from the cloud allows Google Workspace admins to enforce [enterprise protections and policies](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9116814?hl=en) to the whole browser on fully managed devices, which no longer requires a user to sign into Chrome to have policies enforced. You can also enforce policies that apply when your managed users sign in to Chrome browser on any Windows, Mac, or Linux computer (via [Chrome Browser user-level management](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9025411?hl=en)) --not just on corporate managed devices.

This enables you to keep your corporate data and users safe, whether they are accessing work resources from fully managed, personal, or unmanaged devices used by your vendors.

Getting started is easy. If your organization hasn’t already, [c](https://enterprise.google.com/signup/chrome-browser/email?origin=cbcm&source=browsermgmt&_ga=2.9391413.143876897.1676576075-1645908088.1647368605)heck out [this guide for steps on how to enroll your devices.](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9301891?hl=en&ref_topic=9301744)

## 2. Enforce built-in protections against Phishing, Ransomware & Malware

Chrome uses Google’s Safe Browsing technology to help protect billions of devices every day by showing warnings to users when they attempt to navigate to dangerous sites or download dangerous files. Safe Browsing is enabled by default for all users when they download Chrome. As an administrator, you can prevent your users from disabling Safe Browsing by enforcing the [SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel](https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel) policy.

Over the past few years, we’ve seen threats on the web becoming increasingly sophisticated. Turning on [Enhanced Safe Browsing](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/enhanced-protection-strongest-level-of.html) will substantially increase protection from dangerous websites, malicious downloads and extensions. For the best protections against web based attacks Google has to offer, enforce Enhanced Safe Browsing for your users.

## 3. Enable Enterprise Credential Protections in Chrome

Enterprise password reuse introduces significant security risks. Quite often, employees reuse corporate credentials as personal logins and vice versa. Occasionally, employees even enter their corporate passwords into phishing websites. Reused employee logins give criminals easy paths to access corporate data.

[Chrome Enterprise Password Reuse detection](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9696605?hl=en) helps enterprises avoid identity theft and employee and organizational data breaches by detecting when an employee enters their corporate credentials into any other website.

Google Password Manager in Chrome also has a built-in [Password Checkup](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/12/better-password-protections-in-chrome.html) feature that alerts users when Google discovers a username and password has been exposed in a public data breach.

Password alerts are surfaced in Audit Logs and Security Investigation Tool which helps admins create automated rules or take appropriate steps to mitigate this by asking users to reset their passwords.

## 4. Gain insights into critical security events via Audit Logs, Google Security Center or your SIEM of choice

IT teams can gain useful insights about potential security threats and events that your Google Workspace users are encountering when browsing the web using Chrome. IT teams can take preventive measures against threats through Security [Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/extending-chromes-security-insights-to-google-cloud-and-workspace-products).

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGnxyfNa43LnCft69rpyZHpv6BEvzkjRdYWw0pslw0Y7T8vt9XEvTwXKY-3Wk2iZa1ZkqkwiDxaz4il8Sp5x_MteMvQfql7wL9Pbv2uwXKFhfbmLKvEKL5SEmpsisoJczLW_u9WWc_IcGr4NIHDeYQWqwMdpSLZEr4IUAMHHAy8WuCG008qgIdX_1i4w/s1600/Blog%203.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGnxyfNa43LnCft69rpyZHpv6BEvzkjRdYWw0pslw0Y7T8vt9XEvTwXKY-3Wk2iZa1ZkqkwiDxaz4il8Sp5x_MteMvQfql7wL9Pbv2uwXKFhfbmLKvEKL5SEmpsisoJczLW_u9WWc_IcGr4NIHDeYQWqwMdpSLZEr4IUAMHHAy8WuCG008qgIdX_1i4w/s1600/Blog%203.png)

In the Google Workspace Admin console, organizations can enroll their Chrome browser and get detailed information about their browser deployment. IT teams can also set policies, manage extensions, and more. The Chrome management policies can be set to work alongside any end user-based policies that may be in place.

Once you’ve enabled Security events reporting (pictured above), you can then view reporting events within [audit logs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9393909). Google Workspace Enterprise Plus or Education Plus users can use the [Workspace Security Investigation Tool](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7575955?hl=en) to identify, triage, and act on potential security threats.

As of today, Chrome can report on when users:

* Navigate to a known malicious site.* Download or upload files containing known malware.* Reuse corporate passwords on non-approved sites.* Change corporate passwords after reusing them on non-approved sites.* Install extensions.

In addition to Google Workspace, you can also export these events into other Google Cloud products, such as Google Cloud [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub), [Chronicle](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/security-information-event-management), or leading 3rd party products such as [Splunk](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/12325467?hl=en&ref_topic=9302422), [Crowdstrike](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/12731018?hl=en&ref_topic=930...
