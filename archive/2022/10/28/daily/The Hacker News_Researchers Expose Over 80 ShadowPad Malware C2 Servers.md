[![ShadowPad Malware](data:image/png;base64... "ShadowPad Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8ne66RXxVI-7GwzIZERx462gjHp2v3IlkcFA4TG6e6K1-rmtaDUx8wu7giwwQqN3q__TJHIBPmuOeW-qla2fWtBiXAJqq6NU1PghHzejGh3IpBFCGc020QVQHpjubgy7R7DQKxP-FN8x341g64Yg0inMLr8aX1bLpB_fJQDw0rsx5ds2OCwv5lwRR/s790-rw-e365/botnet.jpg)

As many as 85 command-and-control (C2) servers have been [discovered](https://github.com/carbonblack/active_c2_ioc_public/blob/main/shadowpad/shadowpad_202210.tsv) supported by the ShadowPad malware since September 2021, with infrastructure detected as recently as October 16, 2022.

That's according to VMware's Threat Analysis Unit (TAU), which [studied](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2022/10/threat-analysis-active-c2-discovery-using-protocol-emulation-part3-shadowpad.html) three ShadowPad variants using TCP, UDP, and HTTP(S) protocols for C2 communications.

[ShadowPad](https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/apt-hackers-targeting-industrial.html), seen as a successor to [PlugX](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/chinese-hackers-target-government.html), is a modular malware platform privately shared among multiple Chinese state-sponsored actors since 2015.

Taiwanese cybersecurity firm TeamT5, earlier this May, disclosed details of another China-nexus modular implant named [Pangolin8RAT](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-22/briefings/schedule/index.html#the-next-gen-plugxshadowpad-a-dive-into-the-emerging-china-nexus-modular-trojan-pangolinrat-25950), which is believed to be the successor of the PlugX and ShadowPad malware families, linking it to a threat group dubbed Tianwu.

[![ShadowPad Malware](data:image/png;base64... "ShadowPad Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTf1IYfXFn7yZ7sPmbYhDdEXpMQ7yrhQyGaLEWBkFaOeG4TkAvW4tWVCzbOMC-ie2bC4BsUJbstut_rVcqeWZ_G198YU3AVMoGLPON8SUKLygpHdIelnaw-Gnm-95Ug7qQs_VXHpCVXz62GzZIS3Q8Rqp-EPT_kFbeYpzn5feL9IrKne8ftlUs6BFCiw/s790-rw-e365/stats.jpg)

An analysis of the three ShadowPad artifacts, which have been previously put to use by [Winnti](https://thehackernews.com/2021/01/researchers-disclose-undocumented.html), [Tonto Team](https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/proxylogon-exchange-poc-exploit.html), and an emerging threat cluster codenamed [Space Pirates](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/webworm-hackers-using-modified-rats-in.html), made it possible to discover the C2 servers by scanning the list of open hosts generated by a tool called [ZMap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap), VMware said.

The company further disclosed it identified [Spyder](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/chinese-spyder-loader-malware-spotted.html) and [ReverseWindow](https://jsac.jpcert.or.jp/archive/2021/pdf/JSAC2021_301_shui-leon_en.pdf) malware samples communicating with ShadowPad C2 IP addresses, both of which are [malicious tools](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14154) put to use by APT41 (aka Winnti) and [LuoYu](https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/chinese-luoyu-hackers-using-man-on-side.html).

Additionally, overlaps have been observed between the aforementioned Spyder sample and a Worker component of the threat actor's [Winnti 4.0 trojan](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2019/09/cb-tau-threat-intelligence-notification-winnti-malware-4-0.html).

"Scanning APT malware C2s on the Internet is sometimes like finding a needle in a haystack," Takahiro Haruyama, senior threat researcher at VMware TAU, said. "However, once the C2 scanning works, it can become a game changer as one of the most proactive threat detection approaches."
