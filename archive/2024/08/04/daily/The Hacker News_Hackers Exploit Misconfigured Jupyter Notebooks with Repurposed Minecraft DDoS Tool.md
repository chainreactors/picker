[![Minecraft DDoS Tool](data:image/png;base64... "Minecraft DDoS Tool")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJUm8NcZ7i8h5mjZPKMgQPu-cWw1iw4k9AX20doSGcKPDg5s5oXE3rmbwV1rLBR260olLDBdvW1j1JDyYTymw0_eoHm5ma0eeTH2bmoDEcTA7C48ObMZ2D-95Ye74XmSegueRJOlFIft8jagGNskDczp-ZiB2aK3StjjZnLUbovnGpiBx8Pdrz1VuS7J5j/s790-rw-e365/ddos.png)

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack campaign targeting misconfigured Jupyter Notebooks.

The activity, codenamed **Panamorfi** by cloud security firm Aqua, utilizes a Java-based tool called [mineping](https://github.com/foxkera/mineping) to launch a TCP flood DDoS attack. Mineping is a DDoS package designed for Minecraft game servers.

Attack chains entail the exploitation of internet-exposed Jupyter Notebook instances to run wget commands for fetching a ZIP archive hosted on a file-sharing site called Filebin.

The ZIP file contains two Java archive (JAR) files, conn.jar and mineping.jar, with the former used to establish connections to a Discord channel and trigger the execution of the mineping.jar package.

"This attack aims to consume the resources of the target server by sending a large number of TCP connection requests," Aqua researcher Assaf Morag [said](https://www.aquasec.com/blog/panamorfi-a-new-discord-ddos-campaign/). "The results are written to the Discord channel."

The attack campaign has been attributed to a threat actor who goes by the name [yawixooo](https://github.com/yawixooo), whose GitHub account has a public repository containing a Minecraft server properties file.

This is not the first time internet-accessible Jupyter Notebooks have been targeted by adversaries. In October 2023, a Tunisian threat dubbed [Qubitstrike](https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/qubitstrike-targets-jupyter-notebooks.html) was observed breaching Jupyter Notebooks in an attempt to illicitly mine cryptocurrency and compromise cloud environments.
