# SharpDump

---

SharpDump is a C# port of [PowerSploit's Out-Minidump.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Out-Minidump.ps1) functionality. The [MiniDumpWriteDump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump) Win32 API call is used to create a minidump for the process ID specified (LSASS by default) to C:\Windows\Temp\debug.out, GZipStream is used to compress the dump to C:\Windows\Temp\debug.bin (.gz format), and the original minidump file is deleted.

[@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) is the primary author of this port.
