Malware isn't just trying to hide anymore‚Äîit's trying to belong. We're seeing code that talks like us, logs like us, even documents itself like a helpful teammate. Some threats now look more like developer tools than exploits. Others borrow trust from open-source platforms, or quietly build themselves out of AI-written snippets. It's not just about being malicious‚Äîit's about being believable.

In this week's cybersecurity recap, we explore how today's threats are becoming more social, more automated, and far too sophisticated for yesterday's instincts to catch.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Secret Blizzard Conduct ISP-Level AitM Attacks to Deploy ApolloShadow](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/secret-blizzard-deploys-malware-in-isp.html)** ‚Äî Russian cyberspies are abusing local internet service providers' networks to target foreign embassies in Moscow and likely collect intelligence from diplomats' devices. The activity has been attributed to the Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Secret Blizzard (aka Turla). It likely involves using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position within domestic telecom companies and ISPs that diplomats are using for Internet access to push a piece of malware called ApolloShadow. This indicates that the ISP may be [working](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/researchers-uncover-decade-long-cyber.html) with the threat actor to facilitate the attacks using the System for Operative Investigative activities (SORM) systems. Microsoft declined to say how many organizations were targeted, or successfully infected, in this campaign.

## Inside the 2025 Security Shift: What Every Cloud Leader Must Know Now

Cloud security is shifting fast. Sysdig's 2025 Cloud Defense Report shows how AI tools like Sysdig Sage‚Ñ¢ cut response time by 76%, while runtime security and open source tools like Falco reshape defense. Get insights and strategies to stay ahead.](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-defense-2025-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Companies that Employed Hafnium Hackers Linked to Over a Dozen Patents](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/hackers-hide-malware-in-images-to.html)** ‚Äî Threat actors linked to the notorious Hafnium hacking group have worked for companies that registered several patents for highly intrusive forensics and data collection technologies. The findings highlight China's diverse private sector offensive ecosystem and an underlying problem with mapping tradecraft to a specific cluster, which may not accurately reflect the true organizational structure of the attackers. The fact that the threat actors have been attributed to three different companies shows that multiple companies may be working in tandem to conduct the intrusions and those companies may be providing their tools to other actors, leading to incomplete or misleading attribution. It's currently not known how the threat actors came to possess the Microsoft Exchange Server flaws that were used to target various entities in a widespread campaign in early 2021. But their close relationship with the Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB) has raised the possibility that the bureau may have obtained access to information about the zero-days through some evidence collection method and passed it on to the attackers. The discovery also highlights another important aspect: China-based Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) may actually consist of different companies that serve many clients owing to the contracting ecosystem, which forces these companies to collaborate on intrusions. In June 2025, Recorded Future [revealed](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/artificial-eyes-generative-ai-chinas-military-intelligence) that a Chinese state-owned defense research institute filed a patent in late December 2024 that analyzes various kinds of intelligence, including OSINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, and TECHINT, to train a military-specific large language model in order to "support every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations."
* **[Likely 0-Day SonicWall SSL VPN Flaw Used in Akira Ransomware Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/akira-ransomware-exploits-sonicwall.html)** ‚Äî SonicWall SSL VPN devices have become the target of Akira ransomware attacks as part of a newfound surge in activity observed in late July 2025. Arctic Wolf Labs said that the attacks could be exploiting an as-yet-undetermined security flaw in the appliances, meaning a zero-day vulnerability, given that some of the incidents affected fully-patched SonicWall devices. However, the possibility of credential-based attacks for initial access hasn't been ruled out. The development came as watchTowr Labs detailed multiple vulnerabilities in SonicWall SMA 100 Series appliances ([CVE-2025-40596, CVE-2025-40597, and CVE-2025-40598](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/snwlid-2025-0012)) that an attacker could exploit to cause denial-of-service or code execution. "We stumbled across vulnerabilities that feel like they were preserved in amber from a more na√Øve era of C programming," security researcher Sina Kheirkhah [said](https://labs.watchtowr.com/stack-overflows-heap-overflows-and-existential-dread-sonicwall-sma100-cve-2025-40596-cve-2025-40597-and-cve-2025-40598/). "While we understand (and agree) that these vulnerabilities are ultimately difficult - or...
