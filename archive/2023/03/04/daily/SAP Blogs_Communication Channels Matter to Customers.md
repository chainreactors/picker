**Communication Channels Matter to Customers**

As Marshall Mcluhan said, "the media is the message" (1964). It means that the media (or channel) we choose to communicate is arguably more valuable than the message.  However, other than social media like TikTok or Instagram, there often isn’t a huge difference in the way businesses market to users.  Nor is there an easy way to unsubscribe across channels.

This becomes an issue for businesses both in the amount spent on marketing to the wrong channels, and frustration in customer experience with unwanted messages being sent to multiple devices.

For example, I bought an electronic toothbrush off an Instagram advertisement.  To get a discount, I added SMS, thinking once purchased I can opt-out.  Unfortunately, I can’t figure out how to stop the messages from coming. To make it worse, I get the same message via email.  I am starting to no longer like the brand.

This is where having a **Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)** in place can truly accelerate your business and reduce spend.

Start by providing options to the customer of the **available channels of communication**:

Then, using **Progressive Profiling**, you can ask additional information about channel preferences:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Shengi-progressive.jpg)

This eliminates drop-off during registration, as it reduces the amount of information presented on the screen.

Finally, ensure that you have a **preference centre** in which customers can modify their consent in one place, rather than going to each channel to opt-out.  There is no sense marketing to someone that does not want to engage. ­­

Every customer is unique and wants a personalised experience and control over their data.

Now is always a good time to re-evaluate your registration flows, with special consideration for individual customer communication preferences, and how to engage customers to share those preferences with registration screens and progressive profiling.
