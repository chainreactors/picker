# Falcon: digital signature based on NTRU

## Introduction

[NIST’s Post-Quantum standardization process](https://www.telsy.com/post-quantum-cryptography-pqc-a-classical-solution-to-the-quantum-threat/) has identified two cryptographic schemes based on [lattice theory](https://www.telsy.com/the-mathematics-behind-pqc-the-lattices/) within digital signatures: [CRYSTALS-Dilithium](https://www.telsy.com/crystals-dilithium-lwe-based-digital-signature/) and Falcon.

Within modern cryptographic communication protocols, these solutions will replace the schemes currently used for [digital signatures](https://www.telsy.com/digital-signature-algorithms-present-and-future/), which are vulnerable to attack by a [quantum computer](https://www.telsy.com/the-quantum-computing/).

While Dilithium has been selected as the primary solution, Falcon may prove more appropriate in particular application scenarios as highlighted by NIST. For example, a more favorable element of Falcon is the ability to transmit a signature in a single IP packet, avoiding fragmentation issues.

On the other hand, Falcon’s design is more complex to understand and implement. The construction is based on three main ingredients: the NTRU mathematical problem, the GPV framework for lattice-based digital hash-and-sign signatures, and the Fast Fourier Sampling signature method.
