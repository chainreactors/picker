In recent years, there has been a significant uptick in the frequency and sophistication of [attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-magalenha-long-running-campaign-pursues-portuguese-credentials-and-pii/) on the financial and banking industry. The following statistics illustrate the current breadth and depth of cyber attacks by various types of threat actors on financial entities:

* Financial institutions were the second most impacted sector based on the number of reported data breaches last year. Institutions in the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, and China were most affected. As of December 2022, finance and insurance organizations globally [experienced](https://flashpoint.io/blog/risk-intelligence-year-in-review-financial/) 566 breaches, leading to over 254 million leaked records.
* Ransomware attacks on financial services have [increased](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2023/07/13/the-state-of-ransomware-in-financial-services-2023/#:~:text=The%202023%20survey%20revealed%20that,sector%20in%20the%202021%20report.) from 55% in 2022 to 64% in 2023, which is nearly double the 34% reported in 2021. Only 1 in 10 attacks were stopped before encryption took place, making a total of 81% of organizations a victim of data encryption.
* Data breaches [cost](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-07-24-IBM-Report-Half-of-Breached-Organizations-Unwilling-to-Increase-Security-Spend-Despite-Soaring-Breach-Costs) the finance sector the second highest costs amongst all others at $5.9 million.

This blog explores the rise in cyber attacks on the banking and financial industries, their far-reaching consequences, and what these high-target entities can do to protect against the evolving tactics of threat actors.

## Understanding the Risks Faced by the Financial Sector

In their 2022 Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience [report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/cybersecurity-report-202207.pdf), the Federal Reserve Board actively notes all [potential risks](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-cyber-risk-management/) and emerging threats that affect the state of the U.S. economy. At no surprise, cybersecurity concerns topped the list, calling out Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and sophisticated [Distributed Denial of Service](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos/) (DDoS) attacks as the biggest risks to financial institutions’ ability to operate and safeguard customer data.

* RaaS – [RaaS](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology) is characterized by heightened sophistication, rapid proliferation, and difficulty of attribution. RaaS empowers threat actors to establish templates that could be considered “franchised” threats. Accomplished threat actors license their software to other malicious parties, typically in exchange for a portion of the ransom proceeds. This threat model provides less advanced threat actors with many more ways of disrupting businesses. Victims that decline ransom payment often find themselves with the burden of reconstructing their infrastructure in order to reinstate normal business operations.
* DDoS Attacks – In sophisticated [DDoS attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos/), the attacker aims to render a machine or network resource unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with traffic. The United States’ financial services sector has long been a target of DDoS attacks, which has also affected associated external entities and other stakeholders.

An excerpt from the Federal Reserve Board’s report highlights this concern, amplified through the lens of current geopolitics:

*The rising number of advanced persistent threats increases the potential for malicious cyber activity within the financial sector. These threats may result in incidents that affect one or more participants in the financial services sector simultaneously and have potentially systemic consequences. Such incidents could affect the ability of targeted firms to provide services and conduct business as usual, presenting a unique challenge to operational resilience. These incidents can also threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the targeted firm’s data.*

Banks and financial institutions can face significant short and long-term financial damages when they experience a cyberattack. These damages can result from a variety of factors, including operational disruptions, reputational harm, legal and regulatory consequences, and increased cybersecurity investments.

### Immediate & Ongoing Fees

A single, successful cyberattack can lead to immediate financial consequences that directly impact a company’s financial performance. Costs are associated with the severity of the attack and the extent of the data exposure, leading to both immediate and long-term repercussions.

* Ransom Payments – In the scenario of a [ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/) attack, the average payout cost has surged to [$1.6 million](https://invenioit.com/continuity/ransomware-attacks-finance/) on average compared to the previous year’s average of over $272,000. 43% of surveyed companies in the same report confirmed paying the ransom.
* Forensic Analysis & Investigation Fees – Organizations often engage cybersecurity experts to identify the nature and scope of the breach, analyze the attack vectors, and trace the attacker’s activities.
* PR & Crisis Management Fees – After a breach, organizations may engage public relations and communication experts to manage the institution’s public image and respond to media inquiries. This also involves notifying affected customers, partners, and stakeholders about the breach, potential data exposure, and recommended actions.
* Legal Expenses – Small to medium-sized businesses with no in-house legal team may seek legal advice to navigate the legal implications of the breach, including potential liability, regulatory compliance, and contractual obligations.
* Customer Compensations & Cost of Remediation – Depending on the information compromised during the attack, organizations may offer credit monitoring and [identity protection services](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/identity-security-what-it-is-why-its-so-important/) to affected customers to mitigate potential identity theft. This can include assisting customers in resolving fraudulent transactions or unauthorized account access for a period after the breach.
* Increased Premiums – Post-attack, companies may be forced to pay higher premiums for their cyber insurance coverage.

### Regulatory & Legal Consequences

Financial entities and banks are mandated to follow applicable compliance frameworks such as [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). After a breach, they will be subject to paying fines imposed by regulatory authorities for non-compliance with data protection and cybersecurity regulations. Those that fall victim to a cyberattack face substantial regulatory and legal consequences. Regulatory bodies impose fines ...
