It's been a while since I've last posted a quality video on YouTube and I've decided that this is going to be a pretty long and decent introduction into what I've been up to online since the 90's up to present day where I'm an internationally recognized cybercrime researcher security blogger and threat intelligence analyst. In this rather long video I'll walk you through my experience as a hacker enthusiast during the 90's up to present day and I'll also discuss in-depth a variety of personal projects including to offer a general discussion and overview on a variety of key topics that are currently active within the security industry including my personal career such as for instance.

Among my key accomplishments include my "lawful surveillance" and "lawful interceprtion" experience as teenage hacker the production of the popular Astalavista Security Newsletter circa 2003-2006 including the "take-down" of the Koobface botnet [MP3] including a participation in Top Secret GCHQ program called "Lovely Horse" including regular appearance in major news publications for interview and expert opinion including Techmeme, ZDNet, CNN, PCWorld, SCMagazine, TheRegister, NYTimes, CNET, ComputerWorld, H+Magazine and regular security and research presentation appearance at major security events at GCHQ, Interpol, InfoSec Europe, RSA Europe and CyberCamp.

I'm an internationally recognized expert in the field of cybercrime fighting and threat intelligence gathering having actively pioneered my own methodlogy for processing threat intelligence which leads me to a successful set of hundreas of high-quality anaysis and research articles published at the industry's leading threat intelligence blog - ZDNet's Zero Day, Dancho Danchev's Mind Streams of Information Security Knowledge and Webroot's Threat Blog with his research featured in Techmeme, ZDNet, CNN, PCWorld, SCMagazine, TheRegister, NYTimes, CNET, ComputerWorld, H+Magazine currently producing threat intelligence at the industry's leading threat intelligence blog - Dancho Danchev's - Mind Streams of Information Security Knowledge.
