What is Spearphishing: Definition, Techniques, Real-world Example

Roughly **70% of malware incidents are a result of social engineering**, with spearphishing being a common method. Let’s learn more about this phenomenon and discover:

* What is spearphishing and what makes it so dangerous
* Common techniques used in spearphishing attacks
* Tools you can employ in your defense strategy
* An example of a real-world spearphishing attack

## What is spearphishing?

It is a targeted form of [phishing attack](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/phising-types-of-attacks/) where the adversary focuses on a specific individual or organization. Unlike generic phishing, spearphishing is often more sophisticated and uses personalized information to make the attack more convincing.

## What are the main goals of spearphishing?

The most common objectives are delivering a malicious payload, but other goals can be pursued, too:

* **Disclosure of sensitive information**: obtaining personal, financial, or business-critical information for fraudulent use or selling on the dark web.
* **Unauthorized system access**: capturing credentials for unauthorized access, potentially leading to further compromise within a network or system.

## What makes spearphishing dangerous?

**It is highly targeted and tailored to each victim**, making it more challenging to defend against compared to generic [phishing attacks](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/phishing-campaigns-august-24/).

Spoofing genuine connections of the victim, impersonating business associates, or tailoring a message around the receiver’s interests — all of these factors make spearphishing even more challenging to recognize than common phishing.

For example, attackers may impersonate a high-ranking executive within a company, sending an email to an employee requesting urgent payment or confidential information. The email will appear genuine, leaving little chance for the victim to recognize an attack.

Another tactic attackers sometimes use is gaining access to an actual business associate’s email account. Then, they will lead the recipient to believe that the email is from a trusted contact, but in reality, it contains malware.

## Spearphishing and phishing compared

We’ve created this table show what aspects make spearphishing so destructive and why you should be concerned about this potential threat:

| Aspect | Spearphishing | Phishing |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Targeting | Specific targeting: focuses on specific individuals or organizations, making the attack more dangerous as it can exploit known vulnerabilities or personal connections. | General targeting: mass-targeting approach makes it less dangerous per individual, as it's less likely to exploit personal weaknesses. |
| Personalization | Highly tailored: utilizes personal or professional information, making it more convincing and dangerous as it appears more legitimate. | Generic: little or no personalization makes it less dangerous as it is often less convincing. |
| Research required | Extensive research: the detailed research increases danger by enabling precise targeting, exploiting specific vulnerabilities. | Minimal research: lack of research on individual targets makes it less effective and dangerous. |
| Success rate | Higher success rate: customization leads to more successful attacks, posing greater risk. | Lower success rate: The broader approach results in a lower success rate, making it less dangerous on an individual level. |
| Difficulty to detect | Harder to detect: relevance and customization make detection more challenging, increasing danger. | Easier to detect: generic nature often makes it more noticeable, reducing danger. |
| Potential impact | More damaging:...
