# Top Zeus Botnet Suspect “Tank” Arrested in Geneva

**Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov**, the accused 40-year-old Ukrainian leader of a prolific cybercriminal group that stole tens of millions of dollars from small to mid-sized businesses in the United States and Europe, has been arrested in Switzerland, according to multiple sources.

Penchukov was named in a 2014 indictment by the **U.S. Department of Justice** as a top figure in the **JabberZeus Crew**, a small but potent cybercriminal collective from Ukraine and Russia that attacked victim companies with a powerful, custom-made version of the **Zeus** banking trojan.

The **U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation** (FBI) declined to comment for this story. But according to multiple sources, Penchukov was arrested in Geneva, Switzerland roughly three weeks ago as he was traveling to meet up with his wife there.

Penchukov is from Donetsk, a traditionally Russia-leaning region in Eastern Ukraine that was recently annexed by Russia. In his hometown, Penchukov was a well-known deejay (“[DJ Slava Rich](https://en.geo.pro/reportage/143573-red-line-dj-jam-dj-slava-rich/)“) who enjoyed being seen riding around in his high-end BMWs and Porsches. More recently, Penchukov has been [investing quite a bit in local businesses](https://jetsetter.ua/event/promo-otkrytie-butika-garde/).

The JabberZeus crew’s name is derived from the malware they used, which was configured to send them a Jabber instant message each time a new victim entered a one-time password code into a phishing page mimicking their bank. The JabberZeus gang [targeted mostly small to mid-sized businesses](http://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/), and they were an early pioneer of so-called “man-in-the-browser” attacks, malware that can silently siphon any data that victims submit via a web-based form.

Once inside a victim company’s bank accounts, the crooks would modify the firm’s payroll to add dozens of “**money mules**,” [people recruited through work-at-home schemes to handle bank transfers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/09/u-s-charges-37-alleged-money-mules/). The mules in turn would forward any stolen payroll deposits — minus their commissions — via wire transfer overseas.

The JabberZeus malware was custom-made for the crime group by the alleged author of the Zeus trojan — **Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev**, a top Russian cybercriminal with [a $3 million bounty on his head from the FBI](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/). Bogachev is accused of running the [Gameover Zeus botnet](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/operation-tovar-targets-gameover-zeus-botnet-cryptolocker-scourge/), a massive crime machine of 500,000 to 1 million infected PCs that was used for [large DDoS attacks](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/ddos-attacks-spell-gameover-for-banks-victims-in-cyber-heists/) and for spreading Cryptolocker — a peer-to-peer ransomware threat that was years ahead of its time.

Investigators knew Bogachev and JabberZeus were linked because for many years they were reading the private Jabber chats between and among members of the JabberZeus crew, and Bogachev’s monitored aliases were in semi-regular contact with the group about updates to the malware.

**Gary Warner**, director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, noted in his blog from 2014 that Tank told co-conspirators in a JabberZeus chat on July 22, 2009 that his daughter, **Miloslava**, had been born and gave her birth weight.

“A search of Ukrainian birth records only showed one girl named Miloslava with that birth weight born on that day,” Warner wrote. This was enough to positively identify Tank as Penchukov, Warner said.

Ultimately, Penchukov’s political connections helped him evade prosecution by Ukrainian cybercrime investigators for many years. The late son of former Ukrainian President **[Victor Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych)** ([Victor Yanukovych Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Viktorovych_Yanukovych)) would serve as godfather to Tank’s daughter Miloslava. Through his connections to the Yanukovych family, Tank was able to establish contact with key insiders in top tiers of the Ukrainian government, including law enforcement.

Sources briefed on the investigation into Penchukov said that in 2010 — at a time when the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) [was preparing to serve search warrants on Tank and his crew](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/10/ukraine-detains-5-individuals-tied-to-70-million-in-ebanking-heists/) — Tank received a tip that the SBU was coming to raid his home. That warning gave Tank ample time to destroy important evidence against the group, and to avoid being home when the raids happened. Those sources also said Tank used his contacts to have the investigation into his crew moved to a different unit that was headed by his corrupt SBU contact.

Writing for *Technology Review*, **Patrick Howell O’Neil** [recounted](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/08/1027999/fbi-russia-ukraine-cybercrime-investigation-ransomware/) how SBU agents in 2010 were trailing Tank around the city, watching closely as he moved between nightclubs and his apartment.

“In early October, the Ukrainian surveillance team said they’d lost him,” he wrote. “The Americans were unhappy, and a little surprised. But they were also resigned to what they saw as the realities of working in Ukraine. The country had a notorious corruption problem. The running joke was that it was easy to find the SBU’s anticorruption unit—just look for the parking lot full of BMWs.”

## AUTHOR’S NOTE/BACKGROUND

I first encountered Tank and the JabberZeus crew roughly 14 years ago as a reporter for *The Washington Post*, after a trusted source confided that he’d secretly gained access to the group’s private Jabber conversations.

From reading those discussions each day, it became clear Tank was nominally in charge of the Ukrainian crew, and that he spent much of his time overseeing the activities of the money mule recruiters — which were an integral part of their victim cashout scheme.

It was soon discovered that the phony corporate websites the money mule recruiters used to manage new hires had a security weakness that allowed anyone who signed up at the portal to view messages for every other user. A scraping tool was built to harvest these money mule recruitment messages, and at the height of the JabberZeus gang’s activity in 2010 that scraper was monitoring messages on close to a dozen different money mule recruitment sites, each managing hundreds of “employees.”

Each mule [was given busy work or menial tasks](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/busywork.png) for a few days or weeks prior to being asked to handle money transfers. I believe this was an effort to weed out unreliable money mules. After...
