Australian Craig Wright has finally admitted he is not the inventor of Bitcoin after losing several cases in the High Court of England and Wales, whose judge has suggested he be investigated for perjury.

Wright has for years claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto – the pseudonym used by whoever wrote the whitepaper that defined Bitcoin and created the reference architecture for the cryptocurrency.

And he didn't just claim to be Bitcoin's secret mastermind, he demanded the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) – founded to fight for open access to crypto intellectual property – remove the Bitcoin whitepaper from its website as he held its copyright. COPA demurred, and the matter went to court in the UK, where the lobby group [sought](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/06/craig_wright_satoshi_nakamoto_forgery_claims/) to prevent Wright from claiming to be the true brains behind Bitcoin. In truth, no one knows for sure the identity of Nakamoto, or at least isn't saying so.
