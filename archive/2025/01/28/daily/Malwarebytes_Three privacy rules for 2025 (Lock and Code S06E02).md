# Three privacy rules for 2025 (Lock and Code S06E02)

Posted: January 26, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

It’s Data Privacy Week right now, and that means, for the most part, that you’re going to see a lot of well-intentioned but clumsy information online about how to protect your data privacy. You’ll see articles about iPhone settings. You’ll hear acronyms for varying state laws. And you’ll probably see ads for a variety of apps, plug-ins, and online tools that can be difficult to navigate.

So much of Malwarebytes—from Malwarebytes Labs, to the Lock and Code podcast, to the engineers, lawyers, and staff at wide—work on data privacy, and we fault no advocate or technologist or policy expert trying to earnestly inform the public about the importance of data privacy.

But, even with good intentions, we cannot ignore the reality of the situation. [Data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) every day, broad disrespect of user data, and a lack of consequences for some of the worst offenders. To be truly effective against these forces, data privacy guidance has to encompass more than fiddling with device settings or making onerous legal requests to companies.

That’s why, for Data Privacy Week this year, we’re offering three pieces of advice that center on behavior. These changes won’t stop some of the worst invasions against your privacy, but we hope they provide a new framework to understand what you actually get when you practice data privacy, which is control.

You have control over who sees where you are and what inferences they make from that. You have control over whether you continue using products that don’t respect your data privacy. And you have control over whether a fast food app is worth giving up your location data to just in exchange for a few measly coupons.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast, host David Ruiz explores his three rules for data privacy in 2025. In short, he recommends:

1. **Less location sharing**. Only when you want it, only from those you trust, and never in the background, 24/7, for your apps.
2. **More accountability**. If companies can’t respect your data, respect yourself by dropping their products.
3. **No more data deals**. That fast-food app offers more than just $4 off a combo meal, it creates a pipeline into your behavioral data

Tune in today to listen to the full breakdown.
