In preparation for a talk, Jason Lang ([@curi0usJack](https://x.com/curi0usJack)) and I were doing at MCTTP about mining TTPs from [VX-underground](https://vx-underground.org/), we both ended up doing research based on ideas we got from reading all the different reports. For me, it started while reading about the various persistence techniques that are described in the various papers. One technique that caught my eye was the reference to Narrator.exe loading the MSTTSLocEnUS.dll upon execution. Having played a lot with Narrator in the past, I decided to take a closer look if this was still a thing or not. The techniques shown in this post requires local administrator access to the system you are manipulating.

I found references to this technique from the almighty @Hexacorn going back all the way to 2013 (Wow). My mind thought that this must surely be fixed now since this was such a long time ago, well letâ€™s explore this rabbit hole together.

First, I needed to verify if this was still the case or not, so I ran Narrator while having a procmon running at the same time. This revealed something interesting.

It still looks for a variant of the dll in a different path? That is strange. Instead of the old path of *%windir%\system32\speech\engine\tts\msttslocenus.dll* it now looks for *%windir%\system32\speech\_onecore\engines\tts\msttsloc\_onecoreenus.dll*. Of course, this made me wonder if I could create a dll, place it there, and get it executed or not. Turns out, that works great. Interestingly, you do not need to create a dll with exports or anything like that. It just executes whatever you have in the attach statement of the dll.

The only issue is when the dll is executed, the Narrator continues, so you will get the voice telling you everything you click on and that is not particularly useful in an attack scenario. I decided to brainstorm for a while and found out that I could write code inside the dll that would iden...
