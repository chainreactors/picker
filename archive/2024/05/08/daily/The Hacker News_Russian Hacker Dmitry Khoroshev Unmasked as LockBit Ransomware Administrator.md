The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) has unmasked the administrator and developer of the LockBit ransomware operation, revealing it to be a 31-year-old Russian national named **Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev**.

In addition, Khoroshev has been [sanctioned](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-and-allies-sanction-prolific-cyber-hacker) by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCD), the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs.

Europol, in a [press statement](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/new-measures-issued-against-lockbit), said authorities are in possession of over 2,500 decryption keys and are continuing to contact LockBit victims to offer support.

Khoroshev, who went by the monikers LockBitSupp and putinkrab, has also become the subject of asset freezes and travel bans, with the U.S. Department of State [offering a reward](https://www.state.gov/transnational-organized-crime-rewards-program-offer-and-designation-of-a-senior-leader-of-russia-based-ransomware-group-lockbit/) of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction.

Previously, the agency had [announced](https://www.state.gov/reward-for-information-lockbit-ransomware-as-a-service/) reward offers of up to $15 million seeking information leading to the identity and location of key leaders of the LockBit ransomware variant group as well as information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of the group's members.

Concurrently, an indictment unsealed by the Department of Justice (DoJ) has [charged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-russian-national-developing-and-operating-lockbit-ransomware) Khoroshev on 26 counts, including one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, extortion, and related activity in connection with computers; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; eight counts of intentional damage to a protected computer; eight counts of extortion in relation to confidential information from a protected computer; and eight counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer.

In all, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 185 years in prison. Each of the charges further carries a monetary penalty that's the greatest of $250,000, pecuniary gain to the offender, or pecuniary harm to the victim.

With the latest indictment, a total of six members affiliated with the LockBit conspiracy have been charged, including [Mikhail Vasiliev](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/lockbit-ransomware-hacker-ordered-to.html), [Mikhail Matveev](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/behind-scenes-of-matveevs-ransomware.html), [Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov](https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/20-year-old-russian-lockbit-ransomware.html), [Artur Sungatov and Ivan Gennadievich Kondratiev](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/lockbit-ransomware-operation-shut-down.html).

"Today's announcement puts another huge nail in the LockBit coffin and our investigation into them continues," NCA Director General Graeme Biggar [said](https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/lockbit-leader-unmasked-and-sanctioned). "We are also now targeting affiliates who have used LockBit services to inflict devastating ransomware attacks on schools, hospitals and major companies around the world."

LockBit, which was one of the most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups, was dismantled as part of a [coordinated operation](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/lockbit-ransomware-operation-shut-down.html) dubbed Cronos earlier this February. It's estimated to have targeted over 2,500 victims worldwide and received more than $500 million in ransom payments.

"LockBit ransomware has been used against Australian, U.K. and U.S. businesses, comprising 18% of total reported Australian ransomware incidents in 2022-23 and 119 reported victims in Australia," Penny Wong, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, [said](https://www.foreignminister.gov.au/minister/penny-wong/media-release/cyber-sanction-imposed-russian-citizen-ransomware-activity).

Under the RaaS business model, LockBit licenses its ransomware software to affiliates in exchange for an 80% cut of the paid ransoms. The e-crime group is also known for its double extortion tactics, where sensitive data is exfiltrated from victim networks before encrypting the computer systems and demanding ransom payments.

Khoroshev, who started LockBit around September 2019, is believed to have netted at least $100 million in disbursements as part of the scheme over the past four years.

In an interesting twist, the indictment has also accused Khoroshev and his co-conspirators of deploying LockBit against multiple Russian victims, stating the defendant demanded identification documents from the recruited affiliates, and even got in touch with law enforcement after the takedown to offer information regarding the identity of his RaaS competitors.

"The true impact of LockBit's criminality was previously unknown, but data obtained from their systems showed that between June 2022 and February 2024, more than 7,000 attacks were built using their services," the NCA said. "The top five countries hit were the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and China."
