the US Department of Justice recently released what it described as raw footage from the night of Jeffrey Epstein's death in 2019. When WIRED’s Dhruv Mehrotra went through the video’s metadata, he found that it had been, in fact, modified. In today’s episode, we dive into what Dhruv found and what it means.

**Michael Calore:** Hey everyone, this is Mike. Before we start, I want to take the chance to remind you that we want to hear from you.

**Katie Drummond:** I'm doing well. I am recovering from a vacation. I went to Detroit, Michigan, with my family. If you haven't spent time in Detroit, I highly recommend it as a vacation destination, which may surprise you, depending on what kinds of vacations you like to take. But if you like to spend time in interesting cities with great food, you could spend some time in Detroit. It was awesome. So, I'm good. You come back from vacation and you're like, you hate everything, and so I'm there, but I'll get out of it. I'll be fine.

**Lauren Goode:** Is it the purpose of a vacation though, to give you a little bit of relaxation and perspective so that you don't hate everything?

**Katie Drummond:** That's not the kind of vacation I take, Lauren. And-

**Lauren Goode:** OK. We need to get you to a spa.

**Michael Calore:** So, Detroit's famous for its pizza, for its square pizza. How does it rate?

**Lauren Goode:** And its cars.

**Michael Calore:** Yeah, and its cars, but really, we're more concerned about pizza.

**Katie Drummond:** Car, great, great roads. We had pizza twice. We had Detroit-style pizza night one. I mean, it's delicious. I find it very heavy. I like to power-consume pizza, so I'm like 3, 4, 5 pieces of pizza. You can't do that with this pizza. You know what I mean?

**Michael Calore:** Yes.

**Katie Drummond:** So I find that to be kind of a bummer, but it's good, it's just very heavy.

**Lauren Goode:** Katie, I have a very important question for you.

**Katie Drummond:** OK.

**Lauren Goode:** Do you eat your pizza with a fork?

**Katie Drummond:** No.

**Lauren Goode:** Thank God, OK.

**Katie Drummond:** Do you?

**Lauren Goode:** We have shaken it out. We can keep going.

**Katie Drummond:** Definitely not.

**Lauren Goode:** OK. No.

**Katie Drummond:** No chance.

**Lauren Goode:** No.

**Katie Drummond:** No, no chance.

**Lauren Goode:** As John Stewart once said, "You fold it and you eat it."

**Katie Drummond:** Yes.

**Dhruv Mehrotra:** I generally fold mine into a small sphere and I just take the whole thing and put it right in my mouth.

**Lauren Goode:** I like that. Who is that voice who just joined us on this podcast?

**Dhruv Mehrotra:** It's me, it's Dhruv.

**Lauren Goode:** It's our resident conspiracy theorist.

**Michael Calore:** This is WIRED's *Uncanny Valley*, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today, the Jeffrey Epstein prison tapes. Likely, you have heard that the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has released nearly 11 hours of footage from a camera outside Epstein's prison cell. The tape was from the...
