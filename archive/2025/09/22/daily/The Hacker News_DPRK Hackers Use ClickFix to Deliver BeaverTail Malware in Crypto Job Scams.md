Threat actors with ties to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (aka DPRK or North Korea) have been observed leveraging ClickFix-style lures to deliver a known malware called BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret.

"The threat actor used ClickFix lures to target marketing and trader roles in cryptocurrency and retail sector organizations rather than targeting software development roles," GitLab Threat Intelligence researcher Oliver Smith [said](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/security-tech-notes/threat-intelligence-tech-notes/north-korean-malware-sept-2025/) in a report published last week.

First exposed by Palo Alto Networks in late 2023, BeaverTail and InvisibleFerret have been deployed by North Korean operatives as part of a long-running campaign dubbed [Contagious Interview](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/n-korean-hackers-used-job-lures-cloud.html) (aka Gwisin Gang), wherein [the malware is distributed](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/en-breaking-lazarus-group-apt38-targets-crypto-sector-with-sophisticated-phishing-campaign) to software developers under the pretext of a job assessment. Assessed to be a subset of the umbrella group [Lazarus](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/lazarus-group-expands-malware-arsenal.html), the cluster has been [active](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/lazarus-group-targets-job-seekers-with.html) since at least December 2022.

Over the years, BeaverTail has also been propagated via [bogus npm packages](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/north-korea-linked-supply-chain-attack.html) and fraudulent Windows videoconferencing applications like FCCCall and FreeConference. Written in JavaScript, the malware acts as an information stealer and a downloader for a Python-based backdoor known as InvisibleFerret.

An important evolution of the campaign involves the use of the ClickFix social engineering tactic to [deliver malware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-hackers-deploy-ferret.html) such as GolangGhost, PylangGhost, and FlexibleFerret – a sub-cluster of activity tracked as [ClickFake Interview](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/bluenoroff-deepfake-zoom-scam-hits.html).

The latest attack wave, observed in late May 2025, is worth highlighting for two reasons: Employing ClickFix to deliver BeaverTail (rather than GolangGhost or FlexibleFerret) and delivering the stealer in the form of a compiled binary produced using tools like pkg and PyInstaller for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

A fake hiring platform web application created using Vercel serves as a distribution vector for the malware, with the threat actor advertising cryptocurrency trader, sales, and marketing roles at various Web3 organizations, as well as urging targets to invest in a Web3 company.

"The threat actor's targeting of marketing applicants and impersonation of a retail sector organization is noteworthy given BeaverTail distributors' usual focus on software developers and the cryptocurrency sector," Smith said.

Users who land on the site have their public IP addresses captured and are instructed to complete a video assessment of themselves, at which point a fake technical error about a non-existent microphone issue is displayed and they are asked to run an operating system-specific command to supposedly address the problem, effectively leading to the deployment of a leaner version of BeaverTail either by means of a shell script or Visual Basic Script.

"The BeaverTail variant associated with this campaign contains a simplified information stealer routine and targets fewer browser extensions," GitLab said. "The variant targets only eight browser extensions rather than the 22 targeted in other contemporary BeaverTail variants."

Another important omission is the removal of functions related to stealing data from web browsers other than Google Chrome. The Windows version of BeaverTail has also been found relying on a password-protected archive shipped along with the malware to load Python dependencies related to InvisibleFerret.

While password-protected archives are a fairly common technique that various threat actors have adopted for some time, this is the first time the method has been used for payload delivery in connection with BeaverTail, indicating that the threat actors are actively refining their attack chains.

What's more, the low prevalence of secondary artifacts in the wild and the absence of social engineering finesse suggest that the campaign may have been a limited test and unlikely to be deployed at scale.

"The campaign suggests a slight tactical shift for a subgroup of North Korean BeaverTail operators, expanding beyond their traditional software developer targeting to pursue marketing and trading roles across cryptocurrency and retail sectors," GitLab said. "The move to compiled malware variants and continued reliance on ClickFix techniques demonstrates operational adaptation to reach less technical targets and systems without standard software development tools installed."

The development comes as a joint investigation from SentinelOne SentinelLabs, and Validin found t...
