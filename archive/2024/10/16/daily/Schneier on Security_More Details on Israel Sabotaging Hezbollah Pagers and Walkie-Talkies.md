## More Details on Israel Sabotaging Hezbollah Pagers and Walkie-Talkies

The *Washington Post* has a long and detailed [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/) about the operation that’s well worth reading (alternate version [here](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/mossad-s-pager-operation-inside-israel-s-penetration-of-hezbollah/ar-AA1rKXwe)).

> The sales pitch came from a marketing official trusted by Hezbollah with links to Apollo. The marketing official, a woman whose identity and nationality officials declined to reveal, was a former Middle East sales representative for the Taiwanese firm who had established her own company and acquired a license to sell a line of pagers that bore the Apollo brand. Sometime in 2023, she offered Hezbollah a deal on one of the products her firm sold: the rugged and reliable AR924.
>
> “She was the one in touch with Hezbollah, and explained to them why the bigger pager with the larger battery was better than the original model,” said an Israeli official briefed on details of the operation. One of the main selling points about the AR924 was that it was “possible to charge with a cable. And the batteries were longer lasting,” the official said.
>
> As it turned out, the actual production of the devices was outsourced and the marketing official had no knowledge of the operation and was unaware that the pagers were physically assembled in Israel under Mossad oversight, officials said. Mossad’s pagers, each weighing less than three ounces, included a unique feature: a battery pack that concealed a tiny amount of a powerful explosive, according to the officials familiar with the plot.
>
> In a feat of engineering, the bomb component was so carefully hidden as to be virtually undetectable, even if the device was taken apart, the officials said. Israeli officials believe that Hezbollah did disassemble some of the pagers and may have even X-rayed them.
>
> Also invisible was Mossad’s remote access to the devices. An electronic signal from the intelligence service could trigger the explosion of thousands of the devices at once. But, to ensure maximum damage, the blast could also be triggered by a special two-step procedure required for viewing secure messages that had been encrypted.
>
> “You had to push two buttons to read the message,” an official said. In practice, that meant using both hands.

Also read Bunnie Huang’s [essay](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/2024/turning-everyday-gadgets-into-bombs-is-a-bad-idea/) on what it means to live in a world where people can turn IoT devices into bombs. His conclusion:

> Not all things that could exist should exist, and some ideas are better left unimplemented. Technology alone has no ethics: the difference between a patch and an exploit is the method in which a technology is disclosed. Exploding batteries have probably been conceived of and tested by spy agencies around the world, but never deployed *en masse* because while it may achieve a tactical win, it is too easy for weaker adversaries to copy the idea and justify its re-deployment in an asymmetric and devastating retaliation.
>
> However, now that I’ve seen it executed, I am left with the terrifying realization that not only is it feasible, it’s relatively easy for any modestly-funded entity to implement. Not just our allies can do this—a wide cast of adversaries have this capability in their reach, from nation-states to cartels and gangs, to shady copycat battery factories just looking for a big payday (if chemical suppliers can moonlight in illicit drugs, what stops battery factories from dealing in bespoke munitions?). Bottom line is: we should approach the public policy debate around this assuming that someday, we could be victims of exploding batteries, too. Turning everyday objects into fragmentation grenades *should* be a crime, as it blurs the line between civilian and military technologies.
>
> I fear that if we do not universally and swiftly condemn the practice of turning everyday gadgets into bombs, we risk legitimizing a military technology that can literally bring the front line of every conflict into your pocket, purse or home.

I got a feeling unnamed marketing official, knowledge or not, doesn’t have long for this world.

That said, besides the fact I think they are lying and she knew, curious how she wouldn’t know “As it turned out, the actual production of the devices was outsourced and made in Israel” given she supposed started her own company, that would be something you would tend to know. I mean I could understand how that would be possible if she was just an employee of a existing front company, even if the CEO, as everyone on the know could simply be lying to you but it’s a bit more incredulous when you supposed started the company yourself. I mean what are the chances the Mossad just randomly found her new company, infiltrated all the key positions, suggested a new product, and then got it approved all without her knowledge as the owner and founder not any other person being the wiser.

Another issue that should be spoken about (but definitely not here) is whether a previously heavily oppressed group should never be criticized. If all attempts to talk about it results in “oh he went THERE” it will be more dfficult to control what happens next. Some sort of a balance and respect is needed toward EVERYONE.

Shocking. The implications of all this will haunt the world for decades.
