Threat actors increasingly deployed web shells against vulnerable web applications and primarily exploited vulnerable or unpatched public-facing applications to gain initial access in Q4, a notable shift from previous quarters. The functionality of the web shells and targeted web applications varied across incidents, highlighting the multitude of ways threat actors can leverage vulnerable web servers as a gateway into a victim’s environment. Prior to this quarter, use of valid accounts had been Cisco Talos Incident Response (Talos IR)’s most observed method of initial access for over a year.

Ransomware made up a slightly smaller portion of threats observed this quarter than in the past. Notably, the end of the year saw a surge of ransomware and pre-ransomware incidents, primarily involving BlackBasta ransomware, suggesting this as a threat to monitor going into 2025.

Watch The Talos Threat Perspective for additional insights into the report, and recommendations for defenders

### **Web shells increasingly observed in adversaries’ post-compromise toolkits**

In 35 percent of incidents in Q4, threat actors deployed a variety of open-source and publicly available web shells against vulnerable or unpatched web applications, a significant increase from less than 10 percent in the [previous quarter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/incident-response-trends-q3-2024/). In one incident, Talos IR observed the adversary uploading a web shell with the file name “401.php”, which was also seen last [quarter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/incident-response-trends-q3-2024/). This PHP web shell is based on the publicly available Neo-regeorg [web shell](https://github.com/L-codes/Neo-reGeorg/tree/master) on GitHub and has been leveraged in several adversaries’ attack chains, according to a CISA [advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-201a). Another incident involved the [web fuzzer](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) Fuzz Faster U Fool, which is used to perform brute force attacks against web applications to discover usernames and passwords and perform directory and virtual host discovery.

Adversaries also leveraged older tools to support their post-compromise objectives, serving as a reminder for organizations to remain vigilant in adding applications to the allowlist/blocklist to control what software operates on their systems. In one incident, the attacker targeted a vulnerable server of JBoss using a [tool](https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss) called JexBoss, which was originally released on Github in 2014 and can be used to test and exploit vulnerabilities in Java platforms. The adversary saved JexBoss as a WAR file, and the contents included a malicious web shell named “jexws4.jsp”.

### **Ransomware trends**

Ransomware, pre-ransomware, and data theft extortion accounted for nearly 30 percent of engagements this quarter, a slight decrease from the previous quarter, in which these types of engagements accounted for 40 percent. Talos IR observed Interlock ransomware for the first time, while also responding to previously seen ransomware variants BlackBasta and RansomHub. Talos IR was able to identify dwell times in the majority of engagements this quarter, which ranged from approximately 17 to 44 days. For example, in the Interlock ransomware incident, it took the adversary 17 days from the initial compromise stage until the deployment of the ransomware encryptor binary. Longer dwell times can indicate that an adversary is trying to expand their access, evade defenses, and/or identify data of interest for exfiltration. For example, in a RansomHub incident this quarter, operators had access to the compromised network for over a month before executing the ransomware and performed actions such as internal network scanning, accessing passwords for backups, and credential harvesting.

Operators leveraged compromised valid accounts in 75 percent of ransomware engagements this quarter to obtain initial access and/or execute ransomware on targeted systems, highlighting the risk of identity-based attacks and the need for secure authentication methods. In a BlackBasta incident, for example, operators posed as the targeted entity’s IT department and used social engineering to gain access to an employee’s account, which consequently facilitated lateral movement into the network. In a RansomHub engagement, affiliates leveraged a compromised Administrator account to execute the ransomware, dump credentials, and run scans using a commercial network scanning tool. Of note, all organizations impacted by ransomware incidents this quarter did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) properly implemented or MFA was bypassed during the attack.

As forecasted in last quarter’s IR quarterly trends [report](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/incident-response-trends-q3-2024/), this quarter featured two RansomHub incidents, in which affiliates leveraged newly identified tools and techniques. Talos IR observed affiliates leveraging a Veeam password stealer to target the Veeam data backup application, and KMS Auto, a tool designed to illicitly activate cracked Microsoft products. The operators also used a previously unseen persistent access technique, modifying Windows Firewall settings on targeted hosts to enable remote access. This activity occurred shortly before the ransomware was executed, potentially as a method to maintain direct access to the compromised systems.
