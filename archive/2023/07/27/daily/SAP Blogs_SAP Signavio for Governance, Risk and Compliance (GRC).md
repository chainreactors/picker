### What is Corporate Governance and GRC?

In today's rapidly changing markets, with evolving regulations and transformations, corporate governance has become more crucial than ever. It is a blend of both legal and factual regulations that provide a framework for the management and supervision of a company. This comprehensive system ensures the company operates in the best interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, and other associated groups.

The Corporate Governance Code, a set of principles, recommendations, and suggestions, serves as a guide for both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. It emphasizes the obligation of these boards to ensure the company's continued existence and its sustainable value creation. This is done in accordance with the principles of the social market economy, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders.

These principles demand more than just legality; they call for ethically founded, responsible behavior. This is encapsulated in the model of the 'honourable businessman', a figure who operates with integrity and respect for the wider corporate interest.

From this Code, we derive the systems for Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) management. GRC is based on the fundamental duty of management to protect the company from harm. As illustrated in the 'House of Governance' model (Three lines of defence), GRC systems form the cornerstone of managing a regulated organization.
![grc house.png](/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/59176iFE10170253DE121A/image-size/medium?v=v2&px=400 "grc house.png")
These systems are audited as part of the annual financial statements and special inspections. This is done to support the management and supervisory bodies in fulfilling their general duties of care.

In the face of unforeseen developments, such as the occurrence of a risk threatening the existence of the company or fraud cases, the effectiveness of these monitoring systems often comes under scrutiny. The internal control system (ICS), compliance management system (CMS), and risk management system (RMS) are at the heart of this corporate governance discussion. The question arises as to whether these systems were appropriately and effectively designed to prevent such incidents.

GRC management is therefore not just a good-to-have; it's a legal requirement for companies. It ensures operational efficiency, risk mitigation, and adherence to legal and regulatory standards. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, legal consequences, and reputational damage.
In essence, effective GRC management is not just important, but mandatory for lawful, ethical, and successful business operations. It's a critical component of corporate governance, helping to safeguard the company's future and ensure its sustainable value creation.

Navigating the complexities of GRC highlights the necessity for an integrated, collaborative, and future-proof approach to process management. It's not just about managing GRC in isolation, but rather aligning it with the broader business processes to ensure a holistic and effective governance strategy. This is where SAP Signavio, a leading tool in the BPM space, becomes instrumental. Signavio offers a unified platform that doesn't just manage GRC, but integrates it seamlessly with all other business processes and functions like a single source of truth. This integration fosters collaboration across the organization, ensuring that GRC management is not a siloed function but a collaborative effort that involves all relevant stakeholders.
