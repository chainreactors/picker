The second cyber attacks timeline of February 2023 is out (first timeline [here](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/02/27/1-15-february-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/)) and with 10.62 events/day confirms the sustained level of activity that is characterizing this first part of 2023.

Ransomware-driven events are stable at 24.6% (34 out of 138 events), whilst 11 events were characterized by the exploitation of vulnerabilities (corresponding to 8% vs 7.7% of the previous timeline), with the massive exploitation of CVE-2021-21974 targeting VMware ESXi servers continuing also in this fortnight.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

In the fintech sector, Platypus and Hope Finance suffered two massive hacks netting a total of more $10M worth to the attackers. Hatch Bank was also hit thanks to the exploitation of the Fortra’s GoAnywhere CVE-2023-0669 zero-day, and the users of Coinbase and Trezor were hit by phishing campaigns.

RailYatri is the mega breach of this month, leading to the compromise of 31 million users.

Ukraine is still targeted by state-sponsored threat actor. In this fortnight a campaign by a threat actor named UAC-0056  was unearthed, using a backdoor implanted on multiple government websites since two years. Meanwhile, in a different side of the planet (Asia), two threat groups were discovered targeting the material research sector (Clasiopa) and COVID-19 research (Hydrochasma). But obviously these are not the only ones discovered in this period.

And last but not least, and once again unsurprisingly, the pro-russian hacktivists were quite active with multiple DDoS campaigns against the websites of several German airports and some hospitals in Denmark (Killnet and their affiliates of Anonymous Sudan), and multiple Italian websites (NoName057(16)). And the pro-Ukraine hacktivists fought back with DDoS attacks against All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK), multiple Russian websites, and also several Radio stations across Russia, broadcasting fake air raid warnings.

But we are now used to the fact that the list is too long to be summarized in few words, so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
