[![Adobe ColdFusion Vulnerability](data:image/png;base64... "Adobe ColdFusion Vulnerability")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjg8T1EAux0KjF2qw7H0gjPvv33p8vffhuoidvlZzQAXU8bJN3Nq5k5bM0kcjuLxKZop93NztZC75oLL4gBZQ0esCjwHeIfb7ItaCyRCe-DegY_7roFlj_V-9jA86hVciMrc8cTkPflp9xUYKw04ig9pO6BNhbFWAf5hCt6clL2R4eWcm80nFGB9SsD/s790-rw-e365/alert.png)

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on March 15 [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/03/15/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog) a security vulnerability impacting Adobe ColdFusion to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.

The critical flaw in question is [CVE-2023-26360](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26360) (CVSS score: 8.6), which could be exploited by a threat actor to achieve arbitrary code execution.

"Adobe ColdFusion contains an improper access control vulnerability that allows for remote code execution," CISA [said](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog).

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

The vulnerability impacts ColdFusion 2018 (Update 15 and earlier versions) and ColdFusion 2021 (Update 5 and earlier versions). It has been addressed in versions Update 16 and Update 6, respectively, released on March 14, 2023.

It's worth noting that CVE-2023-26360 also affects ColdFusion 2016 and ColdFusion 11 installations, both of which are no longer supported by the software company as they have [reached](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/support/programs/eol-matrix.html) end-of-life (EoL).

While the exact details surrounding the nature of the attacks are unknown, Adobe [said](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb23-25.html) in an advisory that it's aware of the flaw being "exploited in the wild in very limited attacks."

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are required to apply the updates by April 5, 2023, to safeguard their networks against potential threats.

Charlie Arehart, a security researcher credited with discovering and reporting the flaw alongside Pete Freitag, [described](https://coldfusion.adobe.com/2023/03/released-coldfusion-2021-and-2018-march-2023-security-updates/#:~:text=To%20folks%20reading,old%20unsupported%20versions.)) it as a "grave" issue that could result in "arbitrary code execution" and "arbitrary file system read."
