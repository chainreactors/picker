## **About**

The project aims to bring the capabilities of SMM x86-64(System Management Mode) to usermode through a backdoor. The backdoor is triggered through a syscall that invokes an SMI on most systems.
This way, you can easily control the number of times the backdoor is triggered. The project consists of 2 modules.
One SMM driver that has a registered SMI root handler and a normal usermode application that invokes the SMI's and dictates what information to be transceived.

SMM is an operating mode on the x86-64 processor with one of the highest privilege levels in the entire system.
SMM is built to be isolated and lower privilege should not be aware of its operations.
This isolation is done by waiting for all cores to rendezvous inside SMM before handling System...
