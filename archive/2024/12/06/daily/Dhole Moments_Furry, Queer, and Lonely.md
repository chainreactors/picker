What is it about being queer that makes loneliness, isolation, and rejection so much more intense than enduring than what our straight friends and family purport to experience?

Are we just being sensitive, or egoistic? Do they perhaps feel these emotions with the same severity as we do, but are better at coping with it? Or are they perhaps just made of tougher stock than us?

Much yarn has been spun in recent years of the loneliness epidemic–especially concerning male loneliness.

News outlets, magazines, and blogs discuss incels with the same faux empathy as a national geographic narrator describing a gazelle that’s about to become a lioness’ dinner, all whilst trying to side-step the glaring vitriol that festers in communities that self-identify as such, which really makes it hard for anyone involved to stomach.

> For context, incels are straight men that want to have sex with women, but are unable to.

> If it were **just** that, it would be an unfortunate problem with an easy solution: Learn social skills and a healthier mentality, then mingle with promiscuous, available women.
>
> Instead, they’re plagued by [pick-up-artists and manosphere grifters](https://soatok.blog/2021/01/25/no-youre-not-a-sigma-male/) that try to press their anger buttons. And what they have become is something universally recognized as worse. They’re misogynistic to a cartoonish degree. They confront their feelings of inadequacy and insecurity by rejecting reason and proclaiming themselves superior to the female gender. They decry sluts and sexual promiscuity. They scorn men who are able to have sex, and yet want their power.

Where has all of this angst and social isolation come from, and why is it seemingly affecting everyone?

It’s complicated. Just to name a few factors:

1. Social media and the impulse to be inauthentic to elevate one’s own esteem; to share highlights, not behind-the-scenes footage; to elate one’s own status and vie for the respect and admiration of others.
2. Recommendation algorithms, which prioritize content that keeps eyeballs on apps long enough to be served advertising.
3. The advertising and data broker industry, and the enshittification they conjure.
4. Our economic and political systems, which reward the advertisers, marketers, and financiers that play with people’s emotional levers in order to extract more profit from us all; and do not hold them meaningfully accountably when they misuse their power or influence to harm the masses.

   After all, when a person shoots the CEO of United HealthCare in a Manhattan street, there’s a manhunt of epic proportions to identify and arrest them. So the joke goes: Brian Thompson’s death has gotten more coverage than United HealthCare ever provided.

   But when Martin Shkreli raises the cost of drugs by several thousand percent for purely selfish reasons, and many poor people die as a result of losing access to affordable treatments? Well, that’s just business. Nothing to see here.
5. Rapid technological growth coupled with the downside of fungible humanity, which is only likely to be exacerbated by corporations embracing Large Language Models.
6. Purely natural reasons, like hormones, sunlight, and seasonal depression.
7. A noted increase in natural disasters due to anthropogenic climate change.
8. Targeted misinformation and disinformation campaigns from other nations directly against citizens, rather than military targets.

This is by no means an exhaustive list.

And if you take a step back from some of these causes, and squint at it, it’s pretty clear what the root causes are.

**Money** and **power**.

Queer people, at large, lack both of these things.

## Dearth of Hearth

When queer people reveal themselves to their families–especially families with generational wealth and strong “traditional” values–they tend to get cut out of their inheritance and ostracized (if they had any at all).

The incentive structure here is clear: If you want to inherit money or power, you will remain closeted.

Incentive structures like this are present at all level of society, too. It doesn’t just affect the upper class: Many working-class queer people do not want their bosses or coworkers to know their identity, for fear it will be used against them.

(This is undoubtedly more extreme for trans people, who cannot hide their transness in person until years into their transition.)

So we create online communities, where we can be ourselves without these downsides.

And then, well, you already read the list of bad things above.

Is it any wonder that anti-capitalism is extremely enticing for queer people? To believe there can be no queer liberation without class consciousness; without a challenging of tradition and hierarchies?

You could argue that queer people find loneliness and related emotions more than the rest of the population through simple statistics: There are fewer of us, and we’re not all queer in compatible ways. It’s a multidimensional matrix of identity, none of which fit neatly into the normal buckets of “man seeking wife” and “woman seeking husband.”

If male loneliness truly is an epidemic–to the point that incels are an occasional talking point–despite the abundance and distribution of straight women throughout the populace, why would anyone expect queer people to be better off?

## It gets better, but…

There’s a storytelling effort called “[It Gets Better](https://itgetsbetter.org/),” which aims to give LGBTQ+ youth hope for their future.

The idea is, if they can hear the stories of older queer people, the struggles they faced, and how much better their lives are now, they’ll realize that being queer doesn’t mean you’re doomed to suffer more than you can cope with. And just maybe they won’t choose to die, instead.

It’s a damn good project, but their slogan’s only half the story.

**It gets better, but we have to make it better.**
