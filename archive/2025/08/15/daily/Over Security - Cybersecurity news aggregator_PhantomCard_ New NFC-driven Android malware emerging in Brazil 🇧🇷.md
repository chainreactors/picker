## PhantomCard: New NFC-driven Android malware emerging in Brazil üáßüá∑

### Jump to

Our Mobile Threat Intelligence service is monitoring NFC-relay threats and tactics since the discovery of NFSkate (aka NGate) in March 2024. [Ghost Tap](/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay) became another milestone on the evolution of NFC-based attacks, where cybercriminals are using NFC relay for cash-out purposes.

Since then, mobile threat landscape has been invaded by several threat actor groups introducing their own tools to perform malicious relay of NFC data of victim‚Äôs card to fraudster‚Äôs device. The appearance of different malicious implementations serves as an indicator of rising interest and demand amongst cybercriminals for the tools capable of NFC relay fraud.

One of the recent discoveries made by ThreatFabric's analysts continues this trend. In this report we introduce¬†PhantomCard¬†- a new Android NFC-based Trojan targeting banking customers in Brazil and potentially expanding globally. Key takeaways are:

* PhantomCard relays NFC data from victim's banking card to fraudster's device
* PhantomCard is based on Chinese-originating **NFC relay Malware-as-a-Service**
* The actor behind the malware is a "serial" reseller of Android threats **active in Brazil**
* PhantomCard is delivered via fake "Google Play" web-pages **mimicking apps for "card protection"**

## PhantomCard - Ghost in the Pocket

ThreatFabric's researchers were monitoring the activity of "Go1ano developer" threat actor known for targeting Brazilian mobile banking users. In July 2025 this actor announced "GHOST NFC CARD" - a new malware able to relay NFC data from victim's card. Our researchers were able to identify and analyse the samples of this malware that we dubbed "PhantomCard" to not interfere with Ghost Card fraud which is related to fictitious card data used in unauthorized transactions. PhantomCard is not related to it and is used for relaying the NFC data from victim's card to the cybercriminal's device.

## Distribution and Modus Operandi

Mobile Threat Intelligence service has identified a campaign by PhantomCard targeting Brazilian users. In this campaign, PhantomCard masquerades as ‚ÄúProte√ß√£o Cart√µes‚Äù (‚ÄúCard Protection‚Äù) application and is distributed via fake Google Play pages:

![Slide2-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-5192-PM](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slide2-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-5192-PM.png?width=3840&height=2160&name=Slide2-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-5192-PM.png)

Notably, the page also contains fake positive reviews that help to convince victims into installing the malware, referring to successfully blocked scam attempts block:

"*Excellent! I received a suspicious activity warning that turned out to be a scam attempt. I was able to act immediately and avoid any losses. I recommend it to everyone who uses a card on a daily basis.*"

When installed, PhantomCard does not require any additional permissions to be explicitly given by the user and is ready to perform the malicious operations. First, PhantomCard asks victim to present a card:

![phantomcard-step-1](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/phantomcard-step-1.png?width=574&height=440&name=phantomcard-step-1.png)

*Translation from Portuguese (Brazil): Tap your card. Place your card on the back of your phone to begin the verification process.*

When the card is detected, the screen will change:

![phantomcard-step-2](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/phantomcard-step-2.png?width=575&height=488&name=phantomcard-step-2.png)

*Translation from Portuguese (Brazil): ¬†Card Detected! Keep the card nearby until authentication is complete.*

At this moment NFC data is ready to be transmitted to the cybercriminal‚Äôs device and further used for payment or at ATM by them. The data is transmitted via the NFC relay server under criminals‚Äô control.

As a next step, PhantomCard will request PIN code to provide it to fraudster to authenticate the transaction (if needed):

![phantomcard-step-3](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/phantomcard-step-3.png?width=402&height=636&name=phantomcard-step-3.png)![phantomcard-step-4](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/phantomcard-step-4.png?width=401&height=321&name=phantomcard-step-4.png)

*Translation from Portuguese (Brazil):*

1. *Enter your password. For security reasons, enter your 4-digit password to confirm verification. Is your password 6 digits long? Activate the option below to enter 6 digits.*
2. *.. Your card is being verified, please wait for the process to complete. Synchronizing with the bank... Verifying security...*

¬†As a result, PhantomCard establishes a channel between victim‚Äôs physical card and POS terminal / ATM that cybercriminal is next to. It allows cybercriminal to use victim‚Äôs card as if it was in their hands. The following screenshots are taken from the video shared by the actor on Telegram channel, demonstrating PhantomCard operation:

¬†*On the right: fraudster paying with the relayed card at POS terminal.*

## Examining the roots

While analysing PhantomCard malware, our analysts identified that the actor selling PhantomCard is not the actual developer of the malware. Source code reveals lots of debug messages in Chinese as well as package name referring to "NFU Pay" Malware-as-a-Service promoted on Telegram:

![Slide4-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-3299-PM](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slide4-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-3299-PM.png?width=3840&height=2160&name=Slide4-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-3299-PM.png)

"NFU Pay" is one of the several services available on the underground market similar to SuperCardX, KingNFC, X/Z/TX-NFC, etc. Thus, we conclude that ‚ÄúGo1ano Developer‚Äù purchased a customised version of PhantomCard from ‚ÄúNFU Pay‚Äù and started providing it as Malware-as-a-Service, already masqueraded to target users of mobile banking.

![Slide5-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-8937-PM](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slide5-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-8937-PM.png?width=3840&height=2160&name=Slide5-Aug-11-2025-04-27-58-8937-PM.png)

Customisability of "NFU Pay", service underlying PhantomCard malware, poses a global risk. Our analysts also identified indicators showing that PhantomCard is a tailor-made threat for Brazilian market, while there could be more. One of the endpoints on ...
