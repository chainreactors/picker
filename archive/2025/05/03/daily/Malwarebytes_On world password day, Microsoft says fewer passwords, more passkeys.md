# On world password day, Microsoft says fewer passwords, more passkeys

Posted: May 2, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

And we agree. If there is a cybersecurity themed day that we would like to get rid as soon as possible it’s world password day. Sorry, old friend, but you’re outdated, and it looks like your days are numbered. Let’s switch to passkeys.

To quote [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/):

> “As the world shifts from passwords to passkeys, we’re excited to join the [FIDO Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/) in leaving World Password Day behind to celebrate the very first World [Passkey](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/passkey) Day.”

In 2013, Intel introduced World Password Day to remind people of the importance of strong passwords. But over time, the number of passwords we use, and the necessary strengths have grown so much that the system has become practically unusable without a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager). So, only a few years later, Microsoft introduced [Windows Hello](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/tips/windows-hello), a new way for users to securely sign in to their accounts with their face, fingerprint, or PIN.

For several good reasons we want to say goodbye to passwords, especially for the important sites and services. Passwords are:

* Hard to create
* Easy to forget
* Often reused across sites
* Vulnerable to [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) techniques like brute-force attacks and [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing).

## The alternative: passkeys

Passkeys are an alternative, more modern [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) method designed to replace passwords with a safer, simpler alternative. Despite their clear advantages, many people hesitate to switch to passkeys due to unfamiliarity and misconceptions. This blog post will try to explain what passkeys are, how to use them, and why they are better than passwords, helping you embrace this next step in [online security](https://www.malwarebytes.com/internet-security).

A passkey is a digital credential that replaces traditional passwords by using cryptographic keys stored locally, and securely, on your device, such as your phone or computer.

At your demand, a program on your device will create a passkey automatically when you set up an account or enable a passkey login. Basically, it’s a unique key that identifies you without ever leaving your device.

When you log in with a passkey, your device proves you are the legitimate user by using the passkey to solve a challenge without actually providing the passkey itself. As with passwords, it’s a way to prove you know the answer and with that who you are. But the difference is that, unlike passwords, passkeys can’t be stolen by fake or malicious websites.

OK. I heard some sighs in the back from the I-know-this-already crowd. There are plenty of [technical explanations](https://www.passkeys.com/what-are-passkeys) to be found. Feel free to try explaining cryptographic public and private keys to the people you do tech support for.

Because passkeys are tied to your device and cannot be shared or stolen like passwords, they offer a safer login expe...
