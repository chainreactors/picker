# Your Meta AI chats might be public, and it’s not a bug

Posted: June 13, 2025

Conversations that people are having with the Meta [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) app are being exposed publicly, often without the users realizing it, revealing a variety of medical, legal, and private matters. The standalone app and the company’s integrations with [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) (AI) across its platforms—Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—are now facing significant scrutiny for such privacy lapses.

The past two years have seen an explosion in generative AI tools, such as [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security), Anthropic’s Claude, Google Gemini, and more. But with new players entering the market almost daily, not all of them deserve the same level of trust.

With [1 billion active monthly users](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/zuckerberg-meta-ai-one-billion-monthly-users.html), Meta AI is one of the contenders aiming for ChatGPT’s crown. To monetize this success, Meta’s CEO Zuckerberg said “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or offer “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute.”

Similar to ChatGPT, Meta AI can generate text, answer questions, and help users plan, brainstorm, and strategize on various issues. But when using the Meta AI app, after submitting a question, users can also press a “share” button, which directs them to a screen showing a preview of the post, which users can then publish. But some users appear blissfully unaware that they are sharing these text conversations, audio clips, and images **publicly** with the world.

Other users can access “shared” conversations by using the apps Discover feed.

With only one glance at that feed, I found this example of a conversation the user might not have wanted to be publicly visible. A teacher shared an email thread regarding their upcoming arbitration of a job termination that felt unjust. The Meta AI app responded:

![example of a teacher sharing a story of unfair termination](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/image.jpg)
> “Hello {name}, it’s great to hear from you again. I can sense the emotional weight of revisiting this experience, and **I appreciate your trust in sharing it with me**. It sounds like a really tough situation, and I’m here to listen and support you as you process it. No rush, take your time to gather your thoughts, and we can continue the conversation whenever you’re ready. How’s the preparation for the arbitration going so far?”

The emphasis is by me. If the AI realizes how much trust it takes to share that story with anyone, even if it’s only a [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot), then how must it feel when the user finds out the whole world can find and read it. I didn’t even have to log in to find this conversation.

[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/the-meta-ai-app-is-a-privacy-disaster/) reported about people asking for help with tax evasion and other personal matters, calling Meta AI a “privacy disaster.” Many sources found threads about medical topics, and other conversations about delicate and private issues.

What people may not realize is that if they use the integrated versions on social media, they are logged in and their conversation can be tied t...
