# Connected contraptions cause conniption for 2024

Posted: December 31, 2024
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

The holidays are upon us, which means now is the perfect time for gratitude, warmth, and—because modern society has thrust it upon us—gift buying.

It’s Bluey and dig kits and LEGOs for kids, Fortnite and AirPods and backpacks for tweens, and, for an adult you particularly love, it’s televisions, air fryers, e-readers, vacuums, dog-feeders, and more, which all seemingly require a mobile app to function.

“The Internet of Things” is the now-accepted term to describe countless home products that connect to the internet so that they can be controlled and monitored from a mobile app or from a web browser on your computer. The benefits are obvious for shoppers. Thermostats can be turned off during vacation, home doorbells can be answered while at work, and gaming consoles can download videogames as children sleep on Christmas Eve.

And while some of these internet-connected smart devices can sound a little dumb—cue the $400 “smart juicer” that a [Bloomberg reporter outperformed with her bare hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lutHF5HhVA)—there are legitimate cybersecurity risks at hand. Capable of collecting data and connecting to the internet, smart devices can also fall victim to leaking that data to [hackers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) online.

As we enter the new year, Malwarebytes Labs is looking back at some of the strangest, scariest, and most dumbfounding smart device stories this past year. Read on and enjoy.

## **The million-car track hack**

The latest vehicles filling up the local car lot might not strike you as “smart devices,” but upon closer inspection, these cars, SUVs, trucks, and minivans absolutely are. Replete with cameras and sensors that can track location, speed, distance travelled, seatbelt use, and even a driver’s eye movements, modern vehicles are, [as many have described them](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/technology/regulators-investigate-carmakers-driver-tracking.html), “smartphones on wheels.”

For years, the cybersecurity of these particularly mobile mobiles (sorry) was passable.

When a group of security researchers hacked into a Jeep Cherokee’s steering and braking systems in 2014, they were building off earlier research that required the hacker’s laptop to be physically connected to the Jeep itself—a comforting reality when imagining shadowy cybercriminals wresting control from a driver while sat behind a computer console hundreds of miles away. And while the security researchers were able to eventually hack the Jeep Cherokee without a physical connection, the work involved was still robust.

But early this year, a separate group of security researchers [revealed](https://samcurry.net/hacking-kia) that they could [remotely lock, unlock, start, turn off, and geolocate more than a million Kia vehicles](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/millions-of-kia-vehicles-were-vulnerable-to-remote-attacks-with-just-a-license-plate-number) by knowing nothing more than the vehicle’s license plate number. The researchers could also activate a vehicle’s horn, lights, and camera.

The vulnerability wasn’t in the vehicles themselves, but in Kia’s online infrastructure (Kia fixed the vulnerability before the researchers published their findings).

In short, the researchers posed as Kia *deale...
