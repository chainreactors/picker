# Ukraine says Russian hackers are targeting country’s defense contractors

Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) [said in a report](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6281632) published over the weekend that a hacking group has been targeting the country’s defense and military companies with phishing attacks.

The CERT identified the hacking group as UAC-0185 — also known as UNC4221 — without saying who was behind the group. Earlier this year, however, a cybersecurity company [linked that group](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/labscon-2024-security-research-in-real-time-talks-not-to-miss/) to the Russian government.

#### Contact Us

Do you have more information about cyberattacks against Ukraine? Or other attacks carried out by Russian government hackers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email. You also can contact TechCrunch via [SecureDrop](https://techcrunch.com/got-a-tip/).

The hackers have been sending emails pretending to be the Ukrainian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs ([ULIE](https://uspp.ua/en/about-ulie)), which calls itself “Ukraine’s largest union of business organizations and economic agents.” The emails were designed to look like an invitation to a real conference that took place in Kyiv last week, and were sent ahead of the conference, according to CERT-UA.

The hackers are targeting employees working for Ukraine’s defense contractors and defense forces, per CERT-UA.

Cybersecurity publication The Record [has more details](https://therecord.media/suspected-russian-hackers-target-ukrainian-enterprises-espionage) about this hacking campaign and group.
