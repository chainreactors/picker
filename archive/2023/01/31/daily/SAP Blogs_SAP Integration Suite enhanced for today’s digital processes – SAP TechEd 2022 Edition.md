# 1. Newest Innovations of SAP Integration Suite

**Hybrid Deployment Option:**

**Beta release of "Edge Integration Cell**“ in Q4/2023\*, as on-premise version of the new integration runtime “Integration Cell”

* Supports 3 integration use cases: Classic on-premise process orchestration, on-premise API-led integrations including a policy engine, as well as event-driven integrations by an on-premise event bridge to integrate event brokers from SAP and non-SAP (**GA** is planned for 2023\*)

**Release of the SAP** **Process Integration / Process Orchestration to** **SAP Integration Suite migration tool** in Jan 2023, which automates the migration based on integration flow templates. Kindly see [Migration tool in Cloud Integration Capability of SAP Integration Suite | SAP Blogs](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/migration-tool-in-cloud-integration-capability-of-sap-integration-suite/) and [Elevate from SAP Process Orchestration and Modernize your integration platform with SAP Integration ...](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/30/elevate-from-sap-process-orchestration-and-modernize-your-integration-platform-with-sap-integration-suite/?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed)

* Additionally, a self-service **Migration Assessment tool** supports the customers to estimate the migration effort, check for technical showstoppers and provide possible workarounds. Kindly see [Migration Assessment | SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATION_SUITE/51ab953548be4459bfe8539ecaeee98d/5c5e50ee2d644cc59d864409d5b7871c.html?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT&version=CLOUD) (and our blog posts: [Automatically assess your migration from SAP Process Orchestration Systems to SAP Integration Suite ...](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/30/automatically-assess-your-migration-from-sap-process-orchestration-systems-to-sap-integration-suite-with-the-new-migration-assessment-capability/?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed) and [Enablement guide for SAP Integration Suite Migration Assessment Capability | SAP Blogs](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/enablement-guide-for-sap-integration-suite-migration-assessment-capability/?source=email-global-notification-bp-new-in-tag-followed)).
