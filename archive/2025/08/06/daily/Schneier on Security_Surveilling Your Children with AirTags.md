**Is the Global MSM to blame?**

Is a question I find myself asking not just more and more frequently but when ever I hear parents doing what would have caused surprise, shock and consternation in my parents.

And no it’s not just “helicopter parenting” which usually comes about for two reasons, one of which is the social disapproval by other parents (parents of any child with the now numerous mental disabilities will know this social horror for what it is “discrimination”).

We get to hear of parents being criminalised because they did not cover their children with SPF50 enough to please some incompetent and similar.

Curious children in new and interesting places will scoot away from parents and it’s actually a sign of intelligence in the child, a desire to learn and know. But to the Guard Labour types it is seen as heinous dereliction of parental duties in part because it’s a crime that has now comeback if they allege it.

Why do they get away with such false accusations, well in part it’s the Global MSM. They have a business policy towards profit, thus they have to attract eyeballs, to get advertising money. How to get eyeballs, well to not go through all the steps much profit is earned by,

“If it bleeds it leads”

The actual figures show that “child abduction” is incredibly rare by population size and their are other factors that need to be in place before it happens.

Thus a child scooting off in the zoo to get a better look at the penguins is not unexpected and almost predictable. But the odds of it being an abduction are so small the chances are it will never happen to you, anyone you know, or anyone they know or anyone in your home town / city.

Yet fear, uncertainty, and doubt “sell product” when pushed with “dog whistle” memes such as “think of the children”

And as we know Politicians just love their dog whistles[1] and people in the UK are genuinely in fear that what they say will get the a late night “knock on the door” and “excessive prison sentences”. Under what is now called “two tier justice” and is seen as political authoritarian behaviour by successive UK Governments that became more than noticable under Boris Johnson when the “Covid Crisis” enabled him to push through highly questionable legislation.

So parents, under fear of authoritarians using “Might is Right” policing not just enabled but driven on by the Global MSM are getting bullet proof backpacks mobile phones with tracking apps and now air-tag ready shoes, just so they can be seen as “behaving as responsible parents”…

[1] The UK technology minister Peter Kyle who is an unsavoury individual at best, has very recently accused anyone who questions the “Online Safety Act”(OSA) as being the equivalent of a child molester. The OSA is Something that Elon Musk has indicated is unwarranted overly broad censorship and a restriction on free speech.

“Since Skechers only makes this product in kids’ sizes, it’s unlikely that these shoes could be used to surveil adults against their will”

Is it just me or am I the only one who doesn’t recall being bestowed my own will at my 18th birthday party? Of course, this is a nit with the editing of the article and not the technology itself. What’s your guess on the over/under on how long it’ll be before a non-custodial parent abuses this?

@Clive, All: there is another massive risk: that children start to treat their parents as “the enemy”. Kids naturally rebel, it’s part of growing up and is a solid part of the challenge of being a wise parent. But the moment you start surveilling kids as if they are spies or criminals you fall into deep shit.

Why? Just stick a peace sign sticker on the front and a pin on the back and they’ll wear it proudly. Or if you want, use an ‘I Hate my parents’ sticker.

If you’re really serious, you’ll have them implanted with a pet tracker before they leave the nenonatal care ward.

@Clive, to be clear – I agree with you!

I can’t wait for when the children start swapping AirTags to just confuse their parents.

I remember when American culture ridiculed societies that didn’t allow anonymous travel. Now a days most people think all adults carry a tracking device with them all of the time.

@ Chris,

With regards,

> “only makes this product in kids’ sizes”

Two issues,

1, For now, if they become a success than other designs and sizes will probably come along, and may not be “kids sizes” (if you believe TV, what dad would not want to bug his teenage daughters stilettos…).

2, Some adults still get into “kids sizes” a friend has a Brazilian wife, who passes herself of as a Portuguese teenager because she can wear the larger kids sizes and thus gets to save quite a bit on sales tax etc. Fun thing her teenage daughter has inherited from her dads side and is well over a foot taller than her mum but looks even more slender thus can fit into some kids clothing...
