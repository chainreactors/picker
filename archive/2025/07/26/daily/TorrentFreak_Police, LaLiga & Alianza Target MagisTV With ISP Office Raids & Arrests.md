Top-tier Spanish football league LaLiga and Latin American anti-piracy group Alianza have joined forces to maintain the pressure on illegal IPTV service Magis TV. In conjunction with law enforcement partners in Argentina, multiple arrest warrants were executed in five regions against local sellers of premium Magis TV packages. Two of the locations targeted are operated by a local internet service provider; reports indicate that the owner of the ISP is now considered a fugitive.

With around 400 million Spanish speakers and tens of millions of passionate football fans, Latin America is a natural overseas market for top-tier Spanish football league LaLiga.

At least initially market prospects look quite good. Data reported in 2023 by LATAM-focused anti-piracy group Alianza (DirecTV, SimpleTV, SKY Brasil, Warner, Disney, LaLiga & [more](https://alianzaaudiovisual.net/nosotros.php)) around 98.2m households in the region have access to broadband.

The fly in the ointment is that an estimated 40 million of those households engage in piracy. Within Argentina’s 11.3 million broadband-enabled households, 4.8 million households have a penchant for piracy, a 42.6% piracy rate overall. That’s not quite as bad as Mexico (46%) and nowhere near Ecuador’s overall rate (58.6%) but somehow significantly worse than Brazil (38.4%).

## LaLiga & Alianza Target #1 LATAM IPTV Menace, MagisTV

In an announcement Thursday, LaLiga reported relatively rare success in Argentina after teaming up with Alianza and local law enforcement. Under the authority of orders issued by the Juzgado de Garantias Nº 4 (Court of Guarantees No. 4) of San Isidro, as part of a legal process in which LaLiga is a plaintiff, local distributors of MagisTV subscriptions were targeted in several regions of Argentina.

The orders were signed by Judge Esteban Rossignoli, who [recently ordered](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/seguridad/bloquearon-en-vivo-sitios-y-apps-que-transmitian-partidos-de-futbol-de-manera-ilegal-nid02062025/?utm_source=appln/) local ISPs to carry out live blocking to protect the Champions League and Argentine League finals.

LaLiga reports that after the Court issued multiple arrest warrants, Argentine Federal Police and local forces conducted five simultaneous raids that led to the execution of arrest warrants in Chubut, Mendoza, and Río Negro.

Assistance was provided by LATAM online market Mercado Libre and payment platform Mercado Pago, both of which receive praise from LaLiga for their contribution. Several years ago the former was itself declared a Notorious Market for failure to tackle infringement, but since its removal from the list in 2021, there’s been no looking back.

## Local ISP Allegedly Acted as a MagisTV Sales Outlet

LaLiga reports that one of the main targets was local internet service provider UV Mundo Digital. With offices in Trelew and Rawson in the province of Chubut, it appears that those two locations were targeted in the operation. LaLiga claims that the ISP sells subscriptions to MagisTV Pro, promoting the packages on a website (still online), social media, and in its retail stores, “under the guise of legality.”

During the course of the investigation, police reportedly visited UV Mundo Digital’s premises and were informed that in addition to regular packages, they could also offer a “different internet service and different cable service, installed by a third party with a different price.” A provided booklet reportedly concerned MagisTV Pro.

LaLiga’s criticism of the ISP and CABASE (the [non-profit association](https://www.cabase.org.ar/en/the-chamber/) it’s a member of), sits in stark contrast to the warm words used to describe companies that are actively collaborating.

“This type of operation demonstrates that CABASE is influenced by some ISPs that violate legal standards related to audiovisual fraud and others that refuse to comply with judicial orders,” says Javier Tebas, president of LALIGA.

“We are very satisfied with the collaboration of ALIANZA and LALIGA, as well as with entities like Mercado Libre, which have supported the investigation. We firmly believe that collaboration is key to eradicating audiovisual fraud.”

## More Arrests to Come

LaLiga says the authorities have requested the arrest of four individuals identified as “key operators” in the distribution of MagisTV Pro. They used accounts at Naranja X and Binance, and may not have anticipated that using the services of Mercado Pago was a mistake. It’s alleged that some accounts accumulated amounts exceeding 160 million Argentine peso, around US$125,000

“All of them were directly linked to the sale of illegal accounts through banking evidence, IP address records, and messages extracted from messaging applications,” Spain’s top football league reveals.

Whether collaborating with LaLiga and Alianza will help to remove Argentina from the USTR’s Priority Watchlist remains to be seen. However, for UV Mundo Digital owner Ulises Jorge Velázquez, the situation seems to be deteriorating. He’s now considered a fugitive with a warrant out for his arrest.

According to a La Nacion [report](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/seguridad/un-empresario-proveedor-de-internet-esta-acusado-de-revender-magistv-el-mayor-sitio-de-tv-pirata-nid24072025/), the alleged duration of offending appears to be quite short.

“From at least January 1st until the 7th [of July 2025], Velázquez and the other suspects offered Magis TV Pro accounts for sale, with monthly payments, to distribute television signals without proper authorization,” Prosecutor Musso wrote in a request for the suspects to be arrested.

“The APK (Android application) operates in clear violation of the rights of the owners of the works. All of this was done through the website www.magispro.lat and WhatsApp contacts associated with them, with monthly payments made through transfers to virtual wallet accounts and even through crypto assets,” he continued.

“Based on the evidence presented, I interpret this criminal act as constituting the crime of infringement of intellectual property law,” the Prosecutor added.
