# Your location or browsing habits could lead to price increases when buying online

Posted: January 20, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Companies are showing customers different prices for the same goods and services based what data they have on them, including details like their precise location or browser history.

The name for this method is surveillance pricing, and the [FTC has just released initial findings of a report](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-surveillance-pricing-study-indicates-wide-range-personal-data-used-set-individualized-consumer) looking into that practice. In July 2024, the FTC requested information from eight companies offering surveillance pricing products and services that incorporate data about consumers’ characteristics and behavior.

The goal was to get a better understanding of the “shadowy market” that third-party intermediaries use to set individualized prices for products and services based on consumers’ characteristics and behaviors, like location, demographics, browsing patterns, and shopping history.

Speaking to staff at these firms, the FTC found that behaviors ranging from mouse movements on a webpage to the type of products that consumers leave in an online shopping cart without clicking Buy can be tracked and used by retailers to tailor consumer pricing.

The intermediaries claimed they used advanced algorithms, [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai), and other technologies, along with [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) about consumers to determine targeted prices.

![How surveillance pricing can be investigated](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/surveillance-proicing.jpg)

FTC chair Lina M. Khan said:

>  “Americans deserve to know whether businesses are using detailed consumer data to deploy surveillance pricing, and the FTC’s inquiry will shed light on this shadowy ecosystem of pricing middlemen.”

The first priorities to investigate are:

* The types of products and services engaged in surveillance pricing
* Data sources and who collected them
* Who the potential customers are
* How surveillance pricing impacted the prices offered to these customers.

This is nothing new, we’ve seen numerous times that [insurance companies are very interested in our lifestyle](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/01/insurance-company-accused-of-using-secret-software-to-illegally-collect-and-sell-location-data-on-millions-of-americans) and will happily charge more or even refuse to take us in as customers if they think we’re too much of a risk.

But, needless to say, surveillance pricing can have serious consequences, not only for our privacy, but also for fair competition and for consumer protection.

Probably the most shocking thing is the type of information that could be involved. The FTC notes that some of these companies even created lists of people suffering from diseases for the purpose of targeting them with offers for ineffective or worthless cures. This makes the introduction of a bill saying [data brokers should stop trading health and location data](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/data-brokers-should-stop-trading-health-and-location-data-new-bill-proposes) perfectly understandable.
