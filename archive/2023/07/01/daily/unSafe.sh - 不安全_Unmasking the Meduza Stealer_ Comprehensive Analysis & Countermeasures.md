Recently, while monitoring dark web forums and Telegram channels, the Uptycs Threat Research team made a compelling discovery: a formidable menace dubbed The Meduza Stealer.

Crafted by an enigmatic actor known as 'Meduza', this malware has been specifically designed to target Windows users and organizations, currently sparing only ten specific countries from its reach.

The Meduza Stealer has a singular objective: comprehensive data theft. It pilfers users' browsing activities, extracting a wide array of browser-related data. From critical login credentials to the valuable record of browsing history and meticulously curated bookmarks, no digital artifact is safe. Even crypto wallet extensions, password managers, and 2FA extensions are vulnerable.

Left unchecked, the consequences for those affected could be severe, including financial losses and the potential for large-scale data breaches that can have far-reaching implications for organizations.

While Meduza may be a recent addition to the realm of cybercrime and no specific attacks have been attributed to date, the risks it poses shouldn't be underestimated.

To proactively address this emerging threat, Uptycs has taken action by incorporating a [YARA rule](#yararule) into our product. This integration empowers us to conduct thorough memory scanning, enabling swift detection and effective mitigation of the Meduza threat.

What sets Meduza apart is its evolving nature. Our conversations with the malware's administrator highlight that it is not simply another run-of-the-mill ransomware, but an actively developed tool, poised for the potential addition of new features. The malware admin did explicitly state that their operations do not involve any ransom activities and that their sole focus is on functioning as a stealer. Currently, Meduza can avoid detection in [certain countries](#exclusionlist) and prevent execution if the attacker's server is unreachable, making it an extremely stealth cybersecurity threat.

The Uptycs threat research team’s analysis of the Meduza stealer reveals its distribution methods, capabilities, potential impact, and highlights their concerted efforts to counter this threat.

## Marketing and Distribution Tactics of Meduza Stealer

The administrator of the Meduza stealer has been employing sophisticated marketing strategies to promote this malicious offering. In a calculated move to gain trust and confidence, they have initiated static and dynamic scans of the Meduza stealer file using some of the industry's most reputable antivirus software. Screenshots were then shared demonstrating that this potent malware could evade detection by these top-tier antivirus solutions.

What makes Meduza stealer particularly crafty is its operational design. This binary does not employ obfuscation techniques, a common practice among similar threats, making it harder to identify and trace. Additionally, it seeks to establish a connection with the attacker's server before it commences the theft of data from victim machines. If this connection fails, it terminates promptly, further complicating attempts to trace its activities.

The marketing efforts didn't stop at proving the malware's efficacy. As shown in Figure 1, the administrator has been advertising the Meduza stealer aggressively via cybercrime forums and Telegram channels.

What's more concerning is that a large portion of antivirus software has proven ineffective against the Meduza stealer binary, either failing to detect it statically or dynamically. (Fig. 2, Fig. 3).

But the real game-changer in their marketing strategy has been the pricing model and the added control provided to subscribers. To attract potential customers, the administrator offers access to the stolen data through a user-friendly web panel (Fig.4). They present different subscription options, including a one-month, three-month, and lifetime access plan, each with its own price point.

Inside this web panel, subscribers can craft their customized binary options. The panel offers a wealth of information, including IP addresses, geographical data, OS build names, and even the count of stored passwords, wallets, and cookies. This feature allows subscribers to download or delete the stolen data directly from the web page, granting them an unprecedented level of control over their ill-gotten information. This in-depth feature set showcases the sophisticated nature of the Meduza stealer and the lengths its creators are willing to go to ensure its success.

## Meduza stealer's work flow

The Meduza Stealer initiates its operations once it successfully infiltrates a machine. The first step it performs is a geolocation check. If the victim's location is in the stealer's predefined list of [excluded countries](#exclusionlist), the malware operation is immediately aborted. However, if the location isn't on the list, Meduza Stealer checks if the attacker's server is active. In case the server isn't accessible, the stealer also promptly terminates its activity. If both conditions—location check and server accessibility—are favorable, the stealer proceeds to gather extensive information. This includes collecting system information, browser data, password manager details, mining-related registry information, and details about installed games. Once this comprehensive set of data is gathered, it is packaged and uploaded, ready to be dispatched to the attacker's server, thereby completing the stealer's operation within the infected machine. See Figure 5.

Additionally, it's important to highlight the variety of data that the malware collects - system info, browser info, password manager info, miner related registry info, and installed games info. This demonstrates the broad potential impact of an infection, as it targets not only personal and financial data, but also system-specific and potentially proprietary information. Lastly, the swift uploading and transferring of the collected data to the attacker's server accentuates the speed at which a breach can occur and the urgent need for effective detection and protection measures.
