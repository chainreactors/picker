"Espionage Campaign")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqcjyJmrFD57hhO8h62-lFFxjqrFM6ptzZNgpuW5jBQU10AvbcJbrw3qZVYYtPROP2QE4FvTR2ftvyY1io_gUsWw4mrJ6lr9cSzBJYm6vEXDAPgOowMtJ0ZZh-T-py-_U-gZGljBUo8ElriOdL3T0BhLeQJbk8gKp4MVFZxGwZZw5SnP8uWJspUOBe-hAr/s790-rw-e365/telecom.png)

U.S. telecoms giant T-Mobile has confirmed that it was also among the companies that were targeted by Chinese threat actors to gain access to valuable information.

The adversaries, tracked as [Salt Typhoon](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/china-aligned-mirrorface-hackers-target.html), breached the company as part of a "monthslong campaign" designed to harvest cellphone communications of "high-value intelligence targets." It's not clear what information was taken, if any, during the malicious activity.

"T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack, and at this time, T-Mobile systems and data have not been impacted in any significant way, and we have no evidence of impacts to customer information," a spokesperson for the company was [quoted](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/t-mobile-hacked-in-massive-chinese-breach-of-telecom-networks-4b2d7f92) as saying to The Wall Street Journal. "We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities."

With the latest development, T-Mobile has joined a list of major organizations like AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies that have been singled out as part of what appears to be a full-blown cyber espionage campaign.

So far, the reports make no mention of the degree to which these attacks saw success, whether any kind of malware was installed, or what kinds of information they were after. Salt Typhoon's unauthorized access to Americans' cellular data records was previously [disclosed](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/chinese-hackers-american-cell-phones-00187873) by Politico.

Last week, the U.S. government [said](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-statement-from-fbi-and-cisa-on-the-peoples-republic-of-china-targeting-of-commercial-telecommunications-infrastructure) its ongoing investigation into the targeting of commercial telecommunications infrastructure revealed a "broad and significant" hack orchestrated by the People's Republic of China (PRC).

"PRC-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders," it [said](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-peoples-republic-china-prc-targeting-commercial-telecommunications).

It further warned that the extent and scope of these compromises could grow as the probe continues.

[Salt Typhoon](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-us-internet.html), which is also known as Earth Estries, FamousSparrow, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286, is said to have been active since at least 2020, according to Trend Micro. In August 2023, the spy crew was [linked](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/earth-estries-espionage-campaign.html) to a series of attacks aimed at government and technology industries based in the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Africa, Germany, and the U.S.

Analysis shows that the threat actors have methodically crafted their payloads and made use of an interesting combination of legitimate and bespoke tools and techniques to bypass defenses and maintain access to their targets.

"Earth Estries maintains persistence by continuously updating its tools and employs backdoors for lateral movement and credential theft," Trend Micro researchers Ted Lee, Leon M Chang, and Lenart Bermejo [said](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/k/breaking-down-earth-estries-persistent-ttps-in-prolonged-cyber-o.html) in an exhaustive analysis published earlier this month.

"Data collection and exfiltration are performed using TrillClient, while tools like cURL are used for sending information to anonymized file-sharing services, employing proxies to hide backdoor traffic."

The cybersecurity company said it observed two distinct attack chains employed by the group, indicating the tradecraft that Salt Typhoon has in its arsenal is broad as it's varied. Initial access to target networks is facilitated by exploiting vulnerabilities in outside-facing services or remote management utilities.

In one set of attacks, the threat actor has been found taking advantage of vulnerable or misconfigured QConvergeConsole installations to deliver malware such as Cobalt Strike, a custom Go-based stealer called [TrillClient](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/earth-estries-espionage-campaign.html), and backdoors like [HemiGate](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/earth-estries-espionage-campaign.html) and [Crowdoor](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/chinese-speaking-hacker-group-targets.html), a variant of SparrowDoor which has been previously put to use by another China-linked group called [Tropic Trooper](https://blog-en.itochuci.co.jp/entry/2023/10/06/173200).
