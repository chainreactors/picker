Collaborative ERP allows you to make better business decisions by combining information from your SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition system of record, along with expertise from the right people in your organization who are connected using Microsoft Teams. The first step of the [vision we announced](https://news.sap.com/2022/10/next-level-erp-collaboration-sap-s-4hana-cloud-microsoft/) last fall is now a reality. Share to Microsoft Teams as chat is available in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition 2302. You can [download the SAP S/4HANA app from the Microsoft app store](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200005087?exp=ubp8&tab=Overview).

If you are an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition customer, you can use the new Share to Microsoft Teams functionality that we have added to the Share menu.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/shareasteamshorizon.png)

This allows you to work in Microsoft Teams and share a link directly to content in your ERP system with your colleagues, along with the context about why you are sharing this information and why you need them to look at the data in SAP.

**What’s new in S/4HANA Cloud, public edition 2302?**

* [Share as chat generally available](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/085edb30fb3d413da552832f3d5c01c0/b7361c5ab1954a279f44175c6fe31fa0.html)

* [Share as tab available in early adopter care](https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3051).

**What’s next in Share to Microsoft Teams in SAP S/4HANA Cloud?**

We will continue to execute on our plans as communicated in our [roadmap for user collaboration in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?q=teams&range=2023Q1-2024Q4&PRODUCT=67837800100800007389#Q1%202023).

**How did we implement Share with Microsoft Teams in SAP S/4HANA Cloud?**

We introduced this new functionality using SAP Fiori elements. By adding the Share to Microsoft Teams feature to the SAP Fiori elements framework, SAP apps based on the list report, object page, or overview page templates inherit this using the share menu. Using SAP Fiori elements allows us to introduce new functionality as part of the floorplan that applies to all apps built on it, even retroactively.
