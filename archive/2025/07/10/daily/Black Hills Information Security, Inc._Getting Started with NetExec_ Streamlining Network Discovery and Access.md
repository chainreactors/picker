One tool that I can’t live without when performing a penetration test in an Active Directory environment is called [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec). Being able to efficiently authenticate against multiple systems in the network is crucial, and NetExec is an incredibly powerful tool that helps automate a lot of this activity.

## **What is NetExec?**

NetExec is an open-source tool designed to conduct network reconnaissance, lateral movement, and security assessments as well as to help with automated authentication testing against remote systems in an Active Directory environment.

It’s based on another tool called [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) which was originally created by bytebleeder but is no longer under active development for… reasons. As a result, NetExec has become the preferred choice for network authentication testing due to its active development, speed, and modular design.

It allows you to perform a variety of functions such as validating credentials, enumerating users, executing commands remotely, and exploiting some common misconfigurations against Windows-based systems.

While the list below is a small sample of things you can use NetExec for, it is by no means an exhaustive list.

* Enabling users to do Active Directory enumeration, which includes obtaining data about computers, users, groups, domains, trusts, and more.
* Lateral Movement: enables you to switch between hacked systems and escalate privileges by supporting a variety of lateral movement strategies inside a network.
* Enables credential gathering which is the process of obtaining login credentials from compromised systems and using them to get into other systems, hence enabling additional exploitation.
* Supports Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) attacks, which are a method of gaining unauthorized access to resources by reusing Kerberos tickets.
* Attempt to gain unauthorized access by using brute force and credential spraying attacks against different network services.
* Session enumeration gives information about current user activity by listing all active sessions on remote systems.
* Enumerating shares on remote systems can aid in finding possible vulnerabilities and places of interest.

### **Key Features of NetExec**

NetExec provides authentication and command execution capabilities over multiple protocols, making it an incredibly versatile tool. These various functionalities are essential for network enumeration and post-exploitation and enable you to assess multiple authentication mechanisms, identify misconfigurations, and execute commands across diverse environments.

* NetExec supports the following proto...
