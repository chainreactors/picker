ANY.RUN & Microsoft Sentinel: Catch Emerging Threats with Real-Time Threat Intelligence

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_sentinel&utm_term=050825&utm_content=linktolanding) now delivers [Threat Intelligence (TI) Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_sentinel&utm_term=050825&utm_content=linktofeeds) directly to Microsoft Sentinel via the built-in STIX/TAXII connector. No complicated setups. No custom scripts. Only high-quality indicators of compromise (IOCs) to fortify your SOC and catch attacks early, keeping your business secure.

## About the TI Feeds Connector for Microsoft Sentinel

ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds support a seamless, out-of-the-box connection to Microsoft Sentinel that delivers real-time threat intelligence directly into your workspace.

* **Effortless Setup**: Connect TI Feeds to Sentinel using the STIX/TAXII connector with your custom API key.

* **Enhanced Automation**: Sentinel’s playbooks, powered by Azure Logic Apps, automatically correlate IOCs with your logs, triggering alerts or actions like blocking IPs. This cuts manual work and speeds up response times.

* **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage your existing Sentinel setup without extra infrastructure costs. Fewer missed threats, thanks to high-fidelity IOCs, reduce the financial impact of breaches.

The IOCs enriched with links to sandbox sessions can be used in Sentinel’s analytics, letting you build custom rules, visualize threats, and prioritize incidents effectively.

## What Makes ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds Unique

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ti_feeds_infographic-1024x450.png)

ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds deliver malicious IPs, domains, URLs that have been active for just hours, not days. We extract them from live sandbox analyses of the latest threats hitting [15,000+](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/) organizations worldwide. Unlike post-incident reports that lag behind, our feeds update every two hours, sending active attack indicators straight to clients. This lets [MSSPs and SOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/cyber-threat-hunting-tips/) detect today’s threats early and effectively, keeping systems secure.

* **Fresh Data**: IOCs update every 2 hours from live attack detonations in [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_sentinel&utm_term=050825&utm_content=linkolanding).

* **Rich Context**: Each IOC links to sandbox sessions with full TTPs for deeper investigations.

* **Low Noise**: Pre-processing by expert analysts ensure near-zero false positives, saving your team time.

* **Flexible Integration**: Thanks to [API](https://any.run/api-documentation/), [SDK](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/sdk-integration/), [STIX/TAXII](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/taxii-protocol-integration/) support, TI Feeds work seamlessly with SIEM/XDR/firewalls and other solutions.

## How TI Feeds Help SOCs and MSSPs Spot Attacks in Time

Threats move fast. Malware and phishing can slip through if you’re not ready. ANY.RUN TI Feeds give SOCs and MSSPs the edge to detect and stop attacks before they impact. Our [high-fidelity IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/quality-ti-feeds/) — IPs, domains, URLs — come enriched with context from ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox, ensuring you act with precision.
