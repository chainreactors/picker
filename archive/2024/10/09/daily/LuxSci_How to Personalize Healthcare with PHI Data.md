# How to Personalize Healthcare with PHI Data

October 8th, 2024

Recent research from McKinsey & Company indicates that people prefer more personalized experiences when engaging with companies, businesses and providers. While the retail, technology and financial services sectors have realized the benefits of personalization for years, the healthcare industry has been slower to adapt—providing huge opportunities to improve experiences and outcomes with better communications.

Simply put, personalized healthcare is about delivering a patient or customer experience that’s tailored to the unique needs of the individual. Personalization in healthcare goes beyond simply addressing the symptoms of an illness or ongoing care needs. Modern healthcare providers are more effectively engaging patients and customers based on their access and ability to use patient data or protected health information (PHI), factoring in medical history, treatment plans, product usage and personal preferences to drive more personalization. Communication plays a key role in this process. The way healthcare providers and suppliers communicate with patients has a direct impact on their satisfaction, adherence to treatments, and overall outcomes across the end-to-end healthcare journey.

As healthcare becomes more patient-centric, personalization is no longer just a nice-to-have—it’s a requirement. Today’s patients and customers expect healthcare providers to understand their needs and communicate in a way that connects with them on an individual level. Personalizing communications isn’t just about adding a patient’s name to an email—it’s about providing meaningful, timely, and relevant information that aligns with their unique health profile and needs.

So, how can healthcare providers and suppliers effectively personalize their communications while maintaining privacy and compliance with regulations like HIPAA?

This blog post digs deeper into this critical healthcare topic and offers practical tips on how to personalize healthcare engagement.

### **McKinsey & Company Research Highlights Consumer Demand for Personalization**

With industries like retail setting high standards for personalization, patients are coming to expect the same level of attention in healthcare. The demand for better healthcare experiences is rising, and patients are more likely to engage with providers and suppliers who offer personalized communication, including over email and text.

In fact, a [recent study conducted by McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-personalization#/) found that 71 percent of people expect businesses and providers to offer personalized interactions, and 76 percent are frustrated when they don’t receive personalized communications tailored to their specific needs. For healthcare providers, this can include healthcare conditions, treatment plans, new product usage and ongoing care management. The research highlights how much people value personalization and why healthcare providers, payers and suppliers need to adapt their communication strategies accordingly. The benefits include:

**1. Building Trust and Loyalty**

One of the main advantages of personalizing healthcare communications is that it helps build a stronger relationship between the patient and the provider or supplier. When patients and customers feel that a healthcare provider truly understands their individual needs, they’re more likely to develop trust and remain loyal to that provider.

**2. Improving Patient Engagement and Outcomes**

Personalized healthcare communications have been shown to increase patient engagement, especially when it comes to treatment adherence, plan renewals and new product usage. Sending personalized reminders for medication refills, appointment scheduling, equipment upgrades or lab test follow-ups can significantly improve compliance—and outcomes. Patients are more likely to respond to messages that are relevant to their personal health journey.

**3. Reducing Patient Anxiety and Confusion**

Healthcare journeys can be overwhelming, especially when dealing with complex medical conditions or products. Personalized communication can help reduce this anxiety by making information more digestible and relevant. By addressing a patient’s unique concerns and providing the right information in communications, including PHI, healthcare providers and suppliers can reduce confusion and deliver a better overall experience.

### **Leveraging Data to Personalize Healthcare Experiences**

The key to successful personalized communication lies in leveraging patient data effectively and responsibly. Providers can use data from electronic health records (EHRs), customer data platforms (CDPs), CRM systems, and patient portals to send tailored messages. For example, if a patient has a history of diabetes, the healthcare provider can send targeted educational content, reminders for blood sugar monitoring, and personalized treatment recommendations. In turn, medical equipment providers can seend HIPAA compliant communications for new product offers and upgrades.

However, it’s essential that healthcare providers use patient data in a way that respects privacy and complies with HIPAA regulations, including for communications. Only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive information, and all communication should be done via secure, end-to-end HIPAA compliant channels. This can include email, text and forms.

Personalization doesn’t just mean addressing individual patients—it also means communicating effectively with different groups of patients and customers, including understanding their channel preferences and having the ability to securely communicate over the channel of their choice. A younger demographic might prefer communication via text messages, while older patients may appreciate phone calls or emails. By understanding the preferences of different patient groups, healthcare providers and suppliers can ensure their messages are well-received.

### **The Role of HIPAA Compliant Communications in Personalization**

Technology is a powerful enabler when it comes to personalizing healthcare communications. From secure email platforms to automated text messaging systems to secure marketing campaigns, today’s leading HIPAA compliant healthcare communications solutions allow you to deliver personalized communications efficiently and securely.

When it comes to personalization in healthcare, it’s essential to prioritize HIPAA compliance. This ensures that patient information remains protected while still allowing you to include protected health information or PHI in communications. With the right tools in place, healthcare providers can safely use secure email, text, and forms to deliver personalized content. For example, an email with educational materials tailored to a patient’s condition or a text message reminder for an upcoming appointment or medical equipment upgrade can make a significant difference in patient engagement and overall satisfaction—and improve the results of your business.

While there are many benefits to personalizing healthcare communications, there are also challenges. Healthcare providers must navigate privacy concerns, regulatory hurdles, and the complexities of integrating personalized communication into existing workflows. Working with a vendor that is experienced and knowledgeable about HIPAA compliance and has a proven secure communications solutions can help healthcare providers and suppliers overcome these challenges.
