# Kim Dotcom’s Extradition to the U.S. Given Green Light By New Zealand

After years of legal proceedings, New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has approved Kim Dotcom's extradition to the United States. The Megaaupload founder faces criminal copyright infringement, racketeering, and money laundering charges, which in theory could lead to decades in prison. Dotcom says he has a plan and doesn't intend to leave the country.

While time moved on, the New Zealand-based ‘Internet personality’ was still waiting to hear whether he would be extradited to the United States where a criminal prosecution is pending.

With the stakes this high, no legal resources are being spared. Many [millions of dollars](https://torrentfreak.com/nz-government-lawyers-spent-40500-hours-battling-kim-dotcom-and-megaupload-210216/) have been poured into this legal battle since 2012, and the end is still nowhere in sight.

In 2020, the Supreme Court of New Zealand [ruled](https://torrentfreak.com/kim-dotcom-can-be-extradited-to-the-united-states-subject-to-judicial-review-201104/) that Kim Dotcom and his colleagues could indeed be extradited to the United States. However, this still wasn’t set in stone, as judicial reviews and appeals were still pending.

Megaupload defendants van der Kolk and Ortmann eventually opted for a deal. The pair pled guilty but were allowed to serve their respective [30 and 31-month prison sentences](https://torrentfreak.com/former-megaupload-executives-sentenced-to-2-5-years-in-prison-230615/) in New Zealand. Dotcom, meanwhile, vowed to [‘fight on’](https://torrentfreak.com/megaupload-pair-sign-deal-to-avoid-extradition-dotcom-vows-to-fight-on-220510/).

“I’m now the last man standing in this fight and I will continue to fight because unlike my co-defendants I won’t accept the injustice we have been subjected to,” Dotcom said two years ago.

## Justice Minister Signs Dotcom Extradition

In recent years, Dotcom hasn’t shied away from the public eye, often sharing controversial takes on political and societal events. In the background, however, potential extradition loomed, before reaching its conclusion earlier today.

According to [Stuff](https://www.stuff.co.nz/politics/350380271/justice-minister-signs-kim-doctoms-extradition-order), New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith informed Kim Dotcom that he will be deported to the United States to stand trial.

“I have received extensive advice from the Ministry of Justice on this matter,” Goldsmith said. “I considered all of the information carefully, and have decided that Mr Dotcom should be surrendered to the US to face trial.”

“As is common practice, I have allowed Mr Dotcom a short period of time to consider and take advice on my decision. I will not, therefore, be commenting further at this stage,” the Justice Minister added.

Dotcom has always denied the charges and has left no stone unturned in support of his defense. This means that the latest extradition decision will be challenged as well.

## ‘I Have a Plan’

The Ministry of Justice confirmed the extradition order earlier today. Dotcom revealed the decision on social media earlier in the week, describing New Zealand as an “obedient U.S. colony”.

“[T]he obedient US colony in the South Pacific just decided to extradite me for what users uploaded to Megaupload, unsolicited, and what copyright holders were able to remove with direct delete access instantly and without question. But who cares? That’s justice these days,” he wrote on Tuesday.

Today, Dotcom [followed up](https://x.com/KimDotcom/), stating that he has “a plan,” “loves New Zealand,” and doesn’t intend to leave the country.

*A Plan…*

The nature of Dotcom’s plan is unknown but if the past twelve years are any indication, he won’t let any adverse decision pass without a fight.
