Some organizations within the health care sector may believe that they are a Covered Entity simply because they handle health records (spoiler alert: this might not be the case). This often occurs due to misunderstandings about the definition of a Covered Entity. This post takes a deep dive into the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) definition of Covered Entity to help organizations determine whether HIPAA applies to them.

This post is part of a series that helps understand HIPAA applicability. For other posts in this series see:

Various terms throughout this post are linked to further definitions, either within this post or directly to definitions in laws and regulations.

TrustedSec has years of experience helping organizations meet HIPAA security and privacy compliance requirements. Please [get in touch with us](https://trustedsec.com/contact) for any questions on this topic or if your organization needs assistance with its HIPAA Compliance program.

## Covered Entity Definition

The HIPAA Rules directly apply to Covered Entities. The definition of Covered Entity in [45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 160.103](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-160.103) tells us that a Covered Entity is any of the following:

* A [health plan](#HPD)
* A [health care clearinghouse](#HCCD)
* A [health care provider](#HCPD) who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a [Covered Transaction](#CTD)

Each of these terms is defined in more detail below.

Organizations that do not fall into any of the categories listed in the definition above are not Covered Entities, even if they handle information that would otherwise be considered Protected Health Information (PHI), and the HIPAA Rules do not directly apply to them (although they may apply indirectly as a Business Associate if the organization meets that definition).

Note that health care providers are only considered Covered Entities if they transmit certain Covered Transactions (defined below). There is a common misunderstanding that all health care providers are Covered Entities, which in turn results from a misunderstandin...
