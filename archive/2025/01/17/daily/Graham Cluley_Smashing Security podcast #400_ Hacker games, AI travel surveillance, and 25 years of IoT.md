The video game Path of Exile 2 suffers a security breach, we explore the issues of using predictive algorithms in travel surveillance systems, and the very worst IoT devices are put on show in Las Vegas. Oh, and has Elon Musk accidentally revealed he cheats at video games?

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by The Cyberwire‚Äôs Dave Bittner.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
