SAP Stammtisch Plus Gurgaon 2023

**Hello SAP Community Gurgaon/NCR,**

We are back with an exciting update for you. Yes, we are ready to host the most awaited SAP Stammtisch Plus for 2023 in SAP Labs, Gurgaon.

This will be an excellent opportunity for all the SAP professionals, enthusiasts, and people interested
in learning more about SAP technologies to come together, learn, network with like-minded
people with loads of fun.

**Let us first understand what is SAP Stammtisch Plus?**

SAP Stammtisch Plus is a local grassroots community event where SAP Community members come together to share knowledge about SAP-related topics. The event is driven/organized by the community, free, and very informal: everyone who is interested may participate. This is typically around 3 hours with half the time focussed on expert sessions and other on networking.

We have also come up with a tentative agenda from our SAP Community experts.
