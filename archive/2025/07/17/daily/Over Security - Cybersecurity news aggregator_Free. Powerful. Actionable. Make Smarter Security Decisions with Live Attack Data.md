## TI Lookup—Essential Solution for SOC Teams

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image6-1-1024x603.png)

[TI Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_lookup_now_free&utm_term=160725&utm_content=linktolookup) is ANY.RUN’s key solution for working with threat intelligence. It simplifies and accelerates different stages of malware investigations, from proactive monitoring to gaining insights for incident response. As a result, you get to ensure a better defense against cyber threats for your company.

In practice, this means that TI Lookup provides you with Indicators of [Compromise (IOCs), Attack (IOAs), and Behavior (IOBs)](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/iocs-iobs-ioas-explained/). It not only links each indicator to an attack or sample but also showcases its behavior inside the sandbox.

The source of indicators is unique: all data comes from millions of malware analysis sessions done in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox. TI Lookup allows you to tap into it to gain invaluable insights into real threats targeting [15,000 companies](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/) in finance, manufacturing, transportation, government, and other industries right now.

Start your threat investigation in TI Lookup right away
 Triage alerts and handle incidents faster with rich context

[Try now. It’s free!](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_lookup_now_free&utm_term=160725&utm_content=linktolookup)

Unlike other solutions relying on public reports or databases published days or weeks after an incident, TI Lookup provides fresh, actionable data available to you hours or even minutes after the attack happened.

And now you get to access the benefit of our service at no cost. See how even its free version with limited functionality can become a game-changer for your security operations.
