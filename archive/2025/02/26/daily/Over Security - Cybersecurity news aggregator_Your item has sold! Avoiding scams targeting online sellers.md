[Threats](/category/threats/)
[phishing](/category/phishing/)

* There are many [risks](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) associated with selling items on online marketplaces that individuals and organizations should be aware of when conducting business on these platforms.
* Many of the general recommendations related to the use of these platforms are tailored towards purchasing items; however, there are several threats to those selling items as well.
* Recent phishing campaigns targeting sellers on these marketplaces have leveraged the platforms’ direct messaging feature(s) to attempt to steal credit card details for sellers’ payout accounts.
* Shipment detail changes, pressure to conduct off-platform transactions, and attempted use of “friends and family” payment options are commonly encountered scam techniques, all of which seek to remove the seller protections usually afforded by these platforms.
* There are several steps that sellers can take to help protect themselves and their data from these threats. Being mindful of the common scams and threats targeting sellers can help sellers identify when they may be being targeted by malicious buyers while it is occurring so that they can take defensive actions to protect themselves.

The emergence of online marketplaces has facilitated the convenient exchange of goods between individuals and organizations around the world. It has also provided a means for people to easily resell items, enabling them to recapture value from assets they may not otherwise wish to maintain ownership of. The type of new and used items sold via marketplaces varies widely, and platforms such as Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, Reverb, and others are extremely popular avenues for selling everything from $15 [vintage tissue boxes](https://www.mercari.com/search/?keyword=vintage%20kleenex) to $40,000 [Gibson Les Paul](https://reverb.com/item/86362194-gibson-les-paul-custom-1956-black) guitars. You can even find $70,000,000 domains targeting affluent individuals with above-average BMIs being sold on [online](https://www.ebay.com/itm/133017037582) marketplaces.

When we think about online safety in the context of these platforms, we often concentrate the majority of our efforts and recommendations on the threats targeting buyers. In many cases, scammers are also actively targeting the people selling items on these platforms as well. From an adversarial perspective, it makes sense to target sellers, as these are likely to be individuals with large amounts of cash sitting in their accounts as they frequently receive payments for items they sell. Likewise, adversaries can easily monitor the public listings of seller accounts to identify when high-value items are listed, as well as when they are sold, so that they can identify when a target could reasonably be expected to receive an influx of cash into their accounts.

Likewise, many platforms train their sellers to expect frequent, unsolicited account verification prompts delivered in any number of ways, which provides the perfect pretext for scammers seeking to take advantage of this pool of targets. From a detection and analysis standpoint, these types of attacks are often difficult to effectively combat, as platform providers, intelligence analysts, and law enforcement agencies are forced to primarily rely on self-reporting from victims to quantify the scope and impact of these types of threats. Let’s break down a few examples of some of the most common scams that target the individuals or organizations selling products on online marketplaces.

## Phishing and malware scams

While some scams attempt to fraudulently steal items, others are primarily aimed at stealing financial information from sellers by leveraging the platform’s messaging feature(s) as a mechanism to directly communicate with them for the purposes of phishing or malware distribution. In some cases, phishing is used to compromise the seller account itself, enabling the attacker to manipulate listings, shipments, modify automated payout settings, and communicate with current and previous buyers to conduct additional fraudulent activities. In other cases, phishing is used to obtain financial information, such as bank account or credit card information, that can be used to steal money from the seller.

### Payout account verification scams

In a recent example, a [/r/guitarpedals](https://reddit.com/r/guitarpedals) user [reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/1ic5bfv/is_this_a_scam/) that they had received a suspicious direct message on their [Reverb](https://reverb.com/) seller account. The message was crafted to appear as if it was sent from the Reverb team itself. It informs the seller that their item has sold and prompts them to complete account verification to ensure that they receive payment for the item(s) they have sold.

A hyperlink, present in the message (and shown below), attempts to leverage Reverb’s own redirection functionality to direct victims who click on the hyperlink to a malicious web server under the attacker’s control.
