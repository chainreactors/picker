The important thing to realise about the [(most recently) reported data breach at email newsletter service Mailchimp](https://grahamcluley.com/mailchimp-slips-up-again-suffers-security-breach-after-falling-on-social-engineering-banana-skin/) is that it’s not just Mailchimp’s customer data that was put at risk.

Even if you’re not personally a customer of Mailchimp, even if you’ve *never even heard* of Mailchimp, you may be affected.

That’s a realisation that should be dawning on customers of sportsbook and betting website FanDuel, as they receive warnings that their names and email addresses were exposed earlier this month.

![Part of the email FanDuel sent to customers](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/fanduel-email.jpeg)

Part of the email reads as follows:

> Recently, we were informed by a third-party technology vendor that sends transactional emails on behalf of its clients like FanDuel that they had experienced a security breach within their system that impacted several of their clients. On Sunday evening, the vendor confirmed that FanDuel customer names and email addresses were acquired by an unauthorized actor. No customer passwords, financial account information, or other personal information was acquired in this incident.
>
> Although none of your personal information beyond your name and email address were implicated, it is a good moment to remind you that we encourage every customer to take four important steps to help safeguard your FanDuel account and maintain your play safely and securely…

It’s not really accurate for anyone to claim that FanDuel has been hacked. Instead, FanDuel – like many other companies – outsourced its newsletter management to Mailchimp. That meant FanDuel the responsibility of handle its newsletter subscriber database and sending out emails on its behalf to Mailchimp.

Which is all fine and dandy if Mailchimp does a good job of sending out the emails, and *securing* those subscriber details.

Unfortunately, Mailchimp didn’t do that (and [not for the first time, either…](https://grahamcluley.com/trezor-wallets-hacked-dont-be-duped-by-phishing-attack-email/)).

Which is why FanDuel has found itself in the embarrassing position of contacting customers who were exposed by the breach, and warning them that even though passwords, financial information, and the like were not exposed… names and email addresses *are* now in the hands of cybercriminals.

And those criminals could, if they wished, create convincing-looking phishing emails that might attempt to trick unsuspecting users into revealing more information – such as their passwords, for instance.

I would recommend that FanDuel customers be on their guard, and – if they haven’t already done so – [enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their FanDuel accounts](https://www.fanduel.com/2fa-how-it-works "Link to FanDuel 2FA advice").

I would imagine that FanDuel, and other companies affected by Mailchimp’s data breach, are pretty upset right now about the damage that has been done to their reputation by Mailchimp’s sloppy security.

It was kind of FanDuel, in its notification to affected customers, not to mention that Mailchimp was the company which let the side down.

But it *was* Mailchimp.

So now you know.
