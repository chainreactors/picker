The race to the cloud is on. After decades of managing their own IT systems on premise, utilities are now looking for the way to the cloud. And there are good reasons for this:

* Firstly, the cloud offers increased **scalability** and **flexibility**, allowing utilities to adjust their computing resources quickly and easily as demand fluctuates. This means that they can easily handle periods of high demand or unexpected spikes in usage without having to invest in expensive and underutilized hardware.

* Secondly, the cloud provides improved **data storage and management** capabilities, allowing utilities to better manage and analyze large amounts of data, such as customer usage patterns, outage information, and asset performance data.

* Additionally, the cloud offers enhanced **security** features, including data encryption and secure access controls, which can help protect sensitive customer and operational data.

* Finally, by moving to the cloud, utilities can take advantage of the **latest technology and innovation**, without the need for extensive in-house expertise or investment in specialized hardware and software.

While cloud solutions typically enable fast innovation, there is also a downside to this. The daily operations of utilities require very specific and complex functionality that most cloud solutions are not able to deliver. This can be dangerous when utilities have to handle business processes for millions of customers or operations of critical infrastructure.

So, what is needed is a cloud solution that can both reliably run the core business processes of utilities and enable fast and scalable innovation. The solution for this is the **SAP Utilities Core**. It runs in the cloud and is based on SAP S/4HANA Utilities, which reliably runs for hundreds of utilities worldwide. In tight integration with the **SAP Business Technology Platform**, it also delivers and enables very flexible innovation.

To discuss this further, we are happy to invite you to our next [International SAP Conference for Utilities](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities) in Basel in April 2023, where the SAP Utilities Core solution plays a central role.

On April 18, [the pre-conference day](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities/pre-conference-day), we will offer a deep dive workshop for SAP Utilities Core and SAP S/4HANA to give you detailed insights into the functions and value proposition.

On the [first conference day](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities/conference-agenda) on April 19, we will run the SAP Utilities Core track, where you will get first-hand insight from SAP, customers, and partners. Hear from leading utilities like Alperia how they are [enabling a greener future for people and the planet using next-generation cloud infrastructure](https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/07/56d61f7f-387e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) and Endeavour Energy what they learned in their project Optimus, an end-to-end S/4HANA journey.

I’m looking forward to seeing you in Basel from April 18-20!

Kind regards,

Markus
