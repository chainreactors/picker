In episode 64 of The AI Fix, AI discovers new physics, a robot crab looks for love on the beaches of Portugal, the ‚ÄúGodfather of AI‚Äù thinks our only hope is to build motherly AI, a robot folds some laundry, the UK government has a terrible idea, and our hosts discover a long lost sixties soul hit, ‚ÄúDusty Plasma‚Äù.

Plus, Graham digs into the spat between Elon Musk and Sam Altman, and Mark learns that humanity could be saved by vaccinating AI against evil.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
