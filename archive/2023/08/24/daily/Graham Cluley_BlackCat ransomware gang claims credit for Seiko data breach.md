The BlackCat ransomware gang has claimed credit for a cybersecurity attack against Japanese watchmaker Seiko.

BlackCat (also known as ALPHAV) posted on its dark web leak site what it claims are files stolen from Seiko‚Äôs servers.

Like other ransomware operations, BlackCat extorts money from targeted organisations by stealing sensitive data, threatening to release it publicly, and encrypting computer systems to lock victims out of their information.

BlackCat affiliates have often gone one stage further and threatened to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks if extortion demands are not met.

Seiko [announced](https://www.sii.co.jp/en/news/topics/2023/08/10/12208/ "Link to Seiko announcement") earlier this month that it had suffered a data breach which saw hackers access ‚Äúat least one of its servers‚Äù and warned that information may have been stolen.

The company says that it has brought in external experts to investigate the incident.

Earlier this year, cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs [published an interesting account](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/who-wrote-the-alphv-blackcat-ransomware-strain/ "Link to Krebs on Security article") of his contact with online criminals who may be associated with the Russian-speaking BlackCat group.
