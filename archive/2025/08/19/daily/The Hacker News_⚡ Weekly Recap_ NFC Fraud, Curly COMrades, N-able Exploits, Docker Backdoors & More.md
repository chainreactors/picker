Power doesn't just disappear in one big breach. It slips away in the small stuff‚Äîa patch that's missed, a setting that's wrong, a system no one is watching. Security usually doesn't fail all at once; it breaks slowly, then suddenly. Staying safe isn't about knowing everything‚Äîit's about acting fast and clear before problems pile up. Clarity keeps control. Hesitation creates risk.

Here are this week's signals‚Äîeach one pointing to where action matters most.

## ‚ö° Threat of the Week

**[Ghost Tap NFC-Based Mobile Fraud Takes Off](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/new-android-malware-wave-hits-banking.html)** ‚Äî A new Android trojan called PhantomCard has become the latest malware to abuse near-field communication (NFC) to conduct relay attacks for facilitating fraudulent transactions in attacks targeting banking customers in Brazil. In these attacks, users who end up installing the malicious apps are instructed to place their credit/debit card on the back of the phone to begin the verification process, only for the card data to be sent to an attacker-controlled NFC relay server. The stolen card details are passed on to money mules who link the information to contactless payment systems like Apple Pay or Google Pay in person to obtain physical goods.

## Security from Code to Cloud: IaC Best Practices

Cloud misconfigurations don't wait. Neither should you. Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) accelerates development, but even small mistakes in templates can become major production risks‚Äîlike unencrypted S3 buckets or overly permissive access settings. This best practices guide shows you how to fix IaC misconfigurations at the source to secure your cloud environment from the start.](https://thehackernews.uk/iac-best-practices-ar)

* **[Two N-able N-central Flaws Exploited in the Wild](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/cisa-adds-two-n-able-n-central-flaws-to.html)** ‚Äî Two security flaws impacting N-able N-central have come under active exploitation in the wild. The flaws, CVE-2025-8875 and CVE-2025-8876, allow command execution and command injection, respectively. The issues have been addressed in N-central versions 2025.3.1 and 2024.6 HF2 released on August 13, 2025. N-able is also urging customers to make sure that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled, particularly for admin accounts.
* **[New 'Curly COMrades' APT Targets Georgia and Moldova](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/new-curly-comrades-apt-using-ngen-com.html)** ‚Äî A previously undocumented threat actor dubbed Curly COMrades has been observed targeting entities in Georgia and Moldova as part of a cyber espionage campaign designed to facilitate long-term access to target networks. The activity, tracked by the Romanian cybersecurity company since mid-2024, has singled out judicial and government bodies in Georgia, as well as an energy distribution company in Moldova. Curly COMrades are assessed to be operating with goals that are aligned with Russia's geopolitical strategy. It gets its name from the heavy reliance on the curl utility for command-and-control (C2) and data transfer, and the hijacking of the component object model (COM) objects. Persistent access to the infected endpoints is accomplished by means of a bespoke backdoor called MucorAgent.
* **[XZ Utils Backdoor Found in Dozens of Docker Hub Images](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/researchers-spot-xz-utils-backdoor-in.html)** ‚Äî Several Docker images built around the time of the XZ Utils compromise contain the backdoor, some of which are still available via the container image library Docker Hub. Binary said it identified 35 Debian images on Docker Hub that embedded the backdoor. That includes 12 Docker images and 23 second-order images. The main takeaway is that users should only rely on up-to-date images. The findings are a sign that traces of the supply chain threat have remained after more than a year since the incident came to light.
* **[U.S. Expands Sanctions on Garantex](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/us-sanctions-garantex-and-grinex-over.html)** ‚Äî The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchange Garantex, its successor Grinex, and related affiliates as part of continued efforts by the government to halt the flow of ransomware proceeds facilitated by the platforms. Garantex is estimated to have processed more than $100 million in transactions linked to illicit activities since 2019. "Digital assets play a crucial role in global innovation and economic development, and the United States will not tolerate abuse of this industry to support cybercrime and sanctions evasion," the Treasury Department said.
* **[EncryptHub Continues to Exploit Windows Flaw for Stealer Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/russian-group-encrypthub-exploits-msc.html)** ‚Äî The Russia-aligned threat actor known as EncryptHub is continuing to exploit a now-patched security flaw impacting Microsoft Windows to deliver malicious payloads, including a stealer called Fickle Stealer. The campaign combines social engineering and the exploitation of a vulnerability in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) framework (CVE-2025-26633, aka MSC EvilTwin) to trigger the infection routine via a rogue Microsoft Console (MSC) file.
