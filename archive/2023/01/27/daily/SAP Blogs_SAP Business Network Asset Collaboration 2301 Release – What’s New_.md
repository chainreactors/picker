This blog post provides an overview of key innovations in the 2301 Release of SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration. On January 22, 2023, we released exciting new SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration innovations for our customers.

Let me share some of the key highlights from the SAP Business Network Asset Collaboration 2301 Release:-

***Latest Innovations – Collaborative Asset Definition***

**Automatic creation of an equipment request from a QR code scan**

* Automatic creation of an equipment request from the Lookup application if the QR code scanning of the equipment identifier does not find any matches in the equipment list​

* If the QR code represents the IEC 61406 ID link string, automatic identification of the equipment manufacturer by extracting the domain part of the IEC 61406 ID link string and creation of the equipment request for the identified equipment manufacturer​

* If the equipment manufacturer is still not part of the network, an equipment request can be created from a QR code scan and then submitted when the equipment manufacturer joins the network (i.e. parking lot for equipment requests)

***Latest Innovations – Enterprise Readiness***

**Maintenance of Attribute values for Nested Structures in the UI**

* You can now edit the nested structure attribute values along with attribute values from attribute groups in the Data Sheet section
