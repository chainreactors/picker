interview The more cybersecurity news you read, the more often you seem to see a familiar phrase: Software supply chain (SSC) vulnerabilities. Varun Badhwar, founder and CEO at security firm Endor Labs, doesn't believe that's by coincidence.

"The numbers are going to go from 80 to 90 percent to maybe 95, 98, 99 percent of your code in an enterprise environment would be written from basically untrusted, unvetted sources," Badhwar, referring to the proliferation of open-source software packages, told us. "The software supply chain is going to be the next frontier of cybersecurity and cybersecurity attacks."

Getting around those sorts of problems is going to require good documentation, Badhwar told us, which he said includes reliable software bills of material and better vetting of open-source libraries. You can watch the full video below.
