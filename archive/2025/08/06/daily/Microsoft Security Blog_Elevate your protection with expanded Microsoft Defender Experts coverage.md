## Defender Experts now offers 24/7, expert-driven protection for cloud workloads, beginning with hybrid and multicloud servers in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Additionally, third-party network signals can be used in Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR to enhance incidents for faster and more accurate detection and response.

***Co-authors: Henry Yan, Sr. Product Marketing Manager and Sylvie Liu, Principal Product Manager***

Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are under extreme pressure due to a rapidly evolving threat landscape, an increase in volume and frequency of attacks driven by AI, and a widening skills gap. To address these challenges, organizations across industries are relying on [Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/services/microsoft-defender-experts-xdr) and [Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/services/microsoft-defender-experts-hunting?msockid=2033ff1ceb3e609904bdeb02ea13613a) to bolster their SOC and stay ahead of emerging threats. We are committed to continuously enhancing Microsoft Defender Experts services to help our customers safeguard their organizations and focus on what matters most.

We are excited to announce the general availability of expanded Defender Experts coverage. With this update, Defender Experts for XDR and Defender Experts for Hunting now deliver around the clock protection and proactive threat hunting for your cloud workloads, starting with hybrid and multicloud servers in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Additionally, third-party network signals from Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler, and Fortinet can now be used for incident enrichment in Defender Experts for XDR, enabling faster and more accurate detection and response.

**Extend 24/7, expert-led defense and threat hunting to your hybrid and multicloud servers**

As cloud adoption accelerates, the sophistication and frequency of cloud attacks are on the rise. [According to IDC](https://marketingassets.microsoft.com/gdc/gdcnbwj9C/original), in 2024, organizations experienced an average of more than nine cloud security incidents, with 89% reporting an increase year over year. Furthermore, cloud security is the leading skills gap with almost 40% of respondents in the [Oâ€™Reilly 2024 State of Security Survey](https://ae.oreilly.com/State_of_Security_in_2024?_gl=1*14ghxdj*_ga*NTE1MzI1OTU5LjE3NTIxODYwMTc.*_ga_092EL089CH*czE3NTIxOTEyMzYkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTIxOTEyMzYkajYwJGwwJGgw) identifying it as the top area in need of skilled professionals. Virtual machines (VMs) are the backbone of cloud infrastructure, used to run critical applications with sensitive data while offering flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. This makes them attractive targets for attackers as compromised VMs can be used to potentially carry out malicious activities such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and resource exploitation.

Defender Experts for XDR now delivers 24/7, expert-led managed extended detection and response (MXDR) for your hybrid and multicloud servers in Defender for Cloud. Our security analysts will investigate, triage, and respond to alerts on your on-premises and cloud VMs across Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. With Defender Experts for Hunting, which is included in Defender Experts for XDR and also available as a standalone service, our expert threat hunters will now be able to hunt across hybrid and multicloud servers in addition to endpoints, identities, emails, and cloud apps, reducing blind spots and uncovering emerging cloud threats.

**Incident enrichment for improved detection accuracy and faster response**

By enriching Defender incidents with third-party network signals from Palo Alto Networks (PAN-OS Firewall), Zscaler (Zscaler Internet Access and Zscaler Private Access), and Fortinet (FortiGate Next-Generation Firewall), our security analysts gain deeper insights into attack paths. The additional context helps Defender Experts for XDR identify patterns and connections across domains, enabling more accurate detection and faster response to threats.

*Figure 2: Third-party enrichment data in Defender Experts for XDR report*

In this hypothetical scenario, we explore how incident enrichment with third-party network signals helped Defender Experts for XDR uncover lateral movement and potential data exfiltration attempts.

* **Detection**: Microsoft Defender for Identity flagged an "Atypical Travel" alert for User A, showing sign-ins from India and Germany within a short timeframe using different devices and IPs, suggesting possible credential compromise or session hijacking. However, initial identity and cloud reviews showed no signs of malicious activity.
* **Correlation**: From incident enrichment with third-party network signals, Palo Alto firewall logs revealed attempts to access unauthorized remote tools, while Zscaler proxy data showed encrypted traffic to an unprotected legacy SharePoint server.
* **Investigation**: Our security analysts uncovered that the attacker authenticated from a managed mobile device in Germany. Due to token reuse and a misconfigured Mobile Device Management profile, the device passed posture checks and bypassed Conditional Access, enabling access to internal SharePoint. Insights from third-party network signals helped Defender Experts for XDR confirm lateral movement and potential data exfiltration.
* **Response**: Once malicious access was confirmed, Defender Experts for XDR initiated a coordinated response, revoking active tokens, isolating affected devices, and hardening mobile policies to enforce Conditional Access.

**Flexible, cost-effective pricing**
