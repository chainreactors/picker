# A brief history of webÂ browsers

![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2004.jpg?w=1024)

Although taken for granted now, Apple didnâ€™t release the first version of Safari until January 2003. Before that was a succession of interesting experiments to try. Those started with Netscape Navigator in 1994, which lasted until 2007, although by then it was little used on Macs.

Netscape is seen here in 2000, following my successful purchase of downloadable versions of Conflict Catcher and Suitcase from Casady & Greeneâ€™s online store.

Two years later, and Iâ€™m browsing Amazonâ€™s listing of my never-published book that was slated for 31 March the following year. Iâ€™m so glad I never pre-ordered it.

Netscape had been at the front of browser development, leading with on-the-fly page display, cookies and JavaScript. But in 1996, it was challenged by Microsoftâ€™s Internet Explorer, and Appleâ€™s more innovative Cyberdog. The latter was sadly abandoned the following year, leaving the way clear for Apple to replace the bundled Netscape with Internet Exploder, as it quickly became nicknamed.

This is Microsoft Internet Explorer in 2001, providing the front end to Mac OS X Server through Webmin.

Cookie settings in Explorer were highly detailed in 2005.

Many of us abandoned Internet Explorer for alternatives such as Camino. That had originated within Netscape as Chimera in 2002, based on its Gecko layout engine, with a native Mac OS X front end. The following year it was rebranded as Camino, and amazingly lasted until 2012.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/camino2004.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/camino2004.jpg)

There were other competitors, such as Omni Groupâ€™s OmniWeb, which had been developed for NeXTSTEP since 1995, then moved to Mac OS X until 2012.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/omniweb2007.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/omniweb2007.jpg)

This is OmniWeb in 2007, showing the different browsers it could identify itself as, including a single version of Safari 1.0.

In January 2003, Apple launched the first beta-release of its own browser, Safari, and bundled it in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther when it was released that October. Since then Safari has been a regular fixture in successive versions of Mac OS X, OS X, and macOS. For several years, it was the only browser on iOS and iPadOS.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2004.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2004.jpg)

This is Safari 1 showing the front page for Appleâ€™s developer site in 2004, complete with the offer to download Xcode version 1.5 with dead code stripping as a new feature. That year, Mozilla Firefox was released as an alternative, and has continued to support Macs ever since.

Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger came with Safari as the only bundled browser when it was released in April 2005, although it took Safari 2.0.4 in early 2006 before it was stable.

Page loading was slow in 2005, when Appleâ€™s front page took a total of over 16 seconds to load fully, but that only used 6.8 MB of memory. By contrast, today Appleâ€™s front page only takes a couple of seconds but requires over 200 MB.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2006.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2006.jpg)

There were times when the only way ahead with these early versions of Safari was to completely reset it, emptying its cache, and even removing all passwords and AutoFill text. This is Safari 2 in 2006.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safariflash2006.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safariflash2006.jpg)

Prominent among the plugins in 2006 was the dreaded Shockwave Flash, which had only recently been taken over by Adobe when it acquired Macromedia the previous year. Details of plugins are here being displayed on an internal web page within Safari 2.

Safari 3, bundled in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard in October 2007, brought the claim that it was then the fastest browser, but it was troubled by bugs and security problems at first.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2007.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2007.jpg)

Safari 3 had already grown extensive preferences, covering the use of plugins, Java, JavaScript and cookies, seen here in 2007.

Its successor, Safari 4, followed in the summer of 2009, ready for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, with further performance improvements, particularly in its JavaScript engine.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2009.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2009.jpg)

By 2009, Safari 4 was able to warn the user if it was about to visit a site blacklisted by the Google Safe Browsing Service. At least when that service was available. That year also saw Preview and Beta releases of Google Chrome, now Safariâ€™s most serious competitor on Appleâ€™s hardware.

Safari 5 was released a year later, in 2010, and was bundled in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion in 2011. This brought Reader mode and opened the door to third-party extensions.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2010.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safari2010.jpg)

Safariâ€™s hidden Debug menu provided a collection of tools for web developers, and more recently has become the even more extensive Develop menu.

By the release of macOS 10.12 Sierra in 2016, Safari had reached version 10.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safariflash2016.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safariflash2016.jpg)

By 2016, close control over Adobe Flash Player had become critical, as a result of its frequent exploits, although it remained highly popular with content developers before Adobe finally killed it at the end of 2020.

[![](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safaritrans2021.jpg)](https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/safaritrans2021.jpg)

Since 2021, with the release of macOS 12 Monterey, Safari 15 and its successors have been able to perform on-the-fly translation, as demonstrated here.

Safari is now the bundle...
