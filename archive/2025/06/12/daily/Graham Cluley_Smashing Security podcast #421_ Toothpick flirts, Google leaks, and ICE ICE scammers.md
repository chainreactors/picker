What do a sleazy nightclub carpet, Google‚Äôs gaping privacy hole, and an international student conned by fake ICE agents have in common? This week‚Äôs episode of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast obviously.

Graham explains how a Singaporean bug-hunter cracked Google‚Äôs defences and could brute-force your full phone number. Meanwhile, Carole dives into a chilling scam where ICE impersonators used fear, spoofed numbers, and‚Ä¶ Apple gift cards to extort terrified migrants.

Plus: Nazis, door safety, and the age-old struggle of telling Ralph Fiennes from Liam Neeson.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
