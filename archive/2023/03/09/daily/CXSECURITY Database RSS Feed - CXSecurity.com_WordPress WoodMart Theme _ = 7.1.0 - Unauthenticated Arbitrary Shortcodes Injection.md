Report Title: WordPress WoodMart Theme <= 7.1.0 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcodes Injection
Google Dork: inurl:/wp-content/themes/woodmart/
Research Date: 2022-11-12
Researcher: FearZzZz [ https://fearzzzz.ru ]
Component Vendor: XTemos [ https://themeforest.net/user/xtemos ]
Vulnerable Version: <= 7.1.0
Component Link: https://themeforest.net/item/woodmart-woocommerce-wordpress-theme/20264492
CVSS Base Score: 8.1 (High)
CVSS Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
OWASP Top 10: A03: 2021 â€“ Injection
CWE: CWE-20
CVE: CVE-2023-25790
=================================================================================================
#### [ Description: ]
The WoodMart premium theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcodes Injection in versions up to, and including, v7.1.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. Note that the default WordPress shortcodes are relatively secure but other installed plugins often include insecure shortcodes, which allows to assess the potential attack threat as "medium" or "high".
#### [ Impact: ]
Malicious JavaScript code injections, the ability to combine attack vectors against the targeted system, which can lead to a complete compromise of the resource.
Malicious PHP code execution, the ability to gain full control over the attacked website, as well as retain access through the backdoor.
