# Malicious ad distributes SocGholish malware to Kaiser Permanente employees

Posted: December 15, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

On December 15, we detected a malicious campaign targeting Kaiser Permanente employees via Google Search Ads. The fraudulent ad masquerades as the health care company’s HR portal used to check for benefits, download paystubs and other corporate related tasks.

We believe the threat actors’ intent was to phish KP employees for their login credentials, but something unexpected happened. Instead, victims who clicked on the ad were redirected to a compromised website that prompted them to update their browser.

This notification is part of a [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) campaign known as SocGholish that tricks users into running a script supposedly meant to update their browser. Rather, it infects machines and if the victim is deemed important enough, a human operator will gain access in order to perform nefarious actions.

In this blog post, we review how this attack unfolds and why a compromised website derailed the attackers’ plan. We already reported the malicious ad to Google.

## Malicious Kaiser Permanente ad

Several criminal gangs are currently abusing Google Ads to phish victims of various large companies. They prey on employees simply googling for their HR portal so that they can display a malicious ad to lure them in.

Case in point, when searching for Kaiser Permanente’s HR portal, we saw the following ad:

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/image_0ce25d.png)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/image_0ce25d.png)

We were able to identify the advertiser who registered a fake account under the name ‘Heather Black’. This ad was only showed for U.S.-based searches, as can be seen in the Google Ads Transparency Center report:

## Former company’s website hijacked for phishing

The displayed url shown in the ad (*[https](https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day)://www.bellonasoftware[.]com*) does not look associated with Kaiser Permanente. [According to LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bellonasoftware/about/), Bellona Software was a company based in Romania. We can see what their website looked like in 2021, using the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/):

Some time more recently, this same website was taken over by criminals who transformed it into a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) page for Kaiser Permanente:

## Malicious redirect to SocGholish

It looks like there was more than one cook in the kitchen, as malicious code was also injected in the core JavaScript libraries for that website, confirmed in a [scan](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/https/bellonasoftware.com) by Sucuri’s SiteCheck:
