Hi, my fellow hackers. This is **Rayofhope**. I have over 5 years of experience and am currently working as a consultant with a Big 4 firm.

Itâ€™s Day 12 of posting all the PortSwigger labs, not just the solutions. Iâ€™ll break down ***why*** we take each step, because once the ***â€˜whyâ€™ is clear, the â€˜howâ€™ becomes easy.***

**Letâ€™s Start:**

Deadliest Virus in the world.

*As we already know, the* `cookies` *parameter is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection. So, let's intercept the request and explore what we can do with it.*

*Tried injecting a single quote* ***(***`'`***),*** *and it returned a 200 OK response. However, there's no clear indication, such as a* ***true or false*** *statement, to confirm the vulnerability. It could be that the* `Pets` *parameter is the one being affected.*

*Replaced the Tracking ID with* `rayofhope`***,*** *and it still returned a 200 OK response. However,* `rayofhope`*doesn't appear anywhere in the response, and we aren't seeing any indicators that would confirm a* ***true or false condition****.*

*Used a* ***single quote (***`'`***)****, and it returned a* ***500 Internal Server Error****. This indicates that the single quote might be breaking the SQL query, which suggests that the query could be part of custom* ***developer-written code.***

*There we go, this time, we didnâ€™t get an error. We used* ***â€˜ and 1=1****, which is a* ***universal true condition,*** *confirming that the single quote is now properly balancing the* ***SQL query.*** *This suggests that the parameter could potentially be vulnerable to* ***Blind SQL Injection.***

> But wait a minute, we tried `' and 1=2`, which is clearly a f**alse condition** (because, yeah, 1 is never equal to 2, not even in developer dreams). Yet, we still got a 200 OK response! No error, no change, no sign of rejection.

> This is where things get tricky. When both true **(**`' and 1=1`**)** and false (`' and 1=2`**)** conditions return the same response, we can't rely on visual cues or error messages. Welcome to the world of Blind SQL Injection â€” where the injection is happening, but the app acts like nothingâ€™s wrong. It's like trying to read a poker face... in the dark!

> Inputs like `'--` or `''` are valid parts of an SQL query, so the database doesnâ€™t throw an error, the query still runs, and we get a 200 OK in response.

> But waiiih â€” we just saw that â€˜â€™ is accepted, right? That might mean the input is being treated as part of a valid SQL string. Soooâ€¦ what if we try to concatenate something? Like â€˜ || (SELECT â€˜â€™)â€™

*Oh nooo, we still got an error with* `'||(SELECT '')||'`*! Where are we messing up? Wait a secâ€¦ maybe it's not using a string concatenation operator like* `||`*. Could it be an Oracle database? ðŸ¤” Either way, getting an error now is actually a good thing â€” it means weâ€™re poking the query in the right place!*

*There we go â€” we finally got a 200 OK with the payload* `' || (SELECT '' FROM dual) || '`*. And you know what that means? Yep, weâ€™re most likely dealing with an Oracle database! Want to know why that works and how to go even deeper with Oracle SQL Injection?*

*Then you have to check out this blog:* [***SQL Injection Attack: Querying the Database Type and Version on Oracle (PortSwigger Lab)***](https://arayofhope7.medium.com/sql-injection-attack-querying-the-database-type-and-version-on-oracle-portswigger-904487db7d3d)*. Trust me â€” itâ€™ll level up your injection game!*

*We replaced* `dual`*with* `rayofhope,`*a table we know doesnâ€™t exist, and boom, we got an error! But with*`dual`*, we get a clean* ***200 OK****. Thatâ€™s the confirmation we needed: the input is being executed, the equation is balanced, and yes, it's vulnerable to* ***Blind SQL Injection.***

Why does `'||(select '' from users)||'` give an error even though the `users`table exists?

Letâ€™s understand this way: â€”

*If the* `users` *table has no rows (i.e., it's empty), the query* `SELECT '' FROM users` *will return no results. This means a 200 OK response, as the query completes successfully without returning any rows.*
