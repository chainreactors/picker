# Rust OPSEC for Malware Development

How to be sneaky

## OPSEC

OPSEC, or Operational Security, is a term that can broadly be described as staying hidden, unexposed, or untraceable to such a degree it would identify you,
or some artifact of you. It isn’t about being invisible - that is impossible.

When we talk about OPSEC, most people associate it with things like “use Tor”, “use a VPN”, “don’t use social media”, etc. And sure, that would relate to your
personal operational security - but we are talking about malware here.

So, **what is malware OPSEC**? Here, I am only going to talk about the ability to reduce the static finger-printable attack surface. This comes with other side
benefits, such as making a...
