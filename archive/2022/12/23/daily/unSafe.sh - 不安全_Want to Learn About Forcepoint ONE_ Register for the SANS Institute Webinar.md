Even before the pandemic, organizations had already begun to shift an increasing number of workloads to the cloud. The pandemic shifted that trend into high gear, resulting in the adoption of many SaaS aps. It also forced organizations to deal with data being accessed from any number of locations, across managed and unmanaged devices alike.

### Simplifying Cloud Security: A SANS Review of Forcepoint ONE

[Read the Report](https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/reports/simplifying-cloud-security-sans-review-forcepoint-one "Read the Report")

This reality means organizations access and use data across an ever-increasing number of applications (in addition to even more integrations). Managing all of it from a policy perspective quickly becomes overwhelming. And for the large majority of organizations adopting the cloud at an accelerated pace, their cloud adoption rate clearly eclipses their security adoption rate.

[Forcepoint ONE](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/forcepoint-one) exists to help security teams manage data across cloud applications, web applications and private applications. It gives security teams unprecedented policy flexibility, allowing them to manage data in motion or at rest that can be adapted differently based on how departments or individual employees use the tools.
