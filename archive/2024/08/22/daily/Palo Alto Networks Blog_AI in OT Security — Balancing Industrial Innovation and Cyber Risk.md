Whether defensive or offensive, cybersecurity is in constant flux. And in today's industrial landscape, the convergence of operational technology (OT), industrial control systems (ICS) and information technology (IT) is reshaping manufacturing and critical infrastructure. This convergence, while bringing unprecedented efficiency and innovation, also exposes traditionally isolated systems to new security risks, creating a complex ecosystem where AI is emerging as a powerful ally in securing these environments.

We recently interviewed Del Rodillas, distinguished product manager at Palo Alto Networks, who focuses on OT and ICS security, developing solution roadmaps and working closely with the product teams. His expertise extends to collaborating with sales teams, enabling them to better serve clients, and educating customers. Del's long-standing experience and insights make him a valuable asset in navigating the multifaceted landscape of the OT-IT convergence and emerging cybersecurity challenges in the manufacturing and industrial sectors.

## The Changing Face of OT Security

Today, the manufacturing sector is embracing digital transformation at an unmatched rate. By 2026, industrial organizations are expected to employ [over 15 billion new and legacy assets connected to 5G](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/5g-iot-market-164027845.html), the internet and cloud. As one might expect, this rapid adoption of new technologies is not without risk. The attack surface of a typical manufacturing organization becomes exponentially broader as more devices are deployed.

This expanded attack surface, coupled with the inherent vulnerabilities of legacy OT systems, creates a perfect storm for cybercriminals who are now setting their sights on these systems, leveraging advanced, AI-enhanced techniques to launch attacks. As Rodillas points out:

"OT-IT convergence plays a massive role in the cyberthreat landscape because it enables attackers with a more sophisticated playbook or set of tools that makes their capabilities more advanced, but it also increases the velocity and volume of their attacks."

This increased digital tangle of connectivity has made OT systems prime targets for cybercriminals. In 2021, 35% of reported OT cyberattacks had physical consequences, with an [estimated damage of $140 million per incident](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/cybersecurity/how-to-enhance-the-cybersecurity-of-operational-technology-environments). These alarming statistics underscore the critical need for robust OT security measures that can keep pace with evolving threats.

## AI — A Game-Changer in OT Security

As in other areas in cybersecurity, AI is proving to be a formidable ally in the fight against cyberthreats in OT environments. Rodillas emphasizes the importance of AI in addressing the unique challenges of OT security:

"AI plays a massive role in the cyberthreat landscape… I think AI is changing the mindset that it's not relevant to OT. It's very much relevant because of an integrated IT-OT attack lifecycle. From a sophistication standpoint, I think particularly on the social engineering phase, so people have to remember that attacks to OT primarily are ones that originate from IT and then pivot to OT.

Generative AI particularly can be used to automate the research and email generation to have a more targeted and more convincing spear phishing campaign. And the adaptability, I think, is another thing for the threat landscape, where the malware can constantly evolve, making it harder to detect and neutralize. I don’t think it would be a stretch to say that AI will be applied to have more efficient and stealthy lateral movement in OT, thus shortening the time to compromise a critical asset."

Given these evolving threats, AI is not just a tool but a necessity in modern OT security.

## Key Areas Where AI Is Making an Impact Protecting Industrial Environments

**Enhanced Threat Detection and Response**

AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how organizations detect and respond to threats in manufacturing settings. Rodillas highlights the importance of [User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)](/cyberpedia/what-is-user-entity-behavior-analytics-ueba), stating,

"In manufacturing, the device aspect of UEBA becomes very interesting because now you're talking about OT devices, industrial IoT devices, IoT devices, IT devices, a lot of devices on the shop floor."

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, these tools can establish baselines for normal behavior and quickly identify anomalies that may indicate a security threat. This capability is particularly crucial in OT environments, where traditional IT security tools may not understand specialized industrial protocols.

**Bridging the IT-OT Security Gap**

One of the most significant challenges in OT security has been the disconnect between IT and OT teams. AI is helping to bridge this gap by providing a common language and unified view of the security landscape. Rodillas explains:

"Organizations are better off because there's that increased connectivity between the two environments. OT is becoming more like IT from a technology standpoint... AI can be one of these types of technologies, kind of a unifying capability."

By applying AI analytics across both IT and OT environments, organizations can detect threats earlier and map attacks to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, enabling better identification of threat actors and more effective response strategies.

**Addressing the Skills Gap**

The cybersecurity skills shortage is particularly acute in the OT sector. AI is helping to alleviate this limitation by automating routine tasks and enabling less experienced staff to handle more complex security operations. As Rodillas notes, "You need AI to take this burden off of humans and AI can do it 24/7 automatically, and it can only involve your personnel when there's a critical and high fidelity signal that is better handled by a human."

This automation not only helps to address the skills gap but also allows security teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than getting bogged down in day-to-day alert management.

## Challenges and Considerations

While AI offers tremendous potential in OT security, it's not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the risk of false positives leading to unnecessary operational disruptions. Rodillas cautions, "If you act on a false positive and shut something down, and it causes a downtime and or some safety concern, that's like, ‘ the cure is worse than the problem’ kind of scenario."

To mitigate this risk, Rodillas suggests implementing decision assistance mechanisms that provide context and recommended actions to human operators, rather than relying on fully automated containment.
