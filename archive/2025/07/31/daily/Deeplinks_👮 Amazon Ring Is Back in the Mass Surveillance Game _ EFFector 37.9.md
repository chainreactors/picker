EFF is gearing up to beat the heat in Las Vegas for the summer security conferences! Before we make our journey to the Strip, we figured let's get y'all up-to-speed with a [new edition of EFFector](https://eff.org/effector/37/9).

This time we're covering an [illegal mass surveillance scheme](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/when-your-power-meter-becomes-tool-mass-surveillance) by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District,Â calling out dating apps for [using intimate data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/dating-apps-need-learn-how-consent-works)â€”like sexual preferences or identityâ€”to train AIÂ , and explaining why we'reÂ [backing the Wikimedia Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/we-support-wikimedia-foundations-challenge-uks-online-safety-act) in their challenge to the UKâ€™s Online Safety Act.

Don't forget to also check out our audio companion to EFFector as well! We're interviewing staff about some of the important work that they're doing. This time, EFF Senior Policy Analyst Matthew Guariglia explains how Amazon Ring is [cashing in on the rising tide](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/amazon-ring-cashes-techno-authoritarianism-and-mass-surveillance) of techno-authoritarianism.
