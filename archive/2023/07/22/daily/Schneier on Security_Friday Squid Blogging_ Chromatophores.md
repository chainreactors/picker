## Friday Squid Blogging: Chromatophores

[Neat](https://boingboing.net/2023/07/12/chromatophores-are-the-tiny-blinking-colored-cells-on-this-squids-skin.html):

> Chromatophores are tiny color-changing cells in cephalopods. Watch them [blink back and forth from purple to white on this squid’s skin](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoM7IUcoCdW/) in an Instagram video taken by Drew Chicone…

> It’s completely hypnotic to watch these tiny cells flash with color. It’s as if the squid has a little sky full of twinkling stars on its skin. This has to be one of the coolest looking sea creatures I’ve seen.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Byte of the Apple

Maybe NSO has been outed.

Then, it reallocates certain kernel objects inside those physical pages and manipulates them directly from user space through the dangling PTEs in order to achieve a KRKW primitive, short for “kernel read/write”.

I get “stumble and drop the ball”, but what is “turnover possession”? Sorry I’m not a sports fan, though I used to follow baseball somewhat.
Anyway, I’m not surprised by this. The “five eyes” and others have been going this way for a long time. Don’t expect logic from any of them.

@ Anonymous, ALL,

Re : Held as a spy is not new.

> “Is anyone here at Schneier following this case?”

I’ve no idea, your post is the first information I’ve seen on it. As far as I’m aware it’s not been mentioned in any MSM else where.

> “I still find it unbelievable that something like this is happening in Australia. We’re not talking about Iran or Libya or any other country ran by a deranged despot, this is what now passes for reasonable/enforceable “law of the land” in a five-eyes country.”

Err it has been in Australia before, Canada, New Zeland, UK and US for the last four decades in one way or another.

From the little I’ve seen I suspect you might want to read up on the UK and Matrix-Churchill trial of four business men and seperately executives working for Ordtec. They were all working for the UK “Secret intelligence Service”(SiS) / MI6 but the then independent nutbar “Customs and Excise” started prosecutions and documentation was withheld under “Public interest immunity” and miscarages of justic followed immediately behind. The whole mess started under UK Prime Minister “Mad Maggie” Thatcher, and I know from experience it was inkeeping with her ludicrous style, it went on to blight the succeeding John Major Government, that in turn alowed the worst crook in British politics in then living memory Tony Blair, to get in and aid in starting the Gulf War via the dodgy dossier and worse.

A lot came out in the “Scott Inquiry” that might make your eye brows go up so far that they flip over the top and become a neck warmer…

However I must caution that if you are searching on it I would advise sticking with reputable MSM. In the UK The Guardian and The Independent are as far as I’m aware OK, but treat anything from Rupert “The Bear Faced Liar” Murdoch stable either then or now and the “Weirdo Barclay Twins” with significant caution. As lets just say “online information” has been known to “change with interest and influence” and that include the likes of Wikipedia as well.

That’s about it off the top of my head, I’d need to search around to verify information as “factual” and that can be a slow process at best after more than three decades.

But it still goes on in other ways the lunatic behaviour of John Boulton actively trying to start wars with both China and Iran in any way he could including falsification of information. With able assistance from William Barr should be reasonably fresh in most peoples memory. Why war did not happen shows more about the rational behaviour of both China and Iran than it does about the entire Five-Eyes nations.

For some reason many politicos of a conservitive view point appear not to realise that they are falsely living in a past that never existed. That starting a war is going to be of less than zero benifit because some Nations have more wisely learned the strengths and weaknesses they need to address. Whilst the Five-Eyes continue to “sleepwalk into mayhem of their own making” and are in effect “looking for reds under the bed” yet again. When analysed you will find these conservatives so fond of the “Strong Man” myth are very like Putin and are thus behaving irrationally at best about active conflict.

@Anonymous, Clive R.

I had seen a headline of the case in some MSM, but didn’t give it much attention because of the strange love-hate relationship AU has with CN. There is an intense trade relationship in which both strongly desire to see large quantities of coal, iron ore, wheat moving northwards aross the equator. And there are remnants of the Cold War antipathy in both countries which surface from time to time according to the demands of the domestic politics of each.

Carrying a hand-written “shopping list” does seem like bad tradecraft. Any further comment would be outright speculation …

@ Wannabe techguy, Clive

‘turnover possession’ in this case probably means money capture.

turnover == revenue

The terminology depends upon the country.

“turnover possession”
means to give the ball (in this case political / security/ information advantage) to the other team (which in this case is China)
