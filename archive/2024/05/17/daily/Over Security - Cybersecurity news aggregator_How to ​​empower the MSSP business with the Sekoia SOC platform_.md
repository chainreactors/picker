The managed security service market is blooming. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1230718/managed-security-services-market-it/) states it’s projected to reach 65.53 billion U.S. dollars in 2028. Although this forecast looks promising, MSSPs still compete and seek the right tools to manage multiple clients and enhance their offerings. With the multi-tenant Sekoia SOC platform, MSSPs can centralize management, integrate with any infrastructure, and leverage pre-built playbooks designed to automate repetitive tasks.

In this article, we explain how using the Sekoia SOC platform, designed from the ground up for MSSPs, benefits providers and helps them win and manage SMBs.

## **Sekoia SOC platform for MSSPs: Outstanding features**

Historically, MSSPs have been about outsourcing IT services, often starting with SIEM management. In contrast, MDRs focus on running value-added services, particularly on top of endpoint detection. Seeking to enhance their value proposition, MSSPs are gradually transforming into MDRs.

The Sekoia SOC platform is designed to support this transformation, offering an intuitive eXtended Detection & Response (XDR) approach. The platform enables MSSPs to provide additional value, delivering a multi-source perspective and scalability. Moreover, the Sekoia team prioritizes functionality and features needed by MSSPs managing multiple clients. Let’s consider some of these features.

### **Integrations and compatibility**

The Sekoia SOC platform stands out for its remarkable compatibility, featuring **over 190 integrations** and an effective [Endpoint collection agent](https://docs.sekoia.io/xdr/features/collect/integrations/endpoint/sekoiaio/). The large number of connectors ensures smooth integration with any infrastructure, providing MSSPs with unmatched adaptability.

### **Multi-tenant mode**

The Sekoia SOC platform relies on sub-communities and supports a multi-tenant mode for managing different clients. Sub-community data is isolated and includes events, alerts, assets, and users. However, enabling any rule on all sub-communities is possible in a single click.

The advantage of the multi-tenant mode lies in the ability to manage all Sekoia objects, except alerts and events, from the main platform. This approach greatly facilitates the administration of different subsidiary or client communities. Moreover, centralized management and administration allow MSSPs to apply solutions developed for addressing specific client issues to all communities.

For instance, following the detection of a security alert for a client operating in a particular industry sector, the MSSP formulates a new rule. This rule is then deployed from the main platform, enabling other clients operating in different industry sectors to benefit from this new measure.

### **Automation to streamline processes**

Sekoia.io’s pre-designed playbooks are engineered to save time by automating routine tasks, allowing MSSPs to focus on more strategic initiatives.

The platform allows for defining a playbook template and then easily associates it with specific accounts for each client. This approach significantly streamlines the configuration process. In addition, we offer the possibility to customize rules or playbooks specifically for each client within their respective communities.

These playbooks provide a step-by-step approach to orchestration, helping establish standardized incident response processes and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks. Finally, playbooks help MSSPs reduce response time in case of security alerts.

## **Key Benefits of the Sekoia SOC platform** for MSSPs

To start with, the Sekoia SOC platform provides real-time threat detection and response and can be customized to fit specific organizational needs. MSSPs cater the platform to the unique requirements of each customer, using customizable integrations and rules.

The platform’s integration of native, contextual CTI bolsters operational efficiency and threat response capabilities. Also, **Sekoia.io offers a rationalized pricing model based on the number of assets protected,** not on the volume of data.

Other benefits of the Sekoia SOC platform for MSSPs include:

#### **1. Intuitive system**

For MSSPs, Sekoia.io offers an intuitive sub-community system that simplifies client management, maintaining strict confidentiality and high security standards. This system is supported by a unified rule catalog, allowing rule activation across multiple client networks. Integrated intelligence capabilities and efficient alert management further elevate the platform’s threat detection, threat hunting, and incident handling across client environments.

#### **2. Proactive incident management**

Sekoia.io is transforming the landscape of security operations centers with its innovative integrated SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform, designed to supercharge analyst productivity. The platform responds to security threats as they occur and proactively prevents them, leveraging advanced tools to anticipate and neutralize risks before they can cause harm. Such proactive incident management is essential in maintaining the integrity and security of IT environments.

#### **3. Cost-efficiency**

The operational efficiency gained through automation, particularly in EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) monitoring, significantly reduces ...
