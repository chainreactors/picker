I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

*This is the third and penultimate post in a series about theoretical weaknesses in Fiat-Shamir as applied to proof systems. The first post is [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/04/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-1/), the second post is [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/06/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-2/), and you should probably read them.*

Over the past two posts I’ve given a bit of background on four subjects: (1) interactive proof systems (for general programs/circuits), (2) the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, (3) random oracles. We’ve also talked about (4) recursive proofs, which will be important but are not *immediately* relevant.

With all that background we are *finally* almost ready to talk about the new result by Khovratovich, Rothblum and Soukhanov entitled “[How to Prove False Statements: Practical Attacks on Fiat-Shamir](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/118)” (which we will call KRS for short.)

### Let’s get situated

The KRS result deals with a very common situation that we introduced in the previous post. Namely, that many new proving systems are first developed as interactive protocols (usually called [public-coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_proof_system#Public_coin_protocol_versus_private_coin_protocol) protocols, or sometimes [Sigma protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_knowledge#Sigma_protocols).) These protocols fit into a template: first, a Prover first sends a *commitment* message, then interacts with some (honest) Verifier who “challenges” the Prover in various ways that are specific to the protocol; for each challenge, the Prover must respond correctly, either once or multiple times. The nature of the challenges can vary from scheme to scheme. For now we don’t care about the details: the commonality is that in the interactive setting the Verifier picks its challenges honestly, using real randomness.

![](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-6.png)

In many cases, these protocols are then “flattened” down into a non-interactive proof using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. The neat thing is that the Prover can run the interactive protocol all by itself, by running a deterministic “copy” of the Verifier. Specifically, the Prover will:

1. Cryptographically hash its own Commitment message — along with some extra information, such as the input/output and “circuit” (or program, or statement.)1
2. Use the resulting hash digest bits to sample a challenge.
3. Compute the Prover’s response to the challenge (many times if the protocol calls for this.)
4. Publish the whole transcript for anyone to verify.

Protocol designers focus on the interactive setting because it’s relatively easy to analyze the security of the protocol. They can make strong claims about the nature of the challenges that will be chosen, and can then reason about the probability that a cheating Prover can lie in response. The hope with Fiat-Shamir is that, if the hash function is “as good as” a random oracle, it should be nearly as secure as the interactive protocol.

Of course none...
