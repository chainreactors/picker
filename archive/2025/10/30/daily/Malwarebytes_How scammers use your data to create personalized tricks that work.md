# How scammers use your data to create personalized tricks that work

Posted: October 30, 2025
 by [Matt Burgess](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mburgess)

Think of your digital footprint as your online shadow—the trail you leave behind whenever you browse, post, shop, or even appear in someone’s contact list. It’s your likes, reviews, comments, and all the little traces you didn’t mean to share. Together, they paint a picture of you—one that friends, employers, and yes, scammers can see.

### Step 1:  Your active footprint

Your **active footprint** is everything you choose to share online. Every photo, product review, or status update you post adds another brushstroke to your online portrait. Over time, those choices form a public story about who you are—your interests, values, and connections. That story shapes how people, employers, and even algorithms see you.

### Step 2: Your passive footprint

Your **passive footprint** is the quieter one—the data you leave behind without meaning to. Every website you visit, every cookie that tracks your clicks, every photo that quietly tags its GPS location adds to it. These fragments often work in the background, invisible but persistent, quietly mapping your habits, preferences, and even your movements.

## You step in more stuff than you think

Your personal data is scattered in more places than you’d expect. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok hold snapshots of your life and relationships. Government databases, company websites, and news mentions might hold your name or location. Forums, review sites, and shopping accounts keep their own records. And data brokers collect and sell huge bundles of personal details, sometimes packaging them into lists anyone can buy. Even if you’ve never shared something directly, chances are it’s already out there.

Alone, small details don’t seem like much—a nickname here, a photo there—but stitched together they can reveal a lot. Your job title, home city, favorite restaurant, even your pet’s name (a popular security question!) can help someone impersonate or target you. Combine that with info leaked in data breaches, and attackers can build an eerily complete version of you—ready-made for scams or identity theft.

## How scammers collect your data

To stay safe, it helps to see the world the way a scammer does: your online details are puzzle pieces, and they’re putting the picture together.

**Scraping**

Attackers use automated tools to pull information from public pages across the internet. That can include your bio, job history, or photos from social media, or your name and email address from company websites and online forums. All technically “public,” but when combined, they create a full dossier of your online life.

**Breaches**

When companies get hacked or fail to secure their databases, your data can spill into the open. Big names like Equifax, LinkedIn, and Yahoo have all been hit. Leaks like these often contain names, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords—and once data hits the dark web, it can circulate for years. That’s why old breaches can still come back to haunt you.

**Brokers**

Data brokers legally collect information from public records and commercial sources, then sell detailed profiles for advertising and risk scoring. On the dark web, things get murkier: stolen logins, payment info, and even full identity kits (“fullz”) are traded by criminals...
