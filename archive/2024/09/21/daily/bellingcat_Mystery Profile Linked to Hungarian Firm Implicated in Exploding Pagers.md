# Mystery Profile Linked to Hungarian Firm Implicated in Exploding Pagers

September 20, 2024

Dozens of people [were killed and thousands more injured](https://x.com/timourazhari/status/1836727467995709776) after two consecutive days of explosions across Lebanon this week that the Shia militant group Hezbollah has blamed on Israel.

Pagers used by Hezbollah members detonated simultaneously on Tuesday afternoon, leaving at least 12 people dead, including two children.

On Wednesday, another wave of coordinated explosions affecting handheld radios killed at least 25 people. Almost 3,000 people were wounded in the attacks, Lebanon’s health ministry said.

Israel has not commented on the attack, but the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff [said in a video](https://t.me/idfofficial/10135) after the explosions that Israel has “many more capabilities” to be used against Hezbollah.

Hezbollah has [vowed to retaliate](https://t.me/C_Military1/59634) for the major security breach, with the [group’s leader saying](https://x.com/phildstewart/status/1836795610315239558) the attacks “could be considered war crimes or a declaration of war”.

Meanwhile, Bellingcat has identified a suspicious social media profile for a manager at BAC Consulting, the Hungarian firm under increasing scrutiny over its link to the exploding pagers.

## Geolocating Tuesday’s Explosions

Bellingcat has verified and geolocated footage of the deadly blasts and their aftermath this week. Some occurred in Haret Hreik, a known Hezbollah stronghold south of Beirut.

Footage and images posted to social media showed devices exploding in people’s hands or on their hips. In one [video](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1836035325388349630) taken from CCTV footage in a grocery store, a man with a satchel slung across his body is at a produce stand next to three other individuals.

The man’s satchel appears to explode and he collapses to the ground as the people around him flee. The man’s satchel, which can be seen towards the end of the video, is visibly damaged with the bottom section missing and the contents on the floor. Bellingcat geolocated the footage to the [Yahay’s supermarket](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e9Dbz4vfHCKs4pgo8) in Haret Hreik ([33.854741, 35.501362](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fpLMCSesii2KTdU97)).

According to [Reuters](https://www.yahoo.com/news/factbox-know-far-deadly-pager-174837794.html?guccounter=1), the detonations started about 3:30pm local time on Tuesday and continued for about an hour. A timestamp on the grocery store video supports this claim, with footage showing the detonation in the man’s satchel occurred at 3:30pm.

Multiple videos posted online show the moment of the explosions and aftermath. In some videos bloodied victims can be seen with missing fingers or severe injuries to their arms, face or thighs.

Some videos show Beirut hospital wards full with people reportedly brought in due to pager injuries. We geolocated [one of these videos](https://x.com/Osint613/status/1836040863195029530) to Bahman Hospital ([33.853555, 35.506011](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xuJvh9RSKWdYLbZHA)), also in the Haret Hreik area.

## What We Know About the Pagers

[Two images shared on X](https://x.com/michaelh992/status/1836046036365607163) show what appear to be the remnants of pagers that exploded on Tuesday. Details in both photos give clues about the exact model of the pagers, though it cannot be ruled out that other models were also targeted.

In the photos, partial details of the back of the pager show the words “Distri”, “Model” and “Freq”. There is also a partial barcode. The “Distri” description is followed by “GOLD”, while the “Model” description is followed by partially visible letters “AR” and possibly the number nine. In one of the images, the “Freq” description is followed by the number four.

These labels indicate that the pagers were likely the [Gold Apollo AR-924 Rugged Pager](https://www.gapollo.com.tw/product/ar-924/) model. Gold Apollo is a Taiwanese company specialising in the production of wireless paging systems.

In a [statement](https://www.gapollo.com.tw/) released on September 18, Gold Apollo said the exploded pagers were not produced in Taiwan. The company said it had established a long-term partnership with BAC Consulting, a Hungarian firm that was contracted to use its brand. “This model is produced and sold by BAC,” Gold Apollo said.

In turn, BAC Consulting denied any involvement, with its CEO Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono [telling NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/taiwan-firm-denies-making-pagers-used-lebanon-explosions-rcna171594): “I don’t make the pagers. I a...
