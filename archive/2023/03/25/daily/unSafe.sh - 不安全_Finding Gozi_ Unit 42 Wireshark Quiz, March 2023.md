## Executive Summary

The Palo Alto Networks [Unit 42 Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel) tweeted Monday, March 6, 2023, about [Gozi (ISFB/Ursnif) malware targeting Italy](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1633952529804304384). Also known as ISFB or Ursnif, [Gozi malware](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.gozi) or its variants have been part of our cyberthreat landscape for the past several years. Gozi generates distinct traffic patterns during post-infection activity.

This month's Unit 42 Wireshark quiz presents real-world traffic from a Gozi infection in an Active Directory (AD) environment. Participants are asked questions based on the network activity. A separate Unit 42 blog post will provide the answers.

Participants will review a packet capture (pcap) from the infection to answer our quiz questions. While designed for security professionals who focus on suspicious network activity, anyone can participate. Participants should understand basic network traffic concepts and be familiar with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to get the most benefit.

Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from Gozi and other malware through [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) and our [Next-Generation Firewall](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) with [Cloud-Delivered Security Services](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions), including [WildFire](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/wildfire) and [Advanced Threat Prevention](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-threat-prevention).

[Scenario](#post-127301-_wven14kmgum2)

## Scenario

A threat hunt revealed the same activity seen from [the Unit 42 tweet](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic/status/1633952529804304384) in your organization Tuesday, March 7, 2023, at approximately 02:07 UTC.

Details of the local area network (LAN) for this month’s exercise follow.

* LAN segment range: 172.16.1[.]0/24 (172.16.1[.]1 through 172.16.1[.]255)
* Domain: pcapworkshop[.]net
* Domain Controller IP address: 172.16.1[.]16
* Domain Controller host name: PCAPWORKSHOP-DC
* LAN segment gateway: 172.16.1[.]1
* Land segment broadcast address: 172.16.1[.]255

Your Security Operations Center (SOC) provides a pcap, and you are tasked to determine who was infected. You should also find any notable differences between indicators from this month’s exercise pcap and [indicators from this Gozi activity previously reported by Unit 42](https://github.com/pan-unit42/tweets/blob/master/2023-03-06-IOCs-for-Gozi-infection.txt).

## Requirements

This quiz requires [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to review pcap files. However, Wireshark’s default settings are not optimized for web-based traffic commonly generated by malware. Therefore, we encourage participants in this quiz to customize Wireshark after installing it. To help, Unit 42 has published [a series of tutorials and videos](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-workshop-videos/) that include customizing Wireshark.

We recommend using a 3.x or later version of Wireshark, since it has more features, capabilities and bug fixes over previous Wireshark versions.

Furthermore, we recommend using a non-Windows environment like BSD, Linux or macOS to analyze malicious traffic. Malware traffic could contain malicious code targeting Microsoft Windows. This presents a risk of infection if participants use a Windows computer to analyze the pcap.

## Quiz Material

To obtain the pcap for this month’s quiz, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pan-unit42/Wireshark-quizzes/blob/main/2023-03-Unit42-Wireshark-quiz.pcap.zip). Download the ZIP archive and extract the pcap as shown below in Figures 1 and 2. Use *infected* as the password to unlock the ZIP archive.

![Image 1 is a screenshot of Wireshark software showing where to click to download the ZIP archive from GitHub. The inset window shows where to put the zip file name. ](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/word-image-127301-2.jpeg)

## Questions

For this month’s Wireshark Quiz, answer the following questions:

* What is the IP address, host name and Windows user account name for the infected Windows client?
* What is the URL and SHA-256 hash of the ZIP archive downloaded by the infected Windows host?
* Can you find any notable differences between indicators from this Gozi infection and indicators [from Gozi on March 6, 2023, reported by Unit 42](https://github.com/pan-unit42/tweets/blob/master/2023-03-06-IOCs-for-Gozi-infection.txt)?

## Conclusion

Palo Alto Networks encourages the security community to continue developing our skills, so we can better protect ourselves against criminals and other cyberthreats. This month’s Wireshark quiz can help participants better detect Gozi, one of many different malware families in our current threat landscape.

The answers to this month’s Unit 42 Wireshark quiz will be published in a separate blog post on Monday, March 27.

Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from Gozi and other malware through [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) and our [Next-Generation Firewall](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) with [Cloud-Delivered Security Services](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions), including [WildFire](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/wildfire) and [Advanced Threat Prevention](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-threat-prevention).
