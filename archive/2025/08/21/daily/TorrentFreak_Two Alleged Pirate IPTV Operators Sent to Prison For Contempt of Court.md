Two men said to be the operators of SmoothStreams, a pirate IPTV service shut down by entertainment companies over three years ago, have been imprisoned in Canada. Marshall Macciacchera and his father Antonio were both found guilty of contempt and sentenced to an initial term of six months. Marshall's sentence will continue until he complies with a court order to hand over financial information and a laptop password, among other things.

[![smoothstreams](https://torrentfreak.com/images/smoothstreams.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/smoothstreams.png)A little over three years ago, SmoothStreams was considered one the most reliable and well-known pirate IPTV providers. Several years of what appeared to be fairly plain sailing in relatively calm waters proved to be deceptive.

Following a years-long investigation, a huge coalition of entertainment industry companies including Bell Media and Rogers Media, members of MPA-Canada (Motion Picture Association Canada) and ACE (Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment), were preparing to shut SmoothStreams down.

## The End of SmoothStreams

On June 17, 2022, Bell, Rogers, Disney, Paramount, Columbia, Warner Bros., and Universal filed a statement of claim against Marshall Macciacchera and Antonio Macciacchera (son and father respectively). According to the plaintiffs, these men were not just the operators of SmoothStreams, but were also behind several linked platforms including live247.tv, StreamTVNow.tv and StarStreams.tv.

Armed with an Anton Piller order issued by judge, the plan was to gain entry to various premises and quickly secure crucial evidence to prevent tampering or even destruction. With potential prison sentences for failing to respect this type of order, those targeted are expected to comply and that’s usually what happens. [Not here](https://torrentfreak.com/smoothstreams-iptv-shut-down-by-mpa-ace-after-secret-legal-process-220730/).

As individuals their responses differed, but the bottom line was broadly the same for both men. Neither fully complied with the order and for that there would be consequences. The men were [accused](https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-smoothstreams-iptv-operators-accused-of-contempt-of-court-221007/) of contempt of court, an offense punishable by fines or even a custodial sentence.

## The Long Haul and Mounting Costs

The substantial [end of SmoothStreams](https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-v-s-smoothstreams-iptv-server-photos-shutdown-details-emerge-221213/) was never really in doubt but whether there would ever be a normal trial was a completely different matter.

The plaintiffs quickly sought an order finding Marshall Macciacchera and several affiliated companies in contempt for failing to comply with the terms of an interim order. Failure to make financial disclosures, refusing to answer questions regarding assets, and failure to provide login credentials led to Marshall and the companies being charged with contempt in July 2022.

## All Defendants Found Guilty of Contempt

Antonio faced a separate proceeding and a [contempt judgment](https://torrentfreak.com/judge-hits-pirate-iptv-defendant-with-71-1k-contempt-of-court-order-231219/) in the summer of 2023. He was ordered to pay ~CAD$95,000 (~US$70,900) to the plaintiffs to cover their costs.

In Marshall’s case, a contempt hearing spanning four days took place in April 2023, with additional submissions on five occasions to January 2024. The court concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the terms of the interim order were knowingly breached; Marshall and three affiliated companies – Arm Hosting Inc., Star Hosting Limited, and Roma Works Limited – were all found guilty of contempt.

In an order dated August 21, 2024, the defendants were instructed to pay a [lump sum amount of CAD$375,312.93 (~US$270,600)](https://torrentfreak.com/bell-rogers-mpas-pirate-iptv-lawsuit-is-a-slow-motion-money-pit-nightmare-240903/) to cover the plaintiffs’ costs, an amount for which they were held jointly and severally liable.

For Marshall and Antonio, these costs were just the beginning; penalties for contempt were yet to be decided.

## Plaintiffs Demand Custodial Sentences

The entertainment company plaintiffs informed the defendants that they would seek an initial term of imprisonment of up to six months for both men, to continue until they complied with the terms of the interim order. They were expected to “cure their contempt” by providing the information, documentation, and passwords that they had been ordered to provide.

The proposals put forth by Antonio and Marshall were considerably less punitive.

Antonio recommended that he should receive a 30-day term of imprisonment to be served on weekends, or 30 days of house arrest, for failing to provide financial information.

Marshall proposed a prison term of one week for his failure to comply with the terms of the interim order, without an offer to provide the plaintiffs with passwords, documents, and other information.

Concerned that custodial sentences would elevate flight risk, the plaintiffs highlighted track records of non-compliance, almost 100 questions yet to be answered, and significant costs yet to be paid, together representing an ongoing challenge to the Court’s authority. Marshall’s response to the plaintiffs asking whether he intended to cure his contempt by handing over a password, was provided to the court as an example.

*Provide the password? Still ‘No’**![password-no-can-do](https://torrentfreak.com/images/password-no-can-do.png)*>

After thorough consideration, the Court [ordered](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2025/2025fc461/2025fc461.html) Marshall and Antonio to surrender their passports to the Federal Court no later than 09:00 on the first day of their penalty hearing. There they would remain under seal until delivery of their penalty judgment, to be returned only when all appeals had been exhausted.

## Order For Marshall’s Arrest

Throughout this entire case the majority of filings have remained unavailable to the public. An order dated August 15 was just the latest in a long line but a public note suggested that freedom had indeed been taken off the table.

> *Reasons for Order and Order dated 15-AUG-2025 rendered by Chief Justice Crampton. Matter considered with personal appearance. The Court’s decision is with regard to Special Case Result:*
>
> “YOU ARE HEREBY ORDERED to: 1. Arrest Marshall Macciacchera, whose last known address is XXX-XXXX XXXXX XXXXXXX XXXX Woodbridge, Ontario XXX XXX, if it is necessary to do so in order to take him into custody.”

A follow-up note provides [valuable context](https://www.ippractice.ca/file-browser/?fileno=T-1257-22) and reveals the fate of both men.

The court found that the defendants showed blatant disregard for the orders, which aimed to prevent the destruction of evidence and transfer of funds outside the jurisdiction.
