![Digital Services Act - recommender systems](https://securityonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/banner-3370970_640.jpg)

In a significant move to enforce the Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Commission has [issued](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-sends-requests-information-youtube-snapchat-and-tiktok-recommender-systems-under-digital) formal requests for information to YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok, demanding detailed insights into the design and operation of their recommender systems. This action underscores the Commissionâ€™s commitment to mitigating systemic risks associated with these algorithms, particularly concerning user safety and the dissemination of harmful content.

The Commissionâ€™s inquiry specifically targets the mechanisms by which these platformsâ€™ algorithms amplify content, potentially influencing electoral processes, civic discourse, and user mental well-being. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for these systems to promote addictive behaviors, facilitate the spread of illegal content such as hate speech and illicit drug promotion, and contribute to the formation of online echo chambers.

[![CVE Watchtower](https://securityonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/721.png)](https://securityonline.info/CVE-WATCHTOWER)

YouTube and Snapchat are required to disclose the specific parameters driving their content recommendation algorithms and outline the measures employed to mitigate the aforementioned risks. TikTok, already subject to non-compliance proceedings under the DSA, faces additional scrutiny regarding its efforts to prevent malicious manipulation of its platform and address potential threats to electoral integrity and media pluralism.

These platforms are obligated to provide comprehensive responses by November 15th. Failure to comply with the request for information or the provision of inaccurate or misleading information could result in substantial fines or the initiation of formal proceedings under Article 66 of the DSA. This may ultimately lead to the imposition of periodic penalty payments.
