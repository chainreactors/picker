Elber Reble610 M/ODU XPIC IP-ASI-SDH Microwave Link Authentication Bypass

Vendor: Elber S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.elber.it
Affected version: 0.01 Revision 0

Summary: The REBLE610 features an accurate hardware design, absence of
internal cabling and full modularity. The unit is composed by a basic
chassis with 4 extractable boards which makes maintenance and critical
operations, like frequency modification, easy and efficient. The modular
approach has brought to the development of the digital processing module
(containing modulator, demodulator and data interface) and the RF module
(containing Transmitter, Receiver and channel filters). From an RF point
of view, the new transmission circuitry is able to guarantee around 1 Watt
with every modulation scheme, introducing, in addition, wideband precorrection
(up to 1GHz depending on frequency band).

Desc: The device suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability through
a direct and unauthorized access to the password management functionality. The
issue allows attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the set_pwd
endpoint that enables them to overwrite the password of any user within the
system. This grants unauthorized and administrative access to protected areas
of the application compromising the device's system security.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the su...
