SAP Analytics Cloud QRC release calendar 2023

SAP Analytics Cloud, as all cloud products, may have an optional, no-impact release on harmonized monthly feature delivery weekends.

As with the quarterly releases, each product has the option to release during any or all of these windows. Customers should not need to prepare for or take action for the monthly feature deliveries.

Note: Content can only be moved between systems on different release cycles at the time of a quarterly release cycle update.

To transport using Content Network: The source and destination systems need to be on the same quarterly version of SAP Analytics Cloud, or the following quarterly version. If the importing system is on an older version, the package wonâ€™t appear. If itâ€™s two or more versions ahead of the exporting system, the packageâ€™s content may not be supported.

Using the Transport (file) Method (zipped / .TGZ files) â€“ Content can only be imported in the same version of the application from which it was exported, or the subsequent version.Â After your system is upgraded again, you cannot import the content.
