Bruce, there is a type. It should be Trusted Execution Environment.

Not sure in other TEEs, but at least Intel¬Æ Software Guard Extensions‚Ñ¢ (SGX) has fixed some of the vulnerabilities described in this article in the last years by means of firmware upgrades.

It would be great if current operating systems start using these TEEs; even if these enclaves are far from being perfect, they are another layer in a security model. Right now we have limited support for VM memory encryption, but no way to use SGX to ‚Äîwe say‚Äî store OpenSSH encryption keys. Only Linux has some sort of support for SGX, but up to my knowledge it is not enabled by default.

@ Rene Bastien

Agreed, I guess Bruce has worked too much on encryption. üòâ

Markus Friedl has done a great work supporting SGX as a FIDO-style authenticator; however, being an OpenBSD developer, his work is available only on Linux. It is sad not having support for SGX in OpenBSD.
