There are no tricks in [EFF's EFFector newsletter](https://eff.org/effector), just treats to keep you up-to-date on the latest in the fight for digital privacy and free expression.

Catch the conversation on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ym27zUlaRxE) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.15).
