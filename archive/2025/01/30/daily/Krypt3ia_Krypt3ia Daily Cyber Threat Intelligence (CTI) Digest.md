### **üö® Top Headlines**

### **OpenAI says DeepSeek used its models illegally, and it has evidence to prove it, new report claims**

**Summary:** According to a new article by [the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6), [OpenAI](https://www.techradar.com/tag/openai) claims to have evidence that [DeepSeek](https://www.techradar.com/computing/social-media/what-is-deepseek-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-chatgpt-rival-thats-taken-the-app-store-by-storm), the Chinese startup that has thrown the US tech market into financial turmoil, used the company‚Äôs proprietary models to train its own open-source LLM, called R1. This would represent a potential breach of intellectual property, as it goes against the OpenAI terms of service agreement.
