**Summary and Objective**

In today’s global economy with increased global trade, multinational corporations across various industries are rethinking and restructuring their supply chain models to distribute their products in a more efficient and agile way to reduce cost and achieve top and bottom-line growth. Inventory optimization, reducing material, labor and transportation are all well-known means of achieving reduction in cost of goods sold. In addition, tax incentives and contractual flexibility and openness provided by many countries, along with developments in technology and supply chain applications have provided opportunities for optimizing the financial flow of goods across international boundaries. Tax Efficient Supply Chain is such a model to reduce the overall effective tax rate of the corporation and provide significant financial and tax benefits. This has been a common practice in many industries, esp. Pharmaceutical/Life Sciences and High-Tech.

This blog article will explore operational and financial considerations for this supply chain model and some leading practices and methods to enable this model in SAP and S/4HANA ERP.

**Tax Efficient Supply Chain: An Overview**

Tax Efficient Supply Chain is a supply chain model that considers tax as an integral part of the overall operational supply chain processes to optimize global effective tax rates. It is designed to produce flexible tax planning that is operationally driven to achieve long-term reduction in effective tax rate as well as supply chain efficiency, cost reduction and inventory optimization while balancing customer service level. This requires corporations to undertake several strategic, operational, financial, Intellectual Property and systems design actions. The setup efforts and costs maybe substantial but are strategic investments to realize long term benefits and returns.

There are few key characteristics of a business that will benefit from this model:

* Business is multinational with revenues reported in multiple regions

* Multi geography cross-border transfer of goods volume is high

* High domestic effective tax rate

* Decentralized operations with complex global supply chain and distribution models

* Significant Research and Development spend and possession of Intellectual Property

* Manufacturing and Sourcing setup in low-cost geographies for cost optimization

The fundamental concept for such a supply chain design is to establish a “Principal” company -a legal entity in a lower tax jurisdiction/geography - a number of European jurisdictions e.g. Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg etc. provide opportunities for low corporate taxation. The Principal company serves as the Logistics Hub entity and is responsible for purchasing goods from internal manufacturing plants or external manufacturing entities (contract or toll manufacturing) and then selling the goods to other Selling/Operating companies located in the various end customer markets through intercompany sales. The local operating companies then perform the final sale to the end customers.

The underlying mechanism is to shift appropriate amount of functions, assets and risks to the Principal to justify the allocation of taxable entrepreneurial profit and thus get tax advantage from low tax rate in that jurisdiction. The Principal company or the Hub entity should be allocated more management control and business risks (e.g. Inventory risk, Credit risk, Warranty risk, Pricing risk) to be entitled for the entrepreneurial profits while the local Selling/Operating entities should perform routine functions and have limited business risks to receive a relatively low profit level. Hence, the structuring and allocation of value adding functions and commercial risks between the Principal company and the local Selling/Operating companies are critical in the design of such a tax optimized model.

**Business Process/Operational Design Considerations**

The design and setup of the Tax Efficient Supply Chain model requires cross-functional collaboration across supply chain operations, tax, finance, sales and system integrators. It involves some fundamental restructuring of the overall supply chain or value chain of a global corporation. Hence it is imperative that a cross-section of business, finance and tax experts of the organization perform a complete business case including a cost-benefit analysis for some of the key considerations:

* Restructuring and reallocation of value adding functions, assets and commercial risks (e.g. Inventory risk, Credit risk, Warranty risk, Pricing risk, Volume risk etc.) between the Principal entity and local Selling /Operating entities

* Opportunity to optimize the overall supply efficiencies through centralizing key business functions while reallocating business functions and risks -e.g., Sourcing and Procurement, Demand and Supply planning, Inventory Management and optimization across the network, Customer service, Back-office operations and so on

* Legal entity structure, Transfer Pricing compliance for regulatory requirements with local government bodies

* Integrating 3PL companies to manage Principal owned DCs for physical distribution of goods can be complex due to both operational and systems integration perspectives of this supply chain model and need to be analyzed and designed thoroughly

* Returns and Warranties processes also can be complex due to the embedded intercompany transactions in the model that needs to be analyzed against the volume of such return transactions and designed for efficiency
