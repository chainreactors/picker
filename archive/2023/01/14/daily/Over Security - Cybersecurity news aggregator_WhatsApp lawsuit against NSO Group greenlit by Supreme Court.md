# WhatsApp lawsuit against NSO Group greenlit by Supreme Court

Posted: January 12, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

On Monday, the US Supreme Court [denied](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-1338.html) the NSO Group’s petition for a *[writ of certiorari](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/writ%20of%20certiorari)*, a request to the high court to review its case, signaling that Meta’s WhatsApp can go ahead with its case against the Israeli-based company behind the [Pegasus spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog?s=pegasus). The court didn’t explain why it refused to hear the NSO’s appeal.

If you recall, WhatsApp [filed](https://www.openglobalrights.org/whatsapp-sues-nso-group-surveillance-tech/) a [lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6532395-WhatsApp-complaint.html) against NSO in 2019 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for allegedly targeting and installing [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) on roughly 1,400 devices of its global users, including human rights activists, journalists, and government officials.

NSO group allegedly did this by exploiting [a then zero-day vulnerability](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/05/whatsapp-fix-goes-live-after-targeted-attack-on-human-rights-lawyer) in WhatsAapp. Based on a [detailed timeline](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/nso-group-lawsuit-re-hacking-whatsapp-users/#timeline) of the case, NSO said it is protected by the [Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA)](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/2-502-5645?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)), which shields foreign government officials from common law, making it immune to the lawsuit—an argument district court judges in California were unconvinced by.

The company then filed a motion to dismiss the case in the US Court of Appeals, insisting it should be granted immunity, much to the dismay of a number of organizations: Microsoft, Google, Cisco, GitHub, LinkedIn, VMWare, and Internet Association (IA). These companies then banded together to file [an amicus brief](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2020/12/NSO-v.-WhatsApp-Amicus-Brief-Microsoft-et-al.-as-filed.pdf) supporting WhatsApp’s case.

[Microsoft said](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/21/cyber-immunity-nso/):

> “We believe the NSO Group’s business model is dangerous and that such immunity would enable it and other PSOAs to continue their dangerous business without legal rules, responsibilities or repercussions. The expansion of sovereign immunity that NSO seeks would further encourage the burgeoning cyber-surveillance industry to develop, sell and use tools to [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) vulnerabilities in violation of US law. Private companies should remain subject to liability when they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they’re trying to achieve.”

Eventually, the Appeals Court rejected NSO’s appeal.

Appeals Court judge Danielle Forrest [wrote](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NSO-Group-ruling-9th-Circuit.pdf) in a unanimous opinion:

> “NSO does not contend that it meets the FSIA’s definition of ‘foreign state,’ and, of course, it cannot. It is not itself a sovereign. NSO is a private corporation that provides p...
