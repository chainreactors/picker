Nowadays, the term **DDoS** — or **Distributed Denial of Service** — raises the heart rate of most webmasters. Though many don’t know exactly what DDoSing is, they might be familiar with the effects of getting DDoSed: an extremely sluggish, dysfunctional, or entirely shut down website.

In this article, we’ll define DDoSing, discuss the most common symptoms, and detail how to tell if you’ve been DDoSed. We’ll also cover tips to spot denial-of-service and what you can do to protect your website from future DDoS attacks.

## What is DDoSing?

DDoSing, or “Distributed Denial of Service,” is an aggressive form of cyber-attack where a network of ‘hijacked’ computers is used to flood a website’s server with traffic.

At a basic level, DDoS attacks are something like gridlock at a busy intersection — if enough traffic arrives all at once, then the heavy congestion turns into a jam and nobody can get through to the other side.

Here’s another analogy: Imagine you have a small store that can only fit 10 people at a time. Now imagine 100 people trying to get in all at once — it would be chaotic, right? But eventually, your store might even have to close down for a bit because there’s not enough resources for everyone. And that’s what DDoSing does to a website

## What services does DDoS target?

DDoS attacks can target a wide range of services, including:

* websites
* game servers
* internet service providers (ISPs)
* the Nasdaq Stock Market
* a NASA probe

Practically anything connected to the internet is a potential target for DDoS.

The same goes for the source of DDoS attacks: Common culprits include hacked web servers and “internet of things” devices like smart appliances, routers, and even CCTV cameras.

Causes can be accidental or intentional. But a large criminal industry has grown around offering DDoS attacks as a service. There’s a market for attacks on sites, including competitors looking to tarnish others’ reputations and those denying online presence for political reasons.

## Is DDoSing illegal?

Yes, DDoSing is illegal and many countries including the U.S. have [strict laws](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/anchorage/fbi-intensify-efforts-to-combat-illegal-ddos-attacks) against it. After all, it’s a form of online vandalism that can do serious harm to a website or online service. Not only does the act wreaks havoc on targeted sites, but it can also affect innocent computers that are ‘hijacked’ to support the attack.

## How to tell if you’re being DDoSed

But how can you tell if your website is suddenly *very* popular or if it’s being DDoSed? Well, it can be tricky. Symptoms of a DDoS attack can mimic issues you might find on your computer — slow access to website files, inability to access websites, or even problems with internet connection.

However, there are a few main indicators that you might be facing a denial of service attack and leveraging website monitoring tools can help you spot them.

If you’re experiencing one or more of these ten symptoms, it’s a sign you might be getting DDoSed:

1. A sudden influx of requests to a specific endpoint or page.
2. A flood of traffic that originates from a single IP or range of IP addresses.
3. A sudden spike of traffic that occurs at regular intervals or at unusual time frames.
4. Problems accessing your website.
5. Files load slowly or not at all.
6. Slow or unresponsive servers, including “too many connections” error notices.
7. A flood of traffic com...
