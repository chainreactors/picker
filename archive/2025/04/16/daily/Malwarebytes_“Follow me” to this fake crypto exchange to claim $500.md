# “Follow me” to this fake crypto exchange to claim $500

Posted: April 15, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A type of [crypto](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) scam that we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/whatsapp-cryptocurrency-scam-goes-for-the-cash-prize) about in 2024 has ported over to a new platform and changed tactics—a bit.

Where the old scams mostly reached me on WhatsApp, the same group of scammers is now using Direct Messages on X. However, the same old trick of “accidentally” sending you login details to a supposedly well-funded financial account is still being used by at least one cybercriminal gang.

![account details sent to Sean](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/misdirected.png)

Oops, I’m not Sean

> “Sean, your financial management account has been opened. {account details}. Please keep your accoount password safe and do not share it with anyone.”

What’s interesting is that this tactic, which we reported on previously, is coming from a different group than the one included in previous coverage from last year. That earlier gang has now changed their messaging, including references to “follow” a person through cyberspace.

![Follow me, lucky prize](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/eugwmkaj.png)

Follow me

> “Follow me to unlock a lucky prize! Click the link below to claim $500!
>
> No conditions, just follow me! “

In this version, the scammers will also send you the login details for a fake crypto exchange with access to a healthy wallet.

![2,685,012.00 USDT sounds amazing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/healthy_wallet.png)

*2,685,012.00 USDT sounds amazing*

The idea is to give the targets of the scam the impression that they can move that wealth to a wallet of their own. After all, they have the login details for this account. But many others might have those too, since the message was sent to 148 other people. So, you’ll have to hurry and not overthink things too much, right?

Wrong! At some point you’ll find out that you will have to buy a VIP account to transfer the funds to your own account. And that’s what this scam is all about.

## **Don’t fall for scammers**

* Any unsolicited Direct Messages from an unknown person are suspect. No matter how harmless or friendly it may seem. Remember, most [pig butchering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/pig-butchering-scams-how-they-work-and-how-to-avoid-them) scams start with what seems a misdirected message.
* Don’t follow links that reach you in any unexpected way, and certainly not from an untrusted source.
* If it’s too good to be true, then it probably is.
* Scammers bank on the fact that the more time and money you have invested, the more determined you will become to get to the desired end result.
* Use a web filtering app to shield you from known malicious websites, such as [Malwarebytes Premium](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium) or [Malwarebytes Browser Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard).
