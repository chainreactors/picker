# Film companies lose battle to unmask Reddit users

Posted: August 3, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

An interesting case marking the limits of what data big business can expect to dig up has concluded its day (or to be more accurate, many days) in court. Ars Technica reports that film companies have [lost their battle](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/reddit-beats-film-industry-wont-have-to-identify-users-who-admitted-torrenting/) to make social site Reddit identify anonymous users discussing piracy. No fewer than 20 popular movie producers felt they needed this information in order to show that ISP Grande is liable for their subscriber’s copyright infringement.

Reddit was urging a US court to maintain the anonymity of six Reddit users who’d [mentioned piracy all the way back in 2011 and 2018](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/07/film-companies-demand-names-of-reddit-users-who-discussed-piracy-in-2011/). Reddit argued that the First Amendment “protected their right to anonymous speech” in one of several similar cases which the movie industry had [previously lost](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/judge-wont-force-reddit-to-identify-anonymous-users-who-discussed-piracy/). From the [relevant court filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.414273/gov.uscourts.cand.414273.15.0.pdf):

> Plaintiffs’ Motion seeks to unmask six anonymous Reddit users that Plaintiffs assume to have committed copyright infringement using Grande, an Internet service provider (ISP). If these Reddit users did engage in copyright infringement on Grande’s networks, then Plaintiffs hope to learn whether the users were drawn to Grande for the ease of infringement. Weeks ago, this Court denied a nearly identical motion by these same Plaintiffs… But rather than returning with better facts capable of meeting the applicable First Amendment standard, Plaintiffs here offer worse facts–expressly acknowledging that they have no need to identify these Reddit users at all.

As it happens, we’re now right back in our own movie industry Groundhog Day: Another case, another loss. The Reddit users here are stepping stones in a battle against an ISP called Grande. The movie producers are trying to prove liability for user piracy because the ISP “allegedly ignores piracy on its network”.

The justification for needing to know the identities of said reddit users comes from comments like the below:

> In a 2018 Reddit thread titled “Texas ISP [Grande] slams music biz for trying to turn it into a ‘copyright cop,'” one user says, “I have Grande and torrent a lot. Always thought it was pretty cool of them to not snitch.” a user said, “[l]ike everyone else I miss Grande and I’m stuck with Spectrum or AT&T in my area. I use Spectrum. Those [expletive deleted] have turned my connection off completely on one occasion and would not turn it back on until I agreed to stop pirating media.”

According to Ars Technica, the most recent Reddit users were in the firing line for having their identities revealed for similar posts made in 2011. One individual posted that “I have Grande. No issues with torrent or [bandwidth](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bandwidth) caps”. This was seemingly enough to gain the attention of the movie producers.

You’ll note that the post does not mention piracy, nor do they specify what they were doing. There are plenty of inst...
