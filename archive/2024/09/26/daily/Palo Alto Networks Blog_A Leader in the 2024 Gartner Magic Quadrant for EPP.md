**For Cortex XDR, Palo Alto Networks is Recognized as a Leader Once Again in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms**[![Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Figure1-2.png)](https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2IV1ZHKD&ct=240920&st=sb)

In a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape where advanced threats are becoming more sophisticated by the day, organizations need trusted, innovative technology to stay ahead. Today, we are thrilled to share that for Cortex XDR®, Palo Alto Networks has once again been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP).

We believe this recognition underlines the prowess of our AI-powered Cortex platform in transforming modern security operations. Cortex revolutionized endpoint security by pioneering the eXtended detection and response (XDR) category, with Cortex XDR as the only offering to achieve 100% prevention and detection with no configuration changes in the 2023 MITRE ATT&CK Evaluations.

Consistently recognized for rapid, disruptive innovation across endpoint security and SOC, Cortex XDR delivers:

* **Industry-Leading AI-Powered Prevention:** Stop the most advanced adversaries with the only product backed by perfect, 100% MITRE ATT&CK results, powered by Palo Alto Networks Precision AI™.
* **Pioneering Threat Detection Across the Organization:** Uncover attacks in real-time with thousands of machine learning models built on unified data across endpoints, identities, network and cloud – from the pioneer of XDR.
* **Unrivaled SOC Efficiency:** Consolidate security operations on a unified platform with a single agent and one console to reduce alerts by 98%, and drive investigations eight times faster.

## Palo Alto Networks — The Leader in SOC Transformation

Cortex XDR is built on the Cortex platform, which transforms security operations with AI and automation to stop threats in minutes, not days or weeks. Built on unified data, a single agent and single console, the platform consolidates SOC point products for significantly more effective and efficient security operations.

Palo Alto Networks was also recognized as a [Gartner Peer Insights™ Customers’ Choice for Endpoint Protection Platforms in 2024](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms), which we believe underscores our ability to stop the most advanced adversaries with an easy to deploy, easy to use and effective SOC platform. We feel this recognition builds on Palo Alto Networks position as the global Cybersecurity Partner of Choice, named a [Leader in five Gartner Magic Quadrant reports](/about-us/awards).

We owe this success to you, our valued customers. Your trust and commitment to Cortex XDR underscore the mutual partnership we cherish. You have placed your confidence in us, and we remain steadfast in our dedication to providing the best security outcomes in the industry.
