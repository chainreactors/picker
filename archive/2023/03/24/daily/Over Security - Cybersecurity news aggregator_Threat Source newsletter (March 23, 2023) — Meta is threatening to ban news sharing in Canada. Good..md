# Threat Source newsletter (March 23, 2023) — Meta is threatening to ban news sharing in Canada. Good.

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

After asking ChatGPT to write the newsletter for me two weeks ago, I was tempted to have [Google’s Bard](https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html) do the same, but I resisted making this the newsletter’s new gimmick.

Instead, I wanted to write about another tech giant — Meta.

The company recently [doubled down on a threat](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-end-news-access-canadians-if-online-news-act-becomes-law-2023-03-11/) to [remove news links and sharing](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meta-block-news-liberal-online-bill-1.6776485) from its Facebook and Instagram platforms if Canada passes its proposed Online News Act, or bill C-18. The proposed legislation would compel companies like Meta and Google to sign agreements with Canadian news organizations that would pay them each time a user clicks on a news link through one of their platforms (i.e., via a shared link on Facebook or a Google search result).

But as the great Tobey Maguire once said in the cinematic classic “Spider-Man:” [“I fail to see how that’s my problem.”](https://youtu.be/iCAaBWmKTDg)

If Facebook stops users from sharing news links on their pages, it could be a net positive. Facebook users are notoriously the biggest offenders for sharing fake news and misinformation. A [May 2020 study published in Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0833-x) found that Facebook pointed users to fake news websites during the 2016 presidential election at a higher rate than any other social media platform.

A [separate study from Harvard](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-the-scale-of-facebooks-problem-depends-upon-how-fake-news-is-classified/) found that during the first few months of 2020, the rate of user engagement with fake news to mainstream news stories was 1:3.5, and the [International Communications Association](https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article-abstract/46/4/357/5840447) found via a study of social media users that, “sharing countermedia content on Facebook is positively associated with ideological extremity and negatively associated with trust in the mainstream news media.”

If Instagram, Facebook and other social media sites were to follow along with this with Canada (Google already [started quietly removing news links from its search engine last month](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/02/google-blocking-news-canada-online-news-act-link-tax-facebook) in protest of the Online News Act), I think it could go a long way toward fighting disinformation. If users can’t get their news through social media, they may be forced to seek out information independently rather than blindly clicking “share” on Great Aunt Betty’s post, which is just a bad parody from the Babylon Bee.

I also would be remiss to not discuss the benefits this legislation would possibly have on newsrooms in Canada. As a former journalist, and someone who was worried about being laid off 24/7 in my previous jobs, it’s a financial struggle out there right now for legitimate news organizations. Online advertising isn’t what it once was, so many outlets are being forced to pivot to hard paywalls or rely on clickbait articles that don’t deliver any news. If this presents a new way to fund legitimate journalism, especially if the only financial burden falls on the richest companies in the world, it could go a long way to sustaining newsrooms.

Just because something becomes legal in Canada doesn’t mean other countries are going to be adopting the same rules any time soon. But if news sharing does suddenly go away on Facebook in Canada, maybe it will force all of us to think about where we’re really consuming our news from and how we consumed news even just 15 years ago.

## The one big thing

We’re [still reminding people to update their Microsoft Outlook clients](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/outlook-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2023-23397/) as soon as possible after the disclosure of CVE-2023-23397. Attackers have reportedly been exploiting this vulnerability since last year, though a fix is available now through Microsoft. Adversaries could manipulate a targeted system into supplying the user’s Net-NTLMv2 hash to the attacker, which can then be used in NTLM Relay attacks against other systems.

### Why do I care?

Multiple sources, including Microsoft itself, have confirmed that this vulnerability is being used in the wild. Plus, users don’t even have to open the email or any malicious attachments to trigger this vulnerability, the specially crafted email just has to hit the target’s Outlook inbox. This is a high-severity, low-complexity vulnerability everyone should be patching for if they haven’t already.

### So now what?

Microsoft has released a patch that should be applied, but Talos also has several layers of detection and protection available. If, for some reason, your organization cannot apply this patch, Microsoft also provided a [few mitigation options,](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397?ref=blog.talosintelligence.com) including adding users to the Protected Users Security Group to prevent the use of NTLM as an authentication mechanism as well as blocking port TCP/445 outbound from your network to block the NTLM messages from leaving the network.
