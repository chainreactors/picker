I Used a Sandbox to Strengthen Bank’s Security—Here’s How It Worked

Recently we had a chance to sit down for a chat with the Head of Cybersecurity at an investment bank. An hour-long conversation gave a sneak peek into the work of their cybersec team, challenges they face, and the use of [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=how_bank_improved_security&utm_term=110225&utm_content=linktolanding).

Here’s what we learned.

## Company and Team Overview

We’re an investment bank based in Brussels. The total number of employees is about 750 people with 12 of them being on my cybersecurity team. Just like most companies out there we have to make do with limited resources and stay lean. That means wearing multiple hats and sharing different roles depending on the current situation at hand. Our threat analysts can jump in and handle incident response if need be and so on.

## What Made the Team Look for a Sandbox

When I first took over this role, coming from a large international bank, my number one task was to take a look at the business’s entire cybersecurity setup and find ways to make it more efficient. In reality, it turned out to be messier than I expected.

The team was literally getting swamped with alerts every day with no end in sight. Thankfully, having seen what a properly functioning cybersecurity department looks from the old job, I knew what kind of levers I had to start pulling to get the things to where they had to be.

Fixing workflow meant new tools. A good malware sandbox was at the top of the list. Back at the large bank we had a whole selection of these from different vendors, including ANY.RUN. The CISO there often said, “Investing in good cybersecurity costs less than the incidents it prevents.” That helped a lot in securing budget whenever we wanted to test a new tool.

> *Investing in good cybersecurity costs less than the incidents it prevents.*

Basically, because I’d already seen sandboxes in action, I knew how critical they would be for building a more effective department. But if you are going to press me to pick one thing that made me jump to sandboxes right away, it was the speed boost they offered. Not just in terms of malware analysis, I mean across the board, for everything from spotting threats to responding to incidents.

So, it was a total no-brainer to start looking at sandbox options from the day I stepped into my role.

## Why ANY.RUN

After spending a week scrolling through vendors’ websites, I decided to just put together all the must-haves I wanted to see in the ideal solution. Eventually it came down to the two main features, apart from the basic stuff, of course.

Banking means a ton of data privacy compliance, so we had to know our data would be secure in the sandbox and that it would meet all the regulations. Vendor’s privacy policies, the location of their servers, and how they handled data were really important.

Naturally, threat detection performance was essential. But practicality for the team was also crucial. We needed a tool that gave us as many insights as possible, be it network traffic or system logs. It had to be helpful for both our initial triage and our more in-depth incident response work.

And after I threw in ANY.RUN’s price, the choice became obvious.

## How Long They’ve Been Using ANY.RUN

We’ve been using ANY.RUN for approximately 18 months now.

## Sandbox’s Impact on CyberSec Operations

Integrating the sandbox was part of a bigger workflow overhaul, so we saw results almost instantly, in the first week. The team was able to churn through alerts and threat analysis at least twice as fast. This saved the bank hefty sums of ...
