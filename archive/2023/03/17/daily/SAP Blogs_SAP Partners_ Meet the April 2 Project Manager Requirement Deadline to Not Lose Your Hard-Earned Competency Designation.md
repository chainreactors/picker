Just a friendly reminder to partner organizations that have earned competency designations, that an approaching deadline may put your designation at risk if the project management requirement is not met by April 2.

[Competency and Specialization](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/manage/competency.html) designations are the visual badges and descriptors that are part of the new Competency Framework that was introduced late summer of 2022.

The competency framework evolves SAP’s recognition of its partner ecosystem expertise by categorizing partners by the competency and specialization they offer the market giving customers transparency on the skills, expertise, and maturity of a partner’s SAP practice.

This new approach allows partners to differentiate their skills in driving customer success with new global competency and specialization designations that make it easier for customers to distinguish a partner’s capabilities, expertise, and experience.

**April 2 Deadline Approaching**

We know it’s not easy to acquire a designation, and SAP urges that partners stay current on the requirements needed to maintain an earned designation.

The project manager requirement needs to be fulfilled by April 2, 2023. [As communicated last year](https://partneredge.sap.com/content/partnerexp/en/library/news/partnership/manage/news_a_pe_deadline.html), the temporary suspension of the project manager requirement has ended, and the requirement went back into effect on January 2, 2023.

This mean that partners have until April 2, 2023, to fulfill the project manager certification requirement and maintain their earned designation which is visible on SAP Partner Finder.

If the requirement is not met by April 2, the affected designation will be automatically removed from the partner’s area on SAP Partner Finder.

**What to Do**?

To find out which earned competency needs attention, go into SAP for Me and access the Competency and Specialization card.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-16-163837.png) To find the specific training that is needed to fulfill the requirement, [go to this page](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/manage/competency/requirements.html#section-1-accordion-panel-section-row-item_2-widewidgets-accordionitem_copy_1_1147110624) on the SAP Partner Portal and scroll down to the area called **Knowledge Requirement** which lists the different solution areas with the associated trainings.

Go to the solution area of your choice and click on the **Project Manager** accordion to access the SAP Learning Journey and the certification test.

Please contact your assigned partner manager or partner@sap.com if you have any question.
