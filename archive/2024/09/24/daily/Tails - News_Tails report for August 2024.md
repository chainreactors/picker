# Highlights

In August:

* We continued making it easier for Tails users to recover from the most common
  failure modes:

  + we released the first iteration of our design to detect a partition table
    corruption and advise users about it.
  + we worked on implementing detection of the *Persistent Storage* corruption
    on a Tails USB stick, reporting it to users, and repairing it.
* We resumed our work to design a better backup feature for the *Persistent
  Storage*. We integrated the valuable feedback received in July on our design
  proposal for the improved backup feature ([mockups on
  Gitlab](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/20194)).
* We published [instructions for installing
  Dangerzone](../dangerzone/) in Tails. Dangerzone will help Tails users
  convert suspicious documents to safe PDFs. This was a significant milestone:
  this is the first time that we have recommended installing a 3rd party package
  that is not available in Debian.

# Releases

ðŸ“¢ [We released Tails 6.6](../version_6.6/)!

In Tails 6.6, we brought:

* improved hardware support for graphics, WiFi etc.
* an updated *Tor Browser* and fixed issues with connecting to the Tor network
  using default bridges
* fixes that make the *Persisten Storage* more robust.

To know more, check out the Tails 6.6 [release notes](../version_6.6/) and
the
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).
