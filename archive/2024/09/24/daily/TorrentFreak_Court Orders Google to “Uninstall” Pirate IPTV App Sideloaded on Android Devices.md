# Court Orders Google to “Uninstall” Pirate IPTV App Sideloaded on Android Devices

Recent developments in the ongoing battle against pirate IPTV service MagisTV reveal an unprecedented move by an Argentine court. In addition to blocking 69 domains associated with the service, the court has ordered Google to "immediately uninstall" Magis TV apps from Android devices. This measure targets apps that users have sideloaded, as MagisTV is not available on the official Google Play store.

[![google-magistv-s](https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-magistv-s.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-magistv-s.png)As reported last week, an order published in Argentina dated September 13, 2024, revealed that local ISPs are now required to block dozens of Magis TV-linked domains for violating intellectual property law.

In total, 69 domains (full list in our [earlier report](https://torrentfreak.com/magis-tv-iptv-crackdown-blocks-70-domains-hundreds-already-wiped-out-240918/)) must be blocked so that internet users cannot access them from anywhere inside Argentinian territory. The nature of the listed domains suggests that rightsholders focused on resellers of Magis TV subscriptions. One of the service’s main domains appears in the list but as things stand, any damage to availability is likely to be both limited and short-lived.

## Linked to Operation 404

Our report coincided with the [latest wave of Operation 404](https://torrentfreak.com/operation-404-7-targets-675-pirate-sites-brazil-now-blocks-6700-domains-240920/) in Brazil last Thursday, which also led to three arrests in Argentina. On Friday, dozens of local media reports linked those arrests to Magis TV.

According to reports, Hugo Javier Mospan, 47, of Buenos Aires, is linked to the teaching of computer courses in Argentina. Before that he was an employee at a transport company.

Leopoldo Federico Peña, 46, also of Buenos Aires, reportedly has a history of marketing household appliances and electronic equipment. In mid-2022, in concert with others, he reportedly registered several companies for the purposes of importing, exporting, distributing and maintaining such products.

Pictures of all three were widely published by local media late last week following their arrests.

News reports also showed law enforcement entering premises and retail outlets suspected of selling ‘fully-loaded’ TV boxes, with at least some devices sold with the Magis TV app pre-installed. A raid targeting ‘TodoTech’ in Misiones is said to have yielded just three TV boxes but another at “Kive” in CABA, a more impressive 481 TV boxes were seized by police.

Two other suspects, Roberto V. and Marcos DJ, are described as the most visible ‘marketers’ of Magis TV devices in Argentina. They’re still at large, according to reports, and somewhat less visible, at least for now.

This type of high-profile action is clearly meant to send a message. Whether that message will include custodial sentences will remain to be seen, but the loss of money invested in devices taken away by the police has the potential to sting and give pause for thought, if nothing else.

Yet whatever happens in Argentina, the court order has a component that goes beyond seizing devices and ISPs blocking Magis TV. The component isn’t just controversial; depending on how it’s handled, it could reverberate far beyond Argentina.

If those who requested this additional component thought it through (there are clear signs that’s exactly what they did), whatever happens next will determine just how far rightsholders are prepared to go to ensure that people stop pirating live TV content.

## No Red Lines in This War

The action targeting Magis TV appears to have two tracks, the blocking action and a criminal investigation. The initial complaint to the authorities was filed by [LATAM anti-piracy group Alianza](https://alianzaaudiovisual.net/), which represents companies in, or connected to, the pay TV sector; Direct TV, Sky Brasil, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, Globo, Win Sports, Telecine, the list goes on.

The investigation was carried out by Argentina’s Specialized Unit on Cybercrime ([UFEIC](https://www.trmlabs.com/case-study/argentinas-digital-shield-the-ufeic-story)) and headed by prosecutor Alejandro Musso. As we know, the request to block 69 Magis TV-linked domains was handed down on September 13 by Judge Esteban Rossignoli at Court 4 of San Isidro.

No stranger to controversy himself, Judge Rossignoli granted a request that seems likely to be the source of even more. Prosecutor Musso says that the blocking of 69 domains means that the “app will no longer be able to be downloaded” but they needed to go much further than that. Specifically, the threat posed by millions of copies of Magis TV already installed on users’ devices needed to be eliminated. The Judge agreed.

## Google Ordered to Remotely Uninstall Magis TV From Users’ Devices

In instructions to Google, Judge Rossignoli says that the company must “adopt the necessary technical means to immediately uninstall from Android systems that report IP addresses in the territory of the Argentine Republic (which can be verified by the IP addresses assigned to this country), the application named Magis TV.”

The order specifies a filename (magis\_mobile\_v6.5.2.apk) and the following hash values:

• SHA1: e68156b531ffaade1090b7326b7ae7d604975cd0
• MD5: c4614c08c3be4ee9972870056d47afae

A VirusTotal report confirms that both hashes relate to the same file, a 48.89 MB (51262825 bytes) Android APK.

Two hashes, same file[![magis-tv-hashes](https://torrentfreak.com/images/magis-tv-hashes.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/magis-tv-hashes.png)

Commenting on the instructions to Google, Musso acknowledges that “this has never been done before” but defends the unprecedented measure as entirely necessary.

“What was achieved is an unprecedented court order, which is in the process of being analyzed by Google – we understand that they cannot deny it – which is to uninstall, through the Android operating system update, the application on all devices that have an IP address in Argentina,” Musso says.
