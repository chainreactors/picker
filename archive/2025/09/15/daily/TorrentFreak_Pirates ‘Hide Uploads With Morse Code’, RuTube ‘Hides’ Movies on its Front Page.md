# Pirates ‘Hide Uploads With Morse Code’, RuTube ‘Hides’ Movies on its Front Page

A new piracy study published in Russia has some good news, and some more good news. Due to blocking and lower payouts from advertisers, pirates' revenue fell by 14.5% in the first half of 2025. Search traffic fell too, down 13.9% with some pirates using morse code to thwart detection. With piracy on social media and hosting sites reportedly falling from 12.1% to 1.6% of piracy overall, the tactic of hiding Hollywood movies on RuTube's front page may have been overlooked.

The sheer number of piracy studies conducted over the past three decades is a testament to the complexity and allure of the puzzle.

By any reasonable means available today, piracy has proven itself unsolvable. Yet there’s one inescapable constant that holds true across all products, in every single market.

If a product is unavailable to buy legally, piracy will create a market that didn’t previously exist and then become its only supplier. That’s the inevitable outcome when content owners refuse to compete, but when the same happens to an existing legitimate market under extreme circumstances, it certainly isn’t pretty.

## Licensed Market Transformed into 100% Piracy

Following the invasion of Ukraine, Hollywood, Netflix and most Western movie and TV show companies pulled out of Russia, as the following excerpt from an IIPA report to the U.S. Government briefly explains.

Since the withdrawal from the market, regular movie releases enjoyed in the West have had no corresponding official release in Russia. Yet movies have been playing regularly both [in cinemas](https://torrentfreak.com/russian-cinemas-get-help-to-bypass-sanctions-to-screen-avatar-the-way-of-water-221228/) and online, in breach of Russian law and in violation of the studios’ intellectual property rights.

In short, the content that fueled the largest share of Russia’s cinema sector was licensed one minute, and 100% pirated the next.

## Study: Piracy Traffic and Profits Take a Hit

The findings of new study reported by [Kommersant](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8024553) on Wednesday, suggest that making money from pirate sites isn’t as easy as it once was. That’s an interesting premise.

Since the most popular content in Russia is unavailable to view on legal platforms, at least in theory it has no competition either. Under these conditions piracy usually thrives but according to the study, it’s a bit of a struggle.

Cybersecurity company F6 (formerly known as Group-IB) claims that advertising revenue in the first half of 2025 fell by 14.5% when compared to the same period last year, and 26.5% when compared to 2023. The F6 chart below shows pirate site ad revenue in dollars, with total revenue expressed as the size of the market *(translations by TF)*

Kommersant’s report provides no further context, such as which sites or services generate the revenue. F6’s [report](https://www.f6.ru/media-center/press-releases/pirates-h12025/) doesn’t provide specific detail on that front either, but does offer two reasons why revenue is falling.

“Payments for displaying advertising are reduced. Last year, the cost of payments for advertising to visitors of pirated resources remained at about the same level, but in 2025 it began to decline again. In the first half of the year, the average CPM was $3.11 – 0.6% and 2.2% less than in the same period of 2024 and 2023, respectively,” F6 explain.

## Search Query Traffic Down

The second factor is a reported reduction in search query traffic. In the first half of 2025, traffic was reportedly down 13.9% compared to the same period last year. We assume that most of the traffic usually originates from Yandex but again, details haven’t been made available so drawing an independent conclusion is much more difficult.

However, since site/URL blocking measures can indeed remove content from Yandex’s indexes, comments from F6 that pirated content is being detected more quickly, should in theory lead to faster blocking and deindexing. If that leads to lower quality search results, less search query traffic should be the end result. F6 reports that some pirates have even been using morse code to make their uploaded content harder to detect.

The prospect of Russian pirates routinely searching Yandex in morse code seems unlikely, but there seems to be more serious issues that aren’t directly addressed.

## Hollywood Free-For-All?

Some time ago we were informed (unofficially) that blocking claims relating to Western movies weren’t being filed in Russia, therefore searches in local search engines have always returned useful results. Since nothing gets blocked, nothing is removed either, we were told.

Yet whatever the reasons, the bottom line right now is that Yandex and probably other search engines too, are awash with links to pirated Hollywood movies. Case in point, the recently released Naked Gun.

Beyond blocking and deindexing, the F6 study cites another reason for the decrease in traffic to pirate sites.

“This is due to the growing number of users of legal streaming platforms,” the company notes.

The study doesn’t name those legal platforms, mention their traffic volumes, or indicate how much their presence has helped in the bigger picture. But as their presence on Russia’s version of YouTube reveals, competition is fierce right now.

## RuTube: The One-Stop-Shop For Everything

Launched in 2006 and ultimately owned by [Gazprom-Media](https://www.gazprom-media.com/en), RuTube is effectively Russia’s domestic version of YouTube but on a much smaller scale. Users upload content, just as they do on YouTube, and apparently some moderation takes place to ensure certain content doesn’t appear on the platform.

Beyond the obvious, the criteria aren’t clear but visit RuTube while using a VPN, and the site makes it clear that there are benefits when VPNs are turned off. Since under certain conditions VPNs are illegal in Russia, compliance is a matter of personal choice. As will become clear later on, choosing to keep a VPN on can have consequences.

## User Uploads vs. Legal Streaming Service Channels

Heading into the film section on RuTube reveals many channels dedicated to the latest movies from the United States. In many cases direct links to movies available on RuTube can be found when searching Yandex. Russia’s piracy blocklist shows no sign of removals but even if that was the case, between 10 and 20 links on most titles is a clear sign of ineffective measur...
