# Is your phone listening to you? (Lock and Code S06E07)

Posted: April 7, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

It has probably happened to you before.

You and a friend are *talking*—not texting, not DMing, not FaceTiming—but *talking*, physically face-to-face, about, say, an upcoming vacation, a new music festival, or a job offer you just got.

And then, that same week, you start noticing some eerily specific ads. There’s the Instagram ad about carry-on luggage, the TikTok ad about earplugs, and the countless ads you encounter simply scrolling through the internet about laptop bags.

And so you think, “Is my phone listening to me?”

This question has been around for years and, today, it’s far from a conspiracy theory. Modern smartphones can and do listen to users for voice searches, smart assistant integration, and, obviously, phone calls. It’s not too outlandish to believe, then, that the microphones on smartphones could be used to listen to other conversations without users knowing about it.

Recent news stories don’t help, either.

In January, Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the company had eavesdropped on users’ conversations through its smart assistant Siri, and that it shared the recorded conversations with marketers for ad targeting. The lead plaintiff in the case specifically claimed that she and her daughter were recorded without their consent, which resulted in them receiving multiple ads for Air Jordans.

In agreeing to pay the settlement, though, Apple denied any wrongdoing, with a spokesperson [telling the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4rvr495rgo):

“Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.”

But statements like this have done little to ease public anxiety. Tech companies have been caught in multiple lies in the past, privacy invasions happen thousands of times a day, and ad targeting feels extreme entirely because it is.

Where, then, does the truth lie?

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with David Ruiz, we speak with Electronic Frontier Foundation Staff Technologist Lena Cohen about the most mind-boggling forms of corporate surveillance—including an experimental ad-tracking technology that emitted ultrasonic sound waves—specific audience segments that marketing companies make when targeting people with ads, and, of course, whether our phones are really listening to us.

> “Companies are collecting so much information about us and in such covert ways that it really feels like they’re listening to us.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
