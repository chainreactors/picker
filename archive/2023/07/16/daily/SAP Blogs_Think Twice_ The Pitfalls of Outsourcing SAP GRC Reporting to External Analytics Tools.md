#### **Not everything that glitters is gold! This statement applies perfectly to the external reporting solutions that many enterprises are embracing today. Surprisingly, approximately 40% of enterprises are outsourcing their reporting to external analytic applications without fully understanding the potential drawbacks. Take a moment to read this article and discover the benefits of retaining SAP GRC Reporting as an in-application capability!**

When it comes to managing and analyzing large volumes of data, organizations are increasingly turning to external visualization tools such as Tableau, Power BI etc., While these solutions offers a range of features for data visualization and business intelligence, it may not be the most suitable solution for handling massive data sets and also relevant when in-application reporting is available.

In this blog post, we will explore the challenges associated with external reporting/visualization tools. We will discuss what factors to consider and also delve into the in-application reporting capabilities available in SAP GRC.

External reporting solutions undoubtedly offer impressive visualization capabilities and can enhance business reporting. However, improper utilization can lead to increased ongoing cloud and management costs. Therefore, it is highly recommended to evaluate the in-application reporting capabilities before opting for an external reporting solution.

Following are the top three reasons on why external visualization tools are not preferred, especially for SAP GRC reporting:

**1. Cloud Costs:**

Are you paying huge on your cloud costs every month? Many of the enterprises that adapt these solutions, end up paying significant cost due to misaligned or poorly developed analytic models. Inefficient or inaccurate models consume excessive computational resources, increasing the time and resources required for data processing and analysis. This can result in higher storage costs, increased network bandwidth usage, and extended processing times, all of which contribute to inflated cloud expenses. Moreover, incorrect or incomplete models may generate misleading insights, leading to poor decision-making and potential rework, further driving up costs.

To mitigate this risk, organizations should prioritize investing in robust data modelling techniques, proper validation, and continuous monitoring to ensure the optimal utilization of cloud resources and avoid unnecessary financial burdens. Look at the following:

* Utilize quality data. Cleansing of data is more important.

* Utilize data compression techniques.

* Optimize data pipelines. For example: Many of the NewGen reporting applications can be connected to HANA DB and can consume the data directly.

* Implement cost-effective storage options.

While outsourcing SAP GRC reporting may appear cost-effective in the short term, organizations must consider the long-term financial implications. External analytics tools often come with licensing fees, integration costs, and ongoing maintenance expenses. These additional costs, coupled with the potential need for specialized expertise to manage the external tool, can significantly impact the overall budget. Organizations should carefully weigh the benefits against the long-term financial commitment before opting for outsourcing.

**2. Security**

Data security is a paramount concern in today's digital landscape. When outsourcing SAP GRC reporting to external analytics, sensitive information needs to be shared with third-party platforms. This transfer of data increases the risk of breaches, unauthorized access, and potential data leaks, when not secured properly. Additionally, if the visualization is outsourced to an external partner, organizations must take additional care and evaluate the security protocols and measures implemented. Note that majority of the SAP GRC data is classified as PII and business critical and comes under GDPR and other data protection laws.

**3. Near real-time reports/dashboard**

Please keep in mind that the reports and dashboards you view on these reporting solutions may not always be in real-time. The data needs to be extracted from the backend systems, processed/cleansed, and loaded into the analytics solution to generate the visualizations.

This process incurs additional resource costs for downloading, cleansing, and uploading data to the reporting solutions. Moreover, if not properly managed, it can result in outdated and inaccurate outputs.

Despite these facts, it is still not advisable to outsource SAP GRC reporting to external tools, as SAP GRC itself offers exceptional reporting capabilities. Leveraging these capabilities not only helps minimize ongoing costs but also pr...
