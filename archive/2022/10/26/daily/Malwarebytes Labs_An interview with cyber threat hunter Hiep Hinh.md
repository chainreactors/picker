## A cyber threat hunter talks about what he’s learned in his 16+ year cybersecurity career

*Hiep Hinh is a Principal MDR Analyst at Malwarebytes, where he supports [24/7/365 Managed Detection and Response (MDR) efforts.](https://www.threatdown.com/products/managed-detection-and-response/) Hiep has over 16 years of experience in the cybersecurity and intelligence fields, including for the US Army as an intelligence analyst and for the Airforce Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT/33NWS). Hiep is an expert user of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platforms and is highly-skilled in incident response, DLP (data loss prevention), data mining, and threat hunting, among other things. In this post, Hiep breaks down his threat hunting career and shares tips and best practices for those looking to become a cyber threat hunter (or who are just interested to listen!).*

When I first heard the words “cyber threat hunter”, I imagined a sort of Holmesian figure with an upturned collar sitting at a desk, scouring a network for signs of intruders. And when I talked to Hiep Hinh, Principal MDR Analyst at Malwarebytes, I found out I was more or less right in my guess—minus the trenchcoat, maybe.

**Threat hunting is all about nipping stealthy attackers (and malware) in the bud**. It’s plain to see why this is such important work—just consider that the median number of days between [system compromise and detection is 21](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3657571/attack-dwell-times-drop-ransomware-ttps-evolve-china-ramps-up-espionage-activity.html). The earlier cyber threat hunters can find threats, the earlier they can send them off to the remediation team.

Hiep has been threat hunting for a while—since 2007, in fact. According to Hiep, threat hunting is a natural part of incident response, SOC work, and network monitoring in general.

“I’ve been doing threat hunting for a decent amount of time. I got my start in cybersecurity at the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT) in ‘07, where we monitored and defended the Air Force network,” said Hiep. “I did a lot of the forensics work back then, but we were still very deeply involved with just the network monitoring aspect as well.”

For Hiep, effective threat hunting starts with really understanding the network.

“I think to be an effective cyber threat hunter, **you have to have a good understanding of what ‘normal’ behavior is**,” he says. “For example, you should be able to answer questions like, ‘What are common activities seen in the environment? What are the users usually using? When are they usually online? What are they usually connecting from?’, and so on.”

“All of this information gets put under your belt, you take that knowledge, and now look for things that stand out. Using this understanding of normal will make certain activity stand out such as users that are on way too late, or are logging in from a different country than usual.”

> “A threat hunter is most effective when they know the network well.” – Hiep Hinh

Hiep’s advice? If a cyber threat hunter isn’t a part of the company or used to seeing the environment, take some time to learn what is normal. **It can be very overwhelming to jump into an environment with thousands of endpoints and separate malicious and benign activity**.

“Threat hunting is used to find threats that aren’t caught by antivirus or your other defenses. It’s literally looking for things that are unfound, advanced, and hidden, right? So the only way to do that is by knowing what’s normal, and tryin...
