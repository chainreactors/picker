Updated At least two VPNs are no longer available for Russian iPhone users, seemingly after the Kremlin's internet regulatory agency Roskomnadzor demanded Apple take them down.

Red Shield VPN, which is focused on providing its services to Russian users, claims it received a note from Apple that says its VPN was removed from the Russian App Store. The email, which the VPN operator [shared](https://x.com/RedShieldVPN_ru/status/1808766482580377616) on X, says Cupertino had to remove the app from the App Store in Russia since the software did not "conform with all local laws." This is after the Kremlin had apparently spent years trying technological approaches to block the use of the VPN.

"Apple's actions, motivated by a desire to retain revenue from the Russian market, actively support an authoritarian regime," Red Shield said in a [statement](https://redshieldvpn.com/en/news/70).
