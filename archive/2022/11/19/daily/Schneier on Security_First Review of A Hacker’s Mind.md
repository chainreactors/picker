## First Review of *A Hacker’s Mind*

*Kirkus* [reviews](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bruce-schneier/a-hackers-mind-powerful/) *A Hacker’s Mind*:

> A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.
>
> Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as *Data and Goliath* and *Click Here To Kill Everybody*, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­—but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, “Don’t get caught.” Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: “Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion—all forever tax free.” It was perfectly legal—and even if it weren’t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites “the Pudding Guy,” who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and “lifetime Gold frequent flier status.” Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, “the company paid up.” The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. “Any rule can be hacked,” notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, “we can hack more, faster, better,” requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering.

> An eye-opening, maddening book that offers hope for leveling a badly tilted playing field.

I got a starred review. Libraries make decisions on what to buy based on starred reviews. Publications make decisions about what to review based on starred reviews. This is a big deal.

*A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, …*

There is something wrong with this sentence. It makes no sense to me, anyway.

M Ward: Yes, I see the problem: “Powerful” is the noun and “game” is the verb. Fruit flies like a banana.

Ah, so “game” is a verb, not a noun.

You may as well delete these comments.

@M Ward:

It’s a flavor of a Garden Path Sentence. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence>

In this case, the first reading of it is that “powerful” is an adjective modifying the noun “game”. But that makes the rest of the sentence nonsensical.

The interpretation that allows it to make sense is that “the powerful” is a group of people. They are “gaming”, or manipulating, the systems that they encounter. And Bruce is examining how they do that.

“Powerful”, while usually an adjective, is a noun in this case. And “game”, while usually a noun, is a verb in this case. Put those two less-common uses together, and confusion ensues.

A better phrasing could be: “A cybersecurity expert examines how skillful people manipulate whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.” That breaks the adjective-noun confusion.

Are you saying you are trying to hack the book sales process?

Wondering about this:

> The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator

I think maybe the reviewer meant “fluent”.

@M Ward

Let me guess, you are not a native of the western hemisphere? It took me a while to parse that sentence too. The English and the Americans are divided by a common language.

@higgs boson

Fluent is often used to describe speech (especially in non-native languages), and fluid is frequently used to describe writing style.

However Oxford English Dictionary gives:

@ M Ward,

Ever play a game of,

“hunt the invisable comma?

English is a lazy language which makes it easy for non native speakers to learn, but for native speakers of English it makes learning other more rigid / structured languages much harder than it could be[1].

So sometimes puting a breathing pause in to break a sentance up can help.

You see,

“A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them”

And your brain runs “the powerful game” and makes the wrong guess at meaning.

However if instea...
