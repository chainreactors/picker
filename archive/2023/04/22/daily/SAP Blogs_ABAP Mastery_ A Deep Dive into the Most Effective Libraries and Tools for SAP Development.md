**Introduction**

ABAP is a programming language SAP uses for building applications on their platforms. As an SAP ABAP developer, using the correct libraries and tools to write high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code is necessary. This article will explore essential libraries and tools for ABAP developers, grouped by their primary purpose and functionality. Using these resources can improve your productivity, and code quality.

**Code Management and Version Control**

Libraries in this category, such as **ABAPGit** and **AbapGitServer**. Developers can use it to maintain their ABAP Source code, and ABAPGit is an open-source developed Git client for the ABAP server to import and export ABAP objects between ABAP systems.

ABAPGit is built to operate with various Git repository hosting sites, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

ABAPGitServer is a server component that can host ABAP code Git repositories outside an SAP system. It is intended to work with ABAPGit, the Git client for ABAP code, and allows developers to manage their ABAP code in Git repositories hosted outside of their SAP system.

**Code Quality and Maintainability**

**AbapOpenChecks**, **AbapLint**, and **ABAP-code-Review-Checklist** help developers ensure their code adheres to best practices and is high quality.

**AbapOpenCheck** AbapOpenChecks is a group of open-source ABAP checks for Eclipse that aid programmers in producing higher-quality code. It is up to date by SAP and accessible on GitHub.

**AbapLint** is an open-source ABAP code linter that is used to analyse and enhance ABAP code quality. It looks for syntax mistakes, possible performance problems, and compliance with best practices and naming standards. It also makes code enhancement and refactoring suggestions.

You need Node.js installed on your PC in order to use ABAPLint. Then, using npm, the Node.js package manager, install ABAPLint. Once installed, you may use to inspect your ABAP code by specifying the location of the code files. The code will be analysed and comments will be provided in the command line by ABAPLint.

**ABAP-Code-Review-Checklist** is an open-source git library and it contains a set of methods for evaluating ABAP code for quality assurance. The checklist includes programme naming conventions, programme definition attributes, text components, and programme history documents. It also covers the internal tables, structures, constants, global variables, parameters, select-options, types, reference variables, local constants, classes, radio buttons and checkboxes. The checklist also includes SQL query suggestions, such as utilising SELECT statements with a field list instead of SELECT \* and avoiding GROUP BY and DISTINCT procedures as much as feasible. The ABAP-Code-Review-Checklist is a git library that is open source.

**Documentation and API Management**

**ABAP-Swagger** is an open-source tool that combines ABAP with Swagger to produce API documentation and specifications automatically from ABAP method definitions. It enables you to expose the methods of your ABAP classes as REST services and test them using the Swagger UI at <https://blogs.sap.com/2018/02/03/abap-and-swaggeropenapi/> . The library is designed to work with SAP systems running NetWeaver 7.02 or above.

Swagger is a set of tools used to create, generate, describe, and test RESTful services. It is built on a specification file that holds the REST service descriptions, similar to a SOAP WSDL or OData metadata file. The Swagger family has numerous sophisticated tools, all of which are free source and may be used in combination with ABAP-Swagger.

**Debugging and Testing**

The **ABAP Unit Test** repository contains many ABAP unit test examples. It was motivated by the blog post "Unit Tests in an SAP Customer Environment." The goal of this repository is to serve as a resource for developers interested in learning how to write unit tests in ABAP, the programming language used in the SAP system. To contribute to this repository, create a new $autex sub-package and attach your code to it. Make careful to distribute the entire code and avoid utilising any company-specific artifacts.
