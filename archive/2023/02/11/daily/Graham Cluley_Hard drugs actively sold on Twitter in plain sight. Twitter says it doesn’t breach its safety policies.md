Want to sell some cocaine, ecstasy (MDMA), crystal meth, or magic mushrooms?

Twitter could be the place for you. And the site isn’t going to do anything to shut down your account.

A reader pointed me in the direction of a number of different Twitter accounts that are actively offering illegal drugs to sale, directing interested parties to call or WhatsApp a UK mobile number, or contact them via email, Snapchat, Wickr, or Telegram.

In some cases the offending tweets even include short videos of the illegal drugs available.

In the following screenshots I have blurred out the contact details of the person offering to sell the drugs, but they are not obscured in the posts – which are still live on Twitter.

The emails contain the names of UK towns where the drugs can be delivered, presumably to make it easy for anyone searching in their area for a supplier.

So, what’s Twitter’s response to this?

![Twitter response](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/twitter-response.jpeg)

> After reviewing the available information, we want to let you know <REDACTED> hasn’t broken our safety policies. We know this isn’t the answer you’re looking for. If this account breaks our policies in the future, we’ll notify you.

That was Twitter’s response on 22 January, after it was told about the accounts on 19 January. The accounts are still actively posting drugs for sale on Twitter today (10 February 2023).

Of course, if Twitter did actually delete an account selling drugs chances are that a brand new replacement would pop up again within hours… rather like a mushroom.

If Twitter won’t do anything about this, I wonder whether a UK police force will be interested? You would think any police force worth its salt would be able to investigate with the information that is being publicly shared in these tweets (email addresses, phone numbers, Twitter accounts, etc…)
