China's Salt Typhoon spy crew exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco devices to compromise at least seven devices linked to global telecom providers and other orgs, in addition to its previous victim count.

The intrusions happened between December 2024 and January 2025 with the Chinese government snoops attempting to exploit more than 1,000 internet-facing Cisco-made boxes before successfully breaking into at least seven that were unpatched, according to Recorded Future's Insikt Group.

Salt Typhoon previously compromised at least [nine US telecommunications](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/06/charter_consolidated_windstream_salt_typhoon/) companies and [government networks](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/salt_typhoon_us_govt_networks/), giving President Xi's agents real-time access to people's communications and whereabouts.
