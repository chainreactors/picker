I’m often asked to provide short overview of SAP Activate to new customers, implementation partners, and SAP colleagues. Recently I started pointing interested parties to the series of SAP Activate minute recordings the Activate team released last year. They provide great level set overview of what SAP Activate delivers and how customers use it as they deploy their SAP solutions.

Goal of this blog post is to give you one stop shop to access all these videos. You can find them on YouTube in the SAP Activate playlist. And it may not be easy to jump from one video to next as the list shows the videos in "wrong" sequence by default. It is sorted from newest video to oldest, putting Run phase first. Anyways I digress.

Let’s start with the introduction of SAP Activate in this one-minute-long clip. It helps to answer what is SAP Activate.

Now we can start going through the individual phases and outline the key activities and deliverables in each. We will follow the six phases structure from Prepare to Run as as shown in the image below.
