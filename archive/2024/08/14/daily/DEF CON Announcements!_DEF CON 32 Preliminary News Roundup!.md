The [DEF CON presentations are now live](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/) and available for your perusal on the DEF CON media server, free of all commercials, data capture or pesky algorithms. We suggest clearing some disk space and personal time this weekend to snatch up some of the many, many jewels our speakers dropped in Las Vegas. While you’re on media.defcon.org you can also find the slide decks, a ton of pictures and even the DC32 soundtrack. Enjoy, learn a few things and pass it on to someone who can use it.

We’ll be posting the videos on YouTube Monday.

Please enjoy [Cory Doctorow's fantastic presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EmstuO0Em8) on taking back the internet from last month at DEF CON 32. Cory's takes are always thoughtful, provocative and it was his deshittification concept that helped inspire the DC32 theme. More videos from DEF CON coming soon.

As always, pass it on.
