[![Play Ransomware](data:image/png;base64... "Play Ransomware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiy6aNvkvpfvspGBVXWiABqaZSeFgnTKq1CHZvx_1BaE_8QfpREnLmNlVHYTYdwmtljBFj939Q9sADVf3O2feZxv-_qDmKNCRW8-heIVCqSbnqffnmAa4XKTBOBgnW3u6heAfqzHgzULosSG8x-M5QIewpFBaMvx6DGC58A-EjD-DlvdTajBZkqPsvvtowt/s790-rw-e365/ransomware-malware.jpg)

Threat actors with links to the Play ransomware family exploited a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows as a zero-day as part of an attack targeting an unnamed organization in the United States.

The attack, per the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, [leveraged](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/play-ransomware-zero-day) [CVE-2025-29824](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/pipemagic-trojan-exploits-windows-clfs.html), a privilege escalation flaw in the Common Log File System (CLFS) driver. It was patched by Microsoft last month.

[Play](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/new-linux-variant-of-play-ransomware.html), also called Balloonfly and PlayCrypt, is known for its double extortion tactics, wherein sensitive data is exfiltrated prior to encryption in exchange for a ransom. It's active since at least mid-2022.

In the activity observed by Symantec, the threat actors are said to have likely leveraged a public-facing Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) as an entry point, taking advantage of an as-yet-undetermined method to move to another Windows machine on the target network.

The attack is notable for the use of [Grixba](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/ransomware-hackers-using-aukill-tool-to.html), a bespoke information stealer previously attributed to Play and an exploit for CVE-2025-29824 that's dropped in the Music folder, giving it names that masquerade as Palo Alto Networks software (e.g., "paloaltoconfig.exe" and "paloaltoconfig.dll").

The threat actors have also been observed running commands to gather information about all the available machines in the victims' Active Directory and save the results to a CSV file.

"During the execution of the exploit, two files are created in the path C:\ProgramData\SkyPDF," Symantec explained. "The first file, PDUDrv.blf, is a Common Log File System base log file and is an artifact created during exploitation."

"The second file, clssrv.inf, is a DLL that is injected into the winlogon.exe process. This DLL has the ability to drop two additional batch files."

One of the batch files, called "servtask.bat," is used to escalate privileges, dump the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY Registry hives, create a new user named "LocalSvc," and it to the Administrator group. The other batch file, "cmdpostfix.bat," is used to clean up traces of exploitation.

Symantec said that no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion. The findings show that exploits for CVE-2025-29824 may have been available to multiple threat actors before it was fixed by Microsoft.

It's worth noting that the nature of exploitation detailed by the cybersecurity company does not overlap with another activity cluster dubbed [Storm-2460](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/pipemagic-trojan-exploits-windows-clfs.html) that Microsoft disclosed as having weaponized the flaw in a limited set of attacks to deliver a trojan dubbed PipeMagic.

The exploitation of CVE-2025-29824 also points to the trend of ransomware actors using zero-days to infiltrate targets. Last year, Symantec [divulged](https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/black-basta-ransomware-may-have.html) that the Black Basta group may have taken advantage of CVE-2024-26169, a privilege escalation in the Windows Error Reporting Service, as a zero-day.

### New "Bring Your Own Installer" EDR Bypass Used in Babuk Ransomware Attack

The disclosure comes as Aon's Stroz Friedberg Incident Response Services detailed a local bypass technique called Bring Your Own Installer that's being exploited by threat actors to disable endpoint security software and deploy the [Babuk](https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/babuk-source-code-sparks-9-new.html) ransomware.

The attack, per the company, targeted SentinelOne's Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system by exploiting a flaw within the upgrade/downgrade process of the SentinelOne agent after having gained local administrative access on a publicly-accessible server.

"Bring Your Own Installer is a technique which can be used by threat actors to bypass EDR protection on a host through timed termination of the agent update process when inadequately configured," Aon researchers John Ailes and Tim Mashni [said](https://www.aon.com/en/insights/cyber-labs/bring-your-own-installer-bypassing-sentinelone).

The approach is noteworthy because it does not rely on vulnerable drivers or other tools to disarm security software. Rather it exploits a time window in the agent upgrade process to terminate running EDR agents, leaving devices unprotected.

Specifically, it abuses the fact that installing a different version of the software using an MSI file causes it to terminate already running Windows processes before the update is performed.

The Bring Your Own Installer (BYOI) attack essentially involves running a legitimate installer and forcefully terminating the install process by issuing a "taskkill" command after it shuts down the running services.

"Because the old version of SentinelOne processes were terminated during the upgrade, an...
