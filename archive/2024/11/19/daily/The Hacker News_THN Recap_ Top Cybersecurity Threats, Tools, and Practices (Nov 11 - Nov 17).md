What do hijacked websites, fake job offers, and sneaky ransomware have in common? They're proof that cybercriminals are finding smarter, sneakier ways to exploit both systems and people.

This week makes one thing clear: no system, no person, no organization is truly off-limits. Attackers are getting smarter, faster, and more creative‚Äîusing everything from human trust to hidden flaws in technology. The real question is: are you ready?

üí™ Every attack holds a lesson, and every lesson is an opportunity to strengthen your defenses. This isn't just news‚Äîit's your guide to staying safe in a world where cyber threats are everywhere. Let's dive in.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Palo Alto Networks Warns of Zero-Day:** A remote code execution flaw in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewall management interface is the newest zero-day to be [actively exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/pan-os-firewall-vulnerability-under.html) in the wild. The company began warning about potential exploitation concerns on November 8, 2024. It has since been confirmed that it has been weaponized in limited attacks to deploy a web shell. The critical vulnerability has no patches as yet, which makes it all the more crucial that organizations limit management interface access to trusted IP addresses. The development comes as three different critical flaws in Palo Alto Networks Expedition (CVE-2024-5910, CVE-2024-9463, and CVE-2024-9465) have also seen active exploitation attempts. Details are sparse on who is exploiting them and the scale of the attacks.

## **üîî Top News**

* **BrazenBamboo Exploits Unpatched Fortinet Flaw:** A threat-actor known as [BrazenBamboo](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/warning-deepdata-malware-exploiting.html) has exploited an unresolved security flaw in Fortinet's FortiClient for Windows to extract VPN credentials as part of a modular framework called DEEPDATA. Volexity described BrazenBamboo as the developer of three distinct malware families DEEPDATA, DEEPPOST, and LightSpy, and not necessarily one of the operators using them. BlackBerry, which also detailed DEEPDATA, said it has been put to use by the China-linked APT41 actor.
* **About 70,000 Domains Hijacked by Sitting Ducks Attack:** Multiple threat actors have been found taking advantage of an attack technique called [Sitting Ducks](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/experts-uncover-70000-hijacked-domains.html) to hijack legitimate domains for using them in phishing attacks and investment fraud schemes for years. Sitting Ducks exploits misconfigurations in a web domain's domain name system (DNS) settings to take control of it. Of the nearly 800,000 vulnerable registered domains over the past three months, approximately 9% (70,000) have been subsequently hijacked.
* **Got a Dream Job Offer on LinkedIn? It May Be Iranian Hackers:** The Iranian threat actor known as TA455 is targeting LinkedIn users with enticing job offers intended to trick them into running a Windows-based malware named [SnailResin](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/iranian-hackers-use-dream-job-lures-to.html). The attacks have been observed targeting the aerospace, aviation, and defense industries since at least September 2023. Interestingly, the tactics overlap with that of the notorious North Korea-based Lazarus Group.
* **WIRTE Targets Israel With SameCoin Wiper:** WIRTE, a Middle Eastern threat actor affiliated with Hamas, has [orchestrated](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/hamas-affiliated-wirte-employs-samecoin.html) cyber espionage operations against the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, as well as carried out disruptive attacks that exclusively target Israeli entities using SameCoin wiper. The destructive operations were first flagged at the start of the year.
* **ShrinkLocker Decryptor Released:** Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender has [released](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/free-decryptor-released-for-bitlocker.html) a free decryptor to help victims recover data encrypted using the ShrinkLocker ransomware. First identified earlier this year, ShrinkLocker is notable for its abuse of Microsoft's BitLocker utility for encrypting files as part of extortion attacks targeting entities in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan.
