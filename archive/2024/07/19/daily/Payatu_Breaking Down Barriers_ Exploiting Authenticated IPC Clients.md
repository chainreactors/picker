Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a critical aspect of modern computing, enabling different processes within an operating system to exchange data and coordinate actions. Through various methods such as message passing, shared memory, and sockets, IPC facilitates seamless interaction between distinct applications, enhancing system efficiency and functionality. However, ensuring the security of these communications is paramount, as vulnerabilities in authenticated IPC clients can lead to severe breaches and exploitation.
