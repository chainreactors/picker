# Lazarus group uses fake cryptocurrency apps to plant AppleJeus malware

Posted: December 5, 2022
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The North Korean Lazarus Group, aka [APT38](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-analysis/2019/03/the-advanced-persistent-threat-files-lazarus-group/), is one of the most sophisticated North Korean APTs. It’s been active since 2009 and is responsible for many high profile attacks.

In January of 2022 the Malwarebytes Intelligence Team [uncovered](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2022/01/north-koreas-lazarus-apt-leverages-windows-update-client-github-in-latest-campaign) a campaign where Lazarus conducted spear [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attacks weaponized with malicious documents that used a familiar job opportunities theme. Now, [researchers at Volexity](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/12/01/buyer-beware-fake-cryptocurrency-applications-serving-as-front-for-applejeus-malware/) have analyzed a new campaign that is likely targeting cryptocurrency users and organizations with a variant of the AppleJeus [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) by using malicious Microsoft Office documents.

## Lazarus Group

The Lazarus group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean government. It is thought to conduct financial cybercrimes as a way to raise money for a regime that has few trading opportunities, because of long-standing international sanctions. One of the group’s preferred tactics is to use trojanized cryptocurrency related apps, like AppleJeus.

## AppleJeus

Since 2018, one of Lazarus Group’s tactics has been to disguise AppleJeus malware as cryptocurrency trading platforms for both Windows and Mac. In April, CISA [warned](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-108a) that Lazarus Group uses these trojanized applications to gain access to victims’ computers, spread other malware, and steal private keys or to [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) other security gaps. All of this is done to create an environment where the group can initiate fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions.

## The new campaign

The campaign started when Lazarus Group registered the domain *bloxholder[.]com*. The website Lazarus Group built there is a clone of the legitimate website HaasOnline. HaasOnline is a Dutch company that developed HaasScript which is a [crypto](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) scripting language that allows users to create complex automated trading algorithms.

The cloned website distributed a Windows MSI installer that pretended to be an installer for the BloxHolder app. In fact, it was the AppleJeus malware bundled with the [QTBitcoinTrader](https://github.com/JulyIGHOR/QtBitcoinTrader) app, an open source cryptocurrency trading application which has been [used by Lazarus before](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-048a).

*The start screen of the BloxHolder installer*

In the background, the installer creates a [Scheduled Task](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2015/03/scheduled-tasks) which executes the legitimate executable *CameraSettingsUIHost.exe* at logon of any user on the affected system.

## DLL sideloading

When an executable loads a dynamic link library (DLL) in Windows, i...
