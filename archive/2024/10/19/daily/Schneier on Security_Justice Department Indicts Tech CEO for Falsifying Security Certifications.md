If my search skills are reasonable good yet, he must be Deepak Jain, the CEO of AiNET, a company from Baltimore, Maryland. Obivously, unconfirmed!

Re : “CEO of a still unnamed company”

Well a few paragraphs into the WSJ article we find,

> *“Deepak Jain, chief executive of an unnamed information-technology services company operating in Beltsville, Md.*

If true –and it might not be– having the,

1, CEO’s name
2, Likely location of HQ or corporate offices.

Will probably come up in the first page of even a DuckDuck search.

So just a brain dead search using,

[]

Gives as almost the first info –after the regurgitating MSM outlets–,

<https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/data-center-company-ceo-indicted-major-fraud-and-making-false-statements-us-securities-and>

Results in further information about Deepak Jain,

1, They were –past tense– CEO
2, They are 49
3, And “of Potomac”

Also the Beltsville location is also the companies data center…

I could go on but in deference to others sensitivities I will not give the other quite interesting information that rattled out.

The point I’m making is that under the way things are “rigged” “Open Source Intel” is rather more simple than others think.

Oh and US law unlike UK Law does not realy hold with the,

“innocent untill proved guilty”

Stricture, which is why I say “Rigged”

That is the LEOs and Gov Agencies blabber their mouths of in pretense of observing it, whilst in fact encouraging “trial by media” which automatically prejudices a potential jury member usually in the prosecutions favour…

And yes the other information is out there and very easily found thus yes I know the name of the company and somewhat more…

Newer article subscription free and probably identifies the company <https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/17/datacenter_ceo_fake_cert_sec/>

@ ALL,

Whilst yes the company it probably is, has really nice looking offices (except for top floor windows) at an address given on a “Bis Site” with photo.

The persons name is almost like “john smith” in that it is quite common.

Which is why you get several potential organisations.

Interestingly it appears to be the man’s only job, as he is “CEO and Founder” in several online puf pieces for awards and such like. Each one having a differing year as the starting date.

As for Ai.Net if what their site says is true they have 25 locations around the world.

Over on The Register there are comments about how the fraud went on for so long (6years or more)…

From what I can tell whilst the firm may not have been correctly certified, and the documentation to that effect shall we say “invented”. Nobody is saying the company ever failed to deliver on what it said it was going to deliver on as a service.

So once the contract was inked there was no reason by way of “failure to perform” to call it into question.

As a side note, it’s well known that companies set up bogus organisations that “issue awards” annually and the like… Even the “Big Players” do such things.

But those with longer memories may remember the scandal of “The Big Four Accountancy Firms” who basically had significant “conflict of interest” / “self interest” to “sign off annual accounts” etc of firms buying their expensive consulting…

Basically the companies would do the paperwork and the accountancy firm would “rubber stamp” without doing any checking let alone due diligence. These would then get submitted to share holders and government regulators who would all “Nod them by”.

In more recent times we’ve seen a lot of self signed nonsense in Boeing “unwind” unfortunately with a lot of harm.

Remember every time you hear someone going on about “small government” and “cutting red tape” and all the rest of that “get rid of regulation” nonsense the result will always be a “race to the bottom”. And all to often it’s “Fraud” that does not get prosecuted because it would be to big/expensive to stamp out. So we see “no fault admitted fines” and the exces involved just treat them as “a cost of doing business”.

Some might have noticed that this week “automated vehicles” have been very much called into question over “safety concerns” due to very real harms to people.

As I’ve mentioned before I’ve worked eith what was called AI systems since the 1980’s putting “expert systems” and “fuzzy logic” into control systems like auto driver rail vehicle breaking systems.

We would not call them AI by todays standards, and they were/are cert...
