ANY.RUN & Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR: Streamline SOC Workflows for Top Performance

Swamped by incident alerts, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) struggle to quickly identify and prioritize high-risk attacks, leaving critical infrastructure exposed to ransomware and data theft. [ANY.RUN’s integration](https://cortex.marketplace.pan.dev/marketplace/details/ANYRUN/) with [Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar) solves this by automating proactive sandbox analysis and threat intelligence correlation to beat alert fatigue, boost detection rates, and accelerate security workflows.

## ANY.RUN & Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR Integration

Security Operations Centers (SOCs) using Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR can now seamlessly integrate [ANY.RUN’s products](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=palo_alto_networks_integration&utm_term=160925&utm_content=linktolanding) into their workflows.

The ANY.RUN content pack includes connectors for the Interactive Sandbox, Threat Intelligence Lookup, and Threat Intelligence Feeds, empowering SOCs to streamline alert triage, broaden threat detection, and improve identification of elusive malware.
