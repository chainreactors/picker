## Museum Security

Interesting [interview](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/van-gogh-tomato-soup-national-gallery-london/671764/):

> Banks don’t take millions of dollars and put them in plastic bags and hang them on the wall so everybody can walk right up to them. But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it’s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it’s the world’s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh.
>
> It’s a challenge. But we try to predict the items that might be most vulnerable. Which are not necessarily most valuable; some things have symbolic significance to them. And then we try to predict what the next targets might be and advise our clients that they maybe need to put special security on those items.

As it happens, the Bank of England *does* have millions of pounds’ worth of both gold and paper money on display for anyone to walk up to — it has a museum which contains things like a large gold bar and some of the million-pound notes that are used internally for accounting.purposes.

Regardless of the agenda of “Just Stop Oil” and somewhat unstable ideology it follows and if they did check the protection of the painting… they were still in violation of several laws and museum protection policies. Why fund security, physical or electronic, if you are going to sidestep when it comes to political activism putting risk very near to “bags of money hanging on the wall”?

Historically, people who destroy or attempt to destroy art, have been “the bad guys”; lets not forget that component.

Similar to what Mike wrote, the Bank of Canada’s pre-2014 Currency Museum had lots of banknotes on display too—probably trillions of dollars, if the Zimbabwe dollars are counted. Granted, these were in sealed roll-out drawers and not plastic bags. The nearby Mint gift shop does let people lift (slightly) a gold bar worth upwards of 100,000 CAD, and has a guard just for that.

I’m surprised at the claim that it’s difficult to protect a painting against soup, given that a piece of glass did exactly that and is apparently common. The article does go on to say that sometimes museums want to use the original frame, and it can be difficult to modify without visible damage. And the glass doesn’t go over the top and back and sides, which I’d have expected—don’t they also have to guard against water damage from fire sprinklers and hoses? But I suppose museum fire-protection is gonna be its own surprisingly complex topic.

I blame George Costanza for all of this. He gave a guard a chair to sit in and it’s been downhill ever since.

So we should start with window barriers over the art, I think?

@All

It’s all in the same vein as a “prank” where the people self-select themselves to be arbiters of Fun and Not Fun. Groups of like minded self-selectors eventually come to the conclusion it’s Alright to Have Fun – provided THEY don’t catch any flack back.

Like the ones roaming the streets inserting lentil beans into car tire valve stems and tighten down the cap. The lentil pushes the release valve when the cap is tightened slowly deflating the tire.

It’s similar to the old “Stick an Ice Pick in the Side Wall”, but makes them feel more sanctified.

Or the ones hacking into school computer systems as an Unofficial Fun Pen-Test Project. Give them a all A+++ and a scholarship for that. Such a grand idea!

There’s the ones taking Up Skirt and Up Kilt pictures or the ones hanging micro-mini video cameras in bathrooms, showers and under the toilet seat-rim.

It’s all FUN don’t you see? Can’t you take a JOKE Bro???

NO – I cannot take it as a joke.

Art is one of the few items that humans do voluntarily. It’s done for many reasons and we wonder at how driven those reasons are. Music, Art, Theater are human activities and have emotional impacts on the viewers and listeners.

It’s something just a precious as the tiny sugar ant visiting your kitchen for that drop of sugar crystal that fell on the table. We crush them without a thought.

That pretty much sums up their Attitude to Everything: No Thought.

@ ALL,

Re : It’s not just museum security.

First of did anybody else notice that the protesters –as they call themselves– used the wrong brand of soup?

That would have lost them “sympathy points” with the liberal elite that are alleged to be ultimately in charge of UK art museums…

But more seriously,

Yes it is hard to protect against a can of soup, and a lot easier to protect against it’s contents (which was what was actually thrown).

In the UK a can of soup has 400g of contents and depending on the brand 25g upwards of “tin can”. So call it about a pound in weight, thus it’s not something you would want thrown at your head or even toughened glass. Especially as mechanically they are very strong from end to end even when empty[1].

But again that is realy a secondary point. Because the real question people should be asking is not about museum security, but,

“**Why the protestors protested the way they did**“…

In the US you allegadly have the “Right of ‘free speech'” and to an extent that extends to protesting.

In the UK whilst we did not have a right to protes...
