# Palo Alto Networks Is a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Zero Trust Platforms

We are excited to announce that Palo Alto Networks is a Leader in [The Forrester Wave™: Zero Trust Platforms, Q3 2025](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/announcing-the-forrester-wave-zero-trust-platforms-q3-2025-choosing-a-platform-solution-for-your-zero-trust-journey/). We achieved the highest score in the Current Offering category, which we believe underscores our innovation in zero trust, SASE and network security.

Zero trust is foundational to modern cybersecurity. Trust is never implicit and must always be continuously verified, regardless of user, device or location. In today's hybrid and evolving threat landscape, a robust zero trust strategy is essential.

Our comprehensive zero trust platform is designed to minimize the attack surface, prevent unauthorized access, and limit the lateral movement of threats. It ensures that only validated and authorized activity occurs across your network, applications and data. This proactive stance is critical for protecting against sophisticated cyberattacks and maintaining business continuity.

With leading-edge solutions like Prisma® SASE, Prisma Access Browser and Prisma AIRS®, we continue to define excellence in zero trust.

To us, this report reflects our superior capabilities. We received a score of 5 – the highest possible score – in 11 criteria, including:

* **Innovation:** We have continued investment in transformative, integrated platform capabilities.
* **Workforce Security and Identity:** We have robust tools for policy management across diverse environments.
* **Visibility and Analytics:** Our highly differentiated capabilities identify and respond to evolving threats.

Palo Alto Networks sees Forrester's assessment as a testament to our continued innovation:

> Its superior innovation score highlights the vendor's ability to invest in and deliver transformative capabilities that integrate well with its platform ecosystem.

## Our Zero Trust Network Security Strategy

Our [Network Security Platform](/network-security) forms the foundation of our Zero Trust strategy, unifying security across your entire estate.

* **Unified Management and Operations in the Cloud** – Strata™ Cloud Manager centralizes management, allowing consistent policy enforcement across your infrastructure.
* **AI-Powered Real-Time Security** – For real-time threat prevention, our AI-driven cloud-delivered security services, like Advanced WildFire® and Advanced Threat Prevention, use machine learning and deep learning from 70,000+ customer data insights to stop threats instantly.
* **Consistently Applied to Every Environment from SASE to NGFW** – Our platform applies policies across all environments via enforcement points including our industry-leading Prisma SASE, Prisma AIRS and our broad portfolio of Hardware and Software NGFW. This secures both AI and non-AI workloads against network and AI-specific threats, in clouds, containers or data centers.

## **Breakthrough Innovations for the Next Generation of Zero Trust**

As threats evolve, so do our solutions. We're delivering breakthrough innovations for the next generation of zero trust, exemplified by Prisma® Access Browser and Prisma AIRS™.

**Prisma Access Browser** **–** [Prisma Access Browser](/sase/prisma-access-browser) reshapes workforce security by protecting data where it is accessed before from the browser. It securely enables the use of third-party GenAI applications, like ChatGPT. Managed via Strata Cloud Manager, it transforms the web browser into a secure, enterprise-ready solution for remote work, zero trust and compliance, eliminating clunky VPNs and security gaps.

**Prisma AIRS® –** With the once-in-a-generation adoption of AI, securing AI is paramount. [Prisma AIRS](/prisma/prisma-ai-runtime-security) is the world's most comprehensive AI security platform, designed to secure the entire enterprise AI ecosystem, from applications and agents to models and data, across their lifecycle. Prisma AIRS addresses critical AI security needs: AI model scanning for vulnerabilities, posture management to prevent misconfigurations, and AI red teaming to uncover risks. It also provides essential runtime security against threats like prompt injection and malicious code data leaks, enabling confident AI deployment.
