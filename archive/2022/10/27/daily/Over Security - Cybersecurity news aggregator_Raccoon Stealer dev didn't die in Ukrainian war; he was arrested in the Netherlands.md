Back in March, the administrator of the Raccoon Infostealer malware [announced](https://medium.com/s2wblog/raccoon-stealer-is-back-with-a-new-version-5f436e04b20d) they were shutting down their service after "a friend and a great developer" who was responsible for maintaining critical parts of their infrastructure had been "lost" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a month earlier.

But—surprise, surprise—it turns out that the developer didn't die in the war, and he stopped responding to his co-workers because he was arrested in the Netherlands at the request of the FBI.

All of this came to light yesterday when the US Department of Justice [unsealed charges](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/newly-unsealed-indictment-charges-ukrainian-national-international-cybercrime-operation) against Mark Sokolovsky, 26, a Ukrainian national, for his role in maintaining the Raccoon Infostealer (also known as Raccoon Stealer) malware-as-a-service (MaaS).

The DOJ said that together with Dutch and Italian authorities, the FBI also seized servers operated by the Raccoon gang, effectively taking offline that older version of the Raccoon operation.

The Raccoon gang [made a comeback](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-1-the-return-of-the-dead/) three months later, in June, with [version 2.0](https://blog.sekoia.io/raccoon-stealer-v2-part-2-in-depth-analysis/), most likely after they found a replacement for their "departed" colleague.

DOJ officials said the FBI found approximately 50 million unique user credentials stored on the seized Raccoon Infostealer servers, representing credentials stolen from the browsers of users infected by the Raccoon gang and their MaaS customers.

Authorities said they don't believe they have the entire list of stolen credentials pilfered by the Raccoon operation, but they are making the entire data set searchable via a [dedicated website](https://raccoon.ic3.gov/), so users and companies can see if any of them got infected by the malware in the past and proceed to change credentials.

### Breaches and hacks

**L2DAO crypto-heist:** Ethereum investment project L2DAO [confirmed](https://twitter.com/TheLayer2DAO/status/1583994186982109185) on Monday that a hacker drained 49,950,000 L2DAO tokens from its project, worth around $234,000, at the time of the incident. The company said the hacker dumped the funds, but they were able to repurchase 31,239,677 L2DAO tokens ($146,000) with its own treasury.

**Binance hack investigation:** Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the company is [narrowing down](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/binance-narrowing-down-identity-of-hacker-behind-bnb-crypto-hack-ceo.html) the identity of the hacker behind the recent $570 million hack of its BNB Chain platform earlier this month.

**E-Pal breach:** E-Pal, a web service dedicated to helping gamers find free or pro teammates for their favorite games, has [disclosed](https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/reports/sb24-557915) a security breach that took place earlier this month. The company's data, leaked online, was also [added to HIBP](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/1584410212173484032).

ePal, a website dedicated to finding friends on Discord, was breached by individuals on Breached Forums. The individuals behind the breach exfiltrated data and defaced the website.
It appears they are unhappy with the research conducted by some individuals in Threat Intelligence

### General tech and privacy

**First FTC ruling of its kind:** The US Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with online alcohol delivery service Drizly relating to its 2020 security breach that exposed the personal data of more than 2.5 million of its users. The [settlement](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/10/ftc-takes-action-against-drizly-its-ceo-james-cory-rellas-security-failures-exposed-data-25-million) requires that the company, which has since been acquired by Uber, destroy unnecessary data it collected about its users and further restricts Drizly from similar broad data collection in the future. In addition, the settlement is the first of its kind, as it also includes a clause against Drizly CEO James Cory Rellas. [More extensive coverage in *[The Record](https://therecord.media/ftc-seeks-action-against-drizly-and-its-ceo-for-cybersecurity-failures/)*]

> "Notably, the order applies personally to Rellas, who presided over Drizly's lax data security practices as CEO. [...] Specifically, Rellas will be required to implement an information security program at future companies if he moves to a business collecting consumer information from more than 25,000 individuals, and where he is a majority owner, CEO, or senior officer with information security responsibilities."

**Interserve fine:** The UK Information Commissioner Officer levied a massive [£4.4 million ($5 million) fine](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2022/10/biggest-cyber-risk-is-complacency-not-hackers/) against Interserve, a Berkshire-based construction company, for failing to update software and train staff, w...
