# Feds Tie ‘Scattered Spider’ Duo to $115M in Ransoms

U.S. prosecutors last week levied criminal hacking charges against 19-year-old U.K. national **Thalha Jubair** for allegedly being a core member of **Scattered Spider**, a prolific cybercrime group blamed for extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from victims. The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.

At a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old **Owen Flowers**, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled **Transport for London**, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.

On July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity [reported](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/uk-charges-four-in-scattered-spider-ransom-group/) that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider [ransom attacks](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/ransoms-hackers-cyber-crime-t5kjldwwm) against the retailers **Marks & Spencer** and **Harrods**, and the British food retailer **Co-op Group**.

That story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group’s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by **MGM Resorts** and **Caesars Entertainment**.

The story also noted that Jubair’s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair’s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.

## EARLY DAYS (2021-2022)

Jubair is alleged to have been a core member of the **LAPSUS$** cybercrime group that [broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/), stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including **Microsoft**, **Nvidia**, **Okta**, **Rockstar Games**, **Samsung**, **T-Mobile**, and **Uber**.

That is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity [published internal chat records](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/leaked-chats-show-lapsus-stole-t-mobile-source-code/) taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames **Amtrak** and **Asyntax**. In the middle of the gang’s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile’s logo in images sent to the group because he’d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.

The leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax’s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:

That story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including “**Everlynn**,” who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that [sold fraudulent “emergency data requests”](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/) targeting the major social media and email providers.

In these so-called “fake EDR” schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can’t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.

## EARTHTOSTAR

Prosecutors in New Jersey last week [alleged](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-kingdom-national-charged-connection-multiple-cyber-attacks-including-critical) Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, **0ktapus**, and **UNC3944**, and that he used the nicknames **EarthtoStar**, **Brad**, **Austin**, and **Austistic**.

Beginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called **Star Chat**, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.

Jubair allegedly used the handle “Earth2Star,” a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.

The group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target’s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim’s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.

In February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with “Tmo up!” and “Tmo down!” notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile’s network.

A redacted receipt from Star Chat’s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.

The data showed that Star Chat — along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time — [collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/). However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.

A review of EarthtoStar’s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm **Flashpoint** shows this person also sold “AT&T email resets” and AT&T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpo...
