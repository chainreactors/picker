The cybersecurity threat landscape has witnessed a dramatic and alarming rise in the average ransomware payment, an increase exceeding 500%. Sophos, a global leader in cybersecurity, revealed in its annual "State of Ransomware 2024" report that the average ransom payment has increased 500% in the last year with organizations that paid a ransom reporting an average payment of $2 million, up from $400,000 in 2023. Separately, RISK & INSURANCE, a leading media source for the insurance industry reported recently that in 2023 the median ransom demand soared to $20 million in 2023 from $1.4 million in 2022, and payment skyrocketed to $6.5 million in 2023 from $335,000 in 2022, much more than 500%.

This shocking surge is a testament to the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and the significant vulnerabilities inherent in outdated security methods. The most significant factor contributing to this trend is a broad reliance on twenty-year-old, legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which is proving entirely inadequate against modern cyberattacks. Moreover, the adoption of Generative AI has enabled cybercriminals to craft remarkably convincing phishing attacks, making them nearly undetectable to even well-trained users. This article explores the reasons behind the rapid increase in average ransomware payments, the shortcomings of legacy MFA, and the need for next-generation MFA solutions.

## **Three Factors Driving The Increase in Ransomware Payments**

### **Better targeting by cybercriminals**

In pursuit of ever-increasing ransom payments, cybercriminals have refocused their efforts and tactics to identify and cripple organizations where they can cause the greatest interruption in operations to extract the largest ransom payments. Examples include the $100 million loss by MGM, the billion-dollar-plus loss by Change HealthCare, and the yet-to-be determined losses by CDK Global. Cybercriminals are acutely aware of this economic calculus and leverage it to demand exorbitant sums, knowing that victims are likely to comply to minimize losses. It is a simple yet painful business decision for the victim.

### **Utilization of Generative AI in phishing attacks**

Generative AI technologies have revolutionized the way cybercriminals create phishing emails. These tools generate highly convincing and personalized phishing messages free from grammatical and spelling errors that are indistinguishable from legitimate communications. By analyzing vast amounts of data, Generative AI can mimic writing styles, create believable scenarios, and target individuals with precision. These attacks convincingly mimic emails from trusted sources, complete with accurate branding and contextually relevant information. Organizations that rely on employee training as a defense strategy are increasingly seeing diminishing returns for their investment.

Download the white paper ["Secure Your Data with Phishing-Resistant MFA"](https://www.tokenring.com/wp-phishing-resistant-mfa-lp) to discover how next-generation wearable MFA can protect your sensitive information and overcome the shortcomings of legacy solutions.

### **Outdated Security Practices**

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been a mainstay of perimeter security for decades, designed to enhance the protection of enterprise networks by requiring multiple forms of verification. However, legacy MFA systems including Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA), One Time Passwords (OTP), and authentication apps, developed twenty years ago, are increasingly inadequate against modern cyberattacks. Legacy MFA has been defeated in the overwhelming majority of successful ransomware attacks. Legacy MFA is now quickly compromised by cybercriminals in the following ways.

* Phishing Attacks: Attackers trick users into providing their MFA credentials through fake login pages or social engineering tactics.
* SIM Swapping: Attackers convince a mobile carrier to transfer the victim's phone number to a SIM card they control, intercepting SMS-based MFA codes.
* Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Attackers intercept communications between the user and the online service, capturing the MFA tokens and using them to authenticate.
* Malware: Malicious software on a user's device can capture authentication tokens, passwords, or keystrokes, allowing attackers to bypass MFA.
* Other Social Engineering: Attackers may manipulate individuals into revealing their MFA credentials or into performing actions that bypass MFA controls.
* Session Hijacking: Attackers gain access to an active session token (e.g., through XSS, CSRF attacks, or session fixation) and use it to bypass MFA. Once they have the session token, they can impersonate the user without needing to re-authenticate.
* Account Recovery Process Exploitation**:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the account recovery process to reset the user's MFA settings, often bypassing MFA.

## **The Case for Implementing Next-Generation MFA**

To effectively combat the virtual tsunami of ransomware attacks, organizations must consider phishing-resistant, next-generation MFA technologies. These advanced solutions incorporate a range of sophisticated authentication factors, including biometrics (such as fingerprint and facial ...
