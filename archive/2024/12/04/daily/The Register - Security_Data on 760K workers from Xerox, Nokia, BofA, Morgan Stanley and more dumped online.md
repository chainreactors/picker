Hundreds of thousands of employees from major corporations including Xerox, Nokia, Koch, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and others appear to be the latest victims in a massive data breach linked to last year's attacks on file transfer tool MOVEit.

On Monday morning, an entity that uses the handle "Nam3L3ss" began [leaking](https://bsky.app/profile/darkwebinformer.bsky.social/post/3lcdhmipdtk2q) what they claimed to be personal data belonging to from the abovementioned corporations, plus workers at other firms affected by the MOVEit vulnerability.

The Russia-linked [Cl0p ransomware crew](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/clop_broke_into_the_doe/) began abusing this critical security hole in Progress Software's MOVEit product suite in May 2023. Thousands of organizations' and [millions of individuals' data](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/08/georgia_state_education_moveit/) was accessed.
