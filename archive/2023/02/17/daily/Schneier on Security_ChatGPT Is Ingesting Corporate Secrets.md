## ChatGPT Is Ingesting Corporate Secrets

[Interesting](https://futurism.com/the-byte/amazon-begs-employees-chatgpt):

> According to internal Slack messages that were [leaked to *Insider*](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-openai-warns-employees-not-share-confidential-information-microsoft-2023-1), an Amazon lawyer told workers that they had “already seen instances” of text generated by ChatGPT that “closely” resembled internal company data.
>
> This issue seems to have come to a head recently because Amazon staffers and other tech workers throughout the industry have begun using ChatGPT as a “[coding assistant](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/01/chatgpt-python-programming-assistant.html)” of sorts to help them write or improve strings of code, the report notes.
>
> […]
>
> “This is important because your inputs may be used as training data for a further iteration of ChatGPT,” the lawyer wrote in the Slack messages viewed by Insider, “and we wouldn’t want its output to include or resemble our confidential information.”

Just remember, what you put in ChatGPT *stays* in ChatGPT!

When you bare your soul (code/next great criminal enterprise/etc) to the machine, of course it’s going to eat it.

Oh fair thee well, dear friend, and take great heed

So if thou wouldst keep secrets close and tight,
And guard thy treasures from all prying sight,
Then shun this friendly chatbot’s tempting hold,
And keep thy lips and thoughts from being told.

For though ChatGPT may seem a trusty friend,
Its memory doth not know an end,
And what thou sayest in the heat of speech,
May be recalled in ways beyond thy reach.

So let this be a warning, dear and true,
That secrets shared with ChatGPT may ensue
A breach of trust, a loss of privacy,
And consequences beyond thy fantasy.

Good luck with that. When your tool is based on a web crawler that looks for every bit of connected data, it will turn up proprietary information and propagate it.

Long time lurker here. I have tested ChatGPT with some subtleties of the English language. Apparently it hasn’t been trained on puns or jokes.

Question:

Are roses on the piano better than tulips on the organ?

Answer:

The comparison between roses on the piano and tulips on the organ is subjective and depends on personal preferences and opinions. Some people might prefer the aesthetic of roses on a piano because of the delicate and romantic connotations associated with the flower. Others might prefer the bright and bold colors of tulips on an organ, as they can add a cheerful and energetic touch to the musical instrument. Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal taste, and both flowers have the potential to create a beautiful and appealing display.

Question:

If you worship a dog are you dyslexic?

Answer:

No, worshiping a dog does not necessarily indicate that a person is dyslexic. Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that affects a person’s ability to read and write, but it has no direct relationship with the worship of dogs or any other object. Worshiping a dog, or any other animal, might reflect a person’s cultural or religious beliefs, but it does not necessarily indicate the presence of dyslexia or any other learning disorder. It’s important to remember that dyslexia is a complex condition that affects individuals in different ways and that each person’s experience with dyslexia is unique.

Instead of speculating about it, I just asked ChatGPT itself:

> Q: When can ChatGPT leak information it recieves from it’s users?
>
> A: As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to leak information intentionally or unintentionally. However, it is important to note that any information provided to me is stored in a database, and as with any database, there is always a risk of a security breach.
>
> To mitigate this risk, the developers of the platform I am running on have implemented various security measures to protect user data, such as encryption and access controls. Additionally, they have strict policies and procedures in place to ensure that any access to user data is only done for authorized purposes and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
>
> It is also important for users to be cautious about the type of information they provide to me or any other AI language model, as there is always a possibility that the information could be inadvertently shared or compromised. Users should be mindful of the sensitivity of the information they share and only provide what is necessary for the specific task or query they are working on.

like mine colleagues love to cut&paste production jsons/xmls into public-free-pretty formatters/validators.
Or google/bing stole everything unintentianally typed into url bar.
Or just paste something just copied from Teams (together with username).

Basically, it’s being trained to be politically correct even if it means spreading lies and propaganda. So if a high ranking Chinese Communist Party member feeds to ChatGPT a definition of “good”, “right”, or “just” versus a Westerner, Capitalism-oriented/leaning
person’s definitions of the same terms – then you’ll have western-defined terms painted as propaganda by the CCP and vice-versa. No?

@Sid Justice

yup, it would get biased according to its training. Although Chinese “communism” has been rather “capital...
