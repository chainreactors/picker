Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new campaign that exploits a known security flaw impacting Apache HTTP Server to deliver a cryptocurrency miner called **Linuxsys**.

The vulnerability in question is [CVE-2021-41773](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/new-patch-released-for-actively.html) (CVSS score: 7.5), a high-severity [path traversal vulnerability](https://viz.greynoise.io/tags/apache-http-server-path-traversal-attempt) in Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.49 that could result in remote code execution.

"The attacker leverages compromised legitimate websites to distribute malware, enabling stealthy delivery and evasion of detection," VulnCheck's Jacob Baines [said](https://www.vulncheck.com/blog/linuxsys-cryptominer) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

The infection sequence, observed earlier this month and originating from an Indonesian IP address [103.193.177[.]152](https://viz.greynoise.io/ip/103.193.177.152), is designed to drop a next-stage payload from "repositorylinux[.]org" using curl or wget.

The payload is a shell script that's responsible for downloading the Linuxsys cryptocurrency miner from five different legitimate websites, suggesting that the threat actors behind the campaign have managed to compromise third-party infrastructure to facilitate the distribution of the malware.

"This approach is clever because victims connect to legitimate hosts with valid SSL certificates, making detection less likely," VulnCheck noted. "Additionally, it provides a layer of separation for the downloader site ('repositorylinux[.]org') since the malware itself isn't hosted there."

The sites also host another shell script named "cron.sh" that ensures that the miner is launched automatically upon a system reboot. Cybersecurity firm said it also identified two Windows executables on the hacked sites, raising the possibility that the attackers are also going after Microsoft's desktop operating system.

It's worth noting that attacks distributing the Linuxsys miner have previously [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/geoserver-vulnerability-targeted-by.html) a critical security flaw in OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools (CVE-2024-36401, CVSS score: 9.8), as documented by Fortinet FortiGuard Labs in September 2024.

Interestingly, the shell script dropped following the exploitation of the flaw was downloaded from "repositorylinux[.]com," with comments in the source code written in Sundanese, an Indonesian language. The same shell script has been [detected](https://righteousit.com/2021/12/28/hudaks-honeypot-part-4/) in the wild as far back as December 2021.

Some of the other vulnerabilities exploited to deliver the miner in recent years include -

* [CVE-2023-22527](https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/atlassian-confluence-vulnerability.html), a template injection vulnerability in Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Confluence Server
* [CVE-2023-34960](https://blog.imunify360.com/critical-unauthenticated-command-injection-in-chamilo-lms-exploited-in-the-wild), a command injection vulnerability in Chamilo Learning Management Systems (LMS)
* [CVE-2023-38646](https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/major-security-flaw-discovered-in.html), a command injection vulnerability in Metabase
* [CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474](https://www.darktrace.com/blog/darktraces-view-on-operation-lunar-peek-exploitation-of-palo-alto-firewall-devices-cve-2024-2012-and-2024-9474), are authentication bypass and privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Palo Alto Networks firewalls

"All of this indicates that the attacker has been conducting a long-term campaign, employing consistent techniques such as n-day exploitation, staging content on compromised hosts, and coin mining on victim machines," VulnCheck said.

"Part of their success comes from careful targeting. They appear to avoid low interaction honeypots and require high interaction to observe their activity. Combined with the use of compromised hosts for malware distribution, this approach has largely helped the attacker avoid scrutiny."

The discovery of Linuxsys miner attacks coincides with a new campaign associated with the H2Miner cryptocurrency mining botnet that delivers [Kinsing](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/kinsing-hacker-group-exploits-more.html), a remote access trojan (RAT) commonly used to deliver mining malware by targeting a wide variety of Linux-based infrastructure systems.

What makes the attack chain stand out is that it also delivers a Visual Basic Script-based variant of Lcryx ransomware, called Lcrypt0rx, marking the first documented instance of operational overlap between the two malware families.

"Lcryx is a relatively new VBScript-based ransomware strain first observed in November 2024," security researcher Akshat Pradhan [said](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/old-miner-new-tricks). "This family exhibits several unusual characteristics that suggest it may have been generated using artificial intelligence."

The attacks involve the use of a shell script that terminates processes related to security tools, databases, and other user...
