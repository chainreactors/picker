**Update 11/19/24: The Senate Judiciary Committee is still scheduled to vote on the PREVAIL Act on Thursday, Nov. 21, 2024. Please express your continued opposition through our action center, linked below.**

A patent on [crowdfunding](https://www.eff.org/alice/alice-decision-saves-crowdfunding-patent-troll). A patent on [tracking packages](https://www.eff.org/alice/bike-gear-company-nearly-run-over-patent-troll). A patent on [photo contests](https://www.eff.org/alice/photographer-attacked-ludicrous-online-voting-patent). A patent on [watching an ad online](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/victory-court-finally-throws-out-ultramercials-infamous-patent-advertising). A patent on [computer bingo](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/appeals-court-knocks-out-computer-bingo-patents/). A patent on [upselling](https://b2iplaw.com/swip-report/already-alice-corp-v-cls-bank-has-brought-a-sea-change-in-patent-ineligibility/).

These are just a few of the patents used to harass software developers and small companies in recent years. Thankfully, they were tossed out by U.S. courts, thanks to [the landmark 2014 Supreme Court decision in *Alice v. CLS Bank*](https://www.eff.org/alice). The *Alice* ruling Â has effectively ended hundreds of lawsuits where defendants were improperly sued for basic computer use.
