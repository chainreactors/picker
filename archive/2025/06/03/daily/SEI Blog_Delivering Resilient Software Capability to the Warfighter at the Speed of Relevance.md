In March, the secretary of defense [directed](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/4114775/modern-software-acquisition-to-speed-delivery-boost-warfighter-lethality/) the Department of Defense (DoD) to adopt the [Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP)](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/library/dod-software-acquisition-pathway-modernizing-and-speeding-software-acquisition/) to accelerate the development and deployment of capabilities to the warfighter. The directive to default to the SWP arrives at a time when DoD missions increasingly rely on software and the related technologies of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI)—all of which are focus areas at the SEI. These technical areas grow in importance as national security and defense organizations require enhanced capabilities to protect a broader range of targets against more sophisticated and adept threats.

In this post, I will highlight the ways in which our research and development support DoD’s use of modern software practices at each phase of the software development and operation lifecycle.

## The SEI and the Software Acquisition Pathway

The SEI’s depth of experience with data-driven techniques, methods, and approaches; software engineering; and acquisition science catalyzed our work on the SWP.

Section 255 of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) called on the DoD to orient its software activities in research, development, testing, and acquisition toward modern software engineering practices described in two studies that SEI also contributed to: the Defense Innovation Board’s 2019 [Software Acquisition and Practices](https://innovation.defense.gov/software/) (SWAP) and the Defense Science Board Task Force’s 2018 [Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1048883).

As part of our SWP work, the SEI worked hand-in-hand with stakeholders across the DoD and the defense industrial base in the iterative development, testing, and updating of the policy and supporting tools and resources. As called for in the policy document DoDI 5000.87, DoD programs are to emphasize risk-based cybersecurity throughout the lifecycle, relying on modern software practices including DevSecOps. Cybersecurity and DevSecOps form a foundation on which these programs can incorporate new AI technologies more securely.

Since the SEI’s inception as a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), we have worked with academia, government, and industry to conduct research and help DoD programs apply these essential tools, techniques, practices, and policies. The SEI prioritizes development of techniques to support continuous, resilient, and timely deployment of software capability for the warfighter while ensuring that software system performance and security are not compromised in mission-critical settings.

## SEI Impact on Modernizing DoD Software Development

Over the last decade, the DoD has been incorporating principles and practices that promote continuous, iterative deployment of software capability. One such initiative was the development of the 250-plus member Agile Collaboration Group. Members share lessons learned to help DoD practitioners more readily benefit from using Agile methods in their larger-scale systems. When the group began in 2012, it focused on overcoming adoption challenges around Agile. In 2017, it expanded into DevSecOps research, development, and field engagement.

In 2024 the SEI conducted a study examining [the state of DevSecOps in the DoD](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/DevSecOpsStateOf.pdf), the results of which were recently released by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO). The study found that while certain programs have had success adopting DevSecOps practices, the DoD still needs to implement these successes at scale. The study holds in part that

* Investing in DoD software factories is key to securing our future capability.
* DevSecOps is a key strategy to accelerate delivery time.
* Success rests on reimagining a mission-ready DevSecOps workforce.
* Strong leadership committed to creatively driving solutions is critical to overcoming barriers.

The DevSecOps study also recognizes that it is necessary to align those practices with the mission.

To a significant degree, the effective use of modern software practices rests on recognizing the strategic value of data that is now available to the DoD in increasingly massive amounts. To give DoD analysts greater visibility into DevSecOps pipeline data, the SEI recently released [Polar](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/polar-improving-devsecops-observability/), a solution to the limitations of traditional batch data processing. Polar gives visibility into the current state of an organization’s DevSecOps infrastructure, allowing for the entirety of the data to be engaged for informed decision making. The Polar framework, [which can be downloaded from the SEI’s GitHub site](https://github.com/cmu-sei/Polar), helps DevSecOps organizations monitor and gain insights into security aspects and address the challenges posed by building complex software systems in highly regulated environments.

DoD program leaders must increasingly manage all of the software development capability. This responsibility often means dealing effectively with the technical debt that can accumulate in aging systems as well as that which can accumulate in rapid, iterative development. The SEI has been a [pioneer in developing and applying technical debt](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/topics/tec...
