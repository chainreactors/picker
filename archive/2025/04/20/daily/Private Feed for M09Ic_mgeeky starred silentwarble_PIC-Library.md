# PIC-Library

A collection of position independent resources. Code snippets, blog posts, everything PIC.

During the development of [Hannibal](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Hannibal), I spent quite a bit of time looking for and adapting functionality. Many libraries were written in ways that were not easy to modify for position independent coding.

This repo is intended to create a central location to find content that is known PIC friendly. This will hopefully aid in the development process.

### Note

BOF related content has not been included as there are plenty of resources documenting BOF development. This repo is not dedicated to a specific format. It is designed to include functionality that is written in a PIC friendly way.

If you're looking for BOF resources, simply search Github: <https://github.com/search?q=bof&type=...
