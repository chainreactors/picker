## Hacking Electronic Safes

Vulnerabilities in [electronic safes](https://www.wired.com/story/securam-prologic-safe-lock-backdoor-exploits/) that use Securam Prologic locks:

> While both their techniques represent glaring security vulnerabilities, Omo says it’s the one that exploits a feature intended as a legitimate unlock method for locksmiths that’s the more widespread and dangerous. “This attack is something where, if you had a safe with this kind of lock, I could literally pull up the code right now with no specialized hardware, nothing,” Omo says. “All of a sudden, based on our testing, it seems like people can get into almost any Securam Prologic lock in the world.”
>
> […]
>
> Omo and Rowley say they informed Securam about both their safe-opening techniques in spring of last year, but have until now kept their existence secret because of legal threats from the company. “We will refer this matter to our counsel for trade libel if you choose the route of public announcement or disclosure,” a Securam representative wrote to the two researchers ahead of last year’s Defcon, where they first planned to present their research.
>
> Only after obtaining pro bono legal representation from the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Coders’ Rights Project did the pair decide to follow through with their plan to speak about Securam’s vulnerabilities at Defcon. Omo and Rowley say they’re even now being careful not to disclose enough technical detail to help others replicate their techniques, while still trying to offer a warning to safe owners about two different vulnerabilities that exist in many of their devices.

The company says that it plans on updating its locks by the end of the year, but have no plans to patch any locks already sold.

Just disclosing that a vuln exists helps people find it. That’s NOT a reason to hide vulns, the disclosure done responsibly helps improve security.

My guess is that backdoors exist in all electronic safes.

For your hotel safe to be truly secure,
the entire staff has to practice master-key hygiene.
Do you believe that?
When a guest wants their safe unlocked now,
because they have to catch a plane,
don’t you think all the front desk staff
have access to the file with the master codes?
Or even one master code for all the safes
written on a sticky note in the office.

It’s almost like if you build in a back door, someone will find and exploit it.

Liberty Safe was shockingly eager to lick the FBI’s boot during the 2023 incident, and now we see their lock supplier Securam expressing extreme arrogance over their laughable vulnerability. Just goes to show, nobody is going to protect your interests except you.

@ cb, ALL,

With regards,

> “Just goes to show, nobody is going to protect your interests except you.”

Actually it is worse than that as ordinary citizens in the UK are finding out.

We used to hear about criminal gangs running protection rackets, and sometimes having,

“Bent coppers, on the pay roll”

Well in the UK, the Thames Valley Police, the Met Police, and some say the City Police forces are now all “owned” by businesses and in effect on corporation payrolls.

Unfortunately there is sufficient evidence that this might well be the case.

If you want more details look up the abuse of,

1, The ‘Single justice Procedure’.
2, UK ‘Jarassment act(s)’.

By the likes of the British Broadcasting “Goons” who are trying to sell an unneeded licence on commission and have been known to,

1, Knowingly commit false testimony to court.
2, Obtain false warrants
3, Equivalent of “swat” people in their homes.

And quite a bit more, that you would probably not believe even if it had happened to a person known to you for years for their “Honesty and Probity”…

Is it any wonder there is more and more said about “two tier justice” in the UK.

The UK is being turned into a nation in fear of “rights stripping” by corporates and politicos through what are in effect corrupt practices from the very top.

To be a little birdie on Ron Wyden’s window sill.

Rowley and Omo give an enlightening walk-thru of their security research [here](https://www.wired.com/video/watch/hacklab-we-digitally-cracked-a-high-security-safe). (It’s an entertaining and quick-moving review.)

@ lurker, ALL,

With regards,

“I come from the days of drills and acid, or for the hard jobs knowing just how much dynamite to put just where…”

Those where “kinder, gentler, safer and more secure times.”

That have been stolen away from us by the avarice of greed as clearly demonstrated through politicians, lobbyists, and their neo-con mantra run self entitled C-Suite. Who in turn are on bent knee to what we politely call “shareholders” but in reality is what others call the “finance industry”. That is designed to work by parasitic means to,...
