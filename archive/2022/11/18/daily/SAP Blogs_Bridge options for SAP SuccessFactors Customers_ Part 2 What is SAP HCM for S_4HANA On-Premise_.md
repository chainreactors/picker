This blog is a follow-up to my popular blog titled [What is SAP HCM for S/4HANA On-Premise (H4S4)](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/08/what-is-sap-hcm-for-s-4hana-on-premise-h4s4/comment-page-1/#comment-624799) which was published last year to give a high-level overview of the options available to customers for their HXM digital transformation.

In that blog, I introduced SAP HCM for SAP S/4HANA On-Premise (H4S4) as another variation available in Q4 2022, similar to the SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition (PCE) offering, for customers who wished to extend their current investment in SAP ERP HCM.

It has been made available as scheduled, however, customers are trying to understand where the model fits in. This quick blog is an effort to explain it.

### **SAP SuccessFactors**

SAP has continued to emphasize that all of the exciting innovation is happening in the SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) suite. [SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central has crossed over 5,000 customers](https://news.sap.com/2022/09/sap-successfactors-employee-central-customers-5000/) including more on-premise customers making the move each quarter. However, there are still customers on the journey to get there and SAP understands based upon feedback that there will be many customers who continue to operate in a hybrid environment (Cloud and on-premise deployments). These customers want their current SAP HCM investments to be protected and to have additional time for a full cloud migration which is the reason for the various options.

### **SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition (PCE)**

For customers who do not want to change their existing business processes while moving to a private cloud infrastructure, SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition (PCE) is the recommended and least disruptive pathway to keep your HR, Payroll, Time and/or Benefits functionality especially as most customers are looking at moving away from on-premise deployments.

This allows a cost-effective pathway to the cloud, while retaining the functional richness of your existing systems. This option involves migrating to an SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition (S/4 PCE) subscription, moving your environment to SAP’s own data center or in a hyperscalar (Azure, GCP, AWS). A conversion from on-premise SAP ERP HCM licenses to PCE cloud subscriptions is required, more info is available at [Migrate your HCM on-premise to S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition (PCE)](https://www.epiuselabs.com/prism-for-hcm-s4-private-cloud-edition.).

### **SAP Human Capital Management for SAP S/4HANA (H4S4)**

H4S4 is not a completely new on-premise HCM solution. It’s a continuation of the existing HCM code line (In a new on-premise deployment that is part of SAP S/4HANA 2022) that has existed within ECC, and R/3 three before it, as detailed years ago in this blog: [SAP Business Suite 7 Extension: What This Means for SAP ERP Human Capital Management Customers](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/02/17/sap-business-suite-7-extension-what-this-means-for-sap-erp-human-capital-management-customers/). Even though it has a new name and is commercially available, H4S4 does not represent a change in SAP SuccessFactors overall HR strategy or roadmap.

There are some delivered enhancements, primarily as a result of HANA adoption (Which are also available in SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition). Here is what you need to know about H4S4.

1. It is an on-premise offering that requires customers to maintain their own infrastructure

1. The scope largely matches what's in the Compatibility Pack today although not every single function that is available today gets carried forward (some will be deprecated, see <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3091160>). Only the more recent components are supported (e.g. PA-CM is being...
