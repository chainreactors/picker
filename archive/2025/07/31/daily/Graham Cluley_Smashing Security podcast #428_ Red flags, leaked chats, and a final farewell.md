The viral women-only dating safety app Tea, built to flag red flags, gets flagged itself ‚Äì after leaking over 70,000 private images and chat logs. We are talking full-on selfies, ID docs, private DMs, and a dash of 4chan creepiness. Yikes.

Plus, Carole takes us down memory lane as she hangs up her co-host mic after 428 glorious episodes. Expect tea, tears, and Tom Lehrer.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
