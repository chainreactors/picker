# View and analyze Electron crashes on macOS

2024-10-15

When developing an Electron application, you might encounter crashes. However, for various reasons, the application may not have integrated Sentry or other crash analysis platforms. In such cases, you need to manually check the crash logs to identify the issue.

## [Locating Local Crash Logs](#locating-local-crash-logs)

Since Electron is based on Chromium, the crash-related operations are largely consistent with Chromium.

In the [Chromium crash-reports](https://www.chromium.org/developers/crash-reports/#on-mac), we can see that crash files are stored in the `~/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Crashpad/completed` directory. However, since we are using an Electron application and there is no ‚Äúsubmission‚Äù process, the crash files are kept in the `~/Library/Application\ Support/Chromium/Crashpad/pending` directory.

Before searching, remember to replace `Chromium` in the above directories with your application name, such as `OOMOL Studio`.

If you have encountered many crashes, you‚Äôll find numerous \*.dmp files in this directory. Generally, we only need to analyze the most recent crash, so the latest file is the one we require.

## [Analyzing Crash Files](#analyzing-crash-files)

### [Using `breakpad`](#using-breakpad)

breakpad is an open-source crash analysis tool developed by Google, specifically for Chromium. We can use this tool to analyze our *dmp* files.

```
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad
cd breakpad
./configure
make
# Optional
make install
```

After executing the above command, you can parse the dmp using `./src/processor/minidump_stackwalk`, or you can directly use `minidump_stackwalk` (if you executed `make install`).

The basic usage method is:

```
minidump_stackwalk /path/to/your.dmp [/path/to/symbols]
```

If you use `minidump_stackwalk /path/to/your.dmp`, the output you get will only be addresses, and you won‚Äôt be able to see the function names. Therefore, we need to provide a symbol file in order to see the function names.

You can download the symbol file by running: `wget https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/<ELECTEON_VERSION>/electron-<ELECTEON_VERSION>-darwin-arm64-symbols.zip`. For my own case, I downloaded:

```
wget https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/download/v30.5.1/electron-v30.5.1-darwin-arm64-symbols.zip
```

This file is specifically prepared for `breakpad`, so we can directly unzip it to a certain directory and then use that directory as a parameter to pass to `minidump_stackwalk`.

```
minidump_stackwalk ./0c6d2547-6694-4109-b82e-cc3e6331885f.dmp ./electron-v30.5.1-darwin-arm64-symbols/breakpad_symbols
```

Next, you will be able to see the detailed crash information. In my case, the result I got is:

```
