# Titles: sacco-1.0-Multiple-SQLi
# sacco\_shield-1.0-msf-sqlmap-nu11secur1ty-BurpSuite-EXPLOIT!
# Author: nu11secur1ty
# Date: 09/20/2025
# Vendor: https://www.mayurik.com/
# Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15372/open-source-sacco-management-system-free-download.html
# Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection
## Description:
The username parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A single quote was submitted in the username parameter, and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the error message disappeared. You should review the contents of the error message, and the application's handling of other input, to confirm whether a vulnerability is present.
Additionally, the payload '+(select\*from(select(sleep(20)))a)+' was submitted in the username parameter. The application took 20023 milliseconds to respond to the request, compared with 19 milliseconds for the original request, indicating that the injected SQL command caused a time delay.
STATUS: HIGH-CRITICAL Vulnerability
