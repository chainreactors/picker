Hackers never sleep, so why should enterprise defenses? Threat actors prefer to target businesses during off-hours. That's when they can count on fewer security personnel monitoring systems, delaying response and remediation.

When retail giant [Marks & Spencer](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/inside-the-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-chaos) experienced a security event over Easter weekend, they were forced to shut down their online operations, which account for approximately a third of the retailer's clothing and home sales.

As most staff are away during off-hours and holidays, it takes time to assemble an incident response team and initiate countermeasures. This gives attackers more time to move laterally within the network and wreak havoc before the security team reacts.

While not every organization may be ready to staff an in-house team around the clock, building a 24/7 SOC remains one of the most robust and proactive ways to protect against off-hours attacks. In the rest of this post, we'll explore why 24/7 vigilance is so important, the challenges of achieving it, and six practical steps 24/7 SOC success.

## Importance and challenges of a 24/7 SOC

A SOC is central to an organization's cyber defense. It plays a key role in detecting, investigating, and responding to potential threats around the clock, providing real-time threat detection and resolution. Add in automation, and it only gets better, especially when everyone is away celebrating or concentrating on their weekend chores.

But running a 24/7 SOC isn't straightforward. It requires a perfect balance of proven processes, advanced tools, and skilled professionals.

### Proper planning and automation is key

Wherever security professionals can't keep up with the demands of a changing attack surface, AI can make a difference. Together with the right people and processes in place, AI enables efficiency by automating threat detection, resulting in faster response times and enhancing your overall security posture. Let's look at building the right processes and where AI fits in.

## 6 step approach for building a 24/7 SOC

Running a successful SOC comes down to the following six measures your organization will need to realize.

### 1. Build a foundation specific to your organization

Establishing a robust 24/7 SOC starts with defining a clear mission and scope that's aligned with overall business goals. Having a clear strategy helps determine security coverage requirements.

As budgets will dictate who gets hired and what security tools are integrated, making a strong case for 24/7 security monitoring is critical. Given recent examples of cyberattacks with devastating consequences, this shouldn't be difficult.

The best SOC model for your business will depend on its risk profile, compliance and industry requirements, and available resources. **The SOC's scope and objectives will also be business- and industry-specific.** For example, a healthcare provider will prioritize protecting patient data to ensure compliance with HIPAA, while a retailer will concentrate on PCI DSS.

Also, whether you choose an in-house, hybrid, or outsourced model, security teams should leverage AI. It can scale your model to optimize security operations and help defend against rapidly evolving threats. For example, a hybrid SOC with AI-powered SOC analysis can be highly efficient.

### 2. Build the right team and train them well

Organizations have to create a team that's up to the task of facing security challenges. Hiring managers should focus on a mix of junior analysts and seasoned responders, as diversity helps foster collaboration.

SOC teams often follow a three-tiered structure of **Tier 1 analysts** for alert triage; **Tier 2 analysts** responsible for investigation and response; and **Tier 3 analysts** for strategy, advanced threat hunting, proactive detection, and AI tool optimization. If resources are limited, a two-tier model can also be effective—Tier 1 handles triage and initial investigation, while Tier 2 takes on deeper analysis, response, and strategic functions. This approach can still deliver strong coverage with the right tooling and processes in place.

It's also better to hire internally whenever possible. Develop an internal talent pipeline and budget for ongoing training and certification for those who want to upskill. For example, team members can learn to use AI tools to overcome SIEM's costly log management and SOAR's complex configuration challenges.

### 3. Be smart about shift rotations to avoid burnout

SOC teams are known to [burn out quickly](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/6-simple-steps-to-eliminate-soc-analyst.html). Developing sustainable shift rotations with 8- or 12-hour shifts is important. For example, a SOC team can work on a 4-on, 4-off schedule to stay alert, while multinationals can spread shifts across time zones to reduce the risk of fatigue.
