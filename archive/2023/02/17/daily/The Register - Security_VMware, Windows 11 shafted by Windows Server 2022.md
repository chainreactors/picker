## OS won't start on some systems with ESXi VMs, while Win11 updates may not make it to devices

Updated Microsoft is sorting through two issues with Windows Server 2022 that affect VMware virtual machines and updates not getting passed on to Windows 11 devices.

Both problems are related to the [KB5022842](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/february-14-2023-kb5022842-os-build-20348-1547-be155955-29f7-47c4-855c-34bd43895940) security update to Windows Server 2022 rolled out February 14 and will spread their share of headaches to users.

Microsoft and VMware are both reporting that for some users who installed the update on guest virtual machines (VMs) on some versions of ESXi, the operating system may not start up. As one *Reg* reader who contacted us noted: "It'll be a nasty surprise for many sysadmins."
