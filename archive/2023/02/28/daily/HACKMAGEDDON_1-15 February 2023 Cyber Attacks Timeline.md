The first cyber attacks timeline of February 2023 is out setting a new maximum. In the first half of the month I collected 182 events (12.13 events/day.) This is the new maximum for the last 12 months and corresponds to nearly a 20% increase compared to the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/02/13/16-31-january-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/).

Ransomware-driven events were up to 25.8% (47 out of 182 events), up from 22.8%, whilst 14 events were characterized by the exploitation of vulnerabilities (corresponding to 7.7%),  thanks primarily to the massive exploitation of CVE-2021-21974 targeting VMware ESXi servers.

Malvertising events taking advantage of SEO poisoning continued to play an important role with 5 events characterized by this technique.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

In the fintech space, Webaverse suffered the theft of $4 million worth of assets, while crypto investors continued to be the targets of multiple campaigns.

And the mega breaches continued to characterize the threat landscape: AT&T, Verizon, and USCellular suffered the leak of customer records, threat actors stole a database with 20 million records from PeopleConnect, the Heritage Provider Network suffered a ransomware attack exposing the data of 3.3 million patients, and finally Weee! suffered a breach exposing the information of 1.1 million customers.

The Cyber Espionage space was quite crowded as usual, with Ukraine being the center of multiple campaigns by Russian threat actors such as: UAC-0050, UAC-0114 and UAC-0056 (AKA Nodaria). Other threat actors particularly active include Seaborgium (AKA Cold River and Calisto), APT29, APT34 (AKA OilRig), APT37, the Lazarus Group and Mustang Panda.

But state-sponsored threat actors continued to back their countries with multiple campaigns in the cyber space with inevitable connections with the Ukrainian situation, such as a campaign targeting Ukrainian refugees abroad, and also fake bomb alerts aimed to destabilize Moldova. Other unearthed operations included an attack launched by the Chernovite group against a dozen of U.S. electric and gas facilities, and Spamouflage, a campaign where Chinese state-aligned actors used AI-generated broadcasters to distribute content that promotes the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.

And last but not least, and once again unsurprisingly, the hacktivist front was always hot, fueled by the campaigns of pro-Russian threat actors such as Killnet.

In this fortnight in particular, the list is really too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
