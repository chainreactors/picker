Navigating the complexities of compliance frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, or GDPR can be daunting.

Luckily, [Intruder](https://www.intruder.io/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=p_referral&utm_campaign=global%7Cfixed%7Chow_intruder_supports_your_compliance_journey) simplifies the process by helping you address the key vulnerability management criteria these frameworks demand, making your compliance journey much smoother.

Read on to understand how to meet the requirements of each framework to keep your customer data safe.

## **How Intruder supports your compliance goals**

Intruder's continuous vulnerability scanning and automated reporting help you meet the security requirements of multiple frameworks, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, Cyber Essentials, and GDPR. Here are three core ways Intruder can support you:

### **1. Making vulnerability management easy**

Security can be complicated, but your tools shouldn't be. Intruder's always-on platform brings together multiple powerful scanning engines, delivering comprehensive protection that goes beyond traditional vulnerability management. Covering application, cloud, internal, and network scanning, it ensures every layer of your infrastructure is continuously monitored and secured.

### **2. Automating reports to prove compliance**

Compliance often requires regular, detailed reports to prove you're following security best practices. Intruder's automated reporting makes this process faster and easier, providing audit-ready reports at your fingertips. By integrating with Drata and Vanta, you can automate evidence collection, streamlining the entire process and saving valuable time.

### **3. Continuous monitoring of your systems**

Many frameworks, including HIPAA and SOC 2, emphasize the importance of ongoing security monitoring. This is where Intruder stands out - it scans for new threats within hours of their release, keeping you one step ahead of attackers. Plus, Intruder helps you continuously monitor your attack surface, automatically kicking off a scan when network changes are detected, such as when new IPs or hostnames are spun up in your cloud.
