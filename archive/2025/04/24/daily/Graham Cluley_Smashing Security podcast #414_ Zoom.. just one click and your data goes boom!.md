Graham explores how the Elusive Comet cybercrime gang are using a sneaky trick of stealing your cryptocurrency via an innocent-appearing Zoom call, and Carole goes under the covers to explore the extraordinary lengths bio-hacking millionaire Bryan Johnson is attempting to extend his life.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.
