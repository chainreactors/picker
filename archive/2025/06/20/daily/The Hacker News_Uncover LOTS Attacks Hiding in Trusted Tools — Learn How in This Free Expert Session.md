[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehacker.news/threat-hunting-insights?source=article)

Most cyberattacks today don't start with loud alarms or broken firewalls. They start quietly‚Äîinside tools and websites your business already trusts.

It's called "[Living Off Trusted Sites](https://thehacker.news/threat-hunting-insights?source=article)" (LOTS)‚Äîand it's the new favorite strategy of modern attackers. Instead of breaking in, they blend in.

Hackers are using well-known platforms like Google, Microsoft, Dropbox, and Slack as launchpads. They hide malicious code inside routine traffic, making it incredibly difficult for traditional defenses to detect them.

And here's the scary part: many security teams don't even realize it's happening‚Äîuntil it's too late.

## Why You're Not Seeing These Attacks

LOTS tactics don't look suspicious at first glance. There's no malware signature to flag, and no unusual IP address to trace. It's legitimate traffic‚Äîuntil it's not.

Attackers are exploiting:

* **Common business tools** like Teams, Zoom, and GitHub
* **Shortened or vanity URLs** to redirect users
* **Trusted cloud services** to host malicious payloads

In short, they're using your trust against you.
