While organizational leaders and IT owners keep a watchful eye on emerging threats and [trends](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cybersecuritys-biggest-mistakes-of-2022/) from the previous year, much of their cybersecurity strategy will need to be founded on how well their businesses can respond to an attack. While the risk of cyberattacks is an undeniable reality, cyber preparedness can significantly differentiate successful businesses from those struggling to manage after a cyber event.

In particular, Chief Information Security Officers ([CISOs](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/maximizing-your-impact-as-a-ciso-achieving-success-in-todays-threat-landscape/)) will be building plans to ensure a quick and effective return to normal operations in the face of attack. This post covers how to evaluate the business’s current cyber preparedness, how to plan for a cyberattack and what to do after an attack has occurred. It offers guidelines on the key elements CISOs and IT leaders will need to focus on as they bolster their defense strategies in light of the current threat landscape.

## The Increasing Threat of Cyberattacks to Businesses

All sectors in the last few years have grappled with the threat of cyberattacks. [Healthcare](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/my-hospital-caught-a-virus-how-healthcare-is-sick-with-cyber/), [education](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cyber-risks-in-the-education-sector-why-cybersecurity-needs-to-be-top-of-the-class/), [government](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/why-governments-and-agencies-are-targeted-by-cyber-attacks-a-deep-dive-into-the-motives/), and [critical infrastructure](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/securing-the-nations-critical-infrastructure-action-plans-to-defend-against-cyber-attacks/) are among those that have taken the hardest hits. Targeting underprepared or poorly-funded victims has become a lucrative business model for malicious threat groups and opportunistic actors.

Modern adversaries do not discriminate targets by size or sector; consequences from one attack can affect the organization and its vendors and providers. The last 12 months have seen little respite in the wave of [ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/) attacks and [data breaches](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-data-breach/) even as the Biden-Harris Administration’s [Executive Order](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-cybersecurity-executive-order-what-it-means-and-what-you-can-do/) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity and official [Shields Up](https://www.cisa.gov/shields-up) campaign have raised awareness of the severity of the threats facing businesses.

From an [insurance](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cyber-insurance-navigating-a-tough-new-world-in-the-age-of-ransomware/) standpoint, the cost to remediate attacks has increased, spiking the price of cyber insurance premiums. Insurance carriers recognizing the risk from attack have subsequently adjusted their requirements for security.

In such an environment, it makes sense for businesses to prepare for the possibility of a compromise or cyber attack. An effective incident response plan that has been openly communicated and tailored to the needs of the business increases the organization’s chances of recovery and rapid return to normal operations.

## Evaluating Cyber Preparedness | Is Your Business Ready?

Cyber preparedness ensures that enterprises have a plan in place to respond to imminent threats. For small to medium sized businesses (SMBs), properly implemented [incident response](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-an-incident-response-your-ir-guide-for-2022/) and emergency management can mean the difference between recovery and insolvency. While cyber risk cannot be eliminated completely, enterprises can manage risk effectively with the right people, processes, and technology.

The first step to building a strong cyber incident response plan (IRP) is evaluating the organization’s level of preparedness.

### People

* **Response Team**: Is it clear who the incident response team members are? Does the response team include: a technical lead, data analysts, communications/PR advisor, human resources specialist, etc.?
* **Stakeholders**: Are both internal and external stakeholders clearly identified? Are key contacts for third-parties, vendors, clients, and providers identified? Are all public-facing members of the Board and C-levels all wellhearsed in addressing the media
* **Roles & Responsibilities**: Does everyone in the organization understand their role in the IRP? Have all expectations been explained, trained, and documented?
* **Communication Matrix**: Is a communications plan in place and in an easily accessible format/location should networks go down? Does it include central points of contact for each team in the organization?

### Process

* **Policies**: Do the incident response policies align with the organization’s overarching policies and compliance requirements? Have senior leadership reviewed, approved, and communicated to all employees?
* **Continuous Improvement & Lessons Learned**: After every practice, drill, or actual incident, are takeaways and feedback documented and stored in an easily accessible platform? Are action items and deficiencies assigned and communicated to directors and managers? Are post-incident reports used for training and onboarding processes?

### Technology

* **Post-Event Assessments**: Is there a managed service or security operations center (SOC) that can provide in-depth incident response (IR) assessments? Do these assessments pinpoint evidence within the environment?
* **Backups**: Are backups regularly scheduled, stored offline, or stored in a secure cloud? Are backups regularly reviewed and protected with passwords and encryption? Are backups accessible for modification or deletion from the primary network?
* **Data Forensics & Incident Response ([DFIR](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-digital-forensics-and-incident-response-dfir/))**: Does the organization’s security stack include digital forensics analysis, incident response, and/or security consultations in the event of an attack?
* **Contextual Information**: Is the security stack capable of detailed log collection? Is log data stored read-only with standard encryption in place?

## What to Do to Prepare for a Cyberattack

One of the most important things cybersecurity executives can do to prepare for a cyberattack is to establish a task force and name specific individuals responsible for responding to a breach. This task force should include key members of the organization, such as IT professionals, legal counsel, upper management, and any external partners or service providers that may need to be involved in the response.

Before a breach occurs, it’s essential to develop a comprehensive cyberattack survival protocol that outlines the steps to take during an attack. This should include information on identifying, containing, and recovering from the attack. It should also include details on communic...
