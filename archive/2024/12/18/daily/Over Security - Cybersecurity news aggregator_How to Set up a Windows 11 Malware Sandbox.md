How to Set up a Windows 11 Malware Sandbox

As [Windows 10](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows-10-sandbox/) approaches its end-of-life (October 2025), organizations are facing the need to adjust their security infrastructure to be better aligned with Windows 11. A malware sandbox, an isolated environment for analyzing malicious files and URLs, is a key tool for this transition.

Here are the benefits of deploying a Windows 11 sandbox and how you can do it.

## **What is a malware sandbox?**

A malware sandbox is an isolated virtual environment designed to safely analyze cyber threats by detonating, observing, and interacting with them.

This controlled setting allows cybersecurity professionals to understand the behavior of malware post-infection, including file modifications, [network calls](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-analyze-malicious-network-traffic/), and registry changes.

#### **A malware sandbox helps organizations and individual researchers to:**

* Safely explore malicious files and URLs to validate threat alerts or proactively identify cyber threats.
* Observe detonation of malware and phishing attacks in real time to see how they are carried out in a live system.
* Replicate specific network and system environments to assess the potential impact on the existing infrastructure.
* Extract indicators of compromise from malware samples to enhance threat detection capabilities.
* Intercept and analyze command and control communications to gather crucial IOCs.
* Study malware behavior in depth to uncover tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to respond to security incidents or prepare for future attacks more effectively.

## Which sandbox to choose? Built-in, on-premises, cloud-based

When it comes to choosing your sandbox, there are several options you can consider. Let’s focus on the three main ones.

### **Built-In Sandbox Feature Included with Windows 11**

Windows 11 provides built-in sandbox functionality completely for free. This tool works well for quick checks, such as opening malicious links received via phishing emails or downloading and running suspicious files.

A limitation of this type of sandbox is its inability to provide verdicts on detonated malicious content or log system and network activities. This can make it difficult to accurately assess the threat level of evasive and complex malware. There are also no reports generated after the analysis.

These aspects make the built-in Windows sandbox an unsuitable option for professional use.

### On-premises Windows 11 Sandbox

For more advanced analysis, organizations can opt for building their own sandbox environment, configured to their specific needs. Virtualization software like VirtualBox can be used here. Yet, this approach is generally recommended only if you need to reverse-engineer malware source code or analyze it with custom tools.

There are also a several things to take into consideration:

* **Complex Setup**: Requires technical expertise to set up and configure.
* **Potential Risks**: Misconfiguration can lead to malware escaping the sandbox and infecting the host system.
* **Resource-Intensive**: Can be demanding on system resources.

### Cloud Malware Sandbox with Windows 11 Support

For professional malware analysis, a cloud sandbox is the best choice. These services offer all the benefits of virtualization software but with much less tinkering and setup, making it easier to gather deep insights. There’s also no chance to misconfigure something and let the malware escape the sandbox’s confines and infect the host.
