The White House issued an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/27/executive-order-on-prohibition-on-use-by-the-united-states-government-of-commercial-spyware-that-poses-risks-to-national-security/) on Monday barring federal government agencies from using commercial spyware products that pose a national security risk.

The ban does not apply to all spyware and surveillance tools. US federal agencies can still use spyware if the vendor has not been linked to any cases of abuse.

Cases of abuse that will automatically apply the label of "national security risk" to a spyware vendor include situations where the vendor's products have been used to spy against the US government.

Another case is for vendors that have not been licensed to operate in the US.

A spyware vendor is also considered a security risk if its tools have been used to spy on victims and led to human rights abuses or the limitation of various freedoms. This includes illegal surveillance operations against activists, academics, journalists, dissidents, or political figures, in both the US and abroad.

The executive order is a proverbial "separate the wheat from the chaff" attempt from the White House in regard to the spyware industry, which has gone largely unchecked and unregulated for the past two decades. Some vendors have been playing by informal rules, while others have been selling their products to anyone with an open wallet.

As *[Cyberscoop](https://cyberscoop.com/white-house-spyware-executive-order/)* notes, the White House does not intend to create a list of allowed and banned spyware vendors. The purpose of the EO is to steer government agencies away from using vendors that lack a moral compass and could be in a position to leverage information from past engagements and turn on their US employers.

As *[The Record](https://therecord.media/spyware-executive-order-biden-white-house)* also notes, the executive order also comes ahead of [the second Summit for Democracy](https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy-2023/#:~:text=March%2028%20at%2010%3A00,and%20renewal%20of%20democracy%20worldwide.), taking place this week in Washington.

> "At the event, which is organized by the US and a number of other countries, the administration will release a set of guiding principles for governmental use of surveillance technology — something that was promised during last year's summit."

The White House EO has received generally good feedback, but some also wanted to see a more severe crackdown on misbehaving spyware vendors. For example, Jim Hines, Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, [would have wanted](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1246) to see the White House also impose sanctions on rogue spyware makers, not just bar them from working with US federal agencies.

In addition, multiple voices in the surveillance tracking business pointed out that the EO only mentions federal agencies and doesn't specifically ban state and local governments from doing business with rogue vendors.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Twitter source code leaks:** A portion of the Twitter source code was leaked on GitHub earlier this year. According to the *[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/technology/twitter-source-code-leak.html)* [*[non-paywall](https://archive.ph/BihcB)*], Twitter only recently learned of the leak. The code appears to have been available online for several months until Twitter moved last week to file a DMCA request with GitHub. The files are believed to have been leaked by an employee fired at the end of last year and posted on GitHub under an account named "FreeSpeechEnthusiasm"—in a mocking gesture to one of Musk's public statements. In a case filed last week, Twitter asked a judge to order GitHub to reveal details about the user who uploaded the code to its site but also those who downloaded and viewed it.

**Latitude hack update:** Australian financial services company Latitude says the personal information of nearly 14 million customers was stolen in a security breach. The company says the breach took place after a threat actor obtained a Latitude employee's login credentials and logged into its network to steal data stored on the servers of two service providers. Stolen information includes PII data but also identification documents, with the bulk being copies of customer driver's licenses. This marks the [fourth update](https://www.latitudefinancial.com.au/about-us/media-releases/cybercrime-update-27-03-2023.html) Latitude has posted on the breach after initially saying that only 330,000 customers were impacted.

**Sun Pharma ransomware attack:** Sun Pharma, one of India's largest pharmaceutical companies, says it expects to lose some revenue after suffering a ransomware attack at the start of this month. According to *[BQPrime](https://www.bqprime.com/markets/ransomware-group-claims-responsibility-for-an-it-security-incident-at-sun-pharma)*, the company is currently in the process of recovering its network.

**Leaks summary report:** Security firm ThreatMon has published an [analysis](https://threatmon.io/report-on-data-leaks-reported-in-social-media/) of 20 lesser-known leaks that have been reported on social media and dark web forums throughout the past year.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Push notifications are now universal:** With the release of Safari 16.4 for iOS, the W3C's Push API and the Notification API are now [universally supported](https://web.dev/push-notifications-in-all-modern-browsers/) across all major web browsers. The two APIs were formally adopted in 2016, but their adoption has been slow on Safari and Apple devices, where Apple tended to use its own proprietary technology.

**Windows 12:** The [first leaks](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-windows-corepc-modern-platform-hudson-valley-2024) have appeared about Windows 12, Microsoft's next Windows OS iteration. The project appears to be a spiritual successor to Windows 10X, a now-canceled Windows version.

**GitHub adds SBOM support:** GitHub has added a [new feature](https://github.blog/2023-03-28-introducing-self-service-sboms/) to allow users to generate NTIA-compliant SBOM files for any code repositories that have a dependency graph.
