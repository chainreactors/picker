**Research led by: Hu ke, Nir Avraham**

Jamf Threat Labs creates live demonstrations to educate iPhone users worldwide about the capabilities of potential attackers. In this blog, we created a demo that illustrates how a modified yet perfectly functional Facebook app can continuously monitor your photos and upload them to an attacker’s server. Apps like this can be sideloaded onto your phone.

*The* *demo**shown* *is intended solely for educational purposes**.* *It is designed to illustrate potential threats and is not intended to encourage or facilitate any illegal or unethical activities.* *Jamf does not* *condone or endorse any unauthorized access, exploitation, or manipulation of* *social media* *or other* *online* *platform**s* *or service**s**.**Users* *of such platforms* *should* *always follow* *applicable laws, terms of service, and ethical guidelines when using* *them* *and conducting cybersecurity research or demonstrations.*

This video shows a sideloaded social media app secretly obtaining and uploading the device owner’s photo to an attacker’s server. The target device is not jailbroken and is running the latest iOS 17.

These apps can be installed through third-party stores or services like AltStore, and they go through much less scrutiny, meaning their code isn’t audited as thoroughly. Strictly speaking, this risk isn’t limited to just sideloaded apps - it can affect any app on your phone. Some techniques used in exploitation can disguise the true intentions of the code, allowing it to slip past the App Store’s review, as explained in this [blog](https://codecolor.ist/2021/01/16/see-no-eval-runtime-code-execution-objc/).

Don’t assume an app is trustworthy just because it looks legitimate. With the increasing acceptance of sideloading apps, where software is installed outside the App Store, apps that haven’t gone through the typical App Stor...
