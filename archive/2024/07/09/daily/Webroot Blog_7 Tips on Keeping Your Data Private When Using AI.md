In recognition of its profound impact, July 16 is celebrated as Artificial Intelligence (AI) Appreciation Day. AI is one of the defining technologies of our era, and its adoption is skyrocketing. People are using AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot for a wide range of personal applications. Indeed, AI is integrated into various aspects of our daily lives — from AI-powered apps that assist with language translation and personal finance management to tools that help with creative writing and music composition.

However, with the rapid growth of AI comes the pressing need to maintain privacy in our tech-driven world. As these intelligent systems become more capable and ubiquitous, they also collect vast amounts of data. Staying informed about the privacy practices of the AI tools you use and taking proactive steps to safeguard your information is crucial in navigating this new digital landscape.

Here are some tips to help you keep your data private in our AI-enabled era:

1. **Understand the technology**
   Imagine stepping into a futuristic world where robots and computers are your helpful companions. That’s our world today with AI! But as with any new tech, it’s crucial to know how it works. AI is evolving fast, so take some time to understand the basics. Knowing how AI algorithms function and the specific types of data they use is key to understanding how these systems make decisions.
2. **Know the vendor’s privacy practices**
   Think of using an AI tool like choosing a new roommate. You wouldn’t want to live with someone who’s careless with your belongings, right? The same goes for your data privacy. Before you start using any AI tool, look into how the company handles your information. Are they safeguarding it, or selling it off to the highest bidder? A little research can help you find AI tools that respect your privacy.
3. **Avoid inputting private data**
   Avoid sharing sensitive information like your address and phone number when interacting with AI tools. While it’s important to be cautious, remember that certain types of private data, such as preferences or non-sensitive information, can be safely shared with AI. Just as you wouldn’t divulge all your secrets to a new acquaintance, exercise discretion in what you share to ensure your privacy remains protected.
4. **Use strong passwords**
   Think of your passwords as the locks on your doors. Weak locks are easy to pick, while strong ones keep intruders out. Create strong, unique passwords for your accounts, and use a reputable password manager like [**Webroot**](https://www.webroot.com/us/en) to keep track of them. This way, you won’t have to remember each one, and you can rest easy knowing your accounts are secure.
5. **Keep software up-to-date**
   Imagine driving a car with outdated brakes — scary, right? Using outdated software is just as risky. Keep your AI-powered devices and services up-to-date. Software updates often include security patches and bug fixes that keep your data safe and your devices running smoothly.
6. **Protect your devices**
   Your devices are like digital treasure chests, full of valuable information. Unfortunately, they’re also targets for cyber-attacks. AI-powered cyber threats are common and can wreak havoc on your systems. So strong antivirus protection is essential. Invest in a powerful solution like [**Webroot**](https://www.webroot.com/us/en) to keep the bad guys out and your devices safe.
7. **Use two-factor authentication**
   Think of two-factor authentication (2FA) as a double lock on your front door. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a text message or an app notification, along with your password. Enabling 2FA on your accounts makes it much harder for someone to break in, even if they know your password.

By following these tips, you can enjoy the wonders of AI without sacrificing your privacy. Stay informed, stay cautious, and stay protected! The future is bright with AI — just make sure you’re navigating it safely.
