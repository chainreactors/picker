Are we witnessing artificial Bitcoin price suppression? If so, paper Bitcoin is probably to blame. Let’s examine the concept, the previous known cases, and the fact that the ETFs are buying record quantities of BTC without moving the price. Even though, let’s face it, it’s up 50% since the US SEC approved the spot ETFs, and BlackRock, Fidelity, and the others started buying.

Is that enough, considering the inflows? That’s the question.

Another factor--and this is extremely suspicious--is that most of the ETFs use Coinbase as a custodian. Can we trust that company? Something wicked might be afoot; Wall Street might be trying to pull one on us. On the other hand, long-term holders might be leveraging the newfound demand to sell and make a profit. That would be normal post-halving behavior and indicate the cycle is gathering steam as it usually does.

Let’s explore the case with a fine-tooth comb, starting with…

## **Paper Money, A Definition**

In 1729, during a shortage of gold and silver coins in the US, Benjamin Franklin published the pamphlet “[A Modest Enquiry Into the Nature and Necessity of a Paper-Currency](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-01-02-0041?ref=hackernoon.com).” He wrote:

> \*\*“I cannot think it the Interest of England to oppose us in making as great a Sum of Paper Money here, as we, who are the best Judges of our own Necessities, find convenient.”
> \ And a few paragraphs later:

> **“It remains now that we enquire, Whether a large Addition to our Paper Currency will not make it sink in Value very much; And here it will be requisite that we first form just Notions of the Nature and Value of Money in general.”**

The paper bitcoin analogy reflects banknotes and Central Banks getting ahold of all of the citizens’ gold by hook or by crook. The idea behind paper money was that the totality of those IOUs was supposed to represent all the country’s gold reserves. However, how could the citizens tell if their government printed more banknotes than the gold they held? They couldn’t, so the money supply grew and grew.

Then,[in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/?ref=hackernoon.com), things got even worse. Nixon lifted the Gold Standard and - since the dollar is the world’s reserve currency - led the whole planet into the fiat era of today. That’s a story for another time, though. Let’s focus on the issue at hand.

## **Paper Bitcoin, A Definition**

As you should know, there will only be 21 million Bitcoin in total. There’s nothing anyone can do about that. However, exchanges and various institutions could potentially issue Bitcoin IOUs and fool the population into thinking they’re buying the real asset. The FTX case proves that centralized exchanges are able to sell paper Bitcoin without anyone noticing. More on that later.

Make no mistake, as opposed to gold, the Bitcoin blockchain is completely auditable 24/7. The 21 million Bitcoin are accounted for. However, each exchange has its internal accounting system. The BTC they sell settles through their database, which is completely off-chain. Using that ingenious system, they could be perpetuating all kinds of paper Bitcoin shenanigans. \*\*

Coinbase is not legally required and has never shown proof of reserves. However, we, the bitcoiners, are on the case. If they’re issuing paper bitcoin, we will catch them sooner or later. You’ve been warned, Brian Armstrong.

## **The History Of Gold**

To understand paper Bitcoin, we have to discuss gold’s price suppression. When banks introduced paper currency, they solved several problems. Suddenly, people could carry their money with them and transact with ease.

However, the situation allowed banks to lend their customers’ funds without their consent. Of course, as it happens, banks started to abuse that power. And since they had all of the citizens’ gold, they could control its price and eradicate it from commerce.

Private banks were part of the problem, but the main event was the US Federal Reserve, and every country’s central bank printed more bills than the gold they supposedly backed it with, which was worth more. Using that system, governments everywhere could tax the population without them knowing.

Through the power of inflation, they could fund every project they could conceive. And the incentive to be efficient and responsible disappeared. The governments could just print banknotes and inflate the money supply, devaluating the bills already in circulation in the process. And for a long time, the market was none the wiser.

People had no idea what hit them. As opposed to Bitcoin, it’s impossible to audit gold’s total supply. To this day, it’s infeasible to prove without a shadow of a doubt that governments were actively suppressing gold’s price.

However,[in 1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/?ref=hackernoon.com), the French government tried to retrieve the gold that the US owed them. Nixon, the president at the time, responded by taking the dollar out of the Gold Standard, and all hell broke loose.

## **A Few Words About Fractional Reserve Banking**

In the fiat world Nixon left us with, fractional reserve banking made sense. Governments around the world authorized banks to hold only a fraction of the money their customers deposited with them. They could legally lend the rest and charge interest for it, effectively creating even more money.

Moreover, it’s considered normal that these institutions control their customer’s withdrawals to protect themselves from a bank run. The banks simply don’t have the people’s money. That’s modern banking for you.

How do we know Bitcoin exchanges are not incurring the same practices?

## **The FTX Case, a Paper Bitcoin Stravaganza**

Did FTX’s paper on Bitcoin practices stifle the 2021/ 2022 bull run? We’ll probably never know. One thing’s for sure, though: There was massive Bitcoin rehypothecation at FTX. When the derivatives-focused exchange blew up, they had zero Bitcoin on their arcs and 80K BTC on their books.

Since FTX’s internal system said so, their clients - who didn’t practice self-custody - thought they held BTC in their accounts. And, why would they suspect a fine fellow like Sam Bankman-Fried?

In November 2022, FTX declared bankruptcy, and a Bitcoin Twitter personality\_\_[crunched out the numbers](https://x.com/Croesus_BTC/status/1593274010434871297?ref=hackernoon.com)\_\_ behind their paper Bitcoin policies:

> **“Quick math:**
>
> **-330k BTC mined / year this halving era**
>
> **-FTX has -$1.4B in BTC on books, meaning 80k BTC**
>
> **-Assuming incurred this year, means FTX "increased" BTC supply issuance 25% this year**
>
> **-Others likely did same**
>
> \*\*
> \*\*
>
> No wonder we're under prior cycle highs.
>
> Halving math interference.”

Not only that, FTX absorbed Bitcoin buy pressure and transformed it into sell pressure. They bought BTC for their clients and lent it without authorization to their sister company, Alameda, who sold it to buy Solana and FTT. As Croesus puts it, the company “*increased" BTC supply issuance by 25%*” through paper Bitcoin creation.

These are not conspiracy theories anymore. During Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial in November 2023, the CEO of Alameda Re...
