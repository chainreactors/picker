[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXPyVtflZRlV-ihA94_FHChQqbUOg7HxqdPBHAave1hCikscpzZD5NPaGiRNUuEaZgBRJpkCDWCHWwbUFPPlbn9XOgbPMUD_nCF_O1CyrNSG0eanjg88CFbOj7pwZ5AHBKsUpIGbbac-1_DijQ3fb6GvKZxVvmjjZ3ncx5av_6luFu79Zf-5Bq21ggrX7F/s790-rw-e365/wordpress.jpg)

A second security flaw impacting the [OttoKit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/suretriggers/) (formerly **SureTriggers**) WordPress plugin has come under active exploitation in the wild.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-27007 (CVSS score: 9.8), is a privilege escalation bug impacting all versions of the plugin prior to and including version 1.0.82.

"This is due to the create\_wp\_connection() function missing a capability check and insufficiently verifying a user's authentication credentials," Wordfence [said](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2025/05/recently-disclosed-suretriggers-critical-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-under-active-exploitation/). "This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to establish a connection, which ultimately can make privilege escalation possible."

That said, the vulnerability is exploitable only in two possible scenarios -

* When a site has never enabled or used an application password, and OttoKit has never been connected to the website using an application password before
* When an attacker has authenticated access to a site and can generate a valid application password

Wordfence revealed that it observed the threat actors attempting to exploit the initial connection vulnerability to establish a connection with the site, followed by using it to create an administrative user account via the automation/action endpoint.

Furthermore, the attack attempts simultaneously aim for [CVE-2025-3102](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/ottokit-wordpress-plugin-admin-creation.html) (CVSS score: 8.1), another flaw in the same plugin that has also been exploited in the wild since last month.

This has raised the possibility that the threat actors are opportunistically scanning WordPress installations to see if they are susceptible to either of the two flaws. The IP addresses that have been observed targeting the vulnerabilities are listed below -

* 2a0b:4141:820:1f4::2
* 41.216.188.205
* 144.91.119.115
* 194.87.29.57
* 196.251.69.118
* 107.189.29.12
* 205.185.123.102
* 198.98.51.24
* 198.98.52.226
* 199.195.248.147

Given that the plugin has over 100,000 active installations, it's essential that users move quickly to apply the latest patches (version 1.0.83).

"Attackers may have started actively targeting this vulnerability as early as May 2, 2025 with mass exploitation starting on May 4, 2025," Wordfence said.

### Update

Patchstack, in an independent advisory, revealed that it observed exploitation attempts targeting the flaw 91 minutes after public disclosure.

"The vulnerability occurred due to a logic error in the plugin, incorrectly handling the response from the wp\_authenticate\_application\_password WordPress function, as well as a limited amount of verification of user-provided access tokens," security researcher Chazz Wolcott [said](https://patchstack.com/articles/additional-critical-ottokit-formerly-suretriggers-vulnerability-patched/).

"Due to the behavior of this interaction, this vulnerability could lead to an attacker obtaining full control of the website via OttoKit plugin's API, including the ability to create additional Administrator-level user accounts, on any website using this plugin where the administrator has not set an application password."

### OttoKit Issues Statement

In a [statement](https://ottokit.com/what-really-happened-ottokit-security/) shared with The Hacker News and posted on its website, the OttoKit Team said it promptly addressed the identified issues and that it found no evidence of active exploitation from its users.

"We were able to address CVE-2025-27007 swiftly through a force update in collaboration with WordPress and hosting providers, which allowed us to patch the issue before any real impact was observed," the company said in a statement. "Also for CVE-2025-3102, we have not received any reports of active exploitation from our users either."

*(The story was updated after publication on July 18, 2025, to include a statement from OttoKit.)*
