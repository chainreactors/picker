Who has been warning Italian criminals that their phones are wiretapped? Can you trust your voice to protect your bank account? And why is TikTok being singled out by investigators?

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Dinah Davis.
