## Evil Portals

[Evil Portals](https://github.com/kleo/evilportals) is a collection of portals that can be loaded into the Evil Portal module and can be used for phishing attacks against WiFi clients in order to obtain credentials or infect the victims with malware using the [Hak5](https://hak5.org/) [WiFi Pineapple](https://wifipineapple.com/) [Tetra](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=11303845317) and [Nano](http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple?variant=81044992).

This project requires you to install [Evil Portal](https://github.com/frozenjava/EvilPortalNano) captive portal module created by [frozenjava](https://github.com/frozenjava). To install on the Pineapple, go to Modules -> Manage Modules -> Get Modules from Hak5 Community Repositories -> Evil Portal 3.2.

**Tested working on the WiFi Pineapple Nano MK VI only.**
