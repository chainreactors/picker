The evolution of cyber threats has forced organizations across all industries to rethink their security strategies. As attackers become more sophisticated — leveraging encryption, living-off-the-land techniques, and lateral movement to evade traditional defenses — security teams are finding more threats wreaking havoc before they can be detected. Even after an attack has been identified, it can be hard for security teams to prove to auditors that they have fully mitigated the issues that allowed the attackers in.

Security teams worldwide have prioritized endpoint detection and response (EDR), which has become so effective that threat actors have changed their tactics to avoid attack vectors protected by host-based defenses.

These advanced threats are particularly vexing for critical infrastructure providers in [financial services](#financial-services-), [energy and utilities](#energy-and-utilities-), [transportation](#transportation-), and [government agencies](#government-) that may have proprietary systems that cannot be protected by traditional endpoint security, have unique protocols that may not be recognized by existing security tools, or are governed by regulations requiring full disclosure and proof of mitigation.

Elite security teams have turned to the ground truth that can only be provided by the network to both identify suspicious behavior and demonstrate full mitigation and compliance. This ground truth provides an immutable record of all network activities and enables threat hunters to proactively search for potential threats.

## FINANCIAL SERVICES:

## **Defending against silent threats to financial data**

The financial services industry faces a perfect storm: it's the most targeted sector globally, operates under strict regulatory requirements, and manages highly sensitive data that commands premium prices on criminal markets. For financial institutions, network detection and response (NDR) is essential for identifying unauthorized data access, protecting microsecond transactions, and demonstrating regulatory compliance.

### **Detecting unauthorized data access and exfiltration**

Banks and investment firms deploy NDR solutions to monitor for subtle indicators of data theft. Unlike many industries where attackers seek to disrupt operations, financial services attackers often aim to remain undetected while accessing valuable data. NDR platforms help identify suspicious data access patterns and exfiltration attempts, even when disguised within encrypted channels.

Take a hypothetical scenario where a major financial institution is dealing with an attacker who has established persistence for more than six months and was slowly exfiltrating customer financial data using encrypted channels during normal business hours. This type of activity could be missed by SIEM and EDR tools, but NDR can detect anomalous traffic patterns that other tools miss.

### **Maintaining a microsecond security advantage**

High-frequency trading (HFT) environments face unique security challenges due to ultra-low latency requirements that make traditional inline security tools impractical. Custom hardware often cannot support endpoint agents, creating visibility gaps, while proprietary algorithms require protection from theft and manipulation.

Advanced NDR solutions address these challenges through passive monitoring that introduces zero latency while maintaining full network visibility. They provide sophisticated protocol analysis for proprietary trading protocols that conventional tools cannot decode, plus microsecond-precision timestamping allows the detection of subtle manipulation attempts.

### **Demonstrating regulatory compliance**

With regulations like the Digital Operations Resilience Act (DORA), Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2), and FINRA rules, banks must maintain comprehensive audit trails of network activity. NDR solutions provide the detailed forensic evidence necessary for both compliance verification and post-incident investigation.

NDR deployments provide continuous network monitoring and evidence preservation required by regulators. When a financial institution experiences a security incident, NDR can demonstrate exactly what happened, how they responded, and provide evidence of whether a breach has been fully remediated, which is increasingly becoming a regulatory expectation.

## ENERGY AND UTILITIES:

## **Bridging IT/OT security gaps**

With traditional IT networks and operational technology (OT) environments controlling physical infrastructure, the energy sector has become a prime target for criminal and nation-state actors. The recent [Volt Typhoon attacks](https://corelight.com/cp/volt-typhoon?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article-2&utm_campaign=awareness-wave-1) exemplify threats actively compromising critical infrastructure by targeting systems that can't be protected by traditional endpoint security.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order No. 887 requiring internal network security monitoring (INSM) for high-impact bulk electric system security stacks, expanding beyond perimeter- and host-based security controls to include detection of anomalous network activity.

### **Identifying reconnaissance of energy infrastructure**

Advanced threat actors typically conduct extensive reconnaissance before launching attacks. NDR solutions help identify these early-stage activities by detecting unusual scanning patterns, enumeration...
