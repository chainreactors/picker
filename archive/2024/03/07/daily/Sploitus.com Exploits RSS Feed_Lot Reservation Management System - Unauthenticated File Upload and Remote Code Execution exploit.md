About

The Lot Reservation Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that will help a certain subdivision, condo, or any business that selling a land property or house and lot. The system will help the said industry or company to provide their possible client information about the property they are selling and at the same time, possible clients can reserve their desired property. The lot reservation system website for the clients has user-friendly functions and the contents that are displayed can be managed dynamically by the management. This system allows management to upload the area map, and by this feature, the system admin or staff will populate the list of lots, house models, or the property that they are selling to allow the possible client to choose the area they want. The map will be divided into each division of the property of building like Phase 1-5 of a certain Subdivision, each of these phases will be encoded individually in the system along with the map image showing the division of each property or lots.

Vulnerability:-

The application does not properly verify authentication information and file types before files upload. This can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and file checking and upload malicious file to the server. There is an open directory listing where uploaded files are stored, allowing an attacker to open the malicious file in PHP, and will be executed by the server.
