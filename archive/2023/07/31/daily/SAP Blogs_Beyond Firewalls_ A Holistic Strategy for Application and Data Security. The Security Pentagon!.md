These incidents serves as a chilling reminder of the importance of safeguarding applications and data. To protect data, enterprises must adopt a comprehensive security approach starting at the physical layer. A multi-layered security strategy focused on application and data security is the only way to thwart persistent cyber adversaries.

**Don't be a victim!** Read this blog to assess your enterprise's current position in enhancing security measures and combating cyber threats.

***By weaving together the five major areas of security, businesses can construct a formidable digital fortress, mitigating risks and safeguarding their most valuable assets in the face of evolving cyber threats.***

In this article, we will explore different levels of security that can make your organization's critical assets impenetrable, from physical security to data security. Additionally, we'll dig into five stages of security, explore the critical levels that must be applied, such as physical access controls and data encryption, and learn how to strengthen SAP applications and protect sensitive information using best practices derived from real-life examples.

#### **The Security Pentagon**

The fundamental pillars of modern security, including Physical Security, Network Security, Application Security, Authorizations (Segregation of Duties), and the Data Security.

Security Pentagon

**1. Physical Security: Guarding the Gates**

Physical security is the first line of defence for any organization. Secure access controls, surveillance systems, and biometric authentication ensure that only authorized personnel can access work locations, key areas, and data centres. By preventing unauthorized access to servers and network devices, adequate physical security reduces the risk of data breaches.

Additionally, the custodian of backups plays a crucial role in safeguarding an enterprise's valuable data. Businesses often overlook the importance of properly transferring critical backups when switching service providers. This oversight can lead to potential data vulnerabilities, as some providers may not give importance once the client moves out of their service.

It is possible to permanently delete data from backup devices by overwriting it or destroying it. Data overwriting involves repeatedly overwriting data with random characters, making it unrecoverable. It is possible to achieve this level of secure data erasure using tools such as DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke). If the data is highly sensitive or obsolete, data destruction may be an option. By shredding or disintegrating backup media, the data can be irretrievably destroyed. Using these methods, enterprises can protect the privacy of their information and maintain compliance with data protection laws.

The prudent management of backups during provider transitions is essential to prevent data loss or compromise.

**2. Network Security: Building the Walls**

Network security acts as a sturdy perimeter around your digital fortress. Network security is ensured by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) solutions. Incoming and outgoing traffic is inspected, suspicious activity is identified, and possible threats are blocked by various rules defined using these solutions. Additionally, by using a virtual private network (VPN), remote users can communicate securely with the organization's network.

The SAP Enterprise Threat Detection solution is a great way to secure SAP systems for enterprises using SAP as their ERP. You can learn more about SAP Enterprise Threat Detection (ETD) in my previous blog - [Safeg...
