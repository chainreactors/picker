Roadmap for everyone who wants DevSecOps

![](https://www.hahwul.com/projects/devsecops/devsecops.jpg)

DevSecOps is a culture and practice that aims to integrate security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It emphasizes collaboration between Development, Security, and Operations teams. The goal is to build secure software from the ground up, reduce vulnerabilities, and ensure faster, safer deployments. This roadmap provides a curated list of resources and tools to help individuals and organizations implement DevSecOps practices.
