TEM Opera Plus FM Family Transmitter 35.45 Remote Code Execution

Vendor: Telecomunicazioni Elettro Milano (TEM) S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.tem-italy.it
Affected version: Software version: 35.45
                  Webserver version: 1.7

Summary: This new line of Opera plus FM Transmitters combines very
high efficiency, high reliability and low energy consumption in compact
solutions. They have innovative functions and features that can eliminate
the costs required by additional equipment: automatic exchange of audio
sources, built-in stereo encoder, integrated RDS encoder, parallel I/O
card, connectivity through GSM telemetry and/or TCP IP / SNMP / SMTP
Webserver.

Desc: The device allows access to an unprotected endpoint that allows
MPFS File System binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2
file system module provides a light-weight read-only file system that
can be stored in external EEPROM, external serial Flash, or internal
Flash program memory. This file system serves as the basis for the
HTTP2 web server module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is
available to other applications that require basic read-only storage
capabilities. This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program
memory that holds the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary
code.

Tested on: Webserver
