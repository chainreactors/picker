The day in the life of a Maintenance strategist often revolves around achieving KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that would continuously enhance Overall equipment effectiveness to maximize business efficiency. Maintenance strategists often formulate an effective maintenance strategy with facts and evidence that would ensure optimal results in terms of repair cost, maintenance cost & equipment performance.

In this blog, we will discuss how SAP S/4HANA cloud helps to accurately formulate the most economic predictive maintenance strategy based on selective SAP Fiori app features demonstrated through video content for enterprises to achieve maintenance excellence with a step-by-step approach.

Also, it is highly important to understand the capabilities of SAP Asset Performance Management, which uplifts asset management to the next level and fulfills customer's strategic needs on maintenance at first place.

**Identify Critical Assets for Proactive Maintenance**

As enterprises focus on an economical maintenance strategy, it is not possible to do proactive maintenance for all the systems and components in a plant. Hence, we need to precisely identify critical systems, potential sources of failures, and cost of maintenance based on a combination of historical facts and the knowledge and experience of engineers and operators.

This is where SAP Embedded analytical apps play a critical role in identifying the right system for proactive maintenance. Let us look sequentially and see how SAP Embedded analytical apps help Maintenance Strategists to formulate an optimized strategy.

**Evaluate the Historical performance of assets**

Historic asset performance data plays a crucial role in developing effective maintenance strategies. It enables maintenance teams to identify patterns, benchmark performance, and make informed decisions.

SAP Fiori app Technical Object Breakdown would be a single source of information across the enterprise, to perform historical analysis of breakdown at distinct levels, i.e., across the plant and specific to an object, also from components, and subsystems to equipment. It can analyze the causes of a particular breakdown more closely and calculate the distribution KPIs such as Time to Repair, Time Between repair, Mean Time to Repair, and Mean Time Between Repair.

**Analyzing the Failure root cause**

Failure root cause analysis is critical to maintenance strategy as it helps identify the underlying issues that lead to failures.

SAP Fiori Technical Object Damage app is a predefined analytical app, configurable to enable maintenance planners and technicians to analyze, track and report damage incidents related to components, systems, and equipment specific to Plants. With this app, you can see which damages occur frequently and find the systems and components that cause them. You could apply various Filter criteria, such as Maintenance Plant, Object Type, Construction Type, and Catalog Profile to narrow down the damage search specific to the condition. You could drill down to various dimensions, such as maintenance notification, and report aggregated information about the repair work performed to review the technical objects' reliability. Technical Object Damage app allows organizations to adopt a data-driven approach to the historical damages associated with the root cause of failure across Plant and equipment, hence enabling organizations to maximize overall equipment effectiveness.

**Perform Maintenance Cost Analysis**

Cost of maintenance is an important aspect of the enterprise function and imagine how a Maintenance strategist could easily identify the hotspots on maintenance spending for the whole plant. SAP S/4HANA offers an Actual Maintenance Cost Analysis app that provides real-time analysis of costs and consumption of material for maintenance operations, enabling users to make timely decisions. It enables users to anal...
