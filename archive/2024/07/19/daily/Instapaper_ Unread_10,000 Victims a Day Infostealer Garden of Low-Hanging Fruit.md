Imagine you could gain access to any Fortune 100 company for $10 or less, or even for free. Terrifying thought, isn't it? Or exciting, depending on which side of the cybersecurity barricade you are on. Well, that's basically the state of things today. Welcome to the infostealer garden of low-hanging fruit.

Over the last few years, the problem has grown bigger and bigger, and only now are we slowly learning its full destructive potential. In this article, we will describe how the entire cybercriminal ecosystem operates, the ways various threat actors exploit data originating from it, and most importantly, what you can do about it.

Let's start with what infostealer malware actually is. As the name suggests, it's malware that... steals data.

Depending on the specific type, the information it extracts might differ slightly, but most will try to extract the following:

* Cryptocurrency wallets
* Bank account information and saved credit card details
* Saved passwords from various apps
* Browsing history
* Cookies from the browser
* List of downloaded files
* Information about the operating system used
* A screenshot of your desktop
* Documents grabbed from the filesystem
* Credentials for Telegram and VPN apps

And more and more stuff, as the malware developers add additional features over time. As you can imagine, you don't want this kind of information being leaked on the internet for everyone to see. Nor do you want credentials to your organization's internal systems being compromised in this way. Yet that's exactly what's happening each and every day to thousands of users.

You don't have to be particularly tech-savvy to spread infostealer malware, nor rich to obtain valuable data stolen by other threat actors. Let's take a look at how the whole ecosystem works.

## **You, too, can be a cybercriminal!**

An ongoing trend on the dark side of the internet is specialization. While in the past, it was more common for one individual or group to take care of the whole process, nowadays the path to your company assets is paved by many different competing threat actors. These actors specialize in just one part of the "industry" and will happily provide their services to anyone willing to pay, in a true free-market spirit.

An example of the "old way" might be the famous Zeus banking malware. It was developed and spread by the same group of people. Stolen data was also exploited by them, and all proceeds from this criminal enterprise went back to them. There was no way for you, a petty cybercriminal, to make money with their results or even buy the malware itself so that you could spread it on your own.

Well, the market evolved. While there are still actors operating completely on their own, the bar for entering the world of stealing other people's data is much lower. You, even as an individual, can join the ranks of the cybercrime startup industry. The following positions are now open:

### **Dropper Implant Developer / Installs Seller**

You will be responsible for developing a small yet important piece of software on which the rest of the "industry" often relies: the malware dropper, or loader if you prefer.

While the infostealer malware file itself tends to be rather large because it contains lots of functionality, the malware dropper has only one goal: bypass the antivirus and create a way for other actors to download their own malicious code to the device.

An example of such a dropper might be the Smoke Loader, operating since 2011 and still adding new functionality to this day. Dropper/loader developers either exploit access obtained with their software themselves or resell it through various darknet forums to others, or both. In darknet lingo, an infected computer is known as an "install," and there are many "installs services" claiming to provide you with a way to spread your own malware (be it infostealers, cryptominers, or other malicious code) through them. Usually, they will assure you that they sell the "install" to your hands only, but from our experience, this is often not the case, as the "installs service" operators will try to monetize it to the max.

One such service, InstallsKey, will sell infected (with their own dropper) computers to you for less than a dollar to 10 bucks, depending on the locality. That's not exactly dirt cheap...
