## Episode 1 summary

In episode 1 of the “Building Security In – The Next Generation’ podcast, we discuss with Jim Routh how we arrived at the current state of ‘DevOps’ and ‘cloud-first’, with considerations of how work-from-home functioned as an accelerant. We explore how distinct parts of organizations can function at increased speeds and how, going forward, there’ll be a more level playing field for building software and moving the organization toward greater resilience—and how AI and other instrumentation could help. Other topics include shared responsibility models as part of being successful in software security, and why authentication in the development process and cloud, encryption, secrets management, and more is now a significant part of software security. We also talk about how AI is becoming part of the software development and security process. Finally, hear about Routh’s experience of moving from the CISO to the CSO role.

While serving in CISO and CSO roles, he’s widely credited with creating organizational risk management structures and security capabilities at organizations including American Express, DTCC, JPMorgan Chase, Aetna, CVS Health, and MassMutual.
