## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[China Calls Volt Typhoon an Invention of the U.S.](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/china-accuses-us-of-fabricating-volt.html):** China's National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) has claimed that the threat actor tracked Volt Typhoon is an invention of U.S. intelligence agencies and their allies. It also accused the U.S. of carrying out false flag operations in an attempt to conceal its own malicious cyber attacks and that it has established a "large-scale global internet surveillance network."

### **‚ÄéÔ∏è‚ÄçTrending CVEs**

[CVE-2024-38178](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/north-korean-scarcruft-exploits-windows.html), [CVE-2024-9486](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/critical-kubernetes-image-builder.html), [CVE-2024-44133,](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/microsoft-reveals-macos-vulnerability.html) [CVE-2024-9487](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/github-patches-critical-flaw-in.html), [CVE-2024-28987](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/cisa-warns-of-active-exploitation-in.html), [CVE-2024-8963](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/nation-state-attackers-exploiting.html), [CVE-2024-40711](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/critical-veeam-vulnerability-exploited.html), [CVE-2024-30088](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/oilrig-exploits-windows-kernel-flaw-in.html), [CVE-2024-9164](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/new-critical-gitlab-vulnerability-could.html)

## **üîî Top News**

* **Apple macOS Flaw Bypasses Privacy Controls in Safari Browser:** Microsoft has disclosed details about a now-patched [security flaw in Apple](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/microsoft-reveals-macos-vulnerability.html)'s Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) framework in macOS that could be abused to get around a user's privacy preferences and access data. There is some evidence that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-44133, may have been exploited by AdLoad adware campaigns. The issue has been addressed in macOS Sequoia 15 released last month.
* **Legitimate Red Team Tool Abuse in Real-World Attacks:** Threat actors are attempting to [weaponize the open-source EDRSilencer tool](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/hackers-abuse-edrsilencer-tool-to.html) as part of efforts to interfere with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and hide malicious activity. In doing so, the aim is to render EDR software ineffective and make it a lot more challenging to identify and remove malware.
* **TrickMo Can Now Steal Android PINs:** Researchers have spotted new variants of the [TrickMo Android banking trojan](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/trickmo-banking-trojan-can-now-capture.html) that incorporate features to steal a device's unlock pattern or PIN by presenting to victims' a bogus web page that mimics the device's actual unlock screen.
* **FIDO Alliance Debuts New Specs for Passkey Transfer:** One of the major design limitations with passkeys, the new passwordless sign-in method becoming increasingly common, is that it's impossible to transfer them between platforms such as Android and iOS (or vice versa). The FIDO Alliance has now announced that it aims to [make passkeys more interoperable](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/fido-alliance-drafts-new-protocol-to.html) through new draft protocols such as the Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF) that allow for secure credential exchange.
* **Hijack Loader Uses Legitimate Code-Signing Certificates:** Malware campaigns are now leveraging a loader family called [Hijack Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-uncover-hijack-loader.html) that's signed legitimate code-signing certificates in a bid to evade detection. These attacks typically involve tricking users into downloading a booby-trapped binary under the guise of pirated software or movies.

## **üì∞ Around the Cyber World**

* **Apple Releases Draft Ballot to Shorten Certificate Lifespan to 45 Days:** Apple has [published](https://www.sectigo.com/resource-library/apple-now-joins-google-in-push-to-shorten-digital-certificate-lifespans) a draft ballot that proposes to incrementally phase the lifespan of public SSL/TLS certificates from 398 days to 45 days between now and 2027. Google previously announced a similar roadmap of its intention to reduce the maximum validity for public SSL/TLS certificates from 398 days to 90 days.
* **87,000+ Internet-Facing Fortinet Devices Vulnerable to CVE-2024-23113:** About 87,390 Fortinet IP addresses are still [likely susceptible](https://infosec.exchange/%40shadowserver/113300701642489996) to a critical code execution flaw ([CVE-2024-23113](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/cisa-warns-of-critical-fortinet-flaw-as.html), CVSS score: 9.8), which was recently added to the U.S. Cybersecurity and In...
