# Vade Secure Gateway

During a penetration test activity, several reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found on an application developed by the French Company **Vade Secure**. The vulnerable application is Vade Secure Gateway which is an email box scanning and processing tool for spam removal that can be managed via a web page.

Once we identified the vulnerabilities and found that they had not been previously disclosed by someone else before, we made several attemps to establish contact with the Company to report the issue both via email and chat, but no contact could be established.

# Software Popularity

Since we had no previous knowledge about this software, we wanted to verify its spread on the Internet.

We used [fav-up](https://github.com/pielco11/fav-up) to calculate the hash of the favicon, and we combined the result with [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), which allows to search for specific favicon hashes with the query

`http.favicon.hash:{HashFavicon}`

The following picture highlights the number of detected products instances grouped by country.

# Version identification

Even though there is no precise reference on the vendor site, it was possible to deduce the version via the release document found on the Vade Secure support page.

[Changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20230530092540/https%3A//info.vadesecure.com/hubfs/PARTNER%20PORTAL%20DOCUMENTATION/EN/VADE%20GATEWAY/Vade%20Gateway%20Administrator%20guide.pdf)

![](https://labs.yarix.com/wp-content/uploads/porto_placeholders/100x110.jpg)

Given the changes made in version 3.0, we can infer that this is the target’s version.

**\*\*Since it was not possible to establish contact with the Company to identify a solution to these problems, we decided to hide the parameters and payloads in this article. However, we are always available in case Vade Secure wants to set up a collaboration with us, giving the opportunity to integrate the present article with information on future patches that solve the problems reported.\*\***

# Technical Recap

Three vulnerabilities were identified in this application, broken down as follows:

* one **Reflected XSS** vulnerability (**CVE-2023-29713**) [**High**]
* two **DOM-based XSS** vulnerabilities (**CVE-2023-29712, CVE-2023-29714**) [**Medium**]

These types of attacks allow an unauthorized user to inject Javascript or HTML code within the victim’s browser to steal information or induce to perform certain operations through social engineering techniques.
