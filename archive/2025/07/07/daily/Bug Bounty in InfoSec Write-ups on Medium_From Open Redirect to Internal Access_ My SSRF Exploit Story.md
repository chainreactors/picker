Hello there,

I am Pratik Dabhi, a Bug Bounty Hunter and a Penetration Tester. Many of you may already know me, but for those who arenâ€™t, please visit my website to learn more about me.

In this blog, I will share an interesting bug I discovered last year on a multinational corporationâ€™s website. The bug revolves around how I bypassed SSRF protections by chaining it with an open redirect vulnerability on a third-party domain. As in my recent blog posts, Iâ€™ve been detailing the bugs found during the reconnaissance phase. Similarly, in this case, I uncovered this bug during my reconnaissance phase.

## What is SSRF?

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability where an attacker can trick a server into sending HTTP requests to internal or external systems that the attacker should not normally be able to reach.

This can lead to:

* Accessing internal-only services (e.g. databases, admin panels)
* Scanning internal networks and discovering open ports
* Retrieving sensitive data from cloud metadata services
* Bypassing IP restrictions or firewalls

Companies often try to prevent SSRF by blocking requests to certain hostnames like `localhost` or private IP ranges. But as youâ€™ll see, creative chaining of bugs can sometimes bypass these defenses.

## Bug Summary

The target had a service running at:

```
https://thumbnail.example.com/?url=<external_url>
```

This service fetched images from external URLs to generate thumbnails displayed on their platform.

They had protection mechanisms in place that blocked direct requests to internal resources. For example, if I tried:

```
https://thumbnail.example.com/?url=http://localhost:443
```

â€¦the server responded with an error message like:

*Error: localhost is prohibited.*So far, everything seemed secure.

## Discovery of the Open Redirect

While performing reconnaissance, I came across a third-party domain `blip.bizrate.com` that had an interesting endpoint:

```
https://blip.example.com/flip?u=https://evil.com
```

When I opened this URL in my browser, it **redirected directly to** [**https://evil.com**](https://evil.com/) without any validation or restrictions.

So, it was confirmed that the `blip.example.com` endpoint was vulnerable to an **open redirect** via the `u` parameter.

## Chaining the Open Redirect into SSRF

Hereâ€™s where the fun began. I thought:

***If I canâ€™t request localhost directly, what if I redirect through a trusted domain?***

So, instead of directly hitting `localhost`, I crafted this payload:

```
https://thumbnail.example.com/?url=https://blip.example.com/flip?u=http://localhost:80
```

Hereâ€™s what happened behind the scenes:

1. thumbnail.example.com fetched the initial URL:
 [https://blip.example.com/flip?u=http://localhost:80](https://blip.bizrate.com/flip?u=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A80%60)

2. The server at blip.bizrate.com issued an HTTP 302 redirect to:
 http://localhost:80.

3. thumbnail.example.com followed the redirect and attempted to connect to http://localhost:80.

**And thatâ€™s how the SSRF was triggered despite protections.**

## Confirming the SSRF

When I tested my crafted URL, the server responded with:

```
dial tcp 127.0.0.1:80: connect: connection refused
```

This clearly showed that the server **attempted to connect to localhost**. The connection was refused because nothing was listening on that port during my test.

To scan other ports, I simply changed the port number in my payload:

```
https://thumbnail.example.com/?url=https://blip.example.com/flip?u=http://localhost:443
```

If a service was running on that port, Iâ€™d receive either a different error message or possibly even a thumbnail response with sensitive data.

Through this method, I could perform internal port scanning and potentially interact with services not exposed publicly.

## Why This Vulnerability Happened

The vulnerability existed because:

* The developers correctly blocked direct requests to internal hosts.
* However, they **trusted external domains** and followed redirects blindly.

The open redirect allowed me to start with a trusted external domain and end up at an internal resource â€” bypassing the protection logic entirely.

## Impact

**Severity:** Medium

With this SSRF vulnerability, an attacker could:

* Scan internal services and discover open ports.
* Access internal endpoints like admin panels or databases.
* Attempt to exploit other vulnerabilities on internal services.
* Potentially access cloud metadata services (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure) which could leak sensitive credentials.

## Mitigation

Hereâ€™s how such issues can be fixed:

âœ… **Strict Allowlisting**
 Limit the thumbnail service to only fetch images from trusted domains (e.g. `*.example.com`).

âœ… **Validate Final Destination**
 Check the **final resolved IP** of the URL after following redirects. Block requests to internal IP ranges or localhost.

âœ… **Avoid Open Redirects**
 Third-party services like `blip.example.com` should fix open redirects by validating allowed destinations or implementing strict allowlists.

### With this vulnerability, I was able to earn good money, I will show you some of my reports.
