Germany's government has stood down the president of its Federal Office for Information Security, Arne Schönbohm, over his links to Russia.

Schönbohm's woes erupted last week when late-night chat show ZDF Magazine Royale branded him a "Cyberclown" in a Twitter thread that detailed some of the wurst moments of his career:

> Was das BMI zu Arne Schönbohm wusste. Ein Thread (1/12) [#cyberclown](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cyberclown?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Among the matters raised in the thread were Schönbohm's founding of a lobby group called Cyber Security Council Germany. The group admitted a member company called Protelion, which claimed to be German but was in fact founded by a former KGB officer who has been honored for services to Russia by Vladimir Putin.
