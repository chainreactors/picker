# $10M Is Yours If You Can Get This Guy to Leave Russia

The U.S. government this week put a $10 million bounty on a Russian man who for the past 18 years operated **Try2Check**, one of the cybercrime underground’s most trusted services for checking the validity of stolen credit card data. U.S. authorities say 43-year-old **Denis Kulkov**‘s card-checking service made him at least $18 million, which he used to buy a Ferrari, Land Rover, and other luxury items.

Launched in 2005, Try2Check soon was processing more than a million card-checking transactions per month — charging 20 cents per transaction. Cybercriminals turned to services like this after purchasing stolen credit card data from an underground shop, with an eye toward minimizing the number of cards that are inactive by the time they are put to criminal use.

Try2Check was so reliable that it eventually became the official card-checking service for some of the underground’s most bustling crime bazaars, including Vault Market, [Unicc](https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=unicc), and [Joker’s Stash](https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/jokers-stash/). Customers of these carding shops who chose to use the shop’s built-in (but a-la-carte) card checking service from Try2Check could expect automatic refunds on any cards that were found to be inactive or canceled at the time of purchase.

Many established stolen card shops will allow customers to request refunds on dead cards based on official reports from trusted third-party checking services. But in general, the bigger shops have steered customers toward using their own white-labeled version of the Try2Check service — primarily to help minimize disputes over canceled cards.

On Wednesday, May 3, Try2Check’s websites were replaced with a domain seizure notice from the **U.S. Secret Service** and **U.S. Department of Justice**, as prosecutors in the [Eastern District of New York](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/cybercriminal-network-fueling-global-stolen-credit-card-trade-dismantled) unsealed an indictment and search warrant naming **Denis Gennadievich Kulkov** of Samara, Russia as the proprietor.

Try2Check’s login pages have been replaced with a seizure notice from U.S. law enforcement.

At the same time, the **U.S. Department of State** [issued a $10 million reward](http://state.gov/u-s-department-of-state-announces-reward-offers-for-information-leading-to-the-arrest-and-or-conviction-of-a-russian-cybercriminal-and-identification-of-key-leaders-of-a-transnational-organized-crime/) for information leading to the arrest *or* conviction of Kulkov. In November 2021, the State Department began [offering up to to $10 million](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/revil-ransom-arrest-6m-seizure-and-10m-reward/) for the name or location of any key leaders of REvil, a major Russian ransomware gang.

As noted in the Secret Service’s [criminal complaint](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cardcheckers-Complaint-FINAL.pdf) (PDF), the Try2Check service was first advertised on the closely-guarded Russian cybercrime forum **Mazafaka**, by someone using the handle “**KreenJo**.” That handle used the same ICQ instant messenger account number (**555724**) as a Mazafaka denizen named “**Nordex**.”

In February 2005, Nordex posted to Mazafaka that he was in the market for hacked bank accounts, and offered 50 percent of the take. He asked interested partners to contact him at the ICQ number **228427661** or at the email address **polkas@bk.ru**. As the government noted in its search warrant, Nordex exchanged messages with forum users at the time identifying himself as a then-24-year-old “Denis” from Samara, RU.

In 2017, U.S. law enforcement [seized the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction), and the Secret Service said those records show that a Denis Kulkov from Samara supplied the username “**Nordexin**,” email address nordexin@ya.ru, and an address in Samara.

Investigators had already found Instagram accounts where Kulkov posted pictures of his Ferrari and his family. Authorities were able to identify that Kulkov had an **iCloud** account tied to the address **nordexin@icloud.com**, and upon subpoenaing that found passport photos of Kulkov, and well as more photos of his family and pricey cars.

Like many other top cybercriminals based in Russia or in countries with favorable relations to the Kremlin, the proprietor of Try2Check was not particularly difficult to link to a real-life identity. In Kulkov’s case, it no doubt was critical to U.S. investigators that they had access to a wealth of personal information tied to a cryptocurrency exchange Kulkov had used.

However, the link between Kulkov and Try2Check can be made — ironically — based on records that have been plundered by hackers and published online over the years — including Russian email services, Russian government records, and hacked cybercrime forums.

## NORDEX

According to cybersecurity firm [Constella Intelligence](https://www.constellaintelligence.com), the address polkas@bk.ru was used to register an account with the username “Nordex” at [**bankir[.]com**](https://web.archive.org/web/20120228150736/http%3A//bankir.ru/), a now defunct news website that was almost standard reading for Russian speakers interested in news about various Russian financial markets.

Nordex appears to have been a finance nerd. In his early days on the forums, Nordex posted several long threads on his views about the Russian stock market and mutual fund investments.

That Bankir account was registered from the Internet address **193.27.237.66** in Samara, Russia, and included Nordex’s date of birth as **April 8, 1980**, as well as their ICQ number (**228427661**).

Cyber intelligence firm [Intel 471](https://www.intel471.com) found that Internet address also was used to register the account “Nordex” on the Russian hacking forum **Exploit** back in 2006.

Constella tracked another Bankir[.]com account created from that same Internet address under the username “Polkas.” This account had the same date of birth as Nordex, but a different email address: **nordia@yandex.ru**. This and other “nordia@” emails shared a password: “**anna59**.”

## NORDIA

Nordia@yandex.ru shares several passwords with **nordia@list.ru**, which Constella says was used to create an account at a religious website for an **Anna Kulikova** from Samara. At the Russian home furnishing store Westwing.ru, Ms. Kulikova listed her full name as **Anna Vnrhoturkina Kulikova**, and her address as 29 Kommunistrecheskya St., Apt. 110.

A search on that address in Constella brings up a record for an **Anna Denis Vnrhoturkina Kulkov**, and...
