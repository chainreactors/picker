Threat Intelligence Report: North Korean Advanced Persistent Threat Groups

Executive Summary: North Korea is known for its active state-sponsored hacking groups that carry out cyber espionage and disruptive activities to further their strategic objectives. These Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are known for their sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to infiltrate targeted networks and steal data. This report provides an overview of the various North Korean APT groups, their composition, and the activities they have carried out over the last five years.

Background: North Korea’s regime has long recognized the importance of cyber warfare as a means of advancing its strategic interests. The country has been accused of orchestrating several high-profile cyber attacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack.

North Korean APT Groups: North Korea has a number of active APT groups that conduct cyber espionage and disruptive activities. The following are some of the most notable groups:

1. Lazarus Group: Lazarus is one of the most well-known North Korean APT groups and has been active since 2009. The group is believed to operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s primary intelligence agency. Lazarus Group has been linked to several high-profile cyber attacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack.
2. APT37: Also known as Reaper, APT37 is believed to be a sub-group of Lazarus Group. The group is known for its sophisticated malware and phishing campaigns and has targeted a range of sectors, including government, military, and the media.
3. APT38: APT38 is a North Korean hacking group that is believed to be responsible for cyber attacks on financial institutions around the world. The group is known for its advanced capabilities, including the ability to bypass two-factor authentication and other security measures.
4. Kimsuky: Kimsuky is a North Korean APT group that is believed to operate under the country’s military intelligence agency. The group is known for its spear-phishing campaigns targeting South Korean government agencies and the country’s military.

Activities over the last five years: Over the last five years, North Korean APT groups have been involved in a range of cyber attacks, including:

1. The 2014 Sony Pictures hack: Lazarus Group was linked to the attack, which resulted in the theft and release of sensitive data and caused significant damage to Sony Pictures’ reputation.
2. The 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist: APT38 was linked to the attack, which resulted in the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
3. The 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack: Lazarus Group was linked to the attack, which affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and caused widespread disruption.
4. The 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics cyber attack: Kimsuky was linked to the attack, which targeted the email accounts of South Korean officials and organizations involved in the event.

**Exposed Assets within DPRK Cyber Operations**

North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups, also known as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, have been widely identified and studied by cybersecurity researchers over the years. These groups are believed to be operated by the North Korean government and are known for their sophisticated cyber espionage and cyber attack capabilities.

Here are some of the known names of operators within North Korean APT groups:

1. Lazarus Group: The Lazarus Group is perhaps the most well-known North Korean APT group, and has been active since at least 2009. It is believed to be responsible for a wide range of cyber attacks, including the infamous Sony Pictures hack in 2014 and the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. Some of the known Lazarus Group operators include Park Jin Hyok, who was indicted by the US Department of Justice in 2018 for his involvement in the Sony Pictures hack, and Kim Il, who is believed to be a key member of the group’s cyber espionage operations.
2. APT37: Also known as Reaper or Group123, APT37 is another North Korean APT group that has been active since at least 2012. It is known for its wide range of cyber attack capabilities, including espionage, data theft, and destructive attacks. Some of the known APT37 operators include Kim Hyon Woo and Jon Chang Hyok.
3. APT38: APT38 is believed to be a sub-group of the Lazarus Group, focused specifically on financial gain through cyber attacks. It is known for its involvement in a number of high-profile attacks against banks and financial institutions, including the theft of $81 million from the Bangladesh Bank in 2016. Some of the known APT38 operators include Park Jin Hyok and Kim Su Jin.
4. APT27: Also known as Emissary Panda, APT27 is believed to be a Chinese-speaking North Korean APT group that has been active since at least 2010. It is known for its cyber espionage and data theft capabilities, and has been linked to attacks against government agencies, defense contractors, and other high-value targets. Some of the known APT27 operators include Zhang Xiao and Zhu Qiang.
5. APT10: APT10, also known as Stone Panda, is another Chinese-speaking APT group that is believed to have close ties to North Korea. It is known for its cyber espionage and data theft capabilities, and has been linked to attacks against government agencies, defense contractors, and other high-value targets. Some of the known APT10 operators include Zhang Zhang-Gui and Tan Daijing.

It is important to note that these are just some of the known names of operators within North Korean APT groups, and that these groups are constantly evolving and changing their tactics and techniques. Cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement agencies around the world continue to monitor these groups closely in order to better understand their capabilities and prevent their attacks.

**TTP’s and IOC’s,and Campaigns by DPRK OPS**

North Korean Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups have been actively engaged in cyber espionage and cyber attack campaigns for many years. These groups are known for their sophisticated Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), which they use to compromise networks, steal data, and conduct other malicious activities. In this report, we will discuss some of the key TTPs, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and campaigns associated with North Korean APT groups.

Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):

1. Social Engineering: North Korean APT groups often use social engineering tactics to trick users into installing malware or providing sensitive information. This includes spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles.
2. Malware: North Korean APT groups develop and use a wide range of malware, including Remote Access Trojans (RATs), Keyloggers, and data exfiltration tools. They often customize their malware for specific targets to avoid detection.
3. Exploits: North Korean APT groups actively search for vulnerabilities in software and operating systems that they can exploit to gain access to target networks. They have been known to use exploits for z...
