# Large eBay malvertising campaign leads to scams

Posted: November 6, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Tech support scammers are targeting eBay customers in the U.S. via fraudulent Google ads. In a few separate searches, we were able to identify multiple Sponsored results that were created from at least four different advertiser accounts.

While most of those ads clearly looked fake, they appeared consistently and prominently enough to trick the inattentive user into a scam. Victims who clicked the ad were redirected to bogus websites prompting them to call for assistance, leading them straight into the scammer’s den.

We have reported the malicious ads to Google and are monitoring for similar campaigns targeting other brands.

## Flurry of ads

A search for ‘*ebay phone number*‘ or ‘*ebay customer service*‘ from the U.S. using Google Chrome returned several ads that were entirely fraudulent. Upon closer inspection, we found that they were created from four separate advertiser accounts, some belonging to legitimate entities, some created from scratch.

The first ad shown in the screenshot above is the most deceiving of all since it uses eBay’s brand name, logo and website. While Google has strict rules about who may be allowed to do this (i.e. the owner, affiliates), scammers are able to still “comply” with the rule and yet be total crooks.

All they need to do is ensure the final URL (once you click the ad) is one the same domain or is a subdomain that matches the one shown in the ad. That’s the case here, as they are using *developer.ebay.com*. (part of eBay’s Developers Program Search) which can technically be claimed as belonging to *ebay.com*.

Yet, as you can see below, the destination URL is not what one would expect. It shows a search portal with a printed search result that has eBay’s customer service phone number (narrator: it is not).

This is a trick we’ve seen recently with various online platforms: you perform a calculated search query, even if you know no result will be found. What matters is that your search query will appear on screen, and will be used to fool people who see it. In the example above, the search query was for “*eBay.Customer-Service +1 (866) 409[-]9281*“.

The other ads redirect to fake websites or pages hosted on [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) providers such as BitBucket claiming to be eBay customer service. Once again, scammers make it clear and obvious that users should call the phone number displayed on screen.

## Keeping scammers at bay

Calling any of those phone numbers is strongly discouraged, unless of course your favorite sport is scam baiting. The tried and tested “tech support scam” is one of the most costly type of crime for American consumers.

From call centres mostly located overseas, young people with a broken English accent will attempt to trick victims into giving them access to their computer or phone. The end goal is to steal as much money as they can, by requesting...
