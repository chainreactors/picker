# Threat actor impersonates Google via fake ad for Authenticator

Posted: July 30, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

We have previously [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/05/malvertising-its-a-jungle-out-there) on the brand impersonation issue with Google ads: users who search for popular keywords are shown malicious ads that purport to be from an official vendor.

Not only does this trick innocent victims into downloading [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) or losing their data to [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) sites, it also erodes trust in brands and by association in Google Search itself.

Today, we show yet another example of brand misuse, except that this one targets Google itself. If you were trying to download the popular Google Authenticator (a multi-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) program) via a Google search in the past few days, you may have inadvertently installed malware on your computer.

A similar distribution site and the same payload were previously [discovered](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/cybersecurity-blog/deerstealer-campaign-analysis/) by sandbox maker AnyRun. In this blog post, we will reveal the missing piece at the top of the killchain, namely the Google ad that was involved in tricking users into visiting a decoy website.

## Trust, but ‘verified’?

The core issue with brand impersonation comes from ads that appear as if they were from official sources and advertisers’ identities verified by Google. This was the case here with this ad for Authenticator:

The truth is Larry Marr has nothing to do with Google, and is likely a fake account. We can follow what happens when you click on the ad by monitoring web traffic. We see a number of redirects via intermediary domains controlled by the attacker, before landing on a fake site for Authenticator.

## Fake site leads to signed payload hosted on Github

The fraudulent site *chromeweb-authenticators[.]com* was registered via NICENIC INTERNATIONAL GROUP CO., LIMITED on the same day as the ad was observed.

Looking at the site’s source code, we can see the code responsible for downloading *Authenticator.exe* from GitHub. Note the comments from the author in Russian:

Hosting the file on GitHub allows the threat actor to use a trusted [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) resource, unlikely to be blocked via conventional means. While GitHub is the de facto software repository, not all applications or scripts hosted on it are legitimate. In fact, anyone can create an account and upload files, which is exactly what the threat actor did under the username *[authe-gogle](https://github.com/authe-gogle/)*, creating the *authgg* repository that contains the malicious *Authenticator.exe*:

Looking at the file itself, we can see that it has been digitally signed by “*Songyuan Meiying Electronic Products Co., Ltd.*” just one day before, and the signature is still valid at the time of wr...
