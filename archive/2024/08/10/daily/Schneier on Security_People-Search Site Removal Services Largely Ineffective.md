## People-Search Site Removal Services Largely Ineffective

Consumer Reports has a [new study](https://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Data-Defense_-Evaluating-People-Search-Site-Removal-Services-.pdf) of people-search site removal services, concluding that they don’t really work:

> As a whole, people-search removal services are largely ineffective. Private information about each participant on the people-search sites decreased after using the people-search removal services. And, not surprisingly, the removal services did save time compared with manually opting out. But, without exception, information about each participant still appeared on some of the 13 people-search sites at the one-week, one-month, and four-month intervals. We initially found 332 instances of information about the 28 participants who would later be signed up for removal services (that does not include the four participants who were opted out manually). Of those 332 instances, only 117, or 35%, were removed within four months.

I tried 6 optout pages after reading the piece for giggles. The best and worst 3. They are set up to discourage, with multi pass captchas, and some with email verification followed by another set of multi pass captchas. Gave up with Intelius as the optout page didn’t make sense. And I’m in CA, so by law there should be an obvious optout.

Well 😁…not at all an expert on this, but: HDDs, NAS-es, and any other storage device that you can think of, always get backed up, archived and restored. Then you have your messy databases, disgruntled employees or business partners who leave with heaps of confidential data, and so on.

The companies themselves trade the data with anybody that wants to buy it: as Bruce (I think) said in one of his books, “data is a commodity”.

@ ALL,

Re : Who knows how to stay off of the Internet and out of other daya brokers DB’s?

The report really only covers a tiny fraction of people.

1, Those living in the US

So take the results with a very large pinch of salt.

Further the report writers up front admit that the group they selected was not just “too small” but in a way “self selecting” so not representative of a larger population.

In a way those people are likely to be more careful in what information they have revealed than “the norm”.

So we could expect their results to be in effect artificially higher than the norm.

So with,

> “Consumer Reports has a new study of people-search site removal services, concluding that they don’t really work”

Concluding “don’t really work” for a group that is more aware and probably takes more care… Kind of suggests they don’t work for anyone who would not be seen as “Paranoid” by others that are less or unaware.

So it raises a question of,

“Would anybody who is aware seriously think that as long as they are providing information into the likes of Meta, LinkedIn, Alphabet, Microsoft and Application developers of any sort for “Walled Gardens” are not going to have any Personal, Private Information stolen by these organisations?”

We know for instance the Meta Group is a extraordinarily rapacious grab everything and then force identifying tags in where ever they can organisation (install any Meta App and your privacy is deader than the first Dodo). Likewise Google and Microsoft are forcing unique identifiers on people where ever they can. Google in particular has been pronounced guilty by a judge of behaviour that if you look behind it’s intent is to many peoples eyes deeply shocking.

And all these US Corps and Organisations try to link such tags it into “Personal Identifying Information”(PII)[1] to then sell on highly profitably.

Heck Google/Alphabet has just been found guilty in court of not just such and related activities, but paying the likes of Apple and others $billions to ensure their “spyware” is preeminent on hardware users buy and think they own.

Without doubt the US Government bears a very large responsibility for the behaviours of these Corps, Companies, Organisations, and Individuals.

And they are more than fully aware of it, because when other Countries Corps, Companies, Organisations, and Individuals do similar there are cries of “outrage” and “faux-shock” and similar claims.

Keep your eyes open about Temu that is seen by some as a “bottom feeder” for many reasons. And is just now starting to being given the “China Bad” treatment.

As someone who does not reside in the US I do find wry / ironic humour in these behaviours.

But it’s not these “public sources” that worry me it’s the likes of Palantir and other “Private Data Brokers” that use the data to “build profiles” with other non public data to sell to Law Enforcment and other Government “Guard Labour” organisations. They do this in part by pushing the data into the likes of AI LLM and ML systems. Have a think on the likely consequence of this especially as this soet of information begats similar information that then becomes grist in the AI mill of utter nonsense that is called “Hallucinations” by some but either Soft or Hard Bullshit by those more professional than the pushers of the current AI Investor Bubble.

[1] The TLA “PII” is more often seen than the term “Personally Identifying Information” and thus hides the horror of what gets taken by such Criminals due to no or chronically lax legislation in the US and other jurisdictions. Some people do give indicators,

@ SpaceLiform, JonKnowNothing, ALL,

Re : Xmas Gift keeps giving.

Above I ask the question,

*“Who knows how to stay off of the Internet and out of other data brokers DB’s?”*

Well think of those “others” a little more broadly as ...
