If this had been a security drill, someone would've said it went too far. But it wasn't a drill‚Äîit was real. The access? Everything looked normal. The tools? Easy to find. The detection? Came too late.

This is how attacks happen now‚Äîquiet, convincing, and fast. Defenders aren't just chasing hackers anymore‚Äîthey're struggling to trust what their systems are telling them.

The problem isn't too few alerts. It's too many, with no clear meaning. One thing is clear: if your defense still waits for obvious signs, you're not protecting anything. You're just watching it happen.

This recap highlights the moments that mattered‚Äîand why they're worth your attention.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[APT41 Exploits Google Calendar for Command-and-Control](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/chinese-apt41-exploits-google-calendar.html)** ‚Äî The Chinese state-sponsored threat actor known as APT41 deployed a malware called TOUGHPROGRESS that uses Google Calendar for command-and-control (C2). Google said it observed the spear-phishing attacks in October 2024 and that the malware was hosted on an unspecified compromised government website. TOUGHPROGRESS is designed to read and write events with an attacker-controlled Google Calendar, and extract the commands specified in them for subsequent execution. The results of the execution are written back to another Calendar event from where they can be accessed by the attackers. The campaign targeted multiple other government entities, although the company did not name the organizations that were singled out.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[New Law Enforcement Operation Takes down AvCheck[.]net](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/us-doj-seizes-4-domains-supporting.html)** ‚Äî Authorities in the United States, in partnership with Finland and the Netherlands, have seized four domains and associated infrastructure that offered counter-antivirus (CAV) tools and crypting services to other threat actors to help their malware stay undetected from security software. These include AvCheck[.]net, Cryptor[.]biz, Cryptor[.]live, and Crypt[.]guru. "The seized domains offered services to cybercriminals, including counter-antivirus (CAV) tools," the U.S. Justice Department said. "When used together, CAV and crypting services allow criminals to obfuscate malware, making it undetectable and enabling unauthorized access to computer systems." Authorities said the seizure of AvCheck was made possible by exploiting the mistakes of the admins. "The admins did not provide the security they promised," officials said in a notice, stating they have also confiscated a database containing usernames, email addresses, payment information, and more.
* **[Microsoft, Dutch security agencies lift veil on Void Blizzard](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/russian-hackers-breach-20-ngos-using.html)** ‚Äî A previously unknown hacker group with suspected ties to the Kremlin was responsible for a cyberattack last year on the Dutch police and has also targeted other Western nations that deliver military support to Ukraine. "Laundry Bear has successfully managed to fly below the radar by employing simple attack methods and attack vectors involving tools which are readily available on victims' computers and are therefore difficult for organizations to detect and distinguish from other known Russian threat actors," the Netherlands government said. The group's existence came to light after investigating the September 2024 breach of the Dutch National Police, during which the group gained access to an account belonging to an employee by using a stolen session cookie and, through it, they managed to grab the work-related contact information of other police employees. While the attack techniques follow the cyber espionage playbook, the targeting is very specific with a victim list that overlaps with other Russia-linked cyber spies. The findings show that Ukraine and NATO member states continue to remain prime hunting grounds for Russian threat groups.
* **[EDDIESTEALER Bypasses Chrome's App-Bound Encryption to Steal Browser Data](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/eddiestealer-malware-uses-clickfix.html)** ‚Äî A new Rust-based information stealer called EDDIESTEALER is being propagated via fake CAPTCHA verification pages that trick users into running PowerShell commands. The stealer is notable for its ability to bypass Chromium's app-bound encryption to gain access to unencrypted sensitive data, such as cookies. It does so by implementing an open-source project called ChromeKatz in Rust. EDDIESTEALER is not the only stealer to make efforts to sidestep new defenses introduced by Google. Another stealer malware known as Katz Stealer employs DLL injection to obtain the encryption key used to secure the cookies and passwords in Chromium-based browsers. A third stealer malware family dubbed ZeroCrumb, publicly [released](https://github.com/dk0m/ZeroCrumb) on GitHub a couple of weeks ago, achieves the same objective by "impersonating a Chrome ins...
