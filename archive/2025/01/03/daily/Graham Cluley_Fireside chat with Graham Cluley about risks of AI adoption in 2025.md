Chances are that your organisation is one of the many businesses that are adopting AI. And while artificial intelligence can bring opportunities for enhanced productivity, increase your innovation, or streamline processes‚Ä¶ it can also introduce risk.

Without proper safeguarding, AI assistants and models can unintentionally expose sensitive data to unauthorized users, leading to increased risk of a security breach.

Join me, and the experts from Rubrik, on Weds January 15 2025, where we‚Äôll be having a [fireside chat](https://grahamcluley.com/go/rubrikai) with *Dark Reading* all about the known and unknown risks of adopting AI, learning how organizations can navigate, and balance, the risks and opportunities of AI to ensure they remain resilient against cyber threats.
