KL-001-2021-007: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller Undocumented Account
Advisory ID: KL-001-2021-007
Publication Date: 2021.05.26
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2021-007.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: CommScope
Affected Product: Ruckus IoT Controller
Affected Version: 1.7.1.0 and earlier
Platform: Linux
CWE Classification: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials, CWE-912: Hidden Functionality
CVE ID: CVE-2021-33216
2. Vulnerability Description
An upgrade account is included in the IoT Controller OVA that
provides the vendor undocumented access via Secure Copy (SCP).
3. Technical Description
Once the OVA is imported into VirtualBox, a VMDK file is
created. The VMDK file can be mounted and the directory
structure and its contents can be perused.
An authorized_keys file exists that allows an
individual/organization possessing the SSH private key to
access the virtual appliance using the 'vriotiotupgrade'
account. The 'vriotiotupgrade' account is restricted to scp,
per the rssh configuration.
Additionally, it appears that the IoT Controller has rssh version 2.3.4
installed and in use. At the time of this advisory, there are at least
three remote command injection vulnerabilities in this particular version
of rssh: CVE-2019-3463, CVE-2019-3464 and CVE-2019-1000018.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
The vendor has released an updated firmware (1.8.0.0) which
remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
notes are available at:
https://www.commscope.com/globalassets/digizuite/917216-faq-security-advisory-id-20210525-v1-0.pdf
