In episode 49 of The AI Fix, OpenAI kills off a sycophantic bot, our hosts are introduced to a prophetic Bosnian rock band, Meta puts an electric fence around its llamas, Mark reveals he‚Äôs never tried covering a robot with olive oil, and Graham leaves a stern message for his great-great-grandchildren.

Mark sits a ‚Äúsmarty-pants‚Äù test, an AI becomes a crime boss, and Graham explains how a decades-old typo is poisoning the scientific well.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
