# How to avoid election related scams

Posted: September 4, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

With the US election campaigns at full throttle, scammers have taken a renewed interest in the ways this can be used to defraud people, often using the same tactics legitimate campaigns leverage for support (emails, text messages, phone calls, and social media pleas).

The lure that we have seen the most involves asking people to donate to a campaign. Whether that comes in by mail, text, phone call, or on social media, that money isn’t going to any of the candidates.

This sender does not care who you want to donate to

If those scam campaigns aren’t directly after your money, they might well be [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) for [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

These phishers also use fake surveys pretending to be a volunteer for one of the political parties and will ask you for personal information directly or get on your nerves by engaging in discussions about controversial subjects.

Another method besides surveys are voter registration scams where the scammer poses as an election official and asks you to update your voter registration, or tell you that you can register to vote over the phone. Reminder, [here is how you can securely register to vote](https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote).

These scams are not only after your personal information but sometimes have the audacity to ask you to pay for completing your voter registration paperwork—something that is never asked in legitimate voter registration.

## How to stay safe

**Watch out for fake emails**

With the increasing use of [AI by cybercriminals, it has become more difficult to spot fake emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/12/how-to-recognize-ai-generated-phishing-mails). Looking for spelling errors is of no use anymore, but a few golden rules still apply to unsolicited emails:

* Don’t open attachments.
* Hover over the link(s) in the email. If they are different from the one that is displayed this is a red flag.
* Don’t let any sense of urgency expressed in the email rush you into a hasty decision.
* Check the sender’s email address is what you’re expecting. Note: these can be spoofed so this is not a guarantee, but anything that doesn’t look genuine definitely won’t be.

**Donate safely**

If you decide to sponsor a candidate, do not follow any links provided in text messages, emails, or on social media.

Find the official site for your favorite candidate and follow the instructions there. If you use Google or any other search engine to find the official site, do not click on the links in the sponsored ads. We have found too many cases where these went to false sites.

**Ignore text messages**

This is an easy one: just ignore them. Honest. Anyone texting me reque...
