California lawmakers are pushing one of the [most dangerous privacy rollbacks](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/statement-california-state-senate-advancing-dangerous-surveillance-bill) we’ve seen in years.

*The Corporate Cover-Up Act* is a massive carve-out that would gut [California’s Invasion of Privacy Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&part=1.&title=15.&chapter=1.5) (CIPA) and give Big Tech and data brokers a green light to spy on us without consent for just about any reason.

* Authorize pen registers and trap-and-trace tools, which track who you ...
