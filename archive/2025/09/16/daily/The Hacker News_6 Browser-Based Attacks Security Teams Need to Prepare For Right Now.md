Attacks that target users in their web browsers have seen an unprecedented rise in recent years. In this article, we'll explore what a "browser-based attack" is, and why they're proving to be so effective.

## **What is a browser-based attack?**

First, it's important to establish what a browser-based attack is.

In most scenarios, attackers don't think of themselves as attacking your web browser. Their end-goal is to compromise your business apps and data. That means going after the third-party services that are now the backbone of business IT.

The most common attack path today sees attackers log into third-party services, dump the data, and monetize it through extortion. You need only look at last year's [Snowflake](https://pushsecurity.com/blog/snowflake-retro?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored-content&utm_term=article) customer breaches or the still-ongoing Salesforce attacks to see the impact.

The most logical way to do this is by targeting users of those apps. And because of the changes to working practices, your users are more accessible than ever to external attackers — and exposed to a broader range of possible attack techniques.

| Browser-based attacks like AITM phishing, ClickFix, and consent phishing have seen an unprecedented rise in recent years. |

Once upon a time, email was the primary communication channel with the wider world, and work happened locally — on your device, and inside your locked-down network environment. This made email and the endpoint the highest priority from a security perspective.

But now, with modern work happening across a network of decentralized internet apps, and more varied communication channels outside of email, it's harder to stop users from interacting with malicious content (at least, without significantly impeding their ability to do their jobs).

Given that the browser is the place where business apps are accessed and used, it makes sense that attacks are increasingly playing out there too.

## **The 6 key browser-based attacks that security teams need to know about**

### **1. Phishing for credentials and sessions**

The most direct way for an attacker to compromise a business application is to phish a user of that app. You might not necessarily think of phishing as a browser-based attack, but that's exactly what it is today.

Phishing tooling and infrastructure have evolved a lot in the past decade, while the changes to business IT mean there are both many more vectors for phishing attack delivery, and apps and identities to target.

Attackers can deliver links over instant messenger apps, social media, SMS, malicious ads, and use in-app messenger functionality, as well as send emails directly from SaaS services to bypass email-based checks. Likewise, there are now hundreds of apps per enterprise to target, with varying levels of account security configuration.

| Phishing is now multi- and cross-channel, targeting a vast range of cloud and SaaS apps using flexible AitM toolkits — but all roads inevitably lead to the browser. |

Today, phishing operates on an industrial scale, using an array of obfuscation and detection evasion techniques. The latest generation of fully customized MFA-bypassing phishing kits are dynamically obfuscating the code that loads the web page, implementing custom bot protection (e.g. CAPTCHA or Cloudflare Turnstile), using runtime anti-analysis features, and using legitimate SaaS and cloud services to host and deliver phishing links to cover their tracks. [You can read more about the ways that modern phishing attacks are bypassing detection controls here](https://pushsecurity.com/resources/phishing-evolution?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored-content&utm_term=article).

These changes make phishing more effective than ever, and increasingly difficult to detect and block using email and network-based anti-phishing tools.

### **2. Malicious copy & paste (aka. ClickFix, FileFix, etc.)**

One of the biggest security trends in the past year has been the emergence of the attack technique known as [ClickFix](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/08/21/think-before-you-clickfix-analyzing-the-clickfix-social-engineering-technique/).

Originally known as "Fake CAPTCHA", these attacks attempt to trick users into running malicious commands on their device — typically by solving some form of verification challenge in the browser.

In reality, by solving the challenge, the victim is actually copying malicious code from the page clipboard and running it on their device. It typically gives the victim instructions that involve clicking prompts and copying, pasting, and running commands directly in the Windows Run dialog box, Terminal, or PowerShell. Variants such as [FileFix](https://mrd0x.com/filefix-clickfix-alternative/) have also emerged, which instead uses the File Explorer Address Bar to execute OS comma...
