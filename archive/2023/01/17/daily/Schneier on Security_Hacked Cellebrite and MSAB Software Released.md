[Cellebrite](https://cellebrite.com/en/home/) is an cyberweapons arms manufacturer that sells smartphone forensic software to governments around the world. [MSAB](https://www.msab.com/) is a Swedish company that does the same thing. [Someone](https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/cellebrite-msab-phone-forensics-leak) [has](https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/412110904) [released](https://archive.ph/OEI3g) software and documentation from both companies.

MSAB or Micro Systemation AB doesn’t seem to be much competition for NSO Group.

So, what does this mean? Does this mean many more people/governments can infect people — a nightmare scenario, or is this simply a better opportunity for Apple and others to better investigate and close vulnerabilities? Or both?

@Steve 8:00 AM

In the short term I would definitely suspect the former; availability is a prerequisite for usage.

In the medium term I would expect the latter; the ability for software vendors to examine attackers’ tools will help them develop defenses.

In the long term, absent at a minimum changes in the software development practices that allowed those holes to get through QA processes to begin with, I would expect that it will roughly even out as new security-vulnerability bugs are introduced and discovered.

I tend to think the outcome of the documentation and software being released will amount to precisely sweet eff aye if some people have their way. It really just feeds into the steady state form of egomania and avoidant incompetence. Well, that would be the stock business as usual cynicism peddled by cut and paste techbros.

This isn’t about security it all. It’s about a paucity of imagination, and economics and hierarchies. Most growth really has been based on an increasing population. Most of that was internal growth. Only latterly has it become global. Modernity is a very malleable and shifting thing. To wit: products built for limited lifecycles whether it’s their function, or compatibility, or build quality is a way of maximising profits in a shrinking pool of a opportunity while we race towards largely immovable environmental and resource deadlines requiring avoiding action.

The way to avoid all these issues with smartphones and the like is simply to stop making them. You could also turn off the cell towers too. You can imagine the scenes can’t you? Shirty execs panicking over the balance sheet turning red, and assorted coat tail “experts” having to detox.

So build them properly, and build them properly the first time, build them to last, and also don’t use them as an invasive platform to peddle all manner of stuff and nonsense nobody needs or wants.

Once the stupid tax (i.e. consumerism) has been removed then we can be more honest. Stop making stuff we don’t need to enrich the 1% and divvy the GDP up instead so we can all hit the beach.

@Steve

> So, what does this mean?

1. People can scan devices for being infected
2. People can collect information about what people/organisations were targeted
3. If the “wrong” people were targeted, there will be retaliation against the firms peddling the software

@Winter

Were your 3 points not already true prior to this software release? I don’t think the software release changes anything in that regard?

Ad 1., *scanning for infections*, requires the source code to be effective.

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Beware “Not Suitable Fo Work” content**

Some of the links given,

1, hxxps://boards.4chan….

lead to pages that have image / add content that some workplaces consider,

“Not Suitable For Work”(NSFW).

So best avoided.

Children’s comics often portray evil characters who want to destroy most of humanity. You find them also in the worse type of James Bond movies and wannabe Bond movies.

4chan is where the real people who would like to do so, but are too incompetent, gather to discuss their hatred of humanity.

I guess it would be too soon to hear from Cellebrite and MSAB, or any of the other companies whose products might be affected.

Maybe it’s also too soon to hear from security researchers?

MSAB’s extraction software, XRY, can supposedly work with 42,000 device profiles, has 4,500 passcode & bypass features, and can retrieve data from 4,200 app versions.

I feel like this needs a ‘cyber safety review board’ type of analysis. But, then again, I don’t know what the files contain.
