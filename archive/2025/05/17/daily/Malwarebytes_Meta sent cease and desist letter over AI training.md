# Meta sent cease and desist letter over AI training

Posted: May 16, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

EU privacy advocacy group NOYB has clapped back at Meta over its plans to start training its [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) model on European users’ data. In a [cease and desist letter](https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2025-05/noyb_cease%20and%20desist%20letter_Meta%20AI_pub.pdf) to the social networking giant’s Irish operation signed by founder Max Schrems, the non-profit demanded that it justify its actions or risk legal action.

In April, Meta [told users](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/uncategorized/2025/04/meta-slurps-up-eu-user-data-for-ai-training) that it was going to start training its generative AI models on their data.

Schrems uses several arguments against Meta in the NOYB complaint:

**1. Meta’s ‘legitimate interests’ are illegitimate**

NOYB continues to question Meta’s use of opt-out mechanisms rather than excluding all EU users from the process and requiring them to opt in to the scheme. “Meta may face massive legal risks – just because it relies on an “opt-out” instead of an “opt-in” system for AI training,” NOYB said on its site.

Companies who want to process personal data without explicit consent must demonstrate a legitimate interest to do so under GDPR. Meta hasn’t published information about how it justifies those interests, says Schrems. He has trouble seeing how training a general-purpose AI model could be deemed a legitimate interest because it violates a key GDPR principle; limiting data process to specific goals.

NOYB doesn’t believe that Meta can enforce GDPR rights for personal data like the right to be forgotten once an AI system is trained on it, especially if that system is an open-source one like Meta’s Llama AI model.

“How should it have a ‘legitimate interest’ to suck up all data for AI training?” Schrems said. “While the ‘legitimate interest’ assessment is always a multi-factor test, all factors seem to point in the wrong direction for Meta. Meta simply says that its interest in making money is more important than the rights of its users.”

**2. What you don’t know can hurt you**

Schrems warns that people who don’t have a Facebook account but just happen to be mentioned or caught in a picture on a user’s account will be at risk under Meta’s AI training plans. They might not even be aware that their information has been used to train AI, and therefore couldn’t object, he argues.

**3. Differentiation is difficult**

NOYB also worries that the social media giant couldn’t realistically separate people whose data is linked on the system. For example, what happens if two users are in the same picture, but one has opted out of AI training and one hasn’t? Or they’re in different geographies and one is protected under GDPR and one isn’t?

Trying to separate data gets even stickier when trying to separate ‘special category’ data, which GDPR treats as especially sensitive. This includes things like religious beliefs or sexual orientation.

“Based on previous legal submissions by Meta, we therefore have serious doubts that Meta can indeed technically implement a clean and proper differentiation between users that performed an opt-out and users that did not,” Schrems says.
