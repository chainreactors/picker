As SaaS and cloud-native work reshape the enterprise, the web browser has emerged as the new endpoint. However, unlike endpoints, browsers remain mostly unmonitored, despite being responsible for more than **70% of modern malware attacks**.

Keep Aware's recent [State of Browser Security report](https://keepaware.com/resources/guides/state-of-browser-security-report-2025?utm_source=hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=sobs_apr) highlights major concerns security leaders face with employees using the web browser for most of their work. The reality is that **traditional security tools are blind to what happens within the browser**, and attackers know it.

### **Key Findings:**

* **70% of phishing campaigns** impersonate Microsoft, OneDrive, or Office 365 to exploit user trust.
* **150+ trusted platforms** like Google Docs and Dropbox are being abused to host phishing and exfiltrate data.
* **10% of AI prompts** involve sensitive business content, posing risks across thousands of browser-based AI tools.
* **34% of file uploads** on company devices go to personal accounts, often undetected.

## **New Attack Patterns Bypass Traditional Defenses**

From phishing kits that morph in real-time to JavaScript-based credential theft, attackers are bypassing firewalls, SWGs, and even EDRs. Here's how:

### **Malware Reassembly in the Browser**

Threats are delivered as fragments that only activate when assembled inside the browser—making them invisible to network or endpoint tools.

### **Multi-Step Phishing**

Phishing pages dynamically serve different content depending on who's viewing—users see scams, and scanners see nothing. Microsoft remains the most impersonated target.

### **Living Off Trusted Platforms**

Attackers hide behind URLs from reputable SaaS platforms. Security tools allow this by default—giving adversaries a clear path in.

The security stack must evolve to detect, analyze, and respond to threats where they actually occur: inside the browser. Relying solely on perimeter-based defenses like SWGs and network security tools is no longer enough.

## **AI: The Next Great (Unmonitored) Security Risk**

With **75% of employees using generative AI**, most enterprises are unaware of what data is being pasted into models like ChatGPT—or what third-party browser extensions are doing in the background. Unlike traditional apps, AI tools don't have a defined security boundary.

IT and security teams are often left reactively responding to AI adoption, rather than proactively managing it. Traditional policy-based approaches struggle with AI adoption because:

* AI applications are rapidly being created, making static allow/deny lists ineffective.
* Employees often switch between personal and corporate AI use, further blurring enforcement.
* Many AI models are embedded inside other platforms, making detection and control even harder.

This results in inconsistent governance, where security teams are faced with the challenge of defining and enforcing policies in an environment that doesn't have clear usage boundaries.

As AI regulations tighten, visibility and control over AI adoption will be mandatory and no longer optional. Organizations must track usage, detect risks, and flag sensitive data exposure before compliance pressures mount. Proactive monitoring today lays the foundation for AI governance tomorrow.

## **DLP Can't Keep Up With the Browser**

Legacy Data Loss Prevention systems were designed for email and endpoints—not for today's browser-heavy workflows. The browser has become the primary channel for data movement, yet traditional DLP solutions can only see where network traffic is sent, not the actual destination application handling the data.

Modern data exfiltration risks include:

* Pasting API keys into browser-based tools
* Uploading documents to personal Google Drive
* Copy-pasting customer data into AI assistants

Even well-meaning employees can unintentionally leak IP when switching between work and personal accounts—something legacy tools can't detect.

With more data moving through the browser than ever before, DLP must evolve to recognize application context, user actions, and business intent. A unified browser-based DLP model would give security teams the ability to apply consistent data protection policies across all destinations while enforcing controls on high-risk actions.

## **The Extension Problem No One's Watching**

Despite minimal technical evolution over the years, browser extensions now have unprecedented access to sensitive organizational data and user identities. While security teams rigorously manage software updates, patches, and endpoint security policies, extensions remain an attack surface often overlooked in traditional security frameworks. During their user data research, the Keep Aware team found:

* **46%** of extensions serve productivity use cases.
* **20%** fall into lifestyle categories—like shopping or social plugins.
* **10%** are classified as high or critical risk due to excessive permissions.

Permissions that enable full-page access, session tracking, or network interception are still far too common—even in extensions downloaded from trusted marketplaces.

As extensions continue to serve as both productivity tools and security liabilities, enterprises must implement stronger review processes, visibility controls, and proactive defenses to secure the browser from th...
