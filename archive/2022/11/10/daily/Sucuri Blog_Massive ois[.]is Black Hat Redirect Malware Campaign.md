![Massive ois[.]is Black Hat Redirect Malware Campaign Targets WordPress Sites](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_PHP-Login-Stealer-820x386.png)

Since September 2022, our research team has tracked a surge in WordPress malware redirecting website visitors to fake Q&A sites via **ois[.]is**. These malicious redirects appear to be designed to increase the authority of the attacker’s sites for search engines.

[PublicWWW results](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22ois.is%22/) show nearly **15,000 websites** have been affected by this malware so far. Our own SiteCheck scanner has detected these redirects on over **2,500 sites** during September and October. According to data from our internal cleanups, the file structure of each affected website contains a great deal of infected files — nearly **20,000** detections in total.

What makes this campaign especially unusual is that attackers are found to be promoting a handful of fake low quality Q&A sites.

In this post, we’ll be analysing what this infection does, how the malicious redirects work, and how to mitigate risk and clean up the malware.

## Overview

[Malicious SEO redirects](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/05/malicious-redirects.html) can be described as malware designed to hijack a website in order to abuse its resources (especially website traffic and rankings). Attackers are often found promoting spam for [pharma](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/06/find-fix-wordpress-pharma-hack.html), [essay writing services](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/08/a-short-history-of-essay-spam-how-we-got-from-pills-to-plagiarism.html), knockoff designer products — or in this case, fake Q&A sites.

Redirects to spam websites are nothing new. In fact, [over 50%](https://sucuri.net/reports/2021-hacked-website-report/) of the malware Sucuri cleaned last year was SEO spam. Furthermore, spam accounted for over one third of all malware detections from our [SiteCheck](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) tool. That said, spam *redirects* in particular are not as common with just over 13% of all SEO spam infections classified as a malicious redirect.

## Analysis of malicious ois[.]is redirects

Some website malware infections limit themselves to a small number of files, often to limit their footprint and avoid detection. This malware is the opposite — with on average over **100 files** infected per website.

Let’s take a look at some of the most common infection locations.

### Commonly infected files

The most commonly affected files are core WordPress files, however this malware is also found to infect malicious **.php** files created by other unrelated malware campaigns.

Here are the top 10 most commonly infected files.

* ./wp-signup.php
* ./wp-cron.php
* ./wp-links-opml.php
* ./wp-settings.php
* ./wp-comments-post.php
* ./wp-mail.php
* ./xmlrpc.php
* ./wp-activate.php
* ./wp-trackback.php
* ./wp-blog-header.php

Our research team has also seen instances where the infection was found in random or pseudo-legitimate file names, including:

* RVbCGlEjx6H.php
* lfojmd.php
* wp-newslet.php
* wp-ver.php
* wp-logln.php

Since the malware intertwines itself with the core operations of WordPress the redirect is able to execute itself in the browsers of whomever visits the site.

### Evasive techniques

Next, let’s take a look at the malware itself.

Here’s an example of the malicious code found injected into the main **index.php** file of an infected WordPress environment:
