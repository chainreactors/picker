When a Kh-22 missile slammed into a residential apartment block in the city of Dnipro on January 14, it killed [nearly 50 civilians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/19/dnipro-victims-building-missile-strike/) and wounded dozens more. It was one of the largest such attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine which Russian President Vladimir Putin launched one year ago today.

Russia’s destruction of residential buildings, hospitals, schools  and power infrastructure have been widely reported in the period since.

Speaking at an awards ceremony on December 8 Putin, champagne glass in hand, [acknowledged and sought to justify](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63907803) Russia’s campaign to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in what was widely [considered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism) to be a bid to break the country’s resolve. So far, those ambitions have failed.

But as Bellingcat’s project to map and log incidents of civilian harm in Ukraine shows, many other facets of civilian life have also been attacked.

They are the bus stops where people wait at the start of a working day, the playgrounds where they take their children and the post offices where mail parcels and letters are processed. Open source imagery – videos and photos from Ukraine, collected and verified by Bellingcat’s Global Authentication Project – tell the story of these key amenities and the citizens killed while using them.

Each of the codes given in brackets corresponds to a verified incident on Bellingcat’s TimeMap, which you can explore further [here](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/). At the time of publication, more than a thousand incidents are recorded on the map.

## **Heading to Work**

Ukraine’s metro systems, which tunnel deep beneath three of its largest cities, have sheltered thousands of civilians during Russian attacks. They’re [emblematic of the country’s resilience](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/12/ukraine-russia-war-kyiv-metro-transit-shelter-missiles/), despite also being a target themselves on a number of occasions. But above ground, tram, trolleybus and bus stops can be far riskier – single strikes can and have killed dozens of commuters who congregate on the side of a street.

One small group was waiting outside Kharkiv’s Pedagogical University on the morning of July 20 (**[CIV1195](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/?id=CIV1195)**). They stood at the Barabashova Street bus stop, at the intersection of two busy streets. They’d have [had a view](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pedahohichnyi%2BUniversity/%4050.0227848%2C36.3186171%2C1127m/data%3D%213m1%211e3%214m12%211m5%213m4%212zNTDCsDAxJzE5LjYiTiAzNsKwMTknMDYuMCJF%218m2%213d50.02212%214d36.318336%213m5%211s0x4127a767e4c0491b%3A0xa5dc462c5c97005e%218m2%213d50.022703%214d36.318603%2116s/g/1s04bh1dm) of the Vesuvalny canal, which flows into the Kharkiv River and then through the centre of Ukraine’s second-largest city.

All were killed at 9:30 AM by what the authorities [said](https://t.me/prokuratura_kharkiv/5015) was an ‘Uragan’ multiple launch system. According to the prosecutor, among the victims were a 72-year old woman, a 13-year old boy and his 15-year old sister. Photos [shared](https://kh.vgorode.ua/ukr/news/sobytyia/a1213624-zjavilisja-foto-z-mistsja-rankovoho-obstrilu-kharkova-20-lipnja) by local media show the skeleton of the metal bus stop and a number of bodies.

Similar stories can be found across Ukraine.

For example, on the afternoon of March 15, three people sat in heavy coats in a bus shelter outside the town of Velyka Dymerka, just north of Kyiv (**[CIV0373](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/?id=CIV0373)**). They were huddled in heavy coats, as is normal for Ukraine in March.

What happened next was captured on what appears to be CCTV footage. First, an orange flash can be seen behind a row of trees in the distance. The explosions come closer. One strikes just in front of the bus shelter and another behind. One of those waiting makes a move just before smoke fills the bottom half of the screen. Another figure runs out of sight.

This video was [published](https://t.me/insiderUKR/26083) on the InsiderUA Telegram channel. It is unclear whether any of the people featured survived. The local outlet BrovaryMedia [commented](https://www.facebook.com/brovarymedia/videos/1075495899963926/) under a Facebook post of the same footage that police had been unable to retrieve the bodies given that the town was occupied by Russian forces at the time of the event. According to [reporting](https://gazeta.ua/articles/reportage/_susidiv-zakatuvali-v-pogrebi-izdivalisya-a-todi-puli-pustili-v-golovi-yak-velika-dimerka-perezhila-rosijsku-okupaciyu/1085386) by Gazeta.UA, Velyka Dymerka was liberated on April 1.

The next month in an area of the Donetsk Region under government control, 10 workers stood in front of a bus at a platform at the massive Avdiivka Coke Plant. It was the end of their shift. [CCTV footage](https://t.me/UA_National_Police/3677) shows an explosion almost directly in front of them. The screen soon fills with smoke. Citing police statements, the news website LB.UA [wrote](https://rus.lb.ua/society/2022/05/04/515696_okkupanti_ubili_avdeevke_7.html) that seven workers were killed and 19 wounded in this May 4 attack. In press images, broken glass and bloodstains can be seen over the tarmac. Police shared an image of a munition fragment consistent with a [BM-21 rocket](https://www.military-today.com/artillery/grad.htm).

As Russia’s invasion has dragged on, such attacks have continued. Extremely graphic images appeared online following an attack on a Mykolaiv bus stop on July 29 (**[CIV1235](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/?id=CIV1235)**). [Seven](https://t.me/senkevichonline/1865)[were killed](https://t.me/senkevichonline/1847) and 19 hospitalised in this attack, according to the city’s mayor Oleg Senekevich.
