## Full-Face Masks to Frustrate Identification

[This](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7270576541816745985/) is going to be interesting.

It’s a video of someone trying on a variety of printed full-face masks. They won’t fool anyone for long, but will survive casual scrutiny. And they’re cheap and easy to swap.

They don’t survive in-person scrutinity, but video cameras? no contest. *Maybe* if you zoom directly to the face with HD video.

Considering that the (alleged) ceo killer fooled all the face recognition both AI and human with a surgical mask, and only got ID’d because he took it off, once, in a taxi, it seems a surgical mask would be Good Enough.

Now if you could get custom face masks of this type you could arrange for someone else to get ID’d. Generate lots of false positives in the system.

In the sales lit, they also mention that they work like headbands or hats, so you could wear it bunched it up for immediate deployment or storage.

We’ll figure out new handshakes.

They will also confound automated camera surveillance quite easily. I suspect it won’t be difficult to train a NN to recognize them as a mask but that won’t help identify the person.

This does fool people up close.

Not a silver bullet for countering the surveilance state… haven’t firms willing to sell to law enforcement been working on automated height and weight analysis and gait analysis for years?

That’s right, besides the mask, you also need to wear high heels and a fat suit and put rocks in your shoes… although maybe high heels will be enough of a change you don’t need the rocks to change your gait?

(half joking)

I bet there will be “Luigi’s” masks like that will be offered very quickly…

And that’s a security nightmare for those willing to do mass surveillance.

As far as gait analysis, Corey Doctorow wrote a book including this (surprising, I know). Little Brother. Rocks in the shoes is a legitimate strategy

@ ALL,

**We know Bio-Metrics are a busy so why?**

The answer is people on mass either believe inately or for other reasons,

“If you’ve nothing to hide…”

History tells us otherwise, but as nearly always if it requires even a tiny amount of effort most will abdicate responsibility, not just for their safety but the safety of their friends and loved ones.

Part of the reason this abdication is not just initially possible is,

“It’s a numbers game, in a target rich environment.”

Hence the implicit,

“It’ll not happen to me as I’m not prominent or noticeable enough.”

Is actually rather idiotic, when the supposed leaders are actually interested in,

“Justice being ‘seen to be done’ rather than ‘actually being done’.”

It’s part of that numpty “strong man” nonsense all to many run to fall inline with rather than use critical thinking. All the numpty has to actually have is a flag to wrap themselves up in and a drum for people to march to the beat of.

Get enough “tin pot / toy soldiers” to march up and down in cheap shirts and all of a sudden people just hand you power, because it’s easier for them to abdicate responsibility. It’s why we have the saying,

“First they came for the…”

Which is the start of a poem that ends in

“Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me.”

Written by Pastor Martin Niemöller about a time in history when people abdicated their responsibilities and turned to “strong men” to save them.

Forgetting the fact that those “strong men” were never going to solve the problems they claimed they would, because if they did they would loose the power they craved. So they would create endless excuses or endless “Wars On…” etc.

I mention George Orwell from time to time and that people should read and understand not just “1984” but as importantly “Animal Farm”.

As for “The Great American Dream” how many understand how it can not achieve, and worse the “nightmares hidden within”?

@Clive
Good to see your ticker still ticking
