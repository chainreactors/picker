# FAQ: How does ThreatDown ransomware rollback work?

August 2, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

As the old cybersecurity saying goes: “It’s not if, but when.”

Everyone and their grandma have repeated this foreboding maxim about the nature of ransomware attacks, but sadly, that doesn’t make it any less true. Time and again we’re reminded that ransomware can slip past even the best defenses.

Prevention alone, it seems, can only take us so far—so when ransomware hits, organizations need a way to emerge safely from the fallout, data intact.

Enter Malwarebytes Ransomware Rollback, which rescues your data from encryption by effectively “turning back the clock” of a ransomware attack. Dr. Strange style.

But how does it work, exactly? And what are some of the advanced settings that are available?

Let’s dive into the finer details in this post.

## How It Works

The bedrock of Ransomware Rollback is a kernel mode driver to monitor file system changes and make a copy of files before modification. This includes self-protection against attack to the backups.

Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) first spends a 14-day period learning what applications on the system can be trusted. During this time, it logs the various applications that typically interact with files. After this period, the EDR establishes a list of trusted, or “whitelisted,” applications.

ThreatDown Ransomware Rollback can revert any ransomware changes up to 7 days

For performance optimization, an application that is on the whitelist is ignored.

Before any application can make any changes, apart from ignored applications, ThreatDown EDR saves a backup copy of the file it’s trying to modify. It is unknown at the time of modification whether a process is malicious, so every file is backed up.

If the application is later found to be ransomware that encrypts the file, making it unreadable and demanding a ransom for its decryption, the EDR system can use the backup copy it saved to restore the file to its previous state. This is what is meant by “rollback.”

When all’s said and done, the system effectively nullifies the ransomware attack by ensuring a recent clean, unencrypted copy of the file is always available.

## FAQ

### Does ransomware rollback use Volume Shadow Copy Service?

No, ransomware rollback does not use Volume Shadow Copy Service. Instead, it uses proprietary and patent-pending technology, with protected folders as malware often targets the Volume Shadow Copy Service.

### How does the service know which files to restore, is it a snapshot?

Backups are continuous, for any files modified, and are not a snapshot

The process making the change is recorded for each file. Subsequently when a rollback is performed, it is precise because only files modified by the specific process are restored.

### Where is the rollback cache stored in the system?

The rollback cache is stored in a hidden Windows system folder. Typically, you can find it under: C:ProgramDataMalwarebytes Endpoint AgentPluginsEDRPluginBackup.

### Does ransomware rollback always use some amount of disk space? Why is that?

Yes, ransomware rollback always uses some disk space due to its buffer and cleanup operations. This means there will always be some small disk space used by the feature.

For every file modified, e.g., documents, pictures, etc., space for a copy is required. If there is no activity, then after a few days there would be zero used. However, if ransomware encrypted 10 Gb of files, then there would be 10 Gb of backup/before copies.

### How much space does the rollback cache take up on a typical laptop or desktop?

On a typical laptop using common applications like Microsoft Offic...
