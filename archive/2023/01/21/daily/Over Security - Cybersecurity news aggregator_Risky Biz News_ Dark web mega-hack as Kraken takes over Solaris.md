The administrators of the Kraken dark web marketplace have hacked and taken over the infrastructure of Solaris, one of their rivals.

The hack came to light on January 13 when the Solaris market started redirecting visitors to the Kraken portal, where they were greeted by a message from the Kraken admins claiming to have taken over Solaris infrastructure, cryptocurrency wallets, and source code repositories.

Blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, which [documented](https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/friday-the-13th-on-the-dark-web-150-million-russian-drug-market-solaris-hacked-by-rival-market-kraken/) and confirmed the hack, says Solaris was one of the largest drug markets on the dark web last year, processing around $150 million in sales of drugs and other illegal goods and services in its short lifespan.

Elliptic says the market was closely associated with Killnet, a pro-Kremlin hacktivist group, although it's unclear if the group was also in charge of the market itself.

[In December last year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2022/12/22/russian-dark-web-drug-market-hacked-by-ukrainian-bitcoin-donated-to-kyiv-charity/), Alex Holden, a US security researcher with Ukrainian roots, claimed to have hacked Solaris and stolen $25,000 worth of cryptocurrency, which he later donated to Ukrainian charity organizations.

Elliptic believes this initial hack attracted the attention of the Kraken administrators and led to Solaris' demise.

But unlike Holden's intrusion, motivated by the Russian-Ukrainian war, Elliptic says the new Kraken admins are also pro-Kremlin group, so the hack is unlikely to be politically motivated.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**PayPal data breach:** Payments processor PayPal says it fell victim to a credential-stuffing attack in early December last year. According to a data [breach notification letter](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/766753f1-f9c7-4dc5-9a5c-fe0f3ff51c06.shtml) filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, the incident impacted almost 35,000 user accounts, where hackers gained access using legitimate login credentials. PayPal said that despite the breaches, it did not find any unauthorized transactions in the breached accounts following an investigation.

**Mailchimp data breach:** Email delivery service Mailchimp says that one of its support employees was compromised, and hackers accessed account data on 133 of its customers. [Mailchimp says](https://mailchimp.com/january-2023-security-incident/) the hack took place on January 11 and its security team managed to isolate the compromised employee account a day later on the 12th. According to *[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/18/mailchimp-hacked/)*, one of the 133 compromised Mailchimp accounts belonged to WooCommerce, a division inside Automattic that's behind the eponymous WordPress e-commerce plugin. The incident marks the second time Mailchimp got hacked in a year after threat actors also breached its systems last August. [At the time](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-programmers-will-need), the hackers used their access to Mailchimp to send out phishing emails to customers of cloud hosting company Digital Ocean and multiple cryptocurrency platforms.

**Yum! Brands ransomware attack:** Fast food corporation Yum! Brands says it suffered a ransomware attack this week that forced it to close nearly 300 restaurants across the United Kingdom. In a [press release](https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/news/company-stories/Yum%2BBrands%2BJanuary%2B18%2B2023%2BStatement) on Wednesday, the company says that it has since resumed operations at the affected locations and it expects to restore affected IT systems in the "coming days."

**Royal Mail ransomware attack:** Royal Mail [says](https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5317/related/1) it has resumed international parcel and letters shipping after its recent ransomware attack.

**Midas Capital crypto-heist:** DeFi platform Midas Capital lost $660,000 worth of crypto assets following a flash-loan attack [earlier this week](https://twitter.com/MidasCapitalxyz/status/1615407372402585601). Obligatory and almostcertainly illegal [tweet](https://archive.ph/PkRqT) asking the hacker to get in contact and negotiate a "bounty" to return the funds.

**Thoreum Finance crypto-heist:** Cryptocurrency platform Thoreum Finance says that a threat actor exploited a vulnerability in one of its smart contracts and stole 3100 BNB coins, estimated at around $900,000. An [analysis](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/iswp1ig_rtzld06p7nd16g) of the hack is available via Numen Labs.
