The recently disclosed [critical Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/critical-microsoft-sharepoint-flaw.html) has been under exploitation as early as July 7, 2025, according to findings from Check Point Research.

The cybersecurity company [said](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/sharepoint-zero-day-cve-2025-53770-actively-exploited-what-security-teams-need-to-know/) it observed first exploitation attempts targeting an unnamed major Western government, with the activity intensifying on July 18 and 19, spanning government, telecommunications, and software sectors in North America and Western Europe.

Check Point also said the exploitation efforts originated from three different IP addresses – 104.238.159[.]149, 107.191.58[.]76, and 96.9.125[.]147 – one of which was previously tied to the weaponization of security flaws in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) appliances ([CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/chinese-hackers-exploit-ivanti-epmm.html)).

"We're witnessing an urgent and active threat: a critical zero-day in SharePoint on-prem is being exploited in the wild, putting thousands of global organizations at risk," Lotem Finkelstein, Director of Threat Intelligence at Check Point Research, told The Hacker News.

"Our team has confirmed dozens of compromise attempts across government, telecom, and tech sectors since July 7. We strongly urge enterprises to update their security systems immediately – this campaign is both sophisticated and fast-moving."

The attack chains have been observed leveraging CVE-2025-53770, a newly patched remote code execution flaw in SharePoint Server, and chaining it with CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft as part of its July 2025 Patch Tuesday update, to gain initial access and escalate privileges.

It's worth mentioning at this stage that there are two sets of vulnerabilities in SharePoint that have come to light this month -

* [**CVE-2025-49704**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49704) (CVSS score: 8.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)
* [**CVE-2025-49706**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49706) (CVSS score: 6.5) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability (Fixed on July 8, 2025)

* [**CVE-2025-53770**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770) (CVSS score: 9.8) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
* [**CVE-2025-53771**](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53771) (CVSS score: 6.5) - Microsoft SharePoint Server Spoofing Vulnerability

CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, collectively referred to as ToolShell, is an exploitation chain that can lead to remote code execution on SharePoint Server instances. They were [originally disclosed](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2025/5/16/pwn2own-berlin-2025-day-two-results) by Viettel Cyber Security during the Pwn2Own 2025 hacking competition earlier this May.

CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, which became public knowledge over the weekend, have been described as variants of CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, respectively, indicating that they are bypasses for the original fixes put in place by Microsoft earlier this month.

This is evidenced by the fact that Microsoft [acknowledged](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/microsoft-releases-urgent-patch-for.html) active attacks exploiting "vulnerabilities partially addressed by the July Security Update." The company also noted in its advisories that the updates for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 include "more robust protections" than the updates for CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706. However, it bears noting that CVE-2025-53771 has not been flagged by Redmond as actively exploited in the wild.

"CVE-2025-53770 exploits a weakness in how Microsoft SharePoint Server handles the deserialization of untrusted data," Martin Zugec, technical solutions director at Bitdefender, [said](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/bitdefender-advisory-rce-vulnerability-microsoft-sharepoint-server-cve-2025-53770ce). "Attackers are leveraging this flaw to gain unauthenticated remote code execution."

This, in turn, is achieved by deploying malicious ASP.NET web shells that programmatically extract sensitive cryptographic keys. These stolen keys are subsequently leveraged to craft and sign malicious \_\_VIEWSTATE payloads, thereby establishing persistent access and enabling the execution of arbitrary commands on SharePoint Server.

According to Bitdefender telemetry, in-the-wild exploitation has been detected in the United States, Canada, Austria, Jordan, Mexico, Germany, South Africa, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, suggesting widespread abuse of the flaw.

Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, in its own analysis of the campaign, said it observed commands being run to execute a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which creates a file at the location "C:\PROGRA~1\COMMO...
