## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Brand Fish Sauce

Squid Brand is a Thai company that makes [fish sauce](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2023/07/24/thailand-s-squid-brand-capitalising-on-trending-flavours-and-personalised-healthy-options-to-stay-on-top):

> It is part of Squid Brand’s range of “personalized healthy fish sauces” that cater to different consumer groups, which include the Mild Fish Sauce for Kids and Mild Fish Sauce for Silver Ages.

It also has a Vegan Fish Sauce.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Are you sitting comfortably?

Then this might make you laugh,

@ ALL,

Google claim, adding new algorithm so FIDO will eventually be safe from quantum computers… But at what price?

<https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/passkeys-are-great-but-not-safe-from-quantum-computers-dilithium-could-change-that/>

Spot,

> *“While quantum attacks are still in the distant future, deploying cryptography at Internet scale is a massive undertaking which is why doing it as early as possible is vital,” Elie Bursztein and Fabian Kaczmarczyck, cybersecurity and AI research director, and software engineer, respectively, at Google wrote. “In particular, for security keys this process is expected to be gradual **as users will have to acquire new ones** once FIDO has standardized post-quantum cryptography resilient cryptography and this new standard is supported by major browser vendors.”*

So I guess they are kind of saying your current FIDO “security keys” are close to worthless now “Google has spoken”…

@ ALL,

I realy do not know what to make of this,

“Study suggests inflammation drives social media use”

> *“Across three studies involving more than 1,800 participants, the findings—published in the journal Brain, Behavior and Immunity—indicate that increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which the liver makes in response to inflammation in the body, can promote social media use among middle-aged adults and college students.”*

Phishers have discovered that using QR codes to send links to click on bypasses email security filters.

@ Bruce and the usual suspects,

Though a bit technical to read, this research is going to also move into helping surveillance technology as well as UAV target tracking,

“Dynamic Target Tracking of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Under Unpredictable Disturbances”

> *“The research article presents a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of estimating target velocities, image depth estimation, and tracking stability in the presence of external disturbances.”*

@ ALL,

Re : Another software with agency kills article.

It appears “insiders” are reporting that “Managment ignored” a serious issue that the Tesla Autopilot was not designed to respond to cross traffic.

Which was the root cause of both a death in 2016 and later in another tractor-trailer cross traffic crash in 2019.

One of Tesla’s engineers said,

> *“[H]e investigated Brown’s 2016 death as part of his job, and alleged that despite Tesla thus knowing about the issue “no changes were made to Autopilot’s systems to account for cross traffic.”*

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Compression as the new Enryption**

Whilst most do not think of it that way, compression algorithms “flatten the statistics” of plaintext which is usuall considered one of the two functions of encryption.

Whilst compression functions, like hash functions, are “unkeyed” it would not be that difficult to modify the function “output” to make it keyed.

However a couple of centuries back people still tried to rely on only the method of encryption being unknown to an adversary to hide information.

Well it appears to be back in favour,for hiding malware in Android APKs,

“Thousands of Android APKs use compression trick to thwart analysis”

> *“Threat actors increasingly distribute malicious Android APKs (packaged app installers) that resist decompilation using unsupported, unknown, or heavily tweaked compression algorithms.”*

@ WhatsOldIsNew,

Re : QR Code hooked phishing attacks

For those that don’t want to or can not do “slashdot”, I gave the “Bleepingcomputer” link to the story,

<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/major-us-energy-org-targeted-in-qr-code-phishing-attack/>

And a little commentary about how QR Codes appears to be increasingly used, yesyerday on last weeks Squid page,
