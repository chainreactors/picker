On the heels of this year’s highly successful open data and AI [announcement](https://news.sap.com/2023/05/sap-google-cloud-expanded-partnership-open-data-ai-enterprises/) between SAP and Google Cloud, we’re excited to join and meet many of you at Google Cloud Next ’23 in San Francisco next week.  My colleagues and I look forward to showcasing the expanded partnership with SAP Datasphere, Google BigQuery and Vertex AI, which simplifies data landscapes and unleashes the power of business data.  You’ll find more information on the partnership below.

We’ve seen strong interest in the offering on this [community](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/08/02/drive-business-innovation-using-sap-and-google-cloud-data-platforms/) alone, and we’re presenting sessions at Next on a variety of topics:  from data & analytics, to sustainability, to process automation, to RISE with SAP on Google Cloud.  For those of you planning your Next agenda, here are the SAP-led sessions, in chronological order:
