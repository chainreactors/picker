Efficient SOC: How to Detect and Solve Incidents Faster

SOCs face constant pressure**.** Heavy workloads, poor threat visibility, and disconnected tools introduce delays in detection and response, which may lead to financial loss and operational disruptions for the business.

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=faster_incident_response&utm_term=170925&utm_content=linktolanding) helps over [15K security teams](https://any.run/enterprise/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=faster_incident_response&utm_term=170925&utm_content=linktoenterprisepage) to solve this challenge by empowering them to quickly detect, analyze, and understand threats, so they can respond faster and with confidence.

Here’s how your SOC can handle incidents efficiently and **save up to 21 minutes per case**.

## **Spot More Threats in Real Time**

Many SOCs struggle with delayed detection due to static analysis tools and manual research that takes hours. By the time an attack is confirmed, it may have already spread across the network, increasing the cost and complexity of response.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-5-1024x566.png)

ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=faster_incident_response&utm_term=170925&utm_content=linktosandboxlanding) tackles this problem by providing a **real-time virtual environment**, allowing teams to observe malware behavior as it unfolds. Suspicious files, URLs, and scripts are detonated in cloud VMs, giving immediate insights into their actions, without risking production systems or waiting for the analysis to finish.

The result is fast knowledge of the threat and a **clear understanding of the response steps** needed to contain and mitigate it.

**Results SOCs like yours achieve**

* **Faster MTTD:** Get answers in minutes, not hours, with **88% of attacks visible within 60 seconds** of analysis.

* **Higher detection rate:** See more with a **36% detection rate increase** on average.

## **Identify Low-Detection Attacks with Speed and Ease**

For cases with evasive threats, the sandbox equips SOC teams with [the interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/). It lets them identify attacks that beat the majority of standard detection systems by simulating user actions right inside the VM.

The common threats exposed with interactive analysis include:

* Multi-stage malware

* Payloads hidden in email attachments

* CAPTCHA-protected phishing pages

* Malicious links in [QR codes](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/qr-extractor/)

By opening, downloading, running, and performing other activities to trigger the attack chain, analysts can force threats to reveal themselves in seconds, cutting the time to the response stage.

Thanks to the ANY.RUN sandbox’s intuitive interface, most of the investigations can be done by junior analysts without assistance from senior professionals. This results in a continuous team-wide expertise growth and better decision-making.

**Results SOCs like yours achieve**

* **Fewer missed threats:** Find hidden attacks that most tools skip with up to **58% more threats identified overall**.

* **Efficient triage and response:** Enable junior staff to handle more incidents on their own with **30% reduction in Tier 1 to Tier 2 escalations**.

## **Automate Repetitive Work to Free Up Analysts**

Alert fatigue ranks as number one challenge for SOC teams. It not only slows down response times but also increases the risk of human error, leaving gaps in defense.
