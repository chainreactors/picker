Turning this into a suitable Name that Ware-style entry was a bit tough, but I think maybe I hit a balance between leaving enough clues, and giving it away. We’ll see shortly!

I have a lot more to say about this ware: I will give proper attribution once the ware has been guessed (or the end of the month, whichever is sooner); but let’s just say I was incredibly pleased to find such detailed images in the public domain.

   It’s marking says AMD M74AP, I think I found the original picture: <https://mobile.twitter.com/johnycsh/status/1592789152822865926/photo/1>

   But searching for the part doesn’t show much. My guess is that it’s and ATI M74 GPU used in ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT. It’s from 2007 so I believe the date code matches as well.

   As the link from Taylan also shows the number 216-0905018 which, after a bit of searching seems to be a Radeon 540 used in e.g. Samsung Notebook 9 Pro NP940X5M.
   I guess the M74AP.00 is a batch marking (as it is different on the other 216-0905018s I have found photos of) and 1807 is 2018, week 7.
