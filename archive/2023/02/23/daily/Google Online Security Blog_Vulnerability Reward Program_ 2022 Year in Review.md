February 22, 2023

Posted by Sarah Jacobus, Vulnerability Rewards Team

It has been another incredible year for the Vulnerability Reward Programs (VRPs) at Google! Working with security researchers throughout 2022, we have been able to identify and fix over 2,900 security issues and continue to make our products more secure for our users around the world.

We are thrilled to see significant year-over-year growth for our VRPs, and have had yet another record-breaking year for our programs! In 2022 we awarded over $12 million in bounty rewards – with researchers donating over $230,000 to a charity of their choice.

As in [past years](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/02/vulnerability-reward-program-2021-year.html), we are sharing our 2022 Year in Review statistics across all of our programs. We would like to give a special thank you to all of our dedicated researchers for their continued work with our programs - we look forward to more collaboration in the future!

**Android and Devices**

The Android VRP had an incredible record breaking year in 2022 with $4.8 million in rewards and the highest paid report in Google VRP history of $605,000!

In our continued effort to ensure the security of Google device users, we have expanded the scope of Android and Google Devices in our program and are now incentivizing vulnerability research in the latest versions of Google Nest and Fitbit! For more information on the latest program version and qualifying vulnerability reports, please visit our [public rules page](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/6171833274204160/android-and-google-devices-security-reward-program-rules).

We are also excited to share that the invite-only Android Chipset Security Reward Program (ACSRP) - a private vulnerability reward program offered by Google in collaboration with manufacturers of Android chipsets - rewarded $486,000 in 2022 and received over 700 valid security reports.

We would like to give a special shoutout to some of our top researchers, whose continued hard work helps to keep Android safe and secure:

* Submitting an impressive 200+ vulnerabilities to the Android VRP this year, Aman Pandey of [Bugsmirror](https://bugsmirror.com) remains one of our program’s top researchers. Since submitting their first report in 2019, Aman has reported more than 500 vulnerabilities to the program. Their hard work helps ensure the safety of our users; a huge thank you for all of their hard work!
  * [Zinuo Han](https://twitter.com/ele7enxxh) of OPPO Amber Security Lab quickly rose through our program’s ranks, becoming one of our top researchers. In the last year they have identified 150 valid vulnerabilities in Android.
    * Finding yet another critical exploit chain, gzobqq submitted our highest valued exploit to date.
      * Yu-Cheng Lin (林禹成) ([@AndroBugs](https://twitter.com/AndroBugs)) remains one of our top researchers submitting just under 100 reports this year.

**Chrome**

Chrome VRP had another unparalleled year, receiving 470 valid and unique security bug reports, resulting in a total of $4 million of VRP rewards. Of the $4M, $3.5 million was rewarded to researchers for 363 reports of security bugs in Chrome Browser and nearly $500,000 was rewarded for 110 reports of security bugs in ChromeOS.

This year, Chrome VRP re-evaluated and refactored the [Chrome VRP reward amounts](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5745167867576320/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#reward-amounts) to increase the reward amounts for the most exploitable and harmful classes and types of security bugs, as well as added a new category for memory corruption bugs in highly privileged processes, such as the GPU and network process, to incentivize research in these critical areas. The Chrome VRP increased the [fuzzer bonuses](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5745167867576320/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#fuzzer-bonus) for reports from VRP-submitted fuzzers running on the Google ClusterFuzz infrastructure as part of the [Chrome Fuzzing program](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5745167867576320/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#chrome-fuzzer-program)*.* A new [bisect bonus](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5745167867576320/chrome-vulnerability-reward-program-rules#bisect-bonus) was introduced for bisections performed as part of the bug report submission, which helps the security team with our triage and bug reproduction.

2023 will be the year of experimentation in the Chrome VRP! Please keep a lookout for announcements of experiments and potential bonus opportunities for Chrome Browser and ChromeOS security bugs.

The entire Chrome team sincerely appreciates the contributions of all our researchers in 2022 who helped keep Chrome Browser, ChromeOS, and all the browsers and software based on Chromium secure for billions of users across the globe.

In addition to [posting](https://twitter.com/GoogleVRP/status/1466865149655109641) about our Top 0-22 Researchers in 2022, Chrome VRP would like to specifically acknowledge some specific researcher achievements made in 2022:

* Rory McNamara, a six-year participant in Chrome VRP as a ChromeOS researcher, became the highest rewarded researcher of all time in the Chrome VRP. Most impressive is that Rory has achieved this in a total of only 40 security bug submissions, demonstrating just how impactful his findings have been - from [ChromeOS persistent root command execution](https://crbug.com/915541), resulting in a $75,000 reward back in 2018, to his *many* reports of root privilege escalation both with and without persistence. Rory was also kind enough to speak at the Chrome Security Summit in 2022 to share his experiences participating in the Chrome VRP over the years. Thank you, Rory!* SeongHwan Park (SeHwa), a participant in the Chrome VRP since mid-2021, has been an amazing contributor of ANGLE / GPU security bug reports in 2022 with 11 solid quality reports of GPU bugs earning them a spot on Chrome VRP 2022 [top researchers](https://twitter.com/GoogleVRP/status/1466865149655109641) list. Thank you, SeHwa!
