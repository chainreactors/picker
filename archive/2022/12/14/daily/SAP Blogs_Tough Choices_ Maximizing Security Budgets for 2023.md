There are frameworks such as Factor Analysis of Information Risk ([FAIR](https://www.fairinstitute.org/)) for a quantitative model to manage risk, [such as implemented at SAP and described in this recent article.](https://www.sap.com/insights/viewpoints/how-to-spend-your-cybersecurity-budget.html) This helps articulate security risks into financial terms and helps articulate how security investments remediate those risks in order to optimize security budgets.

However, with budgets for 2023 generally smaller than expected, there is no time to put such a framework in place if it isn’t already. You may have only weeks to prioritize what security programs you can execute. Therefore, I’d like to share three key points of practical advice that you can apply in your planning in the coming weeks.

# Cloud Transformation is an Imperative

The uncertainty in the economy and geopolitical climate is paired with ongoing digital- and cloud transformation that is not going to stop and is becoming more critical than ever. In good economic times, cloud transformation is challenging, but budgetary pressures make it worse.

However, budget pressure also poses an opportunity and added incentive to accelerate this transformation rather than continue to execute on previous templates. The cloud poses new security challenges, but also capabilities to optimize and make use of economies of scale. Cloud transformation allows us to rethink how we do things.

# Three Key Steps to Maximize Your Security Budget

Each organization is different, but the following three steps should help you determine what to focus on and how to maximize your current investments.

1. Focus on the most critical items

2. Operationalize current offerings

3. Optimize processes

## Focus on the most critical items

In security, we are often seduced by clever new threats, exploits, and tooling we see in the industry press and social media. But we shouldn’t rate security programs by how cool they are but by how much they improve your overall security posture. Security investments should be commensurate with the business risk the organization faces and can mitigate. When budgets are tight, we must concentrate on what allows the business to operate and execute its existing security strategy.

* Assess risks by probability and impact

* Prioritize those that score high in both

* Review your secure software development lifecycle and secure operations first and foremost​​​​​​​

Esoteric risks of low probability may be compelling thought exercises but meeting compliance and regulatory requirements is almost certainly more important than protecting against sophisticated state actors.

The most common causes for security breaches in the public cloud are:​​​​​​​

1. Cloud infrastructure misconfigurations, such as public storage buckets, unintentionally internet-facing endpoints, etc.

2. Known vulnerabilities in commercial or open-source software

3. Credential and secrets leakage, whether through phishing, keys in source code, or otherwise

The priority, then, is to keep the doors locked, keep vulnerabilities under control, and keep secrets safe. We need to prevent these from happening in the development cycle as much as possible and detect and respond to findings in the deployed landscape. That is, we need to get the basics right first.

The basics include good asset inventory and associated metadata, including who to contact for the asset should there be issues. This is a difficult challenge, even more so in the middle of cloud transformation, and it is valuable to assess the data quality regularly. An alert you know about but don’t know who to direct to is likely going to remain unaddressed.

## Operationalize what you already own

[Research conducted earlier this year among RCA Conference attendees](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/08/10/cybersecurity-budgets-are-wasted-by-an-overabundance-of-tools/?sh=7eba44596e75) suggested that half of the respondents stated they have wasted more than 50% of their security budget yet they are not able to remediate threats. 43% say that their number one challenge is an overabundance of tools.

The element that is often overlooked by ...
