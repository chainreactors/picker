            READ TABLE lt_return INTO DATA(ls_return) WITH KEY type = 'S'.

             <ls_return>-status = 'User' && | | && <fs_user>-bname && | | && 'Deleted' .

          ELSE.

            ENDIF.

        ENDIF.

    ENDLOOP.

  ENDIF.

ENDFUNCTION.
```

Now execute the function module we will get the deleted users.

**NOTE:**While testing the code please comment the BAPI\_USER\_DELETE, Otherwise users would be deleted from the system.
