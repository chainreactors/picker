SaaS applications contain a wealth of sensitive data and are central to business operations. Despite this, far too many organizations rely on half measures and hope their SaaS stack will remain secure. Unfortunately, this approach is lacking and will leave security teams blind to threat prevention and detection, as well as open to regulatory violations, data leaks, and significant breaches.

If you understand the importance of SaaS security, and need some help explaining it internally to get your team's buy-in, this article is just for you — and covers:

* Why SaaS data needs to be secured
* Real-world examples of SaaS apps attacks
* The attack surface of SaaS apps
* Other types of less suitable solutions including CASB or manual audit
* ROI of an SSPM
* What to look for in the right SSPM

## What Is in Your SaaS Data?

Nearly all business operations run through SaaS. So does HR, sales, marketing, product development, legal, and finance, in fact, SaaS apps are central to nearly every business function, and the data that supports and drives those functions are stored in these cloud-based apps.

This includes sensitive customer data, employee records, intellectual property, budget plans, legal contracts, P&L statements – the list is endless.

It is true that SaaS apps are built securely, however, the shared responsibility model that ensures that SaaS vendors include the controls needed to secure an application, leaves their customers the ones who are ultimately accountable and in control of hardening their environments and making sure they are properly configured. Applications typically have hundreds of settings, and thousands of user permissions, and when admins and security teams don't fully understand the implications of settings that are unique to specific applications, it leads to risky security gaps.

## SaaS Applications ARE Under Attack

Headlines have shown that SaaS applications are getting the attention of threat actors. An attack on [Snowflake](https://www.adaptive-shield.com/blog/breach-debrief-series-snowflake-mfa-meltdown-creates-data-leak-blizzard/) led to one company exposing over 500 million customer records. A phishing campaign in [Azure Cloud](https://www.adaptive-shield.com/blog/phishing-in-azure-cloud-a-targeted-campaign-on-executive-accounts/) compromised the accounts of several senior executives. A breach at a major telecom provider exposed files containing sensitive information for over 63,000 employees.

Threats are real, and they are increasing. Cybercriminals are using brute force and password spray attacks with regularity, accessing applications that could withstand these types of attacks with an SSPM to harden access controls and an Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR) capability to detect these threats.

One breach by threat actors can have significant financial and operational repercussions. Introducing an SSPM prevents many threats from arising due to hardened configurations, and ensures ongoing operations. When coupled with a SaaS-centric ITDR solution, it provides full 360-degree protection.

## What Is the SaaS Attack Surface?

The attack surface includes a number of areas that threat actors use for unauthorized access into a company's SaaS applications.

### Misconfigurations

Misconfigured settings can allow unknown users to access applications, exfiltrate data, create new users, and interfere with business operations.

### Identity-First Security

Weak or compromised credentials can expose SaaS apps to attack. This includes not having MFA turned on, weak password requirements, broad user permissions, and permissive guest settings. This kind of poor entitlement management, especially in complex applications such as Salesforce and Workday, can lead to unnecessary access that can be exploited if the account is exposed.

The identity attack surface extends from human accounts to non-human identities (NHI). NHIs are often granted extensive permissions and are frequently unmonitored. Threat actors who can take control of these identities often have a full range of access within the application. NHIs include shadow applications, OAuth integrations, service accounts, and API Keys, and more.

Additionally, there are other attack surfaces within identity protection:

* **Identity's Devices**: High-privileged users with poor hygiene devices can expose data through malware on their device
* **Data Security**: Resources that are shared using public links are in danger of leaks. These include documents, repositories, strategic presentations, and other shared files.

### GenAI

When threat actors gain entry into an app with GenAI activated, they can use the tool to quickly find a treasure trove of sensitive data relating to company IP, strategic vision, sales data, sensitive customer information, employee data, and more.

## Can SaaS Applications Be Secured with CASBs or Manual Audits?

The answer is no. Manual audits are insufficient here. Changes happen far too rapidly, and there is too much on the line to rely on an audit conducted periodically.

CASBs, once believed to be the ideal SaaS security to...
