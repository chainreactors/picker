# Welcome to Fall, I guess?

Posted by[ericlaw](https://textslashplain.com/author/ericlaw1979/)[2024-09-162025-01-14](https://textslashplain.com/2024/09/16/welcome-to-fall-i-guess/)Posted in[life](https://textslashplain.com/category/life/), [travel](https://textslashplain.com/category/life/travel/)Tags:[cruising](https://textslashplain.com/tag/cruising/), [travel](https://textslashplain.com/tag/travel/)

Two months without a blog post? Sheesh. A lot has happened in two months, although perhaps nothing especially *interesting*.

I splurged on a new laptop, a Lenovo P1 Gen7 (22-core Ultra 9 185H and 64 gigs of memory). It’s big, heavy, and expensive, but it’s nice to have a PC that isn’t super-slow.

In July, the kids and I visited Maryland and went to Hershey Park and Tree Trekkers.

Coasters were ridden, Grandpa’s wallet was lightened

Tree Trekkers

We then joined the family on a cruise to Bermuda and [CocoCay](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cococay-cruises). The boat was the older/smaller Vision of the Seas, but we splurged on Suites and it was pretty nice. Bermuda was beautiful and we had a nice time on the beach and snorkeling.

Horseshoe Beach, Bermuda

Boat diving after Snorkeling

The Bahamas port call was a bit of a letdown, but the worst day on a beach in the Bahamas is better than most days anywhere else. The waterpark on CocoCay was a lot of fun; we took a ton of runs down Daredevils’ Peak, the tallest waterslide in North America. I look forward to going back around New Year’s.

Royal Caribbean’s Private Island

After the cruise, we headed back to Texas. Noah started 6th grade and tackle football. We all were happy to reunite with our (bigger) no-longer-kittens.

Tigra stands guard over Luna

At work, I switched from being a Group Product Manager to an Architect, and flew to Redmond for [the Windows Ecosystem Security Summit](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/09/12/taking-steps-that-drive-resiliency-and-security-for-windows-customers/). I’ll be heading back in November for another week.

Coming up? Mostly work, with some daydreaming about winter break mixed in. I’ll be running some races throughout the fall and winter — the 10K Daisy Dash, the 10 Mile Run for the Water, the Austin Half Marathon, and the Galveston Full (gulp!) Marathon.
