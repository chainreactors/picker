The Russian government is taking a page out of China's book (again) and is laying the groundwork to building a national video surveillance system that it will most likely use to keep a foot on its citizens' necks.

Citing anonymous sources, Russian news outlet [Kommersant reported](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5608376) last week that the Russian government intends to centralize and aggregate streams from video surveillance systems from all over the country to a data center it is building in Moscow.

This new national surveillance system is scheduled to launch by December 16 and will be run by the Moscow Department of Information Technology.

This is the same department that has been running [Moscow's city-wide CCTV system](https://video.dit.mos.ru/), complete with facial recognition applied to streams from more than 175,000 cameras from across 4,000 city locations—which was infamously [compromised back in 2019](https://mbk.news/suzhet/bolshoj-brat-optom-i-v-roznicu/) [*[English coverage](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/moscow-cops-sell-access-to-city-cctv-facial-recognition-data/)*].

Kremlin officials said they need to centralize streams from all over Russia in Moscow because "no region can afford full-fledged computing power to process such a volume of data" and in order to allow law enforcement agencies to crack down on increased "terrorist threats."

Authorities are most likely referring to the recent explosions across the country—signs of obvious increasing dissent—but Kommersant also points out that the same system could also be used to identify and track down draft dodgers across Russia.

The Kremlin's plan comes as reports are emerging from Russia about the government's desperation to get hold of new cannon fodder... we mean recruits... for its military force fighting in Ukraine. According to [WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/16/russia-mobilization-men/), Russian military and police forces have been seen handing out mobilization forms to men in its larger cities, in public spaces, apartment building lobbies, metro stations, malls, and even cafes and restaurants.

Until now, the vast majority of recruits have been from Russia's minority groups and its smaller cities, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by the local population, who have been fighting back by [setting local recruitment centers on fire for months](https://intellinews.com/masked-saboteurs-firebomb-army-recruitment-centre-in-russia-as-suspicious-fires-continue-to-rage-across-the-country-243498/?source=russia).

The war, already very unpopular in Russia's larger cities and cosmopolitan areas, is expected to trigger even more protests as a small inconvenience for most has suddenly turned into a matter of life and death—protests and unrest the Russian government has been trying to stay ahead in recent months by tightening internet censorship rules to "China level" and now by the centralization of all CCTV video feeds under the Kremlin's nose.

### Breaches and hacks

**Tata Power:** Tata Power, one of the largest electrical power producers in India, disclosed a security breach in a document [[PDF](https://archives.nseindia.com/corporate/TATAPOWER_14102022190039_SELetter.pdf)] filed with India's national stock exchange. The company said the incident only impacted its IT systems—which is currently in the process of restoring—and that all other critical systems are operating as normal. [*Additional coverage in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/14/india-power-company-tata-power-cyber-attack/)*]

**Woolworths breach:** Australian retail chain Woolworths said that a threat actor compromised an employee's credentials and accessed the backend of its MyDeal portal. The company is currently sending email notifications to all affected customers. Exposed data includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, and home addresses, according to a notification seen by [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-15/woolworths-mydeal-cyber-attack-hack-information-leaked/101539686).

**Advanced incident:** Advanced, one of the biggest IT providers for the UK NHS, [disclosed a security breach](https://www.digitalhealth.net/2022/10/client-data-exfiltrated-advanced-nhs-cyber-attack/) last week, admitting they had their IT network compromised following an infection with the LockBit 3.0 ransomware.

> "The threat actor initially accessed the Advanced network using legitimate third-party credentials to establish a remote desktop (RDP) session to the Staffplan Citrix server. During the initial logon session, the attacker moved laterally in Advanced's Health and Care

environment and escalated privileges, enabling them to conduct reconnaissance, and deploy encryption malware. Immediately prior to encrypting systems, the threat actor copied and exfiltrated a limited amount of data."

**DDoS attacks hit Bulgarian govt sites:**Russian hacking group KillNet claimed responsibility for a [series of DDoS attacks](https://www.svobodnaevropa.bg/a/32084652.html) that hit and took down several Bulgarian government portals, including the websites of the Bulgarian Presidency and several ministries like the Interior and Defense.

### General tech and privacy

**Microsoft didn't update driver blocklist for two years:** Microsoft has confirmed that since 2019, for more than two years, its staff has [failed to push new updates](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/how-a-microsoft-blunder-opened-millions-of-pcs-to-potent-malware-attacks/) to a [blocklist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) that would have prevented the installation of known vulnerable drivers on its Windows operating system. The company's admission comes after cybersecurity firms started noting a trend in BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) exploits, which are attacks where threat actors install and exploit a vulnerable driver to elevate their access on a system ...
