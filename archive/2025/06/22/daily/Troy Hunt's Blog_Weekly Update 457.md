# Weekly Update 457

22 June 2025

Firstly, apologies for the annoying clipping in the audio. I use a [Rode VideoMic](https://rode.com/fr/microphones/mobile/videomic-me-l?ref=troyhunt.com) that's a shotgun style that plugs straight into the iPhone and it's usually pretty solid. It was also solid when I tested it again now, just recording a video into the phone, so I don't know if this was connection related or what, but I was in no position to troubleshoot once the stream had started, unfortunately.

Moving on, it's been a ridiculously hectic week of bacb-to-back events then to top it off, we've bee dealing with crazy traffic volumes on HIBP:

> Well, that explains the traffic: 2.46M visitors to Have I Been Pwned in 24 hours, mostly from Google searches. The inbound traffic is near unprecedented, with only the Collection 1 credential stuffing list in Jan 2019 and the Facebook scrape in April 2021 coming close.

Anyway, you just can't predict these things, hope you enjoy this week's video regardless.
