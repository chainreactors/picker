For those looking to unleash the potential of API integration and low-code platforms, SAP Integration Suite is a one-stop solution.

### **What is API Integration? An overview**

API integration is essentially the link between two or more applications, enabling them to communicate, exchange data, and foster seamless integration. Today's dynamic business environment is powered by API integration, contributing to data synchronization, enhanced productivity, and revenue generation. Therefore, it's no surprise that many companies have multiple API gateway providers to address their diverse API Integration needs.

### API Integration's Role in Business Enhancement

Companies invest heavily in various integration products based on their specific needs, like the systems they need to connect with and their underlying platform requirements. Despite the prevalent usage of on-premise SAP Process Integration (PI) and SAP Process Orchestration (PO) products, there's a widespread desire to lower costs and modernize with cloud-based API integration solutions. The growing necessity for integration across SAP systems, third-party systems, and various line-of-business applications underscores the rising importance of API integration.

### **SAP BTP for Streamlined API Integration: Why Choose It?**

As much as API consumption is standard in software development, API providers grapple with challenges like securing access to sensitive data in the cloud and on-premise systems, managing APIs across diverse landscapes, and monetizing from internal and external usage. For developers, SAP's API business hub is a valuable resource offering OpenAPI specifications, business documentation, and an API sandbox for testing and response checking. Despite its robustness, the tool presents difficulties in API discovery, especially for developers unsure where to start.

The SAP BTP platform, through the SAP Integration Suite's business hub enterprise, provides a comprehensive set of platform APIs for developers to craft integration solutions. It offers a unified catalog powered by workflows and event-based integration with non-SAP API management software. Through its automated billing process, developer onboarding, and tailored UX, a citizen developer can significantly enhance content and learning journeys by integrating the SAP Integration Suite with other SAP BTP services.

### Educating Yourself about SAP’s API Integration Solutions: Where to Start?

For those keen to develop a low-code API developer portal with SAP’s low code approach for all APIs regardless of where they are managed the Discovery Center mission ‘**[Create simple, connected digital experiences with API-based integration](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/4033/4239/)’** is an excellent resource. The mission details services like SAP AppGyver, SAP Integration Suite, SAP Process Automation, SAP BTP Kyma runtime (optional), and SAP Cloud Identity Services’ Identity Authentication service (optional).
