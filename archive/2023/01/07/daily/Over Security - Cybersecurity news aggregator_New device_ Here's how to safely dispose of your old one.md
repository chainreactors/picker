# New device? Here’s how to safely dispose of your old one

Posted: January 3, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Until recently I had two old phones, one tablet and about 20 hard drives in storage that I was afraid to give up for recycling, or to pass on to someone that could use them. I wanted to dispose of them, but knowing how easy it is to retrieve data—such as personally identifiable information—even from apparently “clean” devices, I was cautious. Having researched the subject for this article I now feel a lot safer about disposing of them, and I hope you will feel a lot safer about disposing of your devices too.

Back in November I found out that it wasn’t just me. A survey in the Netherlands showed that [55% of the population keep their old phones in a drawer](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2022/46/oude-mobieltjes-laptops-en-tablets-verdwijnen-in-la-of-doos-op-zolder) instead of selling them on or recycling them.

There are two reasons for people to hold on to old devices:

* Keeping unique data on the device like pictures, etc.
* Fear of spilling information that is left behind on the device.

So, what we need to cover for peace of mind when we do get rid of our old devices are **backups**, so you don’t lose your data when you get rid of your device, and **scrubbing**, so that usable data isn’t left on the device.

## Backups

### **Windows**

**For Windows users there are many software packages and built-in tools available to back up your old PC. The simplest method is to manually back up your files and settings to removable media or a network location. You can specify the files and settings that you want to back up and how often you want to perform a backup. Which tools and software are available to you very much depends on the Windows version you are using.**

To backup and wipe the old hard drives that came from my Windows computers, I bought a hard drive docking station that came with the software to do all that, so that was easy. If the number of hard drives is limited you could opt to keep the drives and use such a docking station to retrieve files when the need arises. But I had so many old, and small, hard drives, it was worth copying the data section to a large external drive. You can also choose to copy your data to a [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) account. Even if some of your drives are very old, you wouldn’t want to end up being that [person that threw away 150 million in Bitcoin](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/aug/02/man-hopes-ai-and-robot-dogs-will-help-recover-150m-in-bitcoin-from-landfill).

### **Mac**

There are [2 ways to make a backup of the most important files on your Mac device](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjSm4f_0-L7AhUNLewKHW5LAqsQFnoECB4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fguide%2Fmac-mini%2Fback-up-and-restore-apdc6980d3be%2Fmac&usg=AOvVaw1cgzSNBmggb3F5Y8eFctuZ). Make a backup with Time Machine or make a backup with iCloud.

Time Machine is an Apple program with which you can easily copy the data on your Mac to an external storage device. When you make a backup, always choose a drive with a larger storage capacity than your Mac.
