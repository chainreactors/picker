Evolve Bank & Trust says the data of more than 7.6 million customers was stolen during the LockBit break-in in late May, per a fresh filing with Maine's attorney general.

The filing [lists](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/a2e61e38-f78d-403d-9abb-3810771bb5d2.html) the total number of persons affected (including residents) at 7,640,112.

It's the first time Evolve has confirmed the scale of the data theft – which affected at least three of its major partners, past and present – and it expects the number to rise as its investigations continue.
