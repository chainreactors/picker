Generative AI is changing how businesses work, learn, and innovate. But beneath the surface, something dangerous is happening. AI agents and custom GenAI workflows are creating **new, hidden ways for sensitive enterprise data to leak**—and most teams don't even realize it.

If you're building, deploying, or managing AI systems, now is the time to ask: Are your AI agents exposing confidential data without your knowledge?

Most GenAI models don't intentionally leak data. But here's the problem: these agents are often plugged into corporate systems—pulling from SharePoint, Google Drive, S3 buckets, and internal tools to give smart answers.

And that's where the risks begin.

Without tight access controls, governance policies, and oversight, **a well-meaning AI can accidentally expose sensitive information** to the wrong users—or worse, to the internet.

Imagine a chatbot revealing internal salary data. Or an assistant surfacing unreleased product designs during a casual query. This isn't hypothetical. It's already happening.

## Learn How to Stay Ahead — Before a Breach Happens

Join the free live webinar "[Securing AI Agents and Preventing Data Exposure in GenAI Workflows](https://thehacker.news/securing-ai-agents-workflows?source=article)," hosted by Sentra's AI security experts. This session will explore how AI agents and GenAI workflows can unintentionally leak sensitive data—and what you can do to stop it before a breach occurs.

This isn't just theory. This session dives into **real-world AI misconfigurations** and what caused them—from excessive permissions to blind trust in LLM outputs.

You'll learn:

* The most common points where GenAI apps accidentally leak enterprise data
* What attackers are exploiting in AI-connected environments
* How to tighten access without blocking innovation
* Proven frameworks to secure AI agents before things go wrong

## Who Should Join?

This session is built for people making AI happen:

* **Security teams** protecting company data
* **DevOps engineers** deploying GenAI apps
* **IT leaders** responsible for access and integration
* **IAM & data governance pros** shaping AI policies
* **Executives and AI product owners** balancing speed with safety

If you're working anywhere near AI, this conversation is essential.

GenAI is incredible. But it's also unpredictable. And the same systems that help employees move faster can accidentally move sensitive data into the wrong hands.
