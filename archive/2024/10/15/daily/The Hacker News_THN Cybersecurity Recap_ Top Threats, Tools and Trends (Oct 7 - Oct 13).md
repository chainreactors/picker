Hey there, it's your weekly dose of "*what the heck is going on in cybersecurity land*" ‚Äì and trust me, you NEED to be in the loop this time. We've got everything from zero-day exploits and AI gone rogue to the FBI playing crypto kingpin ‚Äì it's full of stuff they don't ü§´ want you to know.

So let's jump in before we get FOMO.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**GoldenJackal Hacks Air-Gapped Systems:** Meet GoldenJackal, the hacking crew you've probably never heard of ‚Äì but should definitely know about now. They're busting into super-secure, [air-gapped computer systems](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/new-pixhell-attack-exploits-screen.html) with sneaky worms spread through infected USB drives (yes, really!), proving that even the most isolated networks aren't safe. ESET researchers [caught them red-handed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/goldenjackal-target-embassies-and-air.html) using two different custom-made tools to target high-profile victims, including a South Asian embassy in Belarus and a European Union government organization.

### **üîî Top News**

* **Mozilla Patches Firefox 0-Day:** Mozilla [patched](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/mozilla-warns-of-active-exploitation-in.html) a critical zero-day flaw in its Firefox browser that it said has been actively exploited in the wild to target Tor browser users. While there are currently no details on the attacks, users are advised to update to Firefox 131.0.2, Firefox ESR 128.3.1, and Firefox ESR 115.16.1.
* **Contagious Interview Remains Lucrative for N. Korea:** Ever since details about a North Korean hacking campaign called Contagious Interview came to light nearly a year ago, it has continued to target the technology sector with no signs of stopping anytime soon. These attacks aim to [deliver backdoors and information-stealing malware](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/n-korean-hackers-use-fake-interviews-to.html) by deceiving developers into executing malicious code under the pretext of a coding assignment as part of a job interview after approaching them on platforms like LinkedIn.
* **OpenAI Disrupts Malicious Operations:** OpenAI [said](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/openai-blocks-20-global-malicious.html) it has disrupted over 20 malicious cyber operations since the start of the year that abused its generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, ChatGPT, for debugging and developing malware, spreading misinformation, evading detection, and vulnerability research. One of the activity clusters was observed targeting OpenAI employees via spear-phishing attacks to deploy the SugarGh0st RAT.
* **FBI Creates Fake Crypto to Disrupt Fraudulent Operation:** The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took the "unprecedented step" of [creating](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/fbi-creates-fake-cryptocurrency-to.html) its own cryptocurrency token and a company called NexFundAI to take down a fraud operation that allegedly manipulated digital asset markets by orchestrating an illegal scheme known as wash trading. A total of 18 people and entities have been charged in connection with the pump-and-dump scam, with three arrests reported so far.
* **Gorilla Botnet Launches 300,000 DDoS Attacks Across 100 Countries:** A botnet malware family called Gorilla issued over [300,000 attack commands](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/new-gorilla-botnet-launches-over-300000.html) in the month of September 2024 alone, targeting universities, government websites, telecoms, banks, gaming, and gambling sectors. China, the U.S., Canada, and Germany. The botnet is based on the leaked Mirai botnet source code.

### **üì∞ Around the Cyber World**

* **Microsoft Announces Windows 11 Security Baseline:** Microsoft has [released](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/windows-11-version-24h2-security-baseline/ba-p/4252801) the Windows 11, version 24H2 security baseline with added protections to LAN Manager, Kerberos, User Account Control, and Microsoft Defender Antivirus. It also includes Windows Protected Print (WPP), which the company described as the "new, modern and more secure print for Windows built from the ground up with security in mind." In a related development, the tech giant [announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2024/10/08/passkeys-on-windows-authenticate-seamlessly-with-passkey-providers/) a redesigned Windows Hello experience and API support for third-party passkey providers like 1Password and Bitwarden to plug into the Windows 11 platform.
* **Apple macOS iPhone Mirroring is Broken:** Apple announced a new iPhone mirroring feature with macOS 15.0 Sequoia, but cybersecurity firm Sevco has [uncovered](https://www.sevcosecurity.com/iphone-mirroring-expose-employee-personal-information/) a privacy risk that could expose metadata associated with apps on an employee's personal iPhone to their corporate IT department. The issue stems from the fact that the iOS apps mirrored to the Mac populate the same application metadata as native macOS applications, thereby leaking information about the apps that may be installed on their phones. Apple has acknowledged the problem and is said to be working on a fix.
* **Social Engineering Via Phone Calls:** Threat actors have found an effective social engineering vector in phone calls in order to trick users into performing an unintended action, a technique also called telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), callback phishing, and hybrid vishi...
