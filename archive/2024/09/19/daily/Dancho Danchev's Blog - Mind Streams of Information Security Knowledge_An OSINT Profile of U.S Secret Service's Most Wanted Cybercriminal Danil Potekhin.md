In this analysis we’ll take a look at the Internet connected infrastructure of U.S Secret Service’s most wanted cybercriminal with a $10M reward [Danil Potekhin](https://www.secretservice.gov/investigations/mostwanted/potekhin) using a variety of tools in terms of connecting the dots using current real time and historical passive DNS information to find out where he was and used to host his Web properties and domains online for the purpose of assisting other researchers organizations and vendors in terms of establishing the foundation for a successful Threat Hunting and cyber threat actor attribution efforts and that would also include U.S Law Enforcement.

Using several OSINT methodologies we managed to obtain his personal email including to also find several additional personal emails which are known to belong to him for the purpose of cross checking them for various domain registrations which would assist in our research and infrastructure mapping with success.

**Sample personal email address accounts include:** potekhin14@bk.ru; potekhinl4@bk.ru; potekhin.kg@yandex.ru

We’ve also managed to find one of his primary domains using current and historical WHOIS databases.

hxxp://agressivex.com (MD5: 922530c5371a3d029e4cc330e2d0f4d3 -> 194.58.56.61 -> 194.58.56.91) - 46.30.40.103 - Email: potekhin14@bk.ru; potekhinl4@bk.ru

**Sample known responding IPs for hxxp://agressivex.com historically:**
194.58.56.120
194.58.56.54
194.58.56.80

**Related domain registrations:**

First we started by doing the relatively easy part which is to launch a [Technical Collection](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20200916) campaign using open source information including public and proprietary sources on our way to find as much actionable intelligence about Danil Potehin as possible. The next logical step was to begin processing and taking notes and then enriching the technical details which we obtained using open source information on our way to analyze and connect the dots where our ultimate goal for this assignment would be to provide as much actionable intelligence and technical details about his Internet connected infrastructure both in real time current Internet presence and activities including historical Internet footprint in terms of some of his Web properties which we have discovered using open source information including Technical Collection for processing enriching analyzing and connecting the dots on Danil's Internet whereabouts.

For starters we ended up with a pretty straightforward and obvious fact which no matter how awkward it may sound with Danil's name listed on U.S Secret Service's $10M reward web site is known to have been running a Android based botnet service on one of his primary domains which basically speaks for itself and is yet another indication on how the correlation of multiple public and proprietary databases can lead to the big picture where often a single detail can provide the big picture and most importantly all the details prior to doing proper Technical Collection including OSINT as a methodology including research enrichment and analysis of the obtained and processed data for Danil.
