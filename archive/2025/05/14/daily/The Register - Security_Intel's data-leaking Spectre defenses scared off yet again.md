Updated Researchers at ETH Zurich in Switzerland have found a way around Intel's defenses against Spectre, a family of data-leaking flaws in the x86 giant's processor designs that simply won't die.

Sandro Rüegge, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi have identified a class of security vulnerabilities they're calling Branch Predictor Race Conditions (BPRC), which they describe in [a paper](https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/bprc_sec25.pdf) [PDF] scheduled to be presented at USENIX Security 2025 and Black Hat USA 2025 later this year.

Spectre refers to a set of hardware-level processor vulnerabilities [identified in 2018](https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/) that can be used to break the security isolation between software. It does this by exploiting speculative execution - a performance optimization technique that involves the CPU anticipating future code paths (also known as branch prediction) and executing down those paths before they're actually needed.
