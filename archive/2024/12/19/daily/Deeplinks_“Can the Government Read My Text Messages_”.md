Learn how governments are able to read certain text messages, and how to ensure your messages are end-to-end encrypted on [Digital Rights Bytes](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org), our new site dedicated to helping break down tech issues into *byte-**sized pieces*.

Whether you’re just starting to think about your privacy online, or you’re already a regular user of encrypted messaging apps, Digital Rights Bytes is here to help answer some of the common questions that may be bothering you about the devices you use. Watch the short video that explains how to keep your communications private online--and share it with family and friends who may have asked similar questions!

Have you also wondered why it is so expensive to fix your phone, or if you really own the digital media you paid for? We’ve got answers to those and other questions as well! And, if you’ve got additional questions you’d like us to answer in the future, let us know on your [social platform of choice](https://www.eff.org/pages/where-find-eff) using the hashtag #DigitalRightsBytes.
