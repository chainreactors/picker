**2025 nominations have closed. Be sure to join us at the EFF Awards this year, more info can be found here: [www.eff.org/EFFAwards](http://www.eff.org/EFFAwards)**

For over thirty years, the Electronic Frontier Foundation presented awards to key leaders and organizations in the fight for freedom and innovation online. The EFF Awards celebrate the longtime stalwarts working on behalf of technology users, both in the public eye and behind the scenes. Past Honorees include visionary activist [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz), human rights and security researchers [The Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.org/), media activist [Malkia Devich-Cyril](https://twitter.com/culturejedi), media group [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/), and whistle-blower [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning).

The internet is a necessity in modern life and a continually evolving tool for communication, creativity, and human potential. Together we carry—and must always steward—the movement to protect civil liberties and human rights online. Will you help us spotlight some of the latest and most impactful work towards a better digital future?

Remember, nominations close on May 23rd at 2:00 PM Pacific time!
