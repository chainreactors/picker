Figure 1: Every government contractor when they hear about CUI

Contractors and subcontractors working for the US Federal Government (as well as some other unrelated organizations) may encounter contract clauses that require them to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) but may be confused about what CUI is and how these requirements apply.

These clauses may include mention of one (1) or more of the following:

* Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification ([CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/))
* Federal Information Security Modernization Act ([FISMA](https://csrc.nist.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/laws/fisma))
* Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ([FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/))
* [Executive Order 13556](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/04/executive-order-13556-controlled-unclassified-information)
* Supplier Performance Risk System ([SPRS](https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/))
* Various National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks:
  + [NIST SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)
  + [NIST SP 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final)
  + [NIST SP 800-172](https://csrc.nist.gov/Pubs/sp/800/172/Final)
* Various parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and its supplements including but not limited to:
  + [FAR 52.204-21](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.204-21)
  + [DFARS 252.204-7012](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7012-safeguarding-covered-defense-information-and-cyber-incident-reporting.)
  + [DFARS 252.204-7021](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7021-cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-requirements.)
  + [HSAR 3052.204-72](https://www.acquisition.gov/hsar/3052.204-72-safeguarding-controlled-unclassified-information.)

There is an increased awareness of CUI and its protection as a result of the upcoming DoD CMMC program. TrustedSec has received many inquiries from defense contractors seeking to prepare themselves for CMMC requirements and in some cases TrustedSec has determined that these contractors are not handling CUI and therefore have no CUI protection obligations.

Organizations that misrepresent their CUI protection program, i.e., claiming CUI protection controls are in place when they are not, are subject to liability under the False Claims Act ([FCA](https://www.justice.gov/civil/false-claims-act)). This law all...
