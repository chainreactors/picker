# Titles: Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Update Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability PoC (Conceptual Model)
# Author: nu11secur1ty
# Date: 06/28/25
# Vendor: Microsoft
# Software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ
# Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control
# CVE ID: CVE-2025-47181
## Description:
This repository contains a conceptual proof-of-concept (PoC) for CVE-2025-47181, a "link following" privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based).
This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit improper link resolution and symbolic link (symlink) handling by a trusted Edge updater process to write to privileged system files and potentially gain SYSTEM privileges.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type: Symlink-based Privilege Escalation
Affected Software: Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Updater
Severity: Critical
Impact:
An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can trick the trusted Edge updater to write malicious content to privileged locations on disk, such as C:\Windows\System32\driver\_config.dll. This leads to privilege escalation from a low-privileged user to SYSTEM-level access.
