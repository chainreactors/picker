# Unmasking MrDeepFakes: Canadian Pharmacist Linked to World’s Most Notorious Deepfake Porn Site

MrDeepFakes billed itself as the “largest and most user-friendly” platform for celebrity deepfake pornography. The website, which was visited millions of times every month, hosted almost 70,000 explicit and sometimes violent videos, which had collectively been viewed more than 2.2 billion times.

They show mostly famous women whose faces have been inserted into hardcore porn with artificial intelligence – and without their consent.

In the background, an active community of more than 650,000 members shared tips on how to generate this content, commissioned custom deepfakes, and posted misogynistic and derogatory comments about their victims.

For years, the website has been shrouded in secrecy, existing in a legal grey area and concealing the identity of those who control it. Until now.

Bellingcat, in collaboration with Danish outlets *Tjekdet*, *Politiken* and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), has conducted an investigation to reveal the identity of a key administrator behind MrDeepFakes.

*Canadian pharmacist David Do, whose name never appeared on the MrDeepFakes website, has had a central role in its operations. Source: Instagram and Facebook (Bellingcat has not named these accounts and/or authors of the images to protect their identities)*

David Do is a 36-year-old Canadian pharmacist who, based on open source information, lives an unassuming and respectable life in the suburbs outside of Toronto. Photos and videos posted online show him with family, friends and colleagues. The university graduate has a [well-paying job](https://www.ontariosunshinelist.com/people/david-do/oak-valley-health) in a public hospital and drives a new Tesla.

But Do has been living a double life: in secret, he is the most prominent figure identified to have had control over the administration of MrDeepFakes. He was also an influential member of its growing online community, producing his own deepfake porn and assisting users who want to make their own.

Online posts show Do is a technically minded individual with a long-standing interest in creating and distributing adult content, and provide an insight into efforts to obfuscate his identity.

We identified Do by cross-referencing data from massive credential leaks, which are publicly available via breach databases. A series of burner emails, IP addresses, repeated usernames, and a unique password reveal a more than decade-long digital trail that allowed researchers to link him to MrDeepFakes.

Bellingcat, *Tjekdet*, *Politiken* and CBC have sent Do multiple requests for comment since late March but did not receive a response as of publication. Last month, the CBC hand-delivered correspondence to Do setting out the findings of this investigation, but he declined to comment.

Shortly after, Do’s Facebook page and the social media accounts of some family members were deleted. Do then travelled to Portugal with his family, according to reviews posted on Airbnb, only returning to Canada this week.

On Sunday, the MrDeepFakes site was shut down. “A critical service provider has terminated service permanently,” a notice on the platform says. “We will not be relaunching. Any website claiming this is fake.”

CBC approached David Do again on Monday but he refused to answer questions about his involvement with MrDeepFakes. “I don’t want to be recorded please,” he said. “I have to go. I’m busy right now.”

*MrDeepFakes was billed as the “largest and most user-friendly” site for celebrity deepfakes.*

**Update:** David Do is on leave from his position as a hospital pharmacist, [his employer confirmed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/pharmacist-mrdeepfakes-david-do-off-work-oak-valley-health-1.7533549) on May 13, while an internal investigation is underway. Separately, the Ontario College of Pharmacists [has said](https://www.ocpinfo.com/statement-from-ocp/) it is “taking immediate steps to look into this matter further and determine the necessary actions we need to take to protect the public”.

What is Deepfake Porn?

Deepfake pornography is the use of artificial intelligence to create non-consensual, sexually explicit images and videos. Research shows that 99 per cent of victims are women.

Actress Jenna Ortega, singer Taylor Swift and politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are among some of the high-profile victims whose faces have been superimposed into hardcore pornographic content.

But the technology is also being used on people who are not in the public eye.

A 2024 [survey](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-29/11-percent-of-students-say-classmates-have-created-deepfake-ai-nudes-report-says) found that at least one in nine high school students knew of someone who had used AI technology to make deepfake pornography of a classmate and *The* *New York Times* has [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-westfield-high-school.html) that schools across the US were dealing with ...
