## Pentesting – Discover Vulnerabilities, Create Reports, Provide Guidance

*by Ray Van Hoose || @\_meta.*

The question: How can we predict ways the bad guys will attack our systems, and how can we try to stop them?

The answer: Penetration testing.

Penetration testing, especially in the past, included physical security assessments (i.e. breaking into buildings). Penetration testing has grown and evolved over the years, and currently tends to focus more on technical findings, leaving the physical security and social engineering (phishing emails, tricking folks on the phone, etc.) to the red teamers.

**What tools do I need to survive as a penetration tester?**

* **Kali Linux:** open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards various information security tasks, such as penetration testing, security research, etc.
* **Nmap**: free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing.
* **Burp:** Burp Suite is a comprehensive suite of tools for web application security testing.

**What makes us different from red teamers?**

* Completedness
  + We find and document as many of the vulnerabilities as we can, not just the vulnerabilities used to gain access.
* Goals and approach:
  + Pentesters are “noisy” in their approach.
  + Pentesters do not focus on things like response time and effectiveness of the defense teams.

### **Skills and Techniques to Survive**

##### **Communication**

One of the most important, but least recognized, skills. Your primary deliverable is the report. Additionally, you will often debrief leadership, as well as work with developers, to fix the vulnerabilities discovered.

##### **Documentation**

Few, if any, enjoy it but the report needs to be presentable. Good screenshots and documentation are critical in this field.

##### **Command-line interface knowledge**

Understanding Linux and Windows commands will provide —

* An interface for the vast majority of hacking and penetration testing tools {wget, cURL, Nikto, metasploit, sqlmap, etc.).
* ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ allows you to launch, name, access, and manage a shell for each tool, or even split scans or tools across any number of shells.
* Improvement of screenshot readability (by only returning and displaying the most relevant data).

##### **Validation**

Can you use different tools or techniques to validate the potential vulnerabilities that are discovered? Discovery and validation are key pillars of a good test.

##### **Exploitation**

Often can be the trickiest part of the job. Sometimes, it might be as easy as configuring the tool to execute the appropriate payload… But quite often, you might spend a considerable amount of time tinkering to get a working exploit on that system.

**Here are some popular websites that provide insights and (sometimes) working payloads**:

* Exploit-db – [exploit-db.com](https://exploit-db.com)
* Rapid7-db – [rapid7.com/db/](http://rapid7.com/db/)
* NIST – [nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search](http://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)

Using these skills, knowledge, and tools, a successful penetration tester will be able to discover vulnerabilities, create reports that help inform leadership of security weaknesses, and provide meaningful guidance on how to remedy (or mitigate) these issues.
