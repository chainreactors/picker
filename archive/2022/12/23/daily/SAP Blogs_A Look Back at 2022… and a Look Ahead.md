This past year has been a fast-moving one for us and our customers. While consumer behavior continues to evolve, we’re seeing real strength in consumer confidence. Our support for our customers led to real breakthroughs and growth.

Here are a few of our favorite wins from 2022, as well as what we’re looking forward to in 2023:

**Our Customers**

Emarsys enjoys the trust of some of the most outstanding companies in business today, helping companies around the globe communicate with their customers, drive loyalty, and expand their reach. Brands like [Beauty Pie](https://emarsys.com/why-emarsys/success-stories/how-beauty-pie-connects-data-to-deliver-next-level-email-experiences/) saw revenue driven by automation increase by 88% year over year and a 32% increase in web traffic driven by email, fueled by just some of the features we offer our clients.

Besides the great strides we helped our existing customers make, we were also delighted to welcome new brands from around the world onto the Emarsys platform.

* [**Parfym.se**](https://emarsys.com/press-release/good-things-come-in-thirds-parfym-se-looks-to-emarsys-to-drive-33-of-company-revenue/)**,** a leading provider for beauty products in Scandinavia, came to us looking to drive 33% of its revenue through our omnichannel platform.

* [**Huel**](https://emarsys.com/press-release/rocket-huel-complete-nutrition-specialist-announces-lift-off-with-emarsys/)**,** the complete nutrition specialist, sought to create a single source of truth for a 360-degree view of each customer.

* [**DISSH**](https://emarsys.com/press-release/dissh-deploys-emarsys-to-support-their-global-expansion-journey/)**,** an Australian fashion brand established in 2001, and run, owned, and led by women, came to Emarsys to leverage greater user segmentation and to drive their customer retention strategy.

These are a handful of our new partners, and we’re so excited to help them reach and exceed their goals in 2023 and beyond.

**Power to the Marketer Festival**

Our signature event of the year, the [Power to the Marketer Festival](https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/3856137/power-to-the-marketer-festival-on-demand), spanned the globe, with more than 50 sessions, which we held both live in New York, London, Berlin, Sydney, and Paris, as well as online for digital attendees from around the world. We beat our goal of overall attendance with 1,349 live attendees, with the festival sessions now streaming for those who couldn’t catch them live.

We provided outstanding, actionable content for marketers, with more than 20 thought leadership sessions with top brands. These covered a wide range of topics including loyalty and omnichannel marketing strategies. We heard from leaders at global brands such as Glossier, Anthropologie, TikTok, Kat Maconie, Forrester, Pepsico, and more. In addition, our 45 customer and partner breakout sessions offered real, practical examples of marketing strategies from leading brands including Disney Theatrical Group, Decolico, Columbia Sportswear, Movable Ink, Jebbit, The FA, and Reformation, to name a few.

We also brought 22 new customer stories with precise how-tos on how they’re winning with SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement, plus 20 product sessions that show marketers how to unlock the power of the Emarsys platform to accomplish their goals.

But the fun doesn’t end just because the festival is over. We’re leveraging this brand-building content into shorter snippets, case studies, blogs, videos, and more, so that marketers everywhere can continue to grow and keep up with the rapid pace of change.

 **New Product Releases**

At Emarsys, we don’t just talk the talk about staying up to date in a changing market. We walk the walk by continually upgrading and improving our platform to better serve our customers. In November, 2022, we announced new innovations and updated functionality specifically designed to give more power to marketers and help them deliver more 1:1 omnichannel experiences as part of our [Emarsys Autumn Release 2022](https://emarsys.com/press-release/emarsys-autumn-release-2022-brings-host-of-new-features-and-innovations-to-empower-marketers/). This built on our [Spring Release](https://emarsys.com/press-release/spring-into-action-new-functionality-in-the-emarsys-spring-release-to-enable-marketers-to-connect-and-grow/), which brought more than 25 new features to our platform that enabled marketers to better connect with and grow their customer base.

Our commitment to growth continues, and we’re continually striving to better serve our growing number of customers and expand the ways in which we make marketers’ jobs easier and more effective.

**Industry Recognition**

This year, we’ve been extremely honored by the industry recognition our platform received.

We were delighted to be positioned by Gartner® as a [Leader in the 2022 “Magic Quadrant™ for Personalization Engines”](https://emarsys.com/press-release/emarsys-an-sap-company-named-a-leader-for-the-fourth-time-in-2022-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-personalization-engines/), for the SAP® Emarsys® Customer Engagement Platform. According to the 2022 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Personalization Engines, “Personalization remains a priority for digital marketing leaders. Relevant and timely messaging is key to educating customers, building consideration, and increasing conversions.” That’s why one of our key goals at Emarsys is to help brands create real 1:1, personalized experiences for their customers.

We were also recognized in [The Forrester Wave™: Email Marketing Service Providers, Q1 2022](https://emarsys.com/emarsys-recognized-in-the-forrester-wave-email-marketing-service-providers-q1-2022/). Forrester had this to say about Emarsys, “Emarsys’ top-notch campaign managem...
