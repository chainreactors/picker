# TorrentGalaxy’s Troubles Silence Popular Upload Bots (Update)

Trouble continues for the popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy. After several technical issues last week, the site has become unreachable. At the same time, the related 'TGxGoodies' uploader accounts at other torrent sites have been inactive for days. TorrentGalaxy switched owners earlier this year, but it's unclear what's behind the recent problems.

[Founded](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-torrents-and-streaming-181104/) in 2018, TorrentGalaxy has grown to become a leading player in the torrent ecosystem.

The site was launched by former members of ExtraTorrent, a popular torrent site that had just shut down at the time. The founders aimed to provide a home for ExtraTorrent ‘refugees’ but, over time, it transformed into much more than that.

## TorrentGalaxy Downtime

In recent months, TorrentGalaxy has faced considerable downtime. The original team [sold the site](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-has-a-rough-start-under-new-owners-241017/) to new operators, which offered an explanation for the earlier ‘[maintenance](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-is-back-online-uploads-resume-240904/)‘ issues. However, the site continues to face trouble.

Technical problems have plagued TorrentGalaxy.to for nearly a week and yesterday the site became completely unreachable. The status update domain progalaxy.me has been offline even longer. There is no maintenance message on either of these sites.

***Update December 13:** Torrentgalaxy appears to be back in action, to a certain degree. The uploads at other sites have yet to resume.*

TorrentGalaxy’s owners have not informed the staffers about the reason for the downtime, nor is it clear how serious the issues are. Right now, visitors to the site will simply see a browser timeout notice, which suggests that part of its server infrastructure is disconnected.

## Broken Upload Bots

At this point, downtime at a pirate site is hardly newsworthy. Due to ongoing anti-piracy efforts, websites are pulled offline every week. That said, TorrentGalaxy’s issues have a much broader impact than those at other sites.

Since the site also provides a steady flow of [TGx] releases to other torrent sites, the downtime will be noticeable there as well. This includes the popular ‘TGxGoodies’ uploader at 1337x and The Pirate Bay, whose releases stopped five days ago.

This isn’t just any other uploader either. TGxGoodies submitted close to 5,000 torrents to these sites in November, including many of the most popular releases.

As always, these types of developments are fuel for rumors, which we won’t entertain here. To the delight of rightsholders, it is clear that the public torrent ecosystem is becoming more fragile by the day, which is a trend that shows no signs of abating.

Whether the site’s issues are in any way related to legal problems is unknown. However, no pirate site of its size is spared from anti-piracy efforts.
