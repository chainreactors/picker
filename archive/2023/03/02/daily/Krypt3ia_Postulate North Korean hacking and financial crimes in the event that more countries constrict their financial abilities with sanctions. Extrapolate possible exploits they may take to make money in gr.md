North Korea has a history of engaging in cyberattacks and financial crimes as a means of generating revenue and circumventing economic sanctions. In the event that more countries constrict their financial abilities with sanctions, North Korea may resort to further exploiting illicit and grey market activities to make money. The following are some possible exploits they may take:

1. Cryptocurrency: North Korea has been known to use cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions and fund their regime. They have been involved in mining, theft, and ransomware attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is possible that they may increase their involvement in the cryptocurrency market to further evade sanctions and generate revenue.
2. Money laundering: North Korea has a history of using shell companies and front businesses to launder money and evade sanctions. In the event of increased sanctions, they may increase their use of these methods to move money around the world undetected.
3. Cyberattacks: North Korea has a highly skilled and advanced cyber warfare capability. They have been known to engage in hacking and cyber espionage to steal sensitive information and generate revenue. It is possible that they may increase their involvement in cyberattacks against financial institutions, government agencies, and other targets to generate revenue.
4. Illicit trade: North Korea has been known to engage in illicit trade, such as weapons and drug trafficking, to generate revenue. They may increase their involvement in these activities to generate revenue and circumvent sanctions.
5. Counterfeiting: North Korea has a history of producing high-quality counterfeit currency, such as US dollars and euros. In the event of increased sanctions, they may increase their involvement in counterfeiting to generate revenue.

Overall, North Korea has demonstrated a willingness to engage in illicit and grey market activities to generate revenue and evade sanctions. As sanctions become more constrictive, it is likely that they will increase their involvement in these activities to maintain their financial capabilities. It is important for the international community to remain vigilant and continue to monitor and enforce sanctions against North Korea.

***Expand this and theorize on new schemes they may come up with***

In addition to the possible exploits mentioned earlier, North Korea may develop new schemes to circumvent sanctions and generate revenue. Some possible new schemes they may come up with include:

1. Exploiting loopholes in international financial systems: North Korea may exploit loopholes in international financial systems to evade sanctions. For example, they may use financial intermediaries or shell companies in countries that are not party to the sanctions to move money around the world undetected.
2. Expanding their involvement in the dark web: North Korea may increase their involvement in the dark web to engage in illicit activities such as hacking, drug trafficking, and weapons sales. The dark web provides a platform for anonymous and untraceable transactions, making it an attractive option for North Korea to generate revenue.
3. Leveraging their cyber warfare capabilities for financial gain: North Korea’s cyber warfare capabilities are highly advanced and have been used to target financial institutions in the past. They may develop new tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in financial systems to generate revenue.
4. Expanding their involvement in the arms trade: North Korea has a long history of involvement in the arms trade, and they may expand their involvement in this area to generate revenue. They may also increase their involvement in other illicit activities such as smuggling and counterfeiting.
5. Developing new cryptocurrencies: North Korea may develop new cryptocurrencies that are specifically designed to circumvent sanctions and generate revenue. They may also launch initial coin offerings (ICOs) to raise funds for their regime.

It is important to note that these are all speculative scenarios, and it is impossible to predict with certainty what North Korea may do in the future. However, given their history of engaging in illicit and grey market activities to generate revenue, it is likely that they will continue to develop new schemes to circumvent sanctions and maintain their financial capabilities. The international community must remain vigilant and continue to monitor and enforce sanctions to prevent North Korea from engaging in these activities.

***Expand more and include current programs that North Korea has been using to bypass sanctions including Room 39***

North Korea has been using a number of programs to bypass international sanctions, including Room 39, a secretive organization that is believed to be responsible for many of the country’s illicit activities. Room 39 is thought to be a key player in North Korea’s efforts to circumvent sanctions and generate revenue for the regime.

Some of the activities that Room 39 is believed to be involved in include:

1. Counterfeiting: Room 39 is believed to be involved in the production of high-quality counterfeit currency, including US dollars and euros. The organization has been known to use sophisticated printing technology and high-quality materials to produce counterfeit bills that are difficult to detect.
2. Illicit trade: Room 39 is believed to be involved in a range of illicit trade activities, including the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. The organization has been known to use a network of front companies and intermediaries to move goods around the world undetected.
3. Money laundering: Room 39 is believed to be involved in the laundering of money through a variety of channels, including the use of front companies and shell corporations. The organization is also believed to use cryptocurrencies and other digital assets to move money around the world.
4. Cyberattacks: Room 39 is believed to have a highly advanced cyber warfare capability, and the organization has been linked to a number of high-profile cyberattacks against financial institutions and other targets. These attacks are believed to be part of North Korea’s efforts to generate revenue and evade sanctions.
5. Exploiting loopholes in international financial systems: Room 39 is believed to be highly skilled at exploiting loopholes in international financial systems to evade sanctions. The organization has been known to use intermediaries in countries that are not subject to sanctions to move money around the world undetected.

In addition to Room 39, North Korea has been using a range of other programs to bypass international sanctions. For example, the country has been using ships to smuggle goods and evade sanctions, and they have also been using front companies and shell corporations to conceal their activities. North Korea has also been known to use cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and generate revenue.

Overall, North Korea’s efforts to bypass sanctions and generate revenue are highly sophisticated and involve a range of illicit and grey market activities. The international community must remain vigilant and continue to monitor and e...
