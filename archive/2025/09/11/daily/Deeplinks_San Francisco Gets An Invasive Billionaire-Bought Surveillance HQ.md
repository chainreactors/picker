San Francisco billionaire Chris Larsen once again has wielded his wallet to keep city residents under the eye of all-seeing police surveillance.

The San Francisco Police Commission, the Board of Supervisors, and Mayor Daniel Lurie [have signed off](https://www.sf.gov/news-mayor-lurie-takes-key-step-towards-opening-new-real-time-investigation-center-that-will-leverage-new-technology-to-improve-public-safety) on Larsen’s $9.4 million gift of a new Real-Time Investigations Center. The plan involves moving the city’s existing police tech hub from the public Hall of Justice not to [the city’s brand-new police headquarters](https://www.sanfranciscopolice.org/your-sfpd/sfpd-headquarters) but instead to a sublet in the Financial District building of Ripple Labs, Larsen’s crypto-transfer company. Although the city [reportedly won’t be paying for the space](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/chris-larsen-sfpd-donation-tech-20357671.php), the lease reportedly cost Ripple $2.3 million and will last until December 2026.

The deal will also include a $7.25 million gift from the San Francisco Police Community Foundation that Larsen created. Police foundations are semi-public fundraising arms of police departments that allow them to buy technology and gear that the city will not give them money for.

In Los Angeles, the [city’s police foundation got $178,000 from the company Target](https://www.latimes.com/...
