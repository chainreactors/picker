[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjv49CKWQaiZNBDPfM_NwKLDa77YSTc8OEK4G0wRZCqt3lHfShi8bPc1B7RihZ4yg3EcK_xCX9rcwvTGEQVfnTh4LUZAhsUyJ7xHNEEdqkzsgLrLro3U8R9PKiiwAeYGevlpDGpGV0zudWGZCZdRN8EDruOZzUZyo9z_eIbSBl7VIPmDIWSSZOpKDgsJHA8/s1700/ttps_cover.png)

Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) form the foundation of modern defense strategies. Unlike indicators of compromise (IOCs), TTPs are more stable, making them a reliable way to identify specific cyber threats. Here are some of the most commonly used techniques, according to ANY.RUN's [Q3 2024](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-report-q3-2024/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top5_techniques&utm_content=blog&utm_term=071124) report on malware trends, complete with real-world examples.

## Disabling of Windows Event Logging (T1562.002)

Disrupting Windows Event Logging helps attackers prevent the system from recording crucial information about their malicious actions.

Without event logs, important details such as login attempts, file modifications, and system changes go unrecorded, leaving security solutions and analysts with incomplete or missing data.

Windows Event Logging can be manipulated in different ways, including by changing registry keys or using commands like "net stop eventlog". Altering group policies is another common method.

Since many detection mechanisms rely on log analysis to identify suspicious activities, malware can operate undetected for longer periods.

### Example: XWorm Disables Remote Access Service Logs

To detect, observe, and analyze different types of malicious TTPs in a safe environment, we can use [ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top5_techniques&utm_content=landing&utm_term=071124). The service provides highly-configurable Windows and Linux VMs that let you not only detonate malware and see its execution in real time, but also interact with it just like on a standard computer.

Thanks to tracking of all system and network activities, ANY.RUN lets you easily and quickly identify malicious actions like the disabling of Windows Event Logging.

| The sandbox shares details about the malicious process and its registry modification |

Specifically, it modifies the registry to disable trace logs for RASAPI32, which is responsible for managing remote access connections on the system.

| The malware disables logs by modifying several registry names |

By setting ENABLEAUTOFILETRACING and other registry names related to RASAPI32 to 0, the attacker ensures that logs are not generated. This makes it harder for security software like antiviruses to identify the incident.

## PowerShell Exploitation (T1059.001)

PowerShell is a scripting language and command-line shell built into Windows. Attackers typically exploit it to perform a variety of malicious tasks, including manipulating system settings, exfiltrating data, and establishing persistent access to compromised systems.

When using PowerShell's extensive capabilities, threat actors can utilize obfuscation techniques, such as encoding commands or advanced scripting methods, to bypass detection mechanisms.

### Example: BlanGrabber Uses PowerShell to Disable Detection

Consider [this analysis of a BlankGrabber sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/55d0fdbd-8e0e-463a-a863-44963d060857/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top5_techniques&utm_content=task_2&utm_term=071124), a malware family used for stealing sensitive data from infected systems. After the execution, the malicious program launches several processes, including PowerShell, to change the system settings to avoid detection.
