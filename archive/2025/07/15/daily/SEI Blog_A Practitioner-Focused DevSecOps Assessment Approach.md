Success in a [DevSecOps](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/continuous-deployment-capability/) enterprise hinges on delivering value to the end user, not simply completing intermediate steps along the way. Organizations and programs often struggle to achieve this due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of clear ownership and accountability for the capability to deliver software, functional siloes as opposed to integrated teams and processes, lack of effective tools for teams to use, and a lack of effective resources for team members to leverage to quickly get up to speed and boost productivity.

An absence of a central driving force can result in siloed units within a given organization or program, fragmented decision making, and an absence of defined key performance metrics. Consequently, organizations may be hindered in their ability to deliver capability at the speed of relevance. A siloed DevSecOps infrastructure, where disjointed environments are intertwined to form a complete pipeline, causes developers to expend significant effort to build an application without the support of documentation and guidance for working within the provided platforms. Teams cannot create repeatable solutions in the absence of an end-to-end integrated application delivery pipeline. Without one, efficiency suffers, and unnecessary practices bog down the entire process.

The first step in achieving the value DevSecOps can bring is to understand [how we define it](/library/using-model-based-systems-engineering-mbse-to-assure-a-devsecops-pipeline-is-sufficiently-secure/):

*a socio-technical system made up of a collection of both software tools and processes. It is not a computer-based system to be built or acquired; it is a mindset that relies on defined processes for the rapid development, fielding, and operations of software and software-based systems utilizing automation where feasible to achieve the desired throughput of developing, fielding, and sustaining new product features and capabilities.*

DevSecOps is thus a mindset that builds on automation where feasible.

The objective of an effective DevSecOps assessment is to understand the software development process and make recommendations for improvements that will positively impact the value, quality, and speed of delivery of products to the end user in an operationally stable and secure manner. A comprehensive assessment of current capabilities must include both quantitative and qualitative approaches to gathering data and determining precisely where challenges reside in the product delivery process. The scope of an assessment must consider all processes that are required to field and operate a software product as part of the value delivery processes. The aperture through which a DevSecOps assessment team focuses its work is wider than the tools and processes typically thought of as the software development pipeline. The assessment must encompass the broader context of the entire product delivery pipeline, including planning stages, where capability (or value) needs are defined and translated into requirements, as well as post-deployment operational phases. This wider view allows an assessment team to determine how well organizations deliver value.

There are a myriad of overlapping influences that can cause dysfunction within a DevSecOps enterprise. Looking from the outside it can be difficult to peel back the layers and effectively find the major causes. This blog focuses on how to conduct a DevSecOps assessment with an approach that uses four methodologies to analyze an enterprise from the perspective of the practitioner using the tools and processes to build and deliver valuable software. Taking the perspective of the practitioner allows the assessment team to surface the most immediately relevant challenges facing the enterprise.

## A 4-Pronged Assessment Methodology

To frame the experience of a practitioner, a comprehensive assessment requires a layered approach. This kind of approach can help assessors gather enough data to understand both the full scope and the specific details of the developers’ experiences, both positive and negative. We take a four-pronged approach:

1. **Immersion:** The assessment team immerses itself into the development process by either developing a small, representative application from scratch, joining an existing development team, or other means of gaining firsthand experience and insight in the process. Avoiding special treatment is important to gather real-world data, so the assessment team should use means to become a “secret shopper” wherever possible. This also allows the assessment team to figure out what the real, not just documented, process is to deliver value.
2. **Observation:** The assessment team directly observes existing application development teams as they work to build, test, deliver, and deploy their applications to the end users. Observations should cover as much of the value-delivery process as practicable, such as user engagement, product design, sprint planning, demos, retrospectives, and software releases.
3. **Engagement:** The assessment team conducts interviews and focused discussion with development teams and other relevant stakeholders to clarify and gather context for their experience and observations. Ask the practitioners to show the assessment team how they work.
4. **Benchmarking:** The assessment team captures available metrics from the enterprise and its processes and compares them with expected outcomes for similar organizations.

To achieve this, an assessment team can use ethnographic research techniques ...
