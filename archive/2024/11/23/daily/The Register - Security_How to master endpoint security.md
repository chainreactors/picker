Webinar Want to access the key takeaways from the recent "Secure Everything for Every Endpoint" webinar?

On November 20th, The Register's Tim Phillips hosted Sam Duckett, Product Manager at Kaseya, in a [session](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32962/secure-everything-for-every-endpoint) which tackles one of IT's biggest challenges: securing the rapidly growing number of endpoints in today's organizations.

With laptops, mobile devices, and IoT devices multiplying exponentially, maintaining robust security across diverse environments is more complex than ever. The webinar offers actionable insights into how unified solutions can streamline endpoint protection while simplifying management.

### Key takeaways

**Endpoint complexity and risks:** Sam Duckett discusses the challenges organizations face with endpoint sprawl and explains how disconnected tools can create gaps in security. He highlights common pitfalls in managing complex environments and the need for a cohesive approach.

**Integrated endpoint management:** The discussion considers how consolidating endpoint security tools into a single platform can enhance protection and provide better visibility. This unified strategy can eliminate silos, ensuring security policies are consistently applied across all endpoints.

**Automation and threat response:** Duckett emphasizes the role of automation in modern security workflows. He explains why automating tasks like patching and backups can minimize human error while enabling faster responses to potential threats.

As endpoint diversity grows, a centralized, automated solution could prove essential for reducing risk and boosting efficiency. Kaseya's platform highlights how integrated solutions can enhance security while simplifying operational challenges for IT teams.

For those who missed the live broadcast, you can [watch the webinar on-demand](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32962/secure-everything-for-every-endpoint) to learn how your organization can secure every endpoint effectively.
