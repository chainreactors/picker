Vulnerability Type:    Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used
                        in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')

========================================================================

Description
-----------
```

HackerOne community member Mahmoud Khaled Kanon
(<https://github.com/Kanon4>) has reported an SQL injection vulnerability
in the admin-search.php script. An attacker can craft a specific URL
that includes an SQL payload in the “keyword” parameter. The script
requires manager-level authentication for the injection to happen and
the usage of a MySQL backend. This issue affects Revive Adserver v6.0.0
only.

```
Details
-------
```

The “keyword” GET/POST parameter sent to the admin-search.php script is
used in the `matchPattern()` method of the underlying PEAR MDB2 library,
which is now largely unmaintained. The method was applying the necessary
levels of escaping in the wrong order, resulting in single quotes being
escaped twice when using a MySQL backend, effectively inserting a
backslash character instead of escaping each single quote in the input.
The result was causing a vulnerability to two types attacks:

```
  * Error-based injection using MySQL’s EXTRACTVALUE function
  * Time-based blind injection using MySQL’s SLEEP function
```

An attacker with manager-level permissions can access the page, submit
malicious queries and gather some results either via the error message
or using SLEEP and verifying response times.

```

```

Alternatively blind attacks could be performed by tricking a logged in
administrator/manager user into visiting specifically crafted URLs.
Attack vectors are currently just proof of concept, at it is unknown
what kind of information could be extracted or disrupted using such methods.

```
