# New streaming ad technology plays hide-and-seek with gamers

Posted: October 27, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A new form of digital advertising is looking to make its way to you courtesy of video gaming. However, there’s a rather peculiar twist involved. These ads won’t appear in front of you while playing; in fact, they’re designed to trigger when someone *else* is in-game. The most baffling twist of all? [Those people triggering the ads won’t see them either](https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/amazon-games-tests-experimental-ad-tech-in-game-ads-for-streamers)!

How does this work? Let’s take a look at how advertising has been used in an Amazon gaming title previously, and see how that could create a frosty reception for any new ad technology.

## The sliding doors of advertising banners

This is a push to place more advertising, and sales opportunities, in front of the huge streaming audiences which exist in Twitch channels. Twitch is owned by Amazon and the retail giant is also responsible for a number of gaming titles. Any way to synergise advertising or marketing across multiple platforms is potentially going to be a big revenue generator.

The biggest of these titles, Old World, is sometimes used for various types of advertising promotions and methods. Often, this is to the annoyance of the people playing the game who’d much rather all of this was done somewhere else. For example, just recently players were complaining about Rings of Power advert banners [inside a part of the New World title/continue screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/y6tya7/get_your_ads_out_of_new_world_amazon/). Rings of Power is developed by Amazon, and the ad promotes it as being available on Prime Video. Both show and game are fantasy worlds, so thematically there’s a connection but that doesn’t seem to have impressed at least one player out there.

## Streaming the ads

Twitch streaming is a huge business, with massive audiences and a number of increasingly rich streamers. Twitch has had various types of adverts for some time now, and here too, ads are a contentious subject. Viewers complain about what they feel are [too many ads](https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitchs-advertising-push-is-kind-of-entertaining-in-how-blatantly-dishonest-it-is.611316/) in a [short space of time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/ia5ek8/number_of_ads_is_ridiculous/), and streamers worry that ads can end up [making your channel annoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzLXWgsYvZA) or even reducing subscriber count.

A recent change to ad types and functionality made the ads “[less annoying](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22606297/twitch-stream-display-ads-disruptive-banner-screen)” overall. Even so, it seems more varied types of ad presentations were required to lower the risk of turning people away from streaming or watching altogether.

## Now you see it…now you don’t (but you might)

Way back in 2005, dynamic ads were introduced to titles like The Matrix Online. Essentially these were empty billboards, and the ad network paired up with the game could [display on-the-fly adverts](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/matrix-online-gains-real-world-advertising-from-massive-incorporated), which meant current products could always be advertised in the game.

A whole 17 years later, we have one of the first original advancements of this digital advertising concept, though it’s a bit of an odd one. It’s Old World...
