# BYOVDKit

BYOVDKit is a tool kit for utilizing vulnerable driver to perform various attack aka bring your own vulnerable driver (BYOVD) attack. I wrote this to

* make use of different vulnerable drivers easily (support DBUtil\_2\_3, RTCore64 and GIGABYTE). You can put your own driver read/write implementation in DriverOps.cpp and DriverOps.h
* calculate offset in runtime to avoid hardcoding offset
* review some of the code for learning purpose
* learn how to leverage kernel read write vulnerability
* learn kernel debug

I wont recommend you to use this in production environment as this project could cause BSOD due to PatchGuard/HVCI/etc or a wrong offset calculation. I didnt test with 32 bit system.

### Usage

```
.\BYOVDKit.exe <driver option> <argument>
        <driver option> - 0: Undefined, 1: DBUtil_2_3, 2: RTCore64, 3: GIGABYTE. Default DBUtil_2_3
Options:
Install Driver: installDrv <driver path> [service name]
Uninstall Driver: uninstallDrv <service name>
PPL options: PPL <check/disable> [PID]
        [PID] - default check or disable LSA protection
PPL options: PPL enable <PID> [<PP/PPL> <signer type>]
        [PP/PPL] - default PPL
        [signer type] - defau...
