In episode nine of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast, our hosts learn about the world‚Äôs most dangerous vending machine, a cartoonist who hypnotises himself with AI, and OpenAI‚Äôs plans to eat Google‚Äôs lunch.

Graham tells Mark about a pig-farming professor, and Mark tests Graham‚Äôs tolerance with OpenAI‚Äôs terrifying roadmap to Artificial General Intelligence.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
