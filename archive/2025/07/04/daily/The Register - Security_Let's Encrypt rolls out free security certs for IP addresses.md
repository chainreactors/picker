Let's Encrypt, a certificate authority (CA) known for its free TLS/SSL certificates, has begun issuing digital certificates for IP addresses.

It's not the first CA to do so. PositiveSSL, Sectigo, and GeoTrust all offer TLS/SSL certificates for use with IP addresses, at prices ranging from [$40 to $90 or so annually](https://www.geocerts.com/ip-address-for-ssl-certificates). But Let's Encrypt does so at no cost.

For those with a static IP address who want to host a website, an IP address certificate provides a way to offer visitors a secure connection with that numeric identifier while avoiding the nominal expense of a domain name.

### Why would one want 1.1.1.1?

Generally, web users visit websites by entering domain names, like theregister.com, into their browser. The browser checks with the domain name system (DNS) to map the text-based name to a numeric IP address, then tries to connect to the associated site.
