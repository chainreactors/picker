# IOCTLbf

This is a project from back in tha dayz, in 2011-2012. Kinda dirty code, but worked for me to find several bugs in Windows Drivers.
Here is one of them: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17902/>
More info about this tool and kernel exploitation at: <http://poppopret.blogspot.fr/>
For french people, an article was also written in *MISC Magazine #62*: <http://connect.ed-diamond.com/MISC/MISC-062/De-la-decouverte-d-une-vulnerabilite-dans-un-driver-Windows-a-l-elevation-de-privileges>

## Overview

IOCTLbf is just a small tool (Proof of Concept) that can be used to search vulnerabilities in Windows kernel drivers by performing two
tasks:

* **Scanning for valid IOCTLs codes supported by drivers,**
* **Generation-based IOCTL fuzzing**

**An advantage of this tool is that it does not rely on captured IOCTLs. Therefore, it is able to detect valid IOCTLs codes supported
by drive...
