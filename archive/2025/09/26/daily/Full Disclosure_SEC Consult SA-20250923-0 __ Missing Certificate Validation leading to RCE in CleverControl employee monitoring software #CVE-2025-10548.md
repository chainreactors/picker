Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor was unresponsive and did not answer to our communication attempts.
Therefore, a patch is not available for this security issue. End users of this
product should contact the vendor and demand a patch.

SEC Consult highly recommends performing a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Missing Certificate Validation leading to RCE (CVE-2025-10548)
When deploying the CleverControl MSI, two executables are downloaded without
checking the validity of the server certificate. Those are then executed with
SYSTEM rights. This enables an adversary-in-the-middle attacker to gain code
execution with elevated privileges on the system.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Missing Certificate Validation leading to RCE (CVE-2025-10548)
When the MSI installer file is opened with 7-zip, two script files,
`instredist.cmd` and `srec.cmd` are revealed.

<scripts.png>

Contents of `instredist.cmd`:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl.exe --insecure -o c:\ProgramData\{FO16FA1A-AA91-C56A-654F-E3865DA10DAT}\vc_redist.x86.exe
https://cdn.cdndownload.net/vc/vc_redist.x86.exe
c:\ProgramData\{FO16FA1A-AA91-C56A-654F-E3865DA10DAT}\vc_redist.x86.exe /install /quiet /norestart /log redist.log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contents of `srec.cmd`:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl.exe --insecure -o "C:\ProgramData\{FO16FA1A-AA91-C56A-654F-E3865DA10DAT}\srec(%1).msi"
https://cdn.cdndownload.net/sprec/%2/srec(%1).msi
msiexec /x "C:\ProgramData\{FO16FA1A-AA91-C56A-654F-E3865DA10DAT}\srec(%1).msi" /qn
msiexec /i "C:\ProgramData\{FO16FA1A-AA91-C56A-654F-E3865DA10DAT}\srec(%1).msi" /qn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monitoring the installation process with `ProcMon` shows that these scripts are
indeed executed during the installation:

<procmon.png>

Because curl.exe is started with the `--insecure` flag, the TLS certificate of
the server is not validated. This means that the TLS connection can be
intercepted by an attacker with an adversary-in-the-middle attack.

Therefore, an attacker who can perform such an attack can respond with malicious
files like `vc_redist.x86.exe` or `srec(english).msi` and execute malware with
SYSTEM privileges.

This attack is demonstrated in the following animation which mimics an
adversary-in-the-middle attacker by hard-coding the DNS resolution for
`cdn.cdndownload.net` to point to localhost and by hosting the malicious file
on localhost with `updog`. The malicious .exe file was generated with the following
msfvenom command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
msfvenom -p windows/adduser USER=owned -f exe -o vc_redist.x86.exe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
