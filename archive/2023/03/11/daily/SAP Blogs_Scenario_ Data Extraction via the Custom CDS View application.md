Extracting data in mass from SAP S/4HANA using custom CDS view has multiple use cases. In this blog, let‚Äôs look at the steps for creating a custom CDS (Core Data Service) view that is enabled for data extraction with associations, using the **Custom CDS Views** application.

**Prerequisite: -**

* To open the Custom CDS View app, the key user has to be assigned to a business role being part of business catalog ‚ÄúExtensibility ‚Äì Custom CDS Views‚Äù (ID:SAP\_CORE\_BC\_EXT\_CCV).

The role ‚ÄúAnalytics Specialist‚Äù (ID: SAP\_BR\_ANALYTICS\_SPECIALIST) is one example.

**Steps: -**

1. Open the **Custom CDS Views**
