# Weekly Update 410

28 July 2024

Who would have thought that just a few hours after recording the previous week's video, the world would descend into what has undoubtedly become the largest IT outage we've ever seen:

> I donâ€™t think itâ€™s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history
>
> â€” Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) [July 19, 2024](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1814198760387596407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=troyhunt.com)

By virtue of the CrowdStrike incident occurring in friendly office hours for my corner of the world, I was able to get a thread on it going pretty early on. That tweet above has been seen 315k times at the time of writing and ended up being splashed across the global media. Unsurprisingly, I then spent the better part of the next three days doing endless interviews... and very little else. The question that constantly came up was "could this happen again?" to which the answer is obviously "yes". However, it *was* unprecedented despite the huge number of previous updates CloudStrike had sent out, not to mention all the times Windows itself has updated without a calamity anywhere near the scape of this one. But the mind does wander - "what if?" - and you think about just how bad this *could* be if things went wrong at just the right point ðŸ¤”
