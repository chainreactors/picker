# Identifying the cyber risks that matter

## From noise to clarity: Why CISOs are shifting to adversarial exposure validation

Partner content A vast majority of security teams are overwhelmed by the large number of security alerts and vulnerabilities.

As attack surfaces expand and adversaries evolve their tactics, it is becoming increasingly hard to separate noise from actual threat. With hundreds of potential exposures across the IT infrastructure, the challenge isn't just identifying risks but knowing which ones actually matter.

The hard truth? It's impossible to remediate every single exposure. Many vulnerabilities are either too insignificant or too isolated to be meaningfully exploited. Others may have high severity scores on paper yet pose little real-world risk. In addition, compensating controls often block malicious attempts before they can successfully target vulnerable assets. Attempting to fix everything often results in wasted resources and leaves the most dangerous exposures untouched.

As a professional with over a decade of experience in offensive security and threat intelligence, I have witnessed firsthand how this challenge impacts organizations. Throughout my career, I have learned that achieving true resilience is not about addressing every vulnerability but about identifying and validating the exposures that truly m...
