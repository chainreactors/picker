# Millions of people spied on by malicious browser extensions in Chrome and Edge

Posted: July 9, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

[Researchers](https://blog.koi.security/google-and-microsoft-trusted-them-2-3-million-users-installed-them-they-were-malware-fb4ed4f40ff5) have discovered a campaign that tracked users’ online behavior using 18 [browser extensions](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/browser-extensions) available in the official Chrome and Edge webstores. The total number of installs is estimated to be over two million.

These extensions offered functionality, received good reviews, touted verification badges, and some even enjoyed featured placement.

But when an extension has been available in the web store for a while, cybercriminals can insert malicious code through updates to the extension. Some researchers refer to the clean extensions as “[sleeper agents](https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/sleeper-sound-layerx-uncovers-malicious-sleeper-sound-management-extensions-with-nearly-1-5-million-users-worldwide/).” These sleeper agents are the bases for future malicious activity.

Here’s one example of a malicious extension which poses as a search for Chat GPT, and was available for months.

![example of a malicous extension](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/example.jpg?w=1024)

Some of these extensions behaved nicely for years, which made the researchers think they might have been compromised. What these extensions did after they got “woken up” was they deployed a browser hijacking mechanism that activates every time someone navigates to a new page.

Every time the person visits a website, the extension would:

1. Capture the URL of the page they’re visiting.
2. Send it to a remote server along with a unique ID issued to track the user.
3. Receive potential redirect URLs from the [command and control (C&C) server](https://www.malwarebytes.com/glossary/cc).
4. Automatically redirect your browser if instructed by the C&C server to do so.

The researchers used the following example of how this might work:

> “You receive a Zoom meeting invitation and click the link. Instead of joining your meeting, one of the malicious extensions intercepts your request and redirects you to a convincing fake page claiming you need to download a “critical Zoom update” to join. You download what appears to be legitimate software, but you’ve just installed additional [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) onto your system, potentially leading to full machine takeover and complete compromise of your device.”

Most of the malicious extensions have been removed from the web stores.

[Reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malicious-chrome-extensions-with-17m-installs-found-on-web-store/), 1.7 million people installed these malicious extensions from the Chrome web store and a total of [2.3 million users](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/08/browser_hijacking_campaign/) were affected.

Although we always advise people to only install extensions from official web stores, this proves that not all extensions you download from there are safe. However, the risk involved in getting an extension from outside the web store is even bigger.
