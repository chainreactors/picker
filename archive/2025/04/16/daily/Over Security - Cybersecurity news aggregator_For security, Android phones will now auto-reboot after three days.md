# For security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

1:59 PM PDT · April 15, 2025

Google’s mobile operating system Android will now automatically reboot if the phone is locked for three days in a row.

On Monday, the tech giant [pushed updates to Google Play services](https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500), a core part of Android that provides functionalities for apps and the operating system itself. Listed under “Security & Privacy” is a new security feature that “will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days.”

Last year, [Apple rolled out the same feature for iOS](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/14/new-apple-security-feature-reboots-iphones-after-3-days-researchers-confirm/). The thinking behind adding an automatic reboot after a certain period of inactivity is to make life more difficult for someone who is trying to unlock or extract data from a phone; for example, law enforcement using a forensic analysis device like those made by [Cellebrite](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/cellebrite-suspends-serbia-as-customer-after-claims-police-used-firms-tech-to-plant-spyware/) or [Magnet Forensics](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/20/thoma-bravo-agrees-to-acquire-digital-forensics-firm-magnet-forensics-for-over-1b/).

Before a phone is switched on and unlocked, certain data stored within is fully encrypted and harder to access without the user’s passcode. This is known as the “Before First Unlock” state. Once unlocked, on the other hand, some data gets decrypted and can potentially be accessed by bruteforcing the passcode or taking advantage of security flaws, which is generally how law enforcement forensic devices work. This state is known as “After First Unlock.”

Google did not respond to a request for comment, asking what was the motivation behind this new feature.
