[Fake Browser Update](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/03/new-wave-of-socgholish-infections-impersonates-wordpress-plugins.html) campaigns are known for their deceptive tactics used by hackers to trick users into downloading malicious software. These campaigns typically involve injecting malicious code into a website, which then displays a popup message urging users to update their web browser. Clicking on the provided link usually results in downloading malware, such as a [remote access trojan](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/02/remote-access-trojan-rat-types-mitigation-removal.html) or an infostealer.

One of the most notorious examples of this type of malware is [SocGholish](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html). However, our research team has been tracking a new campaign that has been active since late April 2024. This campaign follows a similar pattern but includes some unique characteristics that make it particularly concerning.

## How the malware works

The infection process for this new fake browser update campaign begins with the injection of malicious code into vulnerable websites. Once the website is compromised, visitors are presented with the following misleading popup message a few seconds after the webpage loads:

![Warning Exploit Chrome Detect Update Browser](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/update-chrome-browser-600x285.png)

The message, written in poor English, reads: **Warning Exploit Chrome Detect. Update Chrome Browser** and includes a large blue **Update** button. The pop-up is displayed even to users who are not using the Chrome browser, highlighting its deceptive (and amateurish) nature.

When a user clicks on the **Update** button, they are redirected to one of several malicious URLs designed to initiate a malware download. The URLs involved in this campaign include:

* hxxps://photoshop-adobe[.]shop/download/**dwnl.php**
* hxxps://brow-ser-update[.]top/download/**dwnl.php**
* hxxps://tinyurl[.]com/uoiqwje3

Creation dates for the malicious domains indicate that the campaign could have been distributed as early as March:

* brow-ser-update[.]top – created on May 3, 2024.
* photoshop-adobe[.]shop – created on March 14, 2024

Although these URLs are no longer functional, they previously served malicious downloads commonly named **GoogleChrome-x86.msix** from server [**185.196.9[.]156**](https://urlscan.io/search/#page.ip:%22185.196.9.156%22).

![Malicious download commonly named GoogleChrome-x86.msix](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GoogleChrome-86x-msix.png)

At the time of writing, PublicWWW currently finds this fake browser update popup [on 341 websites](https://publicwww.com/websites/%22sans-serif%5C%22%3EWarning%2BExploit%2BChrome%2BDetect%3C/div%3E%22/). Sucuri’s [SiteCheck remote website scanner](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) detects this threat as **malware.fake\_update.3**.

## Technical details

The malicious code injected into compromised websites is designed to execute a popup message using the following legitimate WordPress plugin: **Hustle – Email Marketing, Lead Generation, Optins, Popups** This plugin is commonly used for creating popups and opt-in forms, making it an ideal tool for attackers to exploit.

In the page source, the malicious injections appear as follows:

![Malicious code in hustle plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/malicious-code-hustle-plugin.png)

The code is often found in JSON files located in the **wp-content/uploads** directory, such as:

* wp-content/uploads/2024/04/**hustle-popup-20240425-111136-[redacted]-ffsf.json**
* wp-content/uploads/2024/05/**import.json**

The injected code may also be found stored in the **wp\_hustle\_modules\_meta** table within the WordPress database.

Initially, we suspected a vulnerability within the Hustle plugin itself. However, further investigation revealed tha...
