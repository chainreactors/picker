# Locking down the remote printer

## No longer a blind spot, printer security is now a grown up conversation says Brother

Sponsored Feature As businesses journey deeper into an era of restless digital change, it's surprising how inventions from past decades still define the office environment.

Today, as in the 1990s, the main work device is still likely to be a desktop PC or laptop, while local applications such as Microsoft 365 remain a fact of life. And then there's the workgroup laser printer, a mainstay which almost single-handedly killed the notion that offices were destined to become paperless utopias.

Another lingering perception is the assumption that printers are benign servants that can do us no harm.  This is despite printers being fully featured computers which run their own internal OS, RAM, storage, and network connectivity, and present an attack surface big enough to make the device and its documents an obvious target for compromise.

Meanwhile printers have acquired new capabilities over the years such as scanning, advanced document storage, and remote management interfaces that let admins connect to them via a surprisingly long list of protocols.
