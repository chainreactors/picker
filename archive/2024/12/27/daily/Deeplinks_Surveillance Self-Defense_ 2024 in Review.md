This year, we celebrated the [15th anniversary of our Surveillance-Self Defense](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/celebrating-15-years-surveillance-self-defense) (SSD) guide. How’d we celebrate? We kept at it—continuing to work on, refine, and update one of the longest running security and privacy guides on the internet.

Technology changes quickly enough as it is, but so does the language we use to describe that technology. In order for SSD to thrive, it needs careful attention throughout the year. So, we like to think of SSD as a garden, always in need of a little watering, maybe some trimming, and the occasional mowing down of dead technologies.

## Brushing Up on the Basics

A large chunk of SSD exists to explain concepts around digital security in the hopes that you can take that knowledge to make your own decisions about your specific needs. As we often say, security is a mindset, not a purchase. But in order to foster that mindset, you need some basic knowledge. This year, we set out to refine some of this guidance in the hopes of making it easier to read and useful for a variety of skill levels. The guides we updated included:

* [Choosing Your Tools](https://ssd.eff.org/module/choosing-your-tools)
* [Communicating with Others](https://ssd.eff.org/module/communicating-others)
* [Keeping Your Data Safe](https://ssd.eff.org/module/keeping-your-data-safe)
* [Seven Steps to Digital Security](https://ssd.eff.org/module/seven-steps-digital-security)
* [Why Metadata Matters](https://ssd.eff.org/module/why-metadata-matters)
* [What Is Fingerprinting?](https://ssd.eff.org/modul...
