13 October 2024

Linux Security

In this video we demonstrate Sandfly's new file and directory stealth rootkit de-cloaking feature on the *sedexp* malware targeting Linux. We also show how it works for the *Diamorpine* and *Reptile* rootkits which are frequently used as the basis for new stealth malware. The hiding tactics used are made instantly visible with our agentless Linux security platform.

### sedexp Stealth Malware

The sedexp malware was [recently reported by AON](https://www.aon.com/en/insights/cyber-labs/unveiling-sedexp). We recommend you read this report to learn how this malware operates and targeted financial services.
