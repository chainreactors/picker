[![Critical Langflow Flaw](data:image/png;base64... "Critical Langflow Flaw")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhw6sLlizbyssgoIYMOEX4lqWt_3mEDPsaarzYSyeiNQTZKoNGTa_DtPhOqZnGkt-4ThjqSIj1aXjP_Ok6z0bu255_1ZbZNLSS8HrzZ_8K9ZY83bSWFQ_uW79mv7YpgZy-OSIHJPI-np-zeYk1fjLTHdC2FZI10C0OGeqCgCbU42DLnprh6Apua4hSEyZEC/s790-rw-e365/langflow.jpg)

A [recently disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/weekly-recap-critical-sap-exploit-ai.html) critical security flaw impacting the open-source Langflow platform has been [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/05/05/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog) to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), citing evidence of active exploitation.

The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-3248**, carries a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10.0.

"Langflow contains a missing authentication vulnerability in the /api/v1/validate/code endpoint that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP requests," CISA said.

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

Specifically, the endpoint has been found to improperly invoke Python's built-in exec() function on user-supplied code without adequate authentication or sandboxing, thereby allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

The shortcoming, which affects most versions of the popular tool, has been addressed in [version 1.3.0](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/releases/tag/1.3.0) released on March 31, 2025. Horizon3.ai has been credited with discovering and reporting the flaw in February.

[![Critical Langflow Flaw](data:image/png;base64... "Critical Langflow Flaw")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7EnIcqjdp3sDmVX3JEFpFJybDpyXh3f9_z3bTPyBiDxZ6gOIwA46kLRBaaZzTxuCyysRh02_oa-jlHBDVDsej6EjOuxz8IDTmymX6-1upqM_IWXdl8-d9mJY4h8tEVb14p2zgJkA96JkHhgZ0tEzs2VhqC8krWNrwS-KKq5OxTQbtec7Eb0kCZ-0SenO-/s790-rw-e365/poc.jpg)

According to the company, the vulnerability is "[easily exploitable](https://horizon3.ai/attack-research/disclosures/unsafe-at-any-speed-abusing-python-exec-for-unauth-rce-in-langflow-ai/)" and allows unauthenticated remote attackers to take control of Langflow servers. A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has since been made [publicly available](https://x.com/_r00tuser/status/1909858365234463122) as of April 9, 2025, by other researchers.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

Data from attack surface management platform Censys [shows](https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=services.http.response.body%3Alangflow) that there are 466 internet-exposed Langflow instances, with a majority of them concentrated in the United States, Germany, Singapore, India, and China.

It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being abused in real-world attacks, by whom, and for what purpose, although the SANS Technology Institute [said](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Exploit%2BAttempts%2Bfor%2BRecent%2BLangflow%2BAI%2BVulnerability%2BCVE20253248/31850/) it recorded exploit attempts targeting the flaw against its honeypots. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have time until May 26, 2025, to apply the fixes.

"CVE-2025-3248 highlights the risks of executing dynamic code without secure authentication and sandboxing measures," Zscaler [noted](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cve-2025-3248-rce-vulnerability-langflow) last month. "This vulnerability serves as a critical reminder for organizations to approach code-validation features with caution, particularly in applications exposed to the internet."

### Update

Attack surface management platform Censys [said](https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2025-3248) it has observed 1,156 exposed Langflow servers online, nearly half of which are located in the United States. Of these, 360 servers appear to be running a vulnerable version. As many as 509 servers did not advertise a version.
