Dr 90210 finds himself in a sticky situation after his patients‚Äô plastic surgery photos AND more end up in the hands of hackers, emails to the US military end up in the wrong hands, and script kiddies salivate at the thought of Business Email Compromise powered by generative AI.

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by T-Minus Space Daily‚Äôs Maria Varmazis.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
