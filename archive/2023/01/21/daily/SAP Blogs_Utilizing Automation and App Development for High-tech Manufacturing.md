Everyone has heard about the shortage of semiconductors. According to the NY Times (2022), the demand for semiconductors between 2019 to 2021 increased by 17 percent, which also caused supply-demand chain disruptions.

Given the global shortfall, and how much we rely on silicon for everything from our cars to watches to computers, it is possible that many industries are facing as much pressure to reduce errors and improve efficiencies. At SAP, we understand these challenges, and SAP Build Process Automation can help organizations by enabling a simpler and faster way to automate business processes via low-code, no-code solutions.

Recently my colleague sat down with valued SAP Partner, ConvergentIS, to learn how they utilized SAP Build Process Automation to drive innovation for a high-tech manufacturing company that specializes in computer chip fabrication equipment and services. The customer combines system engineering and technology leadership to provide equipment that makes computer chips that can be found in the technology we use daily. The process looks like this: they receive returned equipment, refurbish it, certify it, and then resell it. In the computer chip manufacturing industry, businesses often want to upgrade to the latest technology to meet the standards of high-tech end-customers. However, the existing technology still works fine and is viable for secondary markets– like chips for the car and smartphone industry.

With the global demand for computer chips, it’s essential that end customers can leverage quality equipment and necessary technology to meet market demands. ConvergentIS implemented SAP Build Process Automation as a solution to their customer’s industry needs. The customer wanted to address the improper data integration, the manual effort, and processes for financial and supply-demand reporting and wanted an overall better long-term solution.

Better business performance was achieved by automating many of these processes to fast-track the approvals process. For example, the customer was able to:

* Reduce turnaround time for business approvals by 75%

* Reduce manual effort in inventory and supply-demand capabilities by 50% with better reporting

* Reduce the need to work with different data systems and platforms by 80%

* Provide better visibility to track key event changes by 100%

The customer can use a new, intuitive user interface for workflow management and an automated business process that unclogs the complicated approval process.

In addition to the process automation, ConvergentIS is utilizing SAP Mobile Services and implemented a mobile app, which was designed to easily keep track of inventory and equipment parts. ConvergentIS’ customer now has an easy-to-maintain and long-term solution for tracking, maintenance, and consumption of goods inventory. The combination of automation and the ability to rapidly react on a mobile device have helped their customer see an increase in overall productivity by 80%.
