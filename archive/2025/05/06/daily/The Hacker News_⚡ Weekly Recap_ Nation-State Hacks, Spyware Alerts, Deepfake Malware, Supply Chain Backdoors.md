What if attackers aren't breaking in‚Äîthey're already inside, watching, and adapting?

This week showed a sharp rise in stealth tactics built for long-term access and silent control. AI is being used to shape opinions. Malware is hiding inside software we trust. And old threats are returning under new names. The real danger isn't just the breach‚Äîit's not knowing who's still lurking in your systems. If your defenses can't adapt quickly, you're already at risk.

Here are the key cyber events you need to pay attention to this week.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Lemon Sandstorm Targets Middle East Critical Infra** ‚Äî The Iranian state-sponsored threat group tracked as Lemon Sandstorm [targeted](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/iranian-hackers-maintain-2-year-access.html) an unnamed critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the Middle East and maintained long-term access that lasted for nearly two years using custom backdoors like HanifNet, HXLibrary, and NeoExpressRAT. The activity, which lasted from at least May 2023 to February 2025, entailed "extensive espionage operations and suspected network prepositioning ‚Äì a tactic often used to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage," according to Fortinet.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Claude Abused in "Influence-as-a-Service" Operation** ‚Äî Artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic has [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/claude-ai-exploited-to-operate-100-fake.html) that unknown threat actors leveraged its Claude chatbot for an "influence-as-a-service" operation to engage with authentic accounts across Facebook and X using over 100 fake personas. What's novel about the operation is that it utilized Claude to make tactical engagement decisions such as determining whether social media bot accounts should like, share, comment on, or ignore specific posts created by other accounts based on political objectives aligned with their clients' interests. The bot accounts were used to amplify their clients' political narratives.
* **SentinelOne Uncovers PurpleHaze Activity** ‚Äî Cybersecurity company SentinelOne has [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/sentinelone-uncovers-chinese-espionage.html) that a China-nexus threat cluster dubbed PurpleHaze conducted reconnaissance attempts against its infrastructure and some of its high-value customers. PurpleHaze is assessed to be a hacking crew with loose ties to another state-sponsored group known as APT15 and has also been observed targeting an unnamed South Asian government-supporting entity in October 2024, employing an operational relay box (ORB) network and a Windows backdoor called GoReShell.
* **RansomHub Ransomware Operation Goes Dark** ‚Äî In an interesting twist, RansomHub, an aggressive ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that gained prominence over the past year by courting affiliates in the wake of law enforcement actions against LockBit and BlackCat, appears to have abruptly [gone offline](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/ransomhub-went-dark-april-1-affiliates.html) in early April. The sudden cessation has raised speculations that cybercriminals associated with the ransomware scheme may have migrated to Qilin, which has had a resurgence in recent months. It's also being claimed that RansomHub had moved its operations to DragonForce, a rival ransomware group that has announced the formation of a new "cartel." Besides offering a multi-platform encryptor malware, RansomHub attracted attention for giving affiliates more autonomy to communicate directly with victims and to collect ransom payments from them. It also offered detailed guidance on how to extort ransom payments from victims.
* **Meta Announces New Private Processing Feature for WhatsApp** ‚Äî In an attempt to balance privacy and artificial intelligence features, Meta announced a new WhatsApp setting it says is a privacy-oriented way to interact with Meta AI. Called Private Processing, the feature is optional and, launches in the coming weeks, and neither Meta, WhatsApp nor third-party companies will be able to see interactions that use it. The system Meta describes is very similar to Apple's Private Cloud Compute (PCC). Like Apple, Meta says it will relay Private Processing requests through a third-party OHTTP provider to obscure users' IP addresses. But one crucial difference is that all of WhatsApp's AI requests are handled on Meta's servers and its current architecture is purpose-built for WhatsApp. In a statement shared with WIRED, security researcher and cryptographer Matt Green [said](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-private-processing-generative-ai-security-risks/) "any end-to-end encrypted system that uses off-device AI inference is going to be riskier than a pure end-to-end system" and that "more private data will go off the device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation-state adversaries."
