Hi all,

Last year in August I joined Amnesty International’s Security Lab. Amnesty International’s Security Lab leads cutting-edge technical investigations into cyber-attacks against activists and journalists. Last year we published the [Predator Files](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/), which exposed Intellexa selling the Predator spyware through a broker, to Vietnam. In December, we found traces of [BLASTPASS](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2023/12/india-damning-new-forensic-investigation-reveals-repeated-use-of-pegasus-spyware-to-target-high-profile-journalists/), an exploit from NSO Group on the iPhone of a journalist in India.

Our latest is research uncovering a murky web of brokers and resellers who’ve sold spyware to Indonesia. This was a collaborative research with [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/), [Inside Story](https://insidestory.gr/), [Tempo](https://en.tempo.co/), [WAV research collective](https://wav.info/) and [Woz](https://www.woz.ch/).

We’ve found shipment data through import and export database from spyware companies like: NSO Group, Candiru, FinFisher, Wintego Systems and Intellexa matched a network fingerprint.

I hope this pigued your interest! The research brief can be found on on Amnesty’s Security Lab [website](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2024/05/a-web-of-surveillance/).

Best,

Jurre
