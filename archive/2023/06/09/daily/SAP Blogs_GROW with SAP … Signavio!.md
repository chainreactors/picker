With our latest SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite release in [May 2023](https://www.signavio.com/release-notes/sap-signavio-process-intelligence-may-2023-release/), we announced the general availability of the new SAP S/4HANA CDS connector for SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.

In this blog post, we will see how, by leveraging this new connection, any enterprise investing in **GROW with SAP** can now complement their program with **SAP Signavio**, accelerating process mining initiatives on top of their SAP S/4HANA systems.

# GROW with SAP

SAP introduced GROW with SAP in March 2023 to support any size of company – particularly within the mid-market customer segment – to successfully adopt cloud ERP, as an alternative to the RISE with SAP offering, which was primarily launched for larger and upper-mid market enterprises.

It’s a comprehensive offering combining SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, faster adoption services, best practices, embedded AI, and SAP Business Technology Platform. To know more, you can read this [article](https://blogs.one.int.sap/sapnews_en/2023/03/grow-with-sap/).

SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition is a ready-to-run cloud ERP that enables enterprises to accelerate their business by delivering the latest industry best practices and continuous innovation, leading to growth at speed and scale.

The GROW with SAP offering comes exactly two years after the acquisition of Signavio, which was “one of the most strategic ones SAP has done” (Christian Klein). The SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite plays a key role in SAP strategy, enabling organizations not only to understand their existing business processes but also to proactively manage and optimize those processes to achieve the agility needed to succeed and thrive.

There is no wonder that SAP Signavio was one of the hottest tickets at Sapphire 2023!

# From zero to value with SAP S/4HANA public cloud and SAP Signavio

How to leverage the adoption of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, and the power of SAP Signavio?

With the new connector to SAP S/4HANA systems via CDS views for SAP Signavio Process Intelligence, available with May 2023 release, customers can now run and accelerate process mining initiatives to every business process implemented in their SAP S/4HANA systems helping them achieve operational efficiency fast and at scale.

SAP Signavio Process Intelligence is the process mining solution in the SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite. Jointly with SAP Signavio Process Insights, it has been recognized as a leader in the process mining market, in the first Gartner Magic Quadrant reported for process mining tools. You can learn more in this [blog post.](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/28/sap-signavio-recognized-as-a-leader-in-2023-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-process-mining-tools/)

You can check out this [SAP Enable Now demo](https://sapsignavio.enable-now.cloud.sap/pub/releases/index.html?show=project!PR_4F57D6A0EADC479ABC14172DF9AFCED8:praxis#2), to see the new connector in action: with SAP Signavio Process Intelligence, customers can quickly – in a matter of minutes – derive process mining insights on their SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition system, leveraging on its standard data model. In this example, the demo focuses on the Invoice to Cash process.

# Enterprise Automation

How can we then turn process mining insights into action?

Julia White at SAP Sapphire announced the [Enterprise Automation](https://news.sap.com/2023/05/innovating-with-sap-btp/), a new solution that uses multiple advanced technologies — integration, automation, low-code, and AI — to help connect and automate complex end-to-end business processes. This solution leverages the best-in-class SAP Integration Suite, SAP Signavio solutions, and SAP Build solutions to enable users to quickly and easily connect to SAP S/4HANA systems – in general, in any on-premise or cloud IT landscape –, gain visibility into business processes, and then automate those processes seamlessly, with the ultimate goal to build an intelligent, sustainable enterprise.

Learn more about how to enable the Enterprise Automation with SAP solutions in this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/23/enterprise-automation-with-sap-signavio-solutions/).
