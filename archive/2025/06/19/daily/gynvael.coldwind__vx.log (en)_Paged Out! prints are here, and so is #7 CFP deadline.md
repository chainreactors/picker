## [Paged Out! prints are here, and so is #7 CFP deadline](?id=805)

paged out

![](img/po6print.jpg)

Paged Out! was always intended as a PDF+print zine, but the "print" part turned out to be pretty elusive. We actually did an initial test print of 500 copies in 2019 for a conference I've co-organized (Security PWNing), but that's it. Until last month that is, when we pretty much got back on track with prints — both free prints for events, and — additionally — print on demand if someone wants to buy a copy. We actually also updated the website with a lot of print-related information.

So let's cut to the chase — **how to get printed Paged Out!**?

* You can buy it in the first print-on-demand online bookstore we onboarded: [lulu.com/spotlight/pagedout](https://www.lulu.com/spotlight/pagedout)
  Note: there's a [normal](https://www.lulu.com/shop/paged-out-institute/paged-out-6-pagedout6/paperback/product-kv55657.html?page=1&pageSize=4) edition, and there are [spon](https://www.lulu.com/shop/paged-out-institute/paged-out-6-gold-sponsorship-edition-pagedout6/paperback/product-w4y7vyw.html?page=1&pageSize=4)[sor](https://www.lulu.com/shop/paged-out-institute/paged-out-6-platinum-sponsorship-edition-pagedout6/paperback/product-yvygng9.html?page=1&pageSize=4)[ship](https://www.lulu.com/shop/paged-out-institute/paged-out-6-diamond-sponsorship-edition-pagedout6/paperback/product-57y8g8m.html?page=1&pageSize=4) editions — there's no difference between them apart from the price and the back cover; get a sponsorship one if you want to show additional love for the zine :)
* You can collect one for free at one of these events: [pagedout.institute/?page=event-prints.php](https://pagedout.institute/?page=event-prints.php)
  Note: Revisit this list from time to time — it keeps growing.
* And finally, you can print it yourself: [pagedout.institute/?page=personal-prints.php](https://pagedout.institute/?page=personal-prints.php)

At the same time if you or your company would like to sponsor some Paged Out! prints for a specific event or in general, please let us know (prints AT pagedout DOT institute).

So far only issue #6 is available, but we're working on getting all of them out there, including older ones. We're basically going one by one, first #5, then #4, and so on.

Speaking of issues — **Call For Articles for issue #7 now has a soft deadline: 30 June 2025**

As usual, we're accepting technical 1-page articles about everything interesting related to computers, electronics, radio, and so on. See [pagedout.institute/?page=cfp.php](https://pagedout.institute/?page=cfp.php) for details.

Note: We're having problems getting articles about retro computers, speedrunning, and movement techniques in games (e.g. Apex Legends), so if you can write about that, please do; and if you know someone who could write something about this, please ping them. Of course all the usual topics are welcomed too, as always.
