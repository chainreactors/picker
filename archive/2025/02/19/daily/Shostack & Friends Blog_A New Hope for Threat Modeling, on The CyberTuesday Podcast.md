# A New Hope for Threat Modeling, on The CyberTuesday Podcast

Adam was on the CyberTuesday podcast

I recently had the pleasure of joining [Simon Whittaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwhittaker/) on the CyberTuesday podcast
for a wide-ranging discussion about threat modeling and organizational culture.
I wanted to share some key themes we explored.

One of the core messages I emphasized is how we can make threat modeling more accessible.
If you’ve read my recent blog post on [Hoarding, Debt and Threat Modeling](https://shostack.org/blog/hoarding-debt-and-threat-modeling/), you’ll hear me reiterate
how people often try to model everything at once and get overwhelmed in the process.
Instead, I advocate for starting with four simple questions:

1. What are we working on?

2. What can go wrong?

3. What are we going to do about it?

4. Did we do a good job?

The Four Question Framework is a structured and repeatable set of questions that then opens the door for anyone to threat model.

Simon and I also dove into how security integrates with modern development practices in organizations. There's often a tension between rapid deployment and security considerations, but it doesn't have to be this way. We talked about focusing security efforts on hard-to-reverse decisions like APIs and protocols. And as development ramps up, we can empower developers to handle security considerations throughout the decision-making process. I appreciated Simon's thoughtful questions about organizational culture and how it affects security.
