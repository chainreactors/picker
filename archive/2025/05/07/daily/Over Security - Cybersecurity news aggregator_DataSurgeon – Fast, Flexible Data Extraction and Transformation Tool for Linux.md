**DataSurgeon** is an open-source Linux-based data extraction and transformation tool designed for forensic investigations and recovery scenarios. It operates directly on block devices or image files, letting you surgically carve out and analyze data with a focus on speed and flexibility.

At a high level, it allows you to:

* Carve and extract specific file types (based on signatures) from raw disk images.
* Analyze and recover deleted or fragmented files.
* Transform carved files into readable formats for investigation.
* Operate at high speed even on large datasets or multi-terabyte devices.

Whether you’re working a compromised machine, a corrupted hard drive, or a CTF challenge, DataSurgeon gives you a powerful edge.

### Key Features of DataSurgeon

* **Signature-Based File Carving**: Uses binary signatures (headers/footers) to identify and extract files like images, documents, executables, and archives from raw device images.
* **Speed Optimized**: Built with multi-threading capabilities, letting you carve data at high speed without sacrificing accuracy.
* **Flexible Extraction Modes**: Target specific file types or operate across all recognizable types depending on your investigation needs.
* **Direct Device or Image File Operation**: No need for intermediate file conversion—point it at a device or `.img` file and start extracting.
* **Forensics-First Design**: Minimal footprint, precise logging, and metadata preservation to maintain evidentiary integrity.
* **Open Source and Actively Maintained**: Developed in C++ for performance and transparency.

### Real-World Use Cases

* **Incident Response**: Quickly extract valuable files from compromised drives without fully imaging or mounting the filesystem.
* **Forensic Investigations**: Carve evidence from damaged or partially wiped drives, SD cards, or USB sticks.
* **CTF and Red Team Challenges**: Recover hidden flags or confidential files left on “discarded” disk images.
* **Data Recovery**: Rescue photos, documents, and other critical files from corrupted or formatted partitions.

Basically, anywhere you’d use something like **foremost** or **scalpel**—but faster, more controllable, and less frustrating.
