# 23andMe raked by Congress on privacy, sale of genetic data

Posted: June 11, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In a Senate hearing adequately titled “23 and You: The Privacy and National Security Implications of the 23andMe Bankruptcy,” 23andMe executives addressed concerns about the privacy implications of the company’s sale and the handling of associated genetic data.

For those who missed the latest developments, in May 2025, [we reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/05/23andme-and-its-customers-genetic-data-bought-by-a-pharmaceutical-org) that 23andMe had agreed to sell itself to the pharmaceutical organization Regeneron for $256 million. In that agreed sale, Regeneron was also going to acquire the genetic data of 23andMe’s customers. But in early June, 23andMe’s former CEO Anne Wojcicki put forth a last-minute bid of $305 million, throwing Regeneron’s purchase into question, and placing 23andMe itself [back on auction](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/05/23andme-ceo-bid-anne-wojcicki).

The bid was made through the TTAM Research Institute, a nonprofit medical research organization recently set up by Wojcicki.

We explained earlier how consumers could (and why they maybe should) delete their genetic data from 23andMe. Apparently, people listened. Interim CEO Joe Selsavage said at the hearing that since the [company’s March bankruptcy filing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/23andme-bankruptcy-how-to-delete-your-data-and-stay-safe-from-the-2023-breach), 1.9 million of the company’s 15 million customers have chosen to delete their data.

Committee chairman James Comer said in opening remarks:

> “It is imperative that 23andMe … ensure there is absolutely no legal or illegal way for foreign adversaries or anyone else to access or manipulate and abuse Americans’ genetic data to advance their nefarious agendas.”

The urgency of the matter, undoubtedly enhanced by the [way 23andMe has handled data sales and breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/01/23andme-blames-negligent-breach-victims-says-its-their-own-fault) in the past, lies in the impending sale of the company.

The committee criticized the company for failing to model the potential transfer of customers’ genetic data in the upcoming sale with an “opt-in” framework, and ruled that 23andMe made it too cumbersome for consumers to delete the data—23andMe’s biggest asset in the sale.

US Representative Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia said:

> “If there simply was a ‘delete my data’ page or button somewhere more prominent then I think it would be easier for a lot of people to feel that control.”

During the hearing, interim CEO Selsavage and former CEO Wojcicki repeatedly declined to commit to establishing a customer opt-in mechanism, specifically one that would *require* consumers’ approval before their data could be sold and transferred to a new owner, despite multiple requests from committee members.

Beyond the threat of genetic data falling into foreign hands, many raised concerns that the sale could enable targeted advertising aimed at individuals with mental health conditions, drive up insurance premiums, or restrict access to credit.

23andMe assured the committee that regardless of who wins the auction, the company will not be sold to any entity unless it agrees to uphold the existing privacy policy.
