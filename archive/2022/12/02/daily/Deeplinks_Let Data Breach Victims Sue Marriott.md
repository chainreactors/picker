A company harvested your personal data, but failed to take basic steps to secure it. So thieves stole it. Now you’ve lost control of your data, and you’re at greater risk of identity theft. But when you sue the negligent company, they say you haven’t really been injured, so you don’t belong in court – not unless you can prove a specific economic harm on top of the obvious privacy harm.

We say “no way.” Along with our friends at [EPIC](https://epic.org/), and with assistance from [Morgan & Morgan](https://www.forthepeople.com/), EFF recently filed an [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/document/2022-11-22-re-marriott-4th-cir-amicus-brief-eff-and-epic) arguing that negligent data breaches inflict grievous privacy harms in and of themselves, and so the victims have “standing” to sue in federal court – without the need to prove more. The case, *In re Marriott Customer Data Breach,* arises from the 2018 [breach](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/30/marriott-discloses-massive-data-breach-impacting-million-guests/) of more than 130 million records from the hotel company’s reservation system. This included guests’ names, phone numbers, payment card information, travel destinations, and more. We filed our brief in the federal appeals court for the Fourth Circuit, which will decide whether the plaintiff class certified by the lower court shares a class-wide injury.

Our brief explains that once personal data is stolen, it can be used against the breach victims for [identity](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/172_3203_equifax_complaint_7-22-19.pdf) [theft](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20210216_cyber_fraud_alert), [ransomware](https...
