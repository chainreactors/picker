# Unexpected snail mail packages are being sent with scammy QR codes, warns FBI

Posted: August 5, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Receiving an unexpected package in the post is not always a pleasant surprise. The FBI has [warned the public](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250731) about unsolicited packages containing a [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code) which leads to a website aimed at stealing personal data or downloading [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) to the victim’s device.

The packages are often shipped without sender information, only the [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code). This is a deliberate tactic of the cybercriminals who hope that the lack of information will encourage more people to scan the code.

These packages are a modern variant of brushing scams. In brushing scams, vendors send packages containing merchandise to unsuspecting recipients, and then use the recipient’s information to post positive reviews about their products or business.

The use of QR codes is the new element in this scam. Using QR codes in items sent in the post offers the criminals a few advantages. Firstly, people may not expect to end up with their device infected by something as non-technical as a physical letter. Secondly, QR codes are typically read by mobile devices, which—unfortunately—still get overlooked when it comes to installing [security software](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus).

As we reported in our [“Tap. Swipe. Scam” mobile scam report](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile-scams), 66% of people have scanned a QR code to purchase something. With legitimate businesses employing the use of QR codes, it’s something people are becoming very used to doing.

What many people don’t realize, or remember too late, is that scanning a QR code without the proper safety measures is like clicking a link, with one caveat. With links, we can actually check where they are leading to before we click. However, with QR codes it’s impossible for most people to discern a malicious code from a legitimate one.

## How to protect yourself from brushing scams

* If you receive a package you didn’t order and it contains a QR code, do not scan it. Scanning can lead you to fake websites designed to steal your personal or financial information, or even [install malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/malicious-qr-codes-sent-in-the-mail-deliver-malware) on your device.
* Legitimate businesses almost always include a return address. Treat any mystery package without sender or return information with extra caution.
* If you end up on a site asking for personal or financial information after scanning a QR code, do not enter that information. In the hands of scammers it can be used to defraud you.
* Make sure your device is on the most up to date version. Cybercriminals will take advantage of recently discovered vulnerabilities that people are yet to update and protect themselves against.
* When scanning QR codes use an app that displays the URL before opening the link. This makes it easier to establish whether it’s safe to follow the link.
* Use up-to-date and [active mobile protection](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile), preferably ...
