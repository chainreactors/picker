# Weight loss scams, or why ‘Jodie Foster’ wants me to lose weight

Posted: August 6, 2025

It seems like it’s hard to move on social media without some kind of mention of weight-loss injections these days. And, sure, these drugs can have a positive affect for many people, but not all these cases of weight loss are real, nor are the people promoting them who they say they are.

Weight-loss scams have been around for many years. Remember when senators grilled a [then-popular television physician called Dr. Oz](https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/06/dr-oz-scolded-by-senators-for-miracle-weight-loss-claims) over his miraculous weight loss claims? That was 11 years ago.

And what would work better than celebrities promoting these scams? In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission posted a warning about [scammers impersonating celebrities on social media](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2018/08/scammers-impersonate-celebrities-social-media). That warning was not about weight-loss scams in particular, but you get the drift.

So it was fortuitous timing that I noticed a familiar face in my Facebook friend suggestions.

Scammers, be warned: at some point I get curious and try to figure out what your angle is. So, I put on my best starstruck face and clicked the “Add friend” button.

Jodie must be very desperate to meet a man her own age, because she was quick to accept.

At first, I decided to play the waiting game. In my experience, scammers get to the point more quickly when they are the ones taking the initiative.

But Jodie’s patience outlasted mine and so I sent her a Direct Message to tell her how much of a fan I am and how happy I was she had accepted my friend request.

Apparently she is very busy, and she outlasted my patience again. So, I decided to look at her Facebook profile.

What I found was that her profile gets tagged extremely often. The posts she is tagged in are a mix of explicit content and weight-loss scams. Those include a lot of “before and after” pictures. In some of them the models even seem to be wearing the same clothes.

Weight-loss scams are a common threat on social media platforms like Facebook, and scammers have become increasingly sophisticated in their tactics.

Scammers tag fake celebrity profiles in their posts to increase visibility, hoping fans or unsuspecting users will see, share and click on the posts.

The goal is to sell products like keto supplements, apple cider vinegar gummies, CBD gummies, and many more that will allegedly help you lose weight without exercising and dieting.

The end goal is to ask exorbitant prices for useless products and get victims to pay—preferably repeatedly—for said products. The offers often resort to the fine print hidden under a huge discount that subscribes victims to a monthly plan which is notoriously hard to cancel or get refunds for.

The scammers operating Jodie’s profile like to use a redirect service, hosted at `litewo.xyz`. The service works similar to a URL shortener except for the fact that ...
