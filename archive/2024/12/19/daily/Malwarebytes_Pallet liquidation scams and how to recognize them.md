# Pallet liquidation scams and how to recognize them

Posted: December 18, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Pallet liquidation scams target people looking to purchase pallets of supposedly discounted merchandise, often from major retailers like Amazon.

Groups that engage in pallet liquidation sales are rampant on social media and it’s hard to discern the scammers from the legitimate ones (to be honest, I’ve always thought they were all scams, until someone told me there are legitimate ones), let alone the grey area in between.

The scams are based on the fact that many products are returned and can not be sold again for various reasons. But companies also offer overstock and out-of-season apparel for sale. Most of these companies have the first buyers sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) so when you scroll through different legitimate liquidation websites and marketplaces the origin of the pallet is almost never stated.

Depending on the reason of sale and the origin, the pallets may include a large quantity of one product or a mix of products, such as overstock or discontinued items, customer returns, or refurbished goods.

Given that the pallet liquidation market is a billion-dollar industry, it inevitably attracts scammers seeking to grab a piece of the action without putting in the work or risk.

In social media groups that specialize in pallet liquidation, you’ll find advertisements that promise valuable merchandise at significantly discounted prices, such as electronics, tools, or other high-demand items.

You’ll also see sponsored ads on social media about pallet sales (note: these are almost always fake).

The risk of not receiving what you have paid for is an obvious one, but some of these scammers will go the extra mile and set up fake websites where they will try and harvest payment details.

## How to steer clear of pallet liquidation scams

If you’re really looking to try your luck at this, there are a few tips that can help you get your money’s worth.

The first thing to keep in mind is the higher up you are in the chain, the better your chances of making a profit are. It usually also means buying large quantities (I’m talking about truckloads) and larger investments. And most sellers do not have a return policy. I realize the large shipments are not for everyone, so here are some things to remember:

**Red flags:**

Unbelievable prices. The people you’re buying from are not stupid. If they are offering goods for unbelievable prices, don’t take their word for it.

Payment methods. Sellers who insist on payment methods that do not offer buyer protection are likely scammers.

Only payment options without buyer protection

Lack of manifest. Sellers that are unwilling to disclose any information about the content of a pallet shouldn’t be trusted. There is definitely a higher risk of damaged items.

Time pressure. Slogans like “Act now!” or “Only 3 left” are often used to create a false sense of urgency, hoping victims will purchase without applying the research below.
