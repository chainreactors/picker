Vulnerability description:
Filmora is a professional video editing software. Wondershare NativePush
Build 1.0.0.7 was part of Filmora 12 (Build 12.2.1.2088). Wondershare
NativePush Build 1.0.0.7 was installed while Filmora 12 was installed. The
service name "NativePushService" was vulnerable to unquoted service paths
vulnerability which led to full local privilege escalation in the affected
window operating system as the service "NativePushService" was running with
system privilege that the local user has write access to the directory
where the service is located. Effectively, the local user is able to
elevate to local admin upon successfully replacing the affected executable.
