To reduce the amount of noise from questions, we have disabled self-posts in favor of a unified questions thread every other week. Feel free to ask any question about reverse engineering here. If your question is about how to use a specific tool, or is specific to some particular target, you will have better luck on the [Reverse Engineering StackExchange](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/).
