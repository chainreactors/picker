# **2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SASE Platforms**

We’re proud to announce that Palo Alto Networks has been named a Leader for the third time in the [2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SASE Platforms](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sase-mq-2025), positioned highest on the Ability to Execute axis. We believe this continued recognition underscores our strong execution capabilities and our pioneership in delivering a unified, AI-powered platform. We are purpose-built to secure the future of work by enabling safe and seamless user access experience to applications and data everywhere.

This recognition comes on the heels of other recognitions, including being named a Leader in the [2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge (SSE)](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sse-mq-leader-2025) and in the [2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SD-WAN](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sd-wan-mq-2024), making Palo Alto Networks the only vendor being recognized as a Leader in all three Magic Quadrants. In our opinion, it validates our vision to simplify and secure the modern enterprise through an integrated, cloud-delivered solution.

We believe our position as a Leader also reflects our customers’ confidence in our ongoing innovation and long-term vision to transform how organizations secure work through AI, integrated networking and security, including a cloud-native architecture built to meet the demands of modern enterprises.

Gartner predicts that by 2028, 30% of large organizations with expiring dual-vendor SASE contracts will not renew and instead consolidate to a single SASE platform. [Prisma® SASE](/sase) offers a unified SASE platform built for modern enterprises and is trusted by organizations of all sizes across every industry and geography. Our platform is designed to deliver best-in-class security, performance, resilience and operational simplicity at global scale.

* **Exceptional** **User Experience**Prisma SASE accelerates application performance by up to 5x and reduces latency while [Autonomous Digital Experience Management (ADEM)](/sase/adem) and real-user monitoring (RUM) enable rapid root-cause analysis and proactive issue resolution.
