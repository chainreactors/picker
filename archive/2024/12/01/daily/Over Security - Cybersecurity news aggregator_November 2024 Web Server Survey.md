In the **November 2024** survey we received responses from **1,141,129,846** sites across **272,032,056** domains and **13,114,233** web-facing computers. This reflects an increase of 10.1 million sites, 277,239 domains, and 110,998 web-facing computers.

Cloudflare experienced the largest gain of 2.6 million sites (+1.96%) this month, and now accounts for 11.8% (0.12pp) of sites seen by Netcraft. Google made the next largest gain of 1.4 million sites (+2.39%).

nginx experienced the largest loss of 6.6 million sites (-2.92%) this month, reducing its market share to 19.3% (-0.75pp). Microsoft suffered the next largest loss, down by 634,406 sites (-3.24%).

### Vendor news

* [nginx 1.27.3](https://nginx.org/en/CHANGES) was released on November 26th. It adds support for automatically re-resolving the IP address of an upstream server, which previously required a restart in the open-source edition of nginx. It also disables TLS 1.0 and 1.1 by default.
* [Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.97, 10.1.33, and 11.0.1](https://tomcat.apache.org/), were released, containing various bug fixes and improvements.
* Cloudflare published a blog post describing how it [migrated its customers' DNS records to a new database](https://blog.cloudflare.com/migrating-billions-of-records-moving-our-active-dns-database-while-in-use/), improving performance.
