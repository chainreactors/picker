# What are we building? [‚Äã](#what-are-we-building)

I'd like to ask‚Äîand answer for myself‚Äîwhat I consider a crucially important question about AI right now:

> What are we actually doing with all these AI tools?

I see tons of people focused on the *how* of building AI. And I'm just as excited as the next person about that.

I've spent many hours on my MCP config, and now I've probably spent a couple hundred hours on all of my agents, sub-agents, and overall orchestration. But what I'm *most* interested in is the *what* and the *why* of building AI.

**Like what are we actually making?!? And why are we making it?**

So what I want to do is show you my overall system, how all the pieces fit together, and what I've been building with it.

## My answer to the question [‚Äã](#my-answer-to-the-question)

[![Personal AI Infrastructure‚ÄîComplete system architecture](/images/pai-concentric-circles.jpg)](/images/pai-comprehensive-header-new.png)

As far as *my* "why", I have a company called Unsupervised Learning, which used to just be the name of my podcast I started in 2015, but now it's a company. *And essentially my mission is to upgrade humans and organizations. But mostly humans*.

[![Bullshit Jobs Theory David Graeber](https://books.google.com/books/content?vid=ISBN150114331X&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api)](https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Jobs-Theory-David-Graeber/dp/150114331X)Bullshit Jobs Theory David Graeber

Basically I think the current economic system of lots of what David Graeber calls "Bullshit Jobs" is going to end soon because of AI, and I'm building a system to help people transition to the next thing. I wrote about this in my post on [The End of Work](/blog/real-problem-job-market). It's called [Human 3.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x4s2d3YWak), which is a more human destination combined with a way of upgrading ourselves to be ready for what's coming. *Or as ready as we can be.*

And I build products, do speaking, and do consulting around stuff related to this whole thing.

*Anyway.*

I just wanted to give you the *why*. Like what is it all going towards?

**It's going towards that.**

## Humans over tech [‚Äã](#humans-over-tech)

Another central theme for me is that I'm building tech but I'm building it for human reasons. I believe the purpose of technology is to serve humans, not the other way around. I feel the same way about science in general.

üî¨ Although science is also about human curiosity.

When I think about AI and AGI and all this tech or whatever, ultimately I'm asking the question of what does it do for us in our actual lives? How does it help us further our goals as individuals and as a society?

I'm as big a nerd as anybody, but this human focus keeps me locked onto the question we started with: "What are we building and why?"

## Personal augmentation [‚Äã](#personal-augmentation)

**The main practical theme of what I look to do with a system like this is to augment myself.**

Like, *massively*, with insane capabilities.

ü¶æ Think Tony Stark stuff, no joke. Minus the flying.

It's about doing the things that you wish you could do that you never could do before, like having a [team of 1,000 or 10,000 people](/blog/our-20000-eyes-hands) working for you on your own personal and business goals.

I wrote recently about how there are many limitations to creativity, but one of the most sneaky restraints is just [not believing that things are possible](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/creativity-third-limitation).

What I'm ultimately building here is a system that magnifies myself as a human. And I'm talking about it and sharing the details about it because I truly want everyone to have the same capability.

# What Is Personal AI Infrastructure? [‚Äã](#what-is-personal-ai-infrastructure)

Ok, enough context.

So the umbrella of everything I'm gonna talk about today is what I call a **Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)**, which is PAI for an acronym. Everyone likes pie. It's also one syllable, which I think is an advantage.

üéØ Teaser: I didn't make this image.

PAI Architecture: Kai and the Context System at the core, orchestrating tools to enable human augmentation

# The Real Internet of Things [‚Äã](#the-real-internet-of-things)

And the larger context for this is the feature that I talked about in my really-shitty-very-short-book in 2016, which was called [The Real Internet of Things](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Internet-Things-Daniel-Miessler-ebook/dp/B01NCLUA5T/).

üìö I turned the book into a blog that you can read in full [here](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-real-internet-of-things).

The whole book is basically four components:

1. AI-powered Digital Assistants continuously working for us
2. The API-fication of everything
3. DAs using APIs and Augmented Reality
4. The ability for AI to then orchestrate things towards our goals once things have an API

A lot of these pieces are starting to come along at their own pace. One of the components most being worked on is DAs. We have lots of different things that are the *precursors* to DAs, like:

* Digital Companions (AI boyfriends and girlfriends)
* ChatGPT memory and larger context windows
* Personality features in ChatGPT memory
* Etc.

Lots of different companies are working on different pieces of this digital assistant story, but it's not quite there yet. I would say 1-2 years or so. We're actually making more progress on the API side.

## The API-ification of everything [‚Äã](#the-api-ification-of-everything)

Speaking of progress on the API side, the second piece from the book is the API-fication of everything‚Äîand that's exactly what MCP (Model Context Protocol) is making happen right now.

‚öôÔ∏è But we still need the DAs piece to make this all work.
> So this is the first building block: every object has a daemon‚ÄîAn API to the world that all other objects understand. Any computer, system, or even a human with appropriate access, can look at any other object's daemon and know precisely how to interact with it, what its status is, and what it's capable of.THE REAL INTERNET OF THINGS, 2016

Meta and some other companies are obviously working on the third augmented reality piece and they're making some progress there, but the fourth piece is basically AI orchestration of systems that have tons of APIs already running, so that's going to take some time.

# My AI system philosophy [‚Äã](#my-ai-system-philosophy)

‚è≠Ô∏è Feel free to skip if you're not interested in design philosophy.

[![AI System Philosophy - Context and Orchestration at the Core](/images/ai-system-philosophy.png)](/images/ai-system-philosophy.png)

The system is the brain‚Äîmodels are just interchangeable components that serve the core orchestration

I've basically been building my personal AI system since the first couple of months of 2023, a...
