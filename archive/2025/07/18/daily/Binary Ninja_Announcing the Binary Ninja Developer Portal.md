## Announcing the Binary Ninja Developer Portal

Weâre excited to announce the launch of our new developer portal within the [Binary Ninja Portal](https://portal.binary.ninja). This new feature provides a centralized hub for viewing extensions, gives extension developers the ability to manage their extensions, and provides extension authors insights into their user base.

## Whatâs New

### Extension Viewer

The Extension Viewer provides a comprehensive catalog of all available Binary Ninja extensions, both official and community-created. You can find it under âExtension Viewerâ in the sidebar of the Binary Ninja Portal.

Key features include:

* **Complete Extension Catalog**: Browse all available extensions (both official and community)
* **Extension Details**: View comprehensive information about an extension, including version history, detailed metadata, and more
* **Filtering and Search**: Find extensions by name, description, author, or type (official vs. community)

### Extension Analytics

For extension authors (those who have successfully claimed their extensions), weâve built an analytics dashboard that provides insights into their user base.

#### Download Analytics

* **Total Downloads**: All-time download counts with detailed tracking available starting from July 1, 2025 onwards
* **Monthly Trends**: Visual charts showing download patterns over time
* **Platform Distribution**: See which operating system platforms your users prefer
* **Geographic Insights**: Track downloads by country and understand your global reach

#### Developer Insights

* **User Base Analysis**: Understand your audience and their preferences
* **Performance Indicators**: Average downloads per month and growth trends
* **Platform Support**: See how many unique platforms your extension reaches
* **Geographic Reach**: Track how many countries your extension is used in

*For more information on shared data, see the [FAQ](https://binary.ninja/faq/#shared-data).*

### Extension Claiming System

We added a new extension claiming system, which allows developers to verify ownership of an extension and access detailed analytics.

![Extension Claiming](/blog/images/developer-portal/extension-claiming.png)

#### How It Works

1. **Find Your Extension**: Browse the Extension Viewer to locate your extension
2. **Claim Ownership**: Click âClaim Extensionâ and provide your GitHub repository details
3. **Verify Ownership**: Add the provided verification token as a [GitHub topic](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to your repository
4. **Access Analytics**: Once verified, gain access to comprehensive download metrics and insights

*Going through this token-based verification process ensures that only legitimate extension owners can claim a given extension. Once a claim has been started, you can track the claim status as you complete verification. You have 7 days from the start of a claim to successfully complete verification before the pending claim is removed.*

### Key Benefits

#### **For Extension Developers**

* **Performance Insights**: Understand how your extension is being used across different platforms and regions
* **User Engagement**: Track download patterns and identify growth opportunities
* **Platform Optimization**: See which platforms are most popular for your extension
* **Global Reach**: Understand your international user base

#### For the Community

* **Discoverability**: Easily find and explore new extensions
* **Quality Assurance**: Access detailed information about extensions before downloading

### Getting Started

#### For Extension Users

1. Log in to the [Binary Ninja Portal](https://portal.binary.ninja)
2. Navigate to âExtension Viewerâ in the sidebar
3. Browse and discover new extensions

#### For Extension Developers

1. Log in to the [Binary Ninja Portal](https://portal.binary.ninja)
2. Find your extension in the Extension Viewer
3. Click âClaim Extensionâ and follow the verification process
4. Once verified, access your extensionâs analytics dashboard from the extension details page

### Whatâs Next

This is just the beginning. Weâre already planning additional features, including:

* **Extension Marketplace**: Enhanced distribution features
* **Extension Ratings**: Community feedback system
* **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed usage patterns and insights
* **Native Extension Support**: Better support for native extensions, including improved build workflows and distribution options (see [this discussion](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/issues/6852#issuecomment-3076750888) for a workflow in the meantime)

Weâre excited to see how this new platform helps developers better understand their users, improve on their existing extensions, and create even more extensions for the Binary Ninja ecosystem.
