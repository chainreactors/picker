## Age Verification Using Facial Scans

Discord is  [testing](https://gizmodo.com/discord-begins-testing-facial-scans-for-age-verification-2000590188) the feature:

> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre currently running tests in select regions to age-gate access to certain spaces or user settings,‚Äù a spokesperson for Discord said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe information shared to power the age verification method is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or our vendor. For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.‚Äù

I look forward to all the videos of people hacking this system using various disguises.

No need for disguises. Teenagers just need to point their phone at an adult when they hit the step that needs verification.

But that‚Äôs not going to stop people from trying every way they can think of to beat this.

Oh great, another app that will refuse to run on a phone we really own (i.e. a rooted one).

Very skeptical that this will work enough that it would be implemented large scale. Some people just look young, and some people just look old. Face-based age-estimation just isn‚Äôt accurate enough.

More worrying is their mention of ID verification, which is more likely to go through. They claim that the ID scan would be ‚Äúdeleted on verification‚Äù but I‚Äôm pretty doubtful.

@ ALL,

Lets be honest nobody really cares if it works or not, or how accurate it is.

It‚Äôs reason to exist is to satisfy the Muppets employed by Brainless Politicians, to keep some vocal faux-parents and conservative nut-jobs happy.

Why am I saying this?

Because if humans with 20-20 vision can not tell the age of another human standing three feet in front of them with any great accuracy‚Ä¶ Then how the heck do people think a computer can do it?

The simple fact is the legislation has three purposes,

1, Shut up annoying people who don‚Äôt have a clue but do now how to create noise.

@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards,

You will need a very large barrel full of popcorn for that üòâ

BUT I doubt that will be the way it gets cracked.

Note the,

> *‚ÄúFor Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face.‚Äù*

This is in effect a poor mans version of ‚ÄúSee What You See‚Äù(SWYS) ‚Äúclient side scanning‚Äù on the user device.

A little bird on my shoulder is telling me it will be ‚Äúfull of juicy bugs‚Äù just waiting to be hooked for a new form of fish baiting üòâ

Video or picture? One picture or many? Can you just point it at a magazine photo? Or at the guy next to me on the bus?

It all depends on how you train your phone‚Äôs camera. It depends on what you feed it initially, during the first setup. Have a T-Shirt with Bob Dylan on it and use that to access your phone, to unlock it, I think Bob looks a lot over 18 so you should even be able to access all Pr0n (‚Äúadult‚Äù) sites as well, as an added bonus.

Just take a randomly generated adult pic from here:

and print it out and hold it up. How that be? Endless opportunities.

Aggh! Some children are coming to get me! With water pistols, lolly pops and drool.

Oh. They are just after the ice cream truck. False alarm.

@ALL, Clive

But seriously, electronic measures are just an easy way for politicians and the police to avoid the real work of investigation, properly collecting and securing physical evidence, properly equipping police stations with actual criminal psychologists and people properly trained in solving crime and with the ability to talk to people in a constructive manner.

The politicians do not even care about public safety. They claim that they have to remain independent of the legal system, apart from when it suits them not to be. Like when they start blabbering about criminals, terrorists and ‚Äúyouth crime‚Äù.

Any progress that had been made on reducing crime and public safety will now be reversed.

There will be extra mold in the courthouse roof. The buildings will be both physically and metaphorically rotting, as the funding is cut back and the prosecutors office (DA) is stacked with Yes Men and crooks. The mayor and the police chief will also be crooks.

On Feb. 14, 2025 Adams appears on ‚ÄúFox and Friends‚Äù and claims there was ‚Äúno quid pro quo‚Äù

Was it a coincidence the law on **foreign bribery** was paused ?
