The organisers of an annual combat sports event allegedly told the venue owner that they were using the space to film an activewear commercial featuring a small “crowd” including women and children.

In reality, the event hosted on Aug. 30 by SoCal [Active Club](https://globalextremism.org/post/active-club-chapters-growing-globally/) was part of a movement that champions violent and racist ideas. It featured combat sports fights and performances from two neo-Nazi bands who each have had a member involved in lethal violence, including one for a [2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/us/shooting-reported-at-temple-in-wisconsin.html) mass murder [described](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/healing-communities-and-remembering-victims-oak-creek) by the former US Attorney General as a “heinous act of hatred and terror”.

Bellingcat verified a tip-off from independent researcher Wiley D. Cope and researchers from [SoCal Research Club (SCRC)](https://bsky.app/profile/socalresearchclub.bsky.social) that the event was held at a suburban San Diego professional wrestling venue based on images posted by SoCal Active Club as well as a teaser video posted by a far-right propaganda outlet, which Bellingcat is not naming to prevent amplification. The venue operates as a professional wrestling school on weekdays, and is available for rental for events on weekends.

Charles Smith, co-founder and CEO of Rising Star Entertainment Group, which leases out the venue, confirmed the location after Bellingcat showed him images of the event. He told Bellingcat by email that he was not aware that the space was being used for an Active Club event, and had never heard of the group or “any sort of racial movement here in San Diego of that calibre” before he was contacted by journalists about it.

Smith said he was told by the event’s hosts via Peerspace, a third-party booking and rental website, that the booking was to shoot “an active fitness clothing brand prototype commercial”.

“I was informed that there would be a small audience of people that would be being used as the ‘crowd’ for the filming and that it would include women and children,” Smith told Bellingcat, “so of course I thought nothing of it.”

Upon verifying from the images that the event did indeed take place at his venue, Smith said that it was “disappointing that this is undeniable proof that this event occurred here with this audience”.

The international [Active Club movement](https://globalextremism.org/post/active-club-chapters-growing-globally/) focuses on using [fitness](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6t2tx_oOMk/?hl=en), [fighting](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/11/16/from-pixels-to-punches-geolocating-a-neo-nazi-and-white-nationalist-combat-event-in-los-angeles/) and [fashion](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/10/09/active-club-far-right-fashion-w2r-bulgaria/) to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence. The Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi [Robert Rundo](https://www.bellingcat.com/?s=rundo), who is currently on probation in the United States after having [pleaded guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/former-orange-county-resident-linked-white-supremacist-group-pleads-guilty-plotting) in December 2024 to planning and engaging in riots at political rallies across California in 2017.

Since [2023](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/11/16/from-pixels-to-punches-geolocating-a-neo-nazi-and-white-nationalist-combat-event-in-los-angeles/), Bellingcat has been tracking and geolocating annual “fight nights” held in the US, where white nationalist groups that [focus on training their members to fight](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/03/15/geolocating-a-us-far-right-fight-night/) against their purported enemies gather.

“Collaborations with other Active Clubs and neo-fascist organisations, such as the Patriot Front, serve as important cultural events for the far-right to grow their sphere of influence,” Heidi Beirich from the US-based Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), told Bellingcat by email.

“Exposing Active Club and neo-fascist activities associated with violence helps to inform the public, and authorities, about the beliefs that turn into violence,” Beirich added, “especially when these beliefs have become commonplace in mainstream politics.”

Smith, who told Bellingcat that he is of mixed African-American and Japanese ethnicity, said that he visited the venue late in the evening after the event, when the hosts were cleaning up.

“I was greeted with pats on the back, handshakes, and a couple [of] ‘thanks for letting us use the space, greatly appreciated,’” he told Bellingcat. “It’s hard to believe it’s the same group.”

SoCal Active Club and the far-right propaganda outlet, which was founded by Rundo, did not respond to Bellingcat’s requests for comment.

## Identifying Details: An Orange Wall

On Sept. 2, SoCal Active Club posted several photos on their Telegram channel from the event. Two of these photos show details of the venue, including an orange-coloured part of a wall in the background.

The photos also show a banner for a support group of the Hammerskins, a violent international neo-Nazi gang that has [links](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/11/16/from-pixels-to-punches-geolocating-a-neo-nazi-and-white-nationalist-combat-event-in-los-angeles/) to the Active Club movement, particularly in the [United States](https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/active-clubs/). Hammerskins members have been convicted of multiple crimes, including [assault](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/four-washington-state-men-sentenced-hate-crime-and-false-statement-charges-after-racially) and [murder](https://abc7chicago.com/post/suspected-phoenix-shooter-part-of-hate-group-linked-with-midwest-temple-attack/563843/).
