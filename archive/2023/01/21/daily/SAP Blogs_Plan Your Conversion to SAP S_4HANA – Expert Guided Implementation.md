Is your organization planning to take the next big digital move from SAP ERP to SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition? Are you wondering where to start and curious about what’s involved in this journey? You are in the right place!

Transforming your digital business core from SAP ERP to SAP S/4HANA could be complex but rewarding - so is the process of planning such a project. Planning an SAP S/4HANA conversion project involves various tools, teams, and expertise for a smooth and successful Go-Live. This is where SAP Enterprise Support Academy helps you in being informed of all the tools, technologies, and techniques you need to consume and apply along different phases of the project.

The EGI “**Plan Your Conversion to SAP S/4HANA”** covers a range of topics that are key to planning your SAP S/4HANA conversion project. The session answers topics like how SAP S/4HANA is better and different from SAP ERP, discusses the different editions of SAP S/4HANA and how to plan and successfully execute the transition to SAP S/4HANA. This session also highlights the starting points and best practices for the conversion.

### **What is an Expert Guided Implementation?**

An expert-guided implementation (EGI) is a remote training session delivered virtually over several days. For further details on the EGI format and a list of the SAP S/4HANA related expert-guided implementation training sessions, see the blog: [Expert-Guided Implementation (EGI) – The practical training option](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/19/expert-guided-implementation-egi-the-practical-training-option/)

Customers usually attend this EGI during the Discover phase of their SAP S/4HANA conversion project. From the session, you will know how the data model of SAP S/4HANA is simplified and better suited for running your business processes simpler and faster. We will also discuss about SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud and On-Premise deployment options and what “RISE with SAP” has to offer. You will be equipped with all the essential planning elements of your conversion project by the end of this EGI.
