There's a natural human desire to avoid threatening scenarios. The irony, of course, is if you hope to attain any semblance of security, you've got to remain prepared to confront those very same threats.

As a decision-maker for your organization, you know this well. But no matter how many experts or trusted cybersecurity tools your organization has a standing guard, you're only as secure as your weakest link. There's still one group that can inadvertently open the gates to unwanted threat actors—your own people.

#### **Security must be second nature for your first line of defense**

For your organization to thrive, you need capable employees. After all, they're your source for great ideas, innovation, and ingenuity. However, they're also human. And humans are fallible. Hackers understand no one is perfect, and that's precisely what they seek to exploit.

This is why your people must become your first line of defense against cyber threats. But to do so, they need to learn how to defend themselves against the treachery of hackers. That's where security awareness training (SAT) comes in.

## **What is Security Awareness Training (SAT)?**

The overall objective of an SAT program is to keep your employees and organization secure. The underlying benefit, however, is demonstrating compliance. While content may differ from program to program, most are generally similar, requiring your employees to watch scripted videos, study generic presentations, and take tests on cyber "hygiene." At their core, SAT programs are designed to help you:

* Educate your employees on recognizing cybersecurity risks such as phishing and ransomware
* Minimize your organization's exposure to cyber threats
* Maintain regulatory compliance with cyber insurance stipulations

These are all worthwhile goals in helping your organization thrive amidst ever-evolving cyber threats. However, attaining these outcomes can feel like a pipe dream. That's because of one unfortunate truth about most SAT programs: they don't work.

## **Age-Old Challenges of Old-School SATs**

Traditional SAT programs have long been [scrutinized for their inability to drive meaningful behavioral changes](https://www.huntress.com/blog/seven-donts-of-security-awareness-training?utm_source=hacker-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=CY24-Q1-CAMP-SAT_Launch&utm_content=SAT_Buyers_Guide). In fact, 69% of employees admit to "intentionally bypassing" their enterprise's cybersecurity guidance.

If you oversee cybersecurity for an organization, then you're likely familiar with the pain that comes with implementing one, managing it, and encouraging its usage. Given their complexities, traditional SAT solutions practically force non-technical employees to become full-on technologists.

| Complex, ongoing management is frustrating. Plus, through it all they just find poor results. | They're bored. Unengaging content is detrimental, as it doesn't lead to knowledge retention. Boring, unengaging content doesn't help with knowledge retention. | Most SATs aren't effective because they're created by generalists, not real cybersecurity experts And many are designed with little reporting capabilities, leading to limited visibility into success rates |

Because most SAT programs are complex to manage, they're usually dismissed as a means to an end. Just check a box for compliance and move on. But when done right, SAT can be a potent tool to help your employees make more intelligent, more instinctive, security-conscious decisions.

## **Ask the Right Questions Before Choosing Your SAT Solution**

When it comes to choosing the right solution for your organization, there are some questions you should first ask yourself. By assessing the following, you'll be better equipped to select the option that best fits your specific needs.

**Learning-Based Questions**

* Are the topics covered in this SAT relevant to my organization's security and compliance concerns?
* Are episodes updated regularly to reflect current threats and scenarios?
* Does this SAT engage users in a unique, meaningful manner?
* Is this SAT built and supported by cybersecurity practitioners?
* Is the teaching methodology proven to increase knowledge retention?

**Management-Based Questions**

* Can someone outside of my organization manage the SAT for me?
* Can it be deployed quickly?
* Does it automatically enroll new users and automate management?
* Is it smart enough to skip non-human identities so I don't assign training to, say, our copy machine?
* Is it simple and intuitive enough for anyone across my organization to use?

Your ideal SAT will allow you to answer a resounding "Yes" to all of the above.

### **Essential Features of an Effective SAT**

A SAT solution that's easy to deploy, manage, and use can have a substantial positive impact. That's because a solution that delivers "ease" has considered all of your organization's cybersecurity needs in advance. In other words, an [effective SAT](https://www.huntress.com/blog/please-allow-me-to-re-introduce-myself-huntress-security-awareness-training) does all the heavy lifting on your behalf, as it features:
