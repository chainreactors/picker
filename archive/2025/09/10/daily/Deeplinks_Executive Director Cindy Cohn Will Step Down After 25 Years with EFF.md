SAN FRANCISCO – Electronic Frontier Foundation Executive Director Cindy Cohn will step down by mid-2026 after more than 25 years with the organization and a decade as its top officer leading the fight for digital freedoms.

EFF – defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation since 1990 – is launching a search for Cohn’s successor.

“It’s been the honor of my life to help EFF grow and become the strong, effective organization it is today, but it’s time to make space for new leadership. I also want to get back into the fight for civil liberties more directly than I can as the executive director of a thriving 125-person organization,” Cohn said. “I’m incredibly proud of all that we’ve built and accomplished. One of our former interns once called EFF the joyful warriors for internet freedom and I have always loved that characterization.”

“I know EFF’s lawyers, activists and technologists will continue standing up for freedom, justice and innovation whether we’re fighting trolls, bullies, corporate oligarchs, clueless legislators or outright dictators,” she added.

"Cindy Cohn has been a relentless advocate for the simple proposition that regular people have a fundamental right to privacy online,” said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-OR. “Her work – defending encryption, opposing warrantless NSA surveillance, and suing major corporations for violating customer privacy – has consistently put her on the side of users and individuals and against powerful entrenched interests. Cindy's steady leadership at EFF will be missed by everyone who believes the First and Fourth Amendments are just as necessary today as they were more than 200 years ago."
