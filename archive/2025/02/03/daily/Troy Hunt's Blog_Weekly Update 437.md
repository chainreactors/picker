# Weekly Update 437

02 February 2025

It's IoT time! We're embarking on a *very* major home project (more detail of which is in the video), and some pretty big decisions need to be made about a very simple device: the light switch. I *love* having just about every light in our connected... when it works. The house has just the right light early each morning, it transitions into daytime mode right at the perfect time based on the amount of solar radiation in the sky, into evening time courtesy of the same device and then blacks out when we go to bed. And some lights come on with movement based on motion sensors in fans (Big Ass fans have occupancy sensors), cameras (Ubiquiti camera raise motion events), and tiny dedicated Zigbee sensors. But getting the right physical switches in combination with the right IoT relays has been a bit more challenging. Listen to this week's show let me know if you have any "bright" ideas ðŸ™‚
