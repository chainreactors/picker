# Weekly Update 436

25 January 2025

We're heading back to London! And making a trip to Reykjavik. And Dublin. I talked about us considering this in the video yesterday, and just before publishing this post, we pulled the trigger and booked the tickets. The plan is to pretty much repeat the US and Canada trip we did in September and spend the time meeting up with some of the law enforcement agencies and various other organisations we've been working with over the years. As I say in the video, if you're in one of these locations and are in a position to stand up a meetup or user group session, [I'd love to hear from you](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/). Europe is a hell of a long way to go so we do want to make the most of the travel, stand by for more plans as they emerge.
