I retired this site back in 2022 for a couple of reasons. If you like the content, please subscribe to the new blog at *[lcamtuf.substack.com](https://lcamtuf.substack.com)*.

Thank you for stopping by.

After more than a decade of posting infosec commentary on this blog, I decided to pull the plug. I still publish quite a bit, but I'm less and less inclined to use*blogspot.com*. For one, the platform just doesn't seem to be actively maintained; for example, spam issues have gotten so severe that I had to turn off comments a year ago. But I also wanted to write more about other hobbies, and that's difficult when all the subscribers signed up just for the infosec stuff.

To stay in touch, please **[subscribe on Substack](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/)**for weekly long-form articles on a variety of topics. Here's a sampling of my Substack articles you might enjoy:

* [Anti-garroting innovation in Victorian London](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/random-objects-balls-patent-anti),
