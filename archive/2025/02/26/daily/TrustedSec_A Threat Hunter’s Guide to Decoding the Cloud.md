The adage “keep your head out of the clouds” has run its course. With much of the world’s data now residing in the omnipresent cloud, many attackers are shifting their focus to this trove of information. As attackers shift, defenders must as well. With a new paradigm comes new concepts and vocabulary for technical operations, which may seem daunting to those of us still chained to the endpoint (and still feeling like we have much to learn about that, too).

With this “great migration” to the cloud, defenders must now apply threat hunting concepts to this new landscape. Threat hunting is the process of proactively searching an organization for malicious activity that evades existing security solutions. By looking for an attacker’s known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) throughout the environment, and organization may be able to find traces left behind.

For more guidance on the foundations of threat hunting itself, check out our [white paper](https://trustedsec.com/resources/guides/are-the-attackers-out-of-our-network-a-guide-to-successful-threat-hunting) and [service offerings](https://trustedsec.com/services/threat-hunting) on threat hunting to help bolster your team’s proactive capabilities.

## What is the Cloud?

The cloud has a wide range of definitions, but put simply, it is an infrastructure owned by a cloud provider that allows for the storage, management, and processing of data over the Internet that can be leveraged by a variety of third parties.

When we refer to the cloud, we are typically referring to infrastructure running on the big three (3) cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Each provider has advantages and disadvantages; however, you will find these providers offer many services that are equivalent in purpose.

To complicate things further, many organizations have begun to take a multi-cloud approach, leveraging multiple cloud providers for different purposes. According to Microsoft’s [2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/2024-State-of-Multicloud-Security-Risk-Report.pdf) report, 86% of organizations have adopted multi-cloud practices. For instance, an organization may wish to deploy different workloads to both AWS and Azure to take advantage of different cost structures and discounts. So, they may use AWS EC2 instances for compute-heavy workloads, where they benefit from a reserved instance discount, and Azure Blob Storage for storing large datasets due to lower storage costs.

As more organizations invest in a variety of cloud-based storage and services, it becomes more important to be proactive about defending them.
