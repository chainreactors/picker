In episode 12 of The AI Fix, Mark and Graham meet an LLM having an existential crisis, ChatGPT speaks Welsh for no reason, Graham does an impression of a water spout, Eric Schmidt shares a new and unexpected take on ‚Äúdo no evil‚Äù, and our hosts feel like David Attenborough as they witness herds of Waymo robotaxis honking their late-night mating calls at each other.

Our hosts discover why it‚Äôs OK to make AIs out of human brains, Mark takes Graham on an emotional roller coaster through the AI afterlife, and Graham comes last in a ‚Äúwho‚Äôs the best Graham on the podcast?‚Äù competition.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
