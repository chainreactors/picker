**Introduction:**

This paper will give insight on the automated flexible benefit feature of SuccessFactors. It also explains how this benefit enrollment and claim process can be automated for employees which will give them a better user experience. This paper is intended for people who knows SAP SuccessFactors in detail. This also is intended for project teams who are trying to implement Flexi benefits in SuccessFactors for their clients.

**Business Process:**

SuccessFactors supports benefits patterns globally. Organizations are nowadays providing additional claimable benefits for the employee. The Global Benefit of SuccessFactors feature helps in achieving this. This feature provides employee the feasibility to raise a claim based on his eligibility and this will get processed in the payroll.

Usually in standard process, employee would be entitled with allowance in the offer, based on the benefit validations would be created. The entitlement would be equally split and would be available for the employee to raise claim.

Once all required documents are submitted for the claim, the claim would be reviewed approved and processed in the payroll. Incase if the employee fails to raise a claim, the claim amount can be carry forwarded until certain period usually it would be for financial year.

**Configuration Steps:**

Now let us see few configuration steps:

* First let us create a MDF object  under Configure Object Definition.

* UI should be created for the MDF object under Manage Configuration UI.

* Next a new interface should be created to automate the data from Compensation to this MDF object, this job can be scheduled on daily basis.

* As a next step we should be configuring the benefit details and schedule period.

* By defualt, benefit UI will be enabled as part of standard configuration, additional modifications can be done if needed.

* Another interface run should be configured to pick the data from Benefits object and update in employee's off cycle portlet.

**Conclusion:**

In this way, the whole process of benefit claim and processing it in payroll is automated, This is also provides employees a better user experience.
