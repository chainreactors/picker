# Kolide can help you nail audits and compliance goals with endpoint security for your entire fleet

*Graham Cluley Security News is sponsored this week by the folks at **Kolide**. Thanks to the great team there for their support!*

Do you know the old thought experiment about the AI designed to make paper clips that quickly decides that it will have to eliminate all the humans to maximize paper clips?

Many security teams have a similar idea when meeting compliance goals: it would be much simpler if it weren‚Äôt for all the pesky users.

That way of thinking has brought us to the current state of endpoint security, dominated by MDMs that hamper device performance and turn every laptop into Big Brother. This approach to security is bad for culture and morale; moreover, it doesn‚Äôt actually work. If it did, no company with an MDM and annual security training would have a data breach.

Kolide is endpoint security and fleet management that takes a different approach. We help our customers meet their compliance goals‚Äìwhether for auditors, customers, or leadership‚Äìby enlisting the support of end users.

Kolide works by notifying your employees of security issues via Slack, educating them on why they‚Äôre important, and giving them step-by-step instructions to resolve them themselves.

For IT admins, Kolide helps you prove compliance via a single dashboard. From there, you can monitor the security of your entire fleet, whether they‚Äôre running on Mac, Windows, or Linux. (You read that right; Kolide can [finally provide visibility into your Linux users](https://l.kolide.co/3P8isn0).)

If you‚Äôve read this far, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre intrigued by an approach to endpoint security that gets end users involved. [Click here to learn more about how it works. If you like what you see, you can sign up for a free trial; no credit card required.](https://grahamcluley.com/go/kolide/)
