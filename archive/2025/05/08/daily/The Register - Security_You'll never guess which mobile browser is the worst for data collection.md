Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the slurpiest mobile browser of them all? The answer, according to VPN vendor Surfshark, is Chrome.

[Surfshark's research](https://surfshark.com/research/chart/data-collection-mobile-browsers) focused on the top ten browsers based on [AppMagic](https://appmagic.rocks/top-charts/apps) rankings. This included Safari due to it being the default browser on iPhones.

Between them, Chrome and Safari account for almost 90 percent of the mobile browser market, according to [Statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/worldwide), while also being among the top for data collection.
