# Epic Games introduces safer accounts for kids

Posted: December 9, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Epic have [made some alterations to how accounts for kids work](https://www.pcgamer.com/epic-games-is-introducing-a-new-child-friendly-account-type-to-make-online-play-safer/), with multiple features disabled for what are now known as “[Cabined Accounts](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introducing-epic-games-cabined-accounts)”.

If your children are big fans of Epic games like Fortnite and Rocket League, you may well have worried about their gaming interactions with other players at some point. There’s many risks from voice chat, text chat, random downloads from external sources, trading and much more. Scammers will happily target younger gamers, hoping their naivety will leave them vulnerable to bad passwords, password reuse, [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) tricks, or the promise of free gifts and rewards.

Games consoles have some incredibly granular controls for child safety, and you can almost always guarantee that there’s a setting just right for your needs on PS4/5 or Xbox. Where PCs are concerned, that has not  always been the case.

## Into the gaming cabin

If someone signs up for an Epic account and they’ve indicated that they’re under 13 years of age—to the cabin they go. The account will remain this way until the child hits 13 or reaches the “age of digital consent” in their region. These are the features you can expect to have turned **off** with a cabined account:

* Communicating with other players using voice chat or free text chat
* Purchasing items with money
* Downloading games that are not owned by Epic
* Recommendations based on past activity
* Email marketing or push notifications
* Trades in Rocket League
* Sign in with Epic, including linking accounts to certain external services, such as social media websites or video streaming applications
* Custom display names
* SMS-based two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa))

As you may have noticed, it’s a combination of external factors (random people sending your child not very nice messages) and Epic’s own internal features and functionality (recommendations of games, email marketing, in game trading).

If your child had some sort of monthly subscription, it’s now cancelled and will remain that way until the parent gives permission. Was their Epic account linked to social media services, but now isn’t? Same deal. Did they enjoy the news / forum / marketplace tab inside the Epic game launcher? You’ll never guess what’s happened there too!

With all of these options and features, parental permission is now key. The child now has to navigate to the “Request Parental Permission” tab inside the [Epic account portal](https://www.epicgames.com/account/personal). This will enable the child to have an email sent to the parent regarding consent and what steps to take next.

## Restrictions, restrictions

You may think these accounts are severely restricted in comparison to regular accounts, and you’d be right. In most cases, someone under the age of 13 probably doesn’t need to be making trades with strangers, or talking to random people in game sessions. If the account is on a monthly subscription of some sort, the person paying is almost certainly the parent or guardian in any ...
