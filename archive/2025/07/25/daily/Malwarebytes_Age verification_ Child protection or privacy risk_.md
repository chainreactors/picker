# Age verification: Child protection or privacy risk?

Posted: July 24, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

With governments demanding actual age verification on websites with adult content, and platforms like social media and Roblox introducing restrictions based on a user’s age, the controversy about different types of age verification and their implications is growing.

Last week, [Roblox announced](https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2025/Roblox-Continues-to-Advance-Safety-Innovations-Launching-Age-Estimation-Empowering-Teens-to-Connect-With-People-They-Know-and-Trust-and-Additional-Features/default.aspx) new age estimation technology which, it says, should help to confirm users’ ages and unlock a feature called Trusted Connections for those aged 13 and older. Trusted Connections allows teens aged between 13 and 17 to add adult users (18+) they know in real life. It’s billed as an option to keep out predators, which is good. But the age estimation technology raises concerns and questions.

While Roblox didn’t release any details about how its new technology works, the age estimation processes we know are based on [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) tools that scan selfies or short videos and compare them to a database to estimate the user’s age. Needless to say, they are not always right and it opens up the system to [deepfakes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/deepfakes), and [spoofing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing).

This kind of technology is more effective than asking the user to provide their birthday or check a box that they are over 18, but it’s not waterproof.

We see similar concerns when it comes to age verification for sites that host adult content. As of this Friday, websites operating in the UK with pornographic content must “robustly” age-check users.

The regulator, [Ofcom, lists a number of allowed methods](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/protecting-children/age-checks-for-online-safety--what-you-need-to-know-as-a-user) which all have their pros and cons:

**Facial age estimation**

Show your face, get a guess. You take a selfie or a short video, and an algorithm tries to figure out if you look over 18. The tech claims to keep data private, but facial scans are sensitive. And, as we pointed out, accuracy is far from perfect. If you’ve ever been asked to provide an ID in real life because you “look young,” you can expect a digital déjà vu.

**Open banking**

Banks know your age, so why not let them confirm it? Here, you allow the age-check service to peek at your bank account. No bank statements get handed over, just a yes/no to the question: “Is this customer an adult?” It’s easy, but convincing users to link their bank to a porn site might be a different story.

**Digital identity services**

This is the world of digital wallets for your ID. Think of it as carrying your driver’s license in your phone, but only showing the “over 18” part when needed. Sounds great and it is, but you’ll need yet another app in your digital life just to vouch for your adulthood everywhere you go.

**Credit card age checks**

Simple logic: you need to be 18+ to have a credit card, so showing a valid one counts as proof. The age-checker pings the payment processor to see if your card is legit. It’s q...
