Instant URL Analysis: Use Safebrowsing via ANY.RUN’s Extension

Phishing attempts, malicious redirects, and hidden malware can lurk in seemingly harmless links, putting your company’s data and systems at risk. To streamline threat detection and response, ANY.RUN has upgraded its browser extension, making the Safebrowsing feature free for all users.

## How Safebrowsing Works in ANY.RUN’s Extension

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1024x640.png)

Safebrowsing from ANY.RUN provides a fully functional browser, allowing users to interact with potential threats safely. This is especially useful for investigating multi-stage phishing attacks and CAPTCHA-based fraud.

Now, security teams can quickly analyze suspicious URLs without extra steps and launch analysis in [ANY.RUN’s Safebrowsing](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=safebrowsing_extension&utm_term=060225&utm_content=linktoregistration#register/) instantly. This eliminates the hassle of copying and pasting links into the platform manually, making security investigations faster and more efficient!

Most importantly, it’s completely free!

## How to Use Safebrowsing for Free

ANY.RUN’s Safebrowsing feature is now available for all users at no cost—all you need is a [registered account](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=safebrowsing_extension&utm_term=060225&utm_content=linktoregistration#register/) to start analyzing suspicious links instantly.

1. [Install the ANY.RUN browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/anyrun-sandbox/lgklkhgljfifnnpgkblckolmaafmkikk)

2. Right-click on any suspicious link

3. Select “Safebrowsing” to launch an instant analysis

## How Safebrowsing Helps Agasinst Cyber Attacks

With the updated extension, businesses can take advantage of Safebrowsing’s capabilities to:

**Check suspicious links with a single click:** No need to manually copy and paste URLs into the sandbox. Simply use the Safebrowsing option from your browser’s right-click menu, and the link will open in an isolated environment.

**Speed up threat analysis:** The extension streamlines the process, allowing security teams to quickly assess a link’s behavior in a full-size virtual browser without interacting with the page on their own system.

**Ensure safe link browsing for employees:** By testing unknown URLs in an isolated virtual browser before opening them on company devices, businesses can prevent malware infections, credential theft, and phishing attacks.

## Use Cases for Safebrowsing

With Safebrowsing, security analysts can interact with the entire attack chain, observe network activity, and uncover hidden threats in a controlled environment.

### Multi-Stage Phishing Analysis

In the following Safebrowsing example, we analyze a phishing attempt disguised as a TransferNow link — a free file transfer service that allows sending large documents up to 250GB.

[View Safebrowsing analysis session](https://app.any.run/browses/4b98f749-6eb6-4994-85ab-84492309bf27/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=safebrowsing_extension&utm_term=060225&utm_content=linktoservice)

Right-clicking on the suspicious link instantly opens it in ANY.RUN’s isolated browser, eliminating the need to copy and paste URLs manually.

The link leads to a fake TransferNow page, appearing to offer a free document download. After clicking the download file button, a PDF file opens instead.
