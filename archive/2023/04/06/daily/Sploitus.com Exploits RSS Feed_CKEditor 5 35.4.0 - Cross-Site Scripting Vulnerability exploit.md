CKSource CKEditor5 35.4.0 was discovered to contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability via Full Featured CKEditor5 Widget as the editor fails to sanitize user provided data.

An attacker can execute arbitrary script in the browser in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

CKEditor5 version 35.4.0 is tested & found to be vulnerable.

Documentation avaiable at https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html-embed.html#security

Security Docs Says """The HTML embed feature does not currently execute code in <script> tags. However, it will execute code in the on* and src="javascript:..." attributes."""

Payload:

<div class="raw-html-embed">
    <script>alert(456)</script>
</div>
```
