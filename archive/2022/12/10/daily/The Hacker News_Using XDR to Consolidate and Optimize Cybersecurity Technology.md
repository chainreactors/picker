Businesses know they need cybersecurity, but it seems like a new acronym and system is popping up every day. Professionals that aren't actively researching these technologies can struggle to keep up. As the cybersecurity landscape becomes more complicated, organizations are desperate to simplify it. Frustrated with the inefficiencies that come with using multiple vendors for cybersecurity, often stemming from a lack of integration of a heterogenous security stack, approximately [75% of organizations](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-09-12-gartner-survey-shows-seventy-five-percent-of-organizations-are-pursuing-security-vendor-consolidation-in-2022) are looking to consolidate their cybersecurity technology in 2022 — a 29% increase from 2020.

Surprisingly, reducing spend isn't the number one goal for these organizations.

Of the businesses that are consolidating, 65% are doing so to improve their risk posture. Having more cybersecurity tools means a larger threat surface. And when cybersecurity products don't integrate easily, businesses end up with gaps in their protection.

## Why Companies Need To Consolidate Cybersecurity Technology

Not only does consolidating cybersecurity tools provide a better ROI over the long run, but it also offers additional benefits.

#### Improves Analytics

XDR improves analytics because it offers visibility from a single pane of glass, increasing the amount of context that analysts get as they evaluate the network's security posture. Because they're getting more context, the security team can make better data-driven decisions and remediate issues faster. The improved analytics also simplifies maintenance and integrations, limiting gaps in an organization's security infrastructure that could allow threats to penetrate the network.

#### Reduces Resource Waste and Fills Gaps

Organizations that choose XDR see a better ROI, especially during times of high inflation or recessions because they reduce the number of wasted resources. For one, businesses are reducing the number of software subscriptions they have overall, both cutting costs and making their technology easier to manage. Additionally, they'll see less overlap between the tools they do have, meaning they'll be wasting less money.

XDR also improves the efficiency of an organization's security team to lower operating costs. With fewer false positives, analysts will have to spend less time chasing down alerts that aren't indicative of threats, reducing their overall workload and the chance of alert fatigue. Additionally, [Cynet 360 AutoXDR](https://www.cynet.com/platform/?utm_source=thn) includes a managed detection and response (MDR) service for no extra charge, helping businesses fill in security gaps without hiring extra analysts — something that is both expensive and extremely difficult at a time when there are around [770,000 unfilled cybersecurity job openings](https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html) in the United States alone.

#### Enables Automation

XDR makes automation easier because several applications are combined into one, further reducing the security team's manual workload. They'll have to do less manual analysis and tracking, and automated platform updates mean they won't have to manually patch the system. Additionally, XDR offers automated remediation, initiating sandboxes or rollbacks before human analysts have to get involved. This automation also means that XDR can react to threats faster than humans can, lowering the likelihood of a successful breach.

> According to a recent survey by Gartner, 57% of organizations resolved [security threats](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-06-10-how-geopolitics-impacts-the-cyber-threat-landscape) faster after implementing an XDR strategy.

## Obstacles to Cybersecurity Consolidation

Despite the benefits, many businesses are wary of consolidating their cybersecurity technology due to the obstacles they face.

#### Paralysis by Analysis

There are so many choices for cybersecurity software in the market that it can be difficult to decide which tools are best for the business. And even within the smaller XDR market, not every vendor approach XDR the same way. Native XDR platforms, like [Cynet 360 AutoXDR](https://www.cynet.com/platform/?utm_source=thn), consolidate several tools into one platform. Open XDR, on the other hand, simply provides a connection point for other security systems to bring data into a centralized console.

Some organizations may also be concerned about putting all their cybersecurity in the hands of one vendor. What if that vendor gets breached themselves or goes out of business? While this is an understandable worry, businesses can assuage this fear by choosing a vendor with a solid history in the market and by examining reviews from other users to see how the vendor handles problems.

Businesses also need to determine if the benefits of XDR outweigh the costs of changing platforms and processes. While XDR can provide a better ROI over the long run, it may be difficult for an organization to see past the initial expense and really buy into the operational benefits that XDR can offer. The organization must examine its current processes and tools to get a better understanding of how XDR can improve current processes and keep the business safe from threats.

#### Small or Understaffed Cybersecurity Teams

Many cybersecurity teams are currently quite small or understaffed. Because of this, they may not even be aw...
