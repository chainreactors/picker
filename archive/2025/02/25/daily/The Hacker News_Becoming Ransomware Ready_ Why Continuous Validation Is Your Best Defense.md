Ransomware doesn't hit all at once‚Äîit slowly floods your defenses in stages. Like a ship subsumed with water, the attack starts quietly, below the surface, with subtle warning signs that are easy to miss. By the time encryption starts, it's too late to stop the flood.

Each stage of a ransomware attack offers a small window to detect and stop the threat before it's too late. The problem is most organizations aren't monitoring for early warning signs - allowing attackers to quietly disable backups, escalate privileges, and evade detection until encryption locks everything down.

By the time the ransomware note appears, your opportunities are gone.

Let's unpack the stages of a ransomware attack, how to stay resilient amidst constantly morphing indicators of compromise (IOCs), and why constant validation of your defense is a must to stay resilient.

## **The Three Stages of a Ransomware Attack - and How to Detect It**

Ransomware attacks don't happen instantly. Attackers follow a structured approach, carefully planning and executing their campaigns across three distinct stages:

### **1. Pre-Encryption: Laying the Groundwork**

Before encryption begins, attackers take steps to maximize damage and evade detection. They:

* Delete shadow copies and backups to prevent recovery.
* Inject malware into trusted processes to establish persistence.
* Create mutexes to ensure the ransomware runs uninterrupted.

These early-stage activities - known as **[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)](https://pentera.io/glossary/indicators-of-compromise-ioc/)** - are critical warning signs. If detected in time, security teams can disrupt the attack before encryption occurs.

### **2. Encryption: Locking You Out**

Once attackers have control, they initiate the encryption process. Some ransomware variants work rapidly, locking systems within minutes, while others take a stealthier approach - remaining undetected until the encryption is complete.

By the time encryption is discovered, it's often too late. Security tools must be able to detect and respond to ransomware activity before files are locked.

### **3. Post-Encryption: The Ransom Demand**

With files encrypted, attackers deliver their ultimatum - often through ransom notes left on desktops or embedded within encrypted folders. They demand payment, usually in cryptocurrency, and monitor victim responses via command-and-control (C2) channels.

At this stage, organizations face a difficult decision: pay the ransom or attempt recovery, often at great cost.

If you're not proactively monitoring for IOCs across all three stages, you're leaving your organization vulnerable. By emulating a ransomware attack path, continuous ransomware validation helps security teams confirm that their detection and response systems are effectively detecting indicators before encryption can take hold.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): What to Look Out For

If you detect shadow copy deletions, process injections, or security service terminations, you may already be in the pre-encryption phase - but detecting these IOCs is a critical step to prevent the attack from unfolding.

Here are key IOCs to watch for:

### **1. Shadow Copy Deletion: Eliminating Recovery Options**

Attackers erase Windows Volume Shadow Copies to prevent file restoration. These snapshots store previous file versions and enable recovery through tools like System Restore and Previous Versions.

üí° **How it works:** Ransomware executes commands like:

powershell

vssadmin.exe delete shadows

By wiping these backups, attackers ensure total data lockdown, increasing pressure on victims to pay the ransom.

### **2. Mutex Creation: Preventing Multiple Infections**

A **mutex (mutual exclusion object)** is a synchronization mechanism that enables only one process or thread to access a shared resource at a time. In ransomware they can be used to:

‚úî Prevent multiple instances of the malware from running.

‚úî Evade detection by reducing redundant infections and reducing resource usage.

üí° **Defensive trick:** Some security tools preemptively create mutexes associated with known ransomware strains, tricking the malware into thinking it's already active - causing it to self-terminate. Your ransomware validation tool can be used to assess if this response is triggered, by incorporating a mutex within the ransomware attack chain.

### **3. Process Injection: Hiding Inside Trusted Applications**

Ransomware often injects malicious code into **legitimate system processes** to avoid detection and bypass security controls.

üö© **Common injection techniques:**

* **DLL Injection** ‚Äì Loads malicious code into a running process.
* **Reflective DLL Loading** ‚Äì Injects a DLL without writing to disk, bypassing antivirus scans.
* **APC Injection** ‚Äì Uses **Asynchronous Procedure Calls** to execute malicious payloads within a trusted process.

By running inside a trusted application, ransomware can operate undetected, encrypting files without triggering alarms.

### **4. Service Termination: Disabling Security Defenses**

To ensure uninterrupted encryption and prevent data recovery attempts during the attack, ransomware attempts to **shut down security services** such as:

‚úî Antivirus & EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)

‚úî Backup agents

‚úî Database systems

üí° **How it works:** Attackers use administrative commands or APIs to disable services like Windows Defender and backup solutions. For example:

powershell

taskkill /F /IM MsMpEng.exe # Terminates Wind...
