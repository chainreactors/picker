The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is directing states to include cybersecurity in their sanitary surveys, which are periodic audits of public water systems.

To help states get underway, the EPA has [published](https://www.epa.gov/waterriskassessment/epa-cybersecurity-water-sector#rule) a technical document with guidance [*[PDF](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-improve-cybersecurity-resilience-public-water-systems)*] intended to assist states with integrating cybersecurity into sanitary surveys.

EPA officials say they issued the memorandum after efforts to improve cybersecurity through voluntary measures "yielded minimal progress." The [EPA says](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-improve-cybersecurity-resilience-public-water-systems) the document "is designed to be used right away" and can play a major role in "improving the cybersecurity of operational technology used for safe drinking water."

The EPA's memorandum marks the first major new critical infrastructure initiative announced following the White House unveiling [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-white-house-unveils) last week.

It also comes after a series of high-profile hacks of US water utilities across the US, including attempts to modify water treatment chemical levels in the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-tried-poison-calif-water-supply-was-easy-entering-password-rcna1206), [Oldsmar, Florida](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-modified-drinking-water-chemical-levels-in-a-us-city/), and [Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania](https://www.wtae.com/article/fbi-investigating-hacking-threats-at-pennsylvania-water-systems/36386504).

*[The Record](https://therecord.media/epa-cyber-audits-water-facilities/)* reports that in a press call following the launch of its new cybersecurity memorandum, EPA officials say they've tracked down cyberattacks on water facilities to cybercriminals, state-backed groups, but also disgruntled employees.

"Cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure facilities, including drinking water systems, [are increasing](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-287a), and public water systems are vulnerable. Cyber-attacks have the potential to contaminate drinking water, which threatens public health," says EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**GunAction leak:** Hackers have breached GunAction.com, an online auction portal for US gun owners. The data of more than 550,000 gun owners who sold or bought guns through the site has been stolen, according to *[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/hackers-steal-gun-owners-data-from-firearm-auction-website/)*. The incident came to light after a security researcher found the hackers' server where the stolen GunAuction user data was being stored. The researcher says the storage server had been left unprotected online. GunAuction confirmed the hack and says it plans to notify all affected users.

**Flutterwave hack:** Hackers have stolen ₦2.9 billion ($6.3 million) from the accounts of Flutterwave, a Nigerian company that creates software for banks and financial services providers. The incident took place in early February, and according to *[Techpoint Africa](https://techpoint.africa/2023/03/05/hackers-have-stolen-2-9-billion-from-flutterwave/)*, the hack is still under investigation by Nigerian authorities. Flutterwave says the stolen funds were sent to accounts at 28 local banks, from where they were laundered to new locations.

**BitBNS hack:** Gaurav Dahake, the CEO of India-based cryptocurrency exchange BitBNS, confirmed in a [YouTube AMA session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97zBXf8Tw-0) that his company was hacked at the start of last month, in February 2023. Dahake says the company kept the incident private at the request of local law enforcement. The CEO's admission came after a blockchain security expert named ZachXBT [linked](https://archive.ph/5wa1p) a "system maintenance" event on February 1 to the exfiltration of $7.5 million worth of assets from customer accounts.

**TheSandbox incident:** Blockchain metaverse company TheSandbox has disclosed a [security incident](https://sandboxgame.medium.com/notice-of-security-incident-february-2023-ea692ee8094b). The company says that on February 26, one of its employees was hacked, and their account was used to send emails to its users with a link to a malware-laced file. TheSandbox says the incident was traced back to malware installed on the employee's laptop, which has since been formatted to remove the infection.

**Chick-fil-A cred-stuffing:** Fast-food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A says it's been under a near-constant credential-stuffing attack from December 18, 2022, to February 12, this year. The company says that [more than 71,000 customers](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/66699dcb-5f86-40bb-9d12-d64dea06faca.shtml) had their accounts compromised in the attacks. Chick-fil-A says that where funds were loaded, it is now restoring balances to compromised accounts, but also prompting users to reset passwords and remove any stored credit/debit card payment methods.

**Mastodon DDoS attacks:** Fosstodon, the largest Mastodon instance dedicated to open-source software experts, says it suffered a [major DDoS attack](https://mastodon.social/%40grueproof%40fosstodon.org/109955583080461727) that took down both its mobile and desktop clients. The attack marks the latest in a long string of DDoS attacks that have hit Mastodon instances over the past few months. Most of the attacks took place after Twitter users started migrating to the platform after Elon Musk's acquisition, his unban of right-wing and QAnon nutjob accounts, and the birdsite's issues with porn spam and political propaganda.

**River cameras hack:** Japanese officials say that in mid-January of this year, hackers gained access to [261 river monitoring cameras](https://piyolog.hatenadiary.jp/entry/2023/03/05/011832) across the Kansai region. That's around a third of all the river monitoring cameras installed across the region. The cameras, installed in February 2020, capture images of local river levels every 10-to-15 minutes. Officials haven't yet attributed the hack.

### **General tech and privacy**

**TikTok's data collection:** A [Gizmodo investigation](https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-ban-joe-biden-28000-apps-sdk-data-china-1850174019) found more than 28,000 mobile applications are collecting data from...
