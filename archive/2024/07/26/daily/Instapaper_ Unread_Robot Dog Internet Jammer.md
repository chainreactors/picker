## Robot Dog Internet Jammer

Supposedly the DHS [has these](https://www.404media.co/dhs-has-a-ddos-robot-to-disable-internet-of-things-booby-traps-inside-homes/):

> The robot, called “NEO,” is a modified version of the “Quadruped Unmanned Ground Vehicle” (Q-UGV) sold to law enforcement by a company called Ghost Robotics. Benjamine Huffman, the director of DHS’s Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC), told police at the 2024 Border Security Expo in Texas that DHS is increasingly worried about criminals setting “booby traps” with internet of things and smart home devices, and that NEO allows DHS to remotely disable the home networks of a home or building law enforcement is raiding. The Border Security Expo is open only to law enforcement and defense contractors. A transcript of Huffman’s speech was obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Dave Maass using a Freedom of Information Act request and was shared with 404 Media.

> “NEO can enter a potentially dangerous environment to provide video and audio feedback to the officers before entry and allow them to communicate with those in that environment,” Huffman said, according to the transcript. “NEO carries an onboard computer and antenna array that will allow officers the ability to create a ‘denial-of-service’ (DoS) event to disable ‘Internet of Things’ devices that could potentially cause harm while entry is made.”

Let’s see it work against low tech traps like Kevin McCallister would deploy.

Yet one more reason to not use WiFI in the home for things that are mounted on walls and not meant to move around. Just run a wire, it is cheap

The excuses are along the “protect the children” line for surveillance laws. By far the main reason is to disable wifi connected cameras that could record “alternative facts” to what LEO might present.

Wired connectivity and redundant local servers are your friend. And an alert system that gets all cameras recording to the local server should the internet go down.

@ Bruce, ALL,

The idea is far from new.

Back in the 1980’s and 1990’s as I’ve mentioned before I did various jobs involving “VIP Protection” and “Remote Bomb Disposal”.

I’ve mentioned before the use of very broadband jammers and the problems with distance [1].

I’ve also mentioned the problem with the “Bomb Disposal Wheelbarrows” that are still the current devices used.

A major problem is that they have “issues” like they are only of use on near flat ground, and they are not autonomous so require “Intelligent Control”(IC).

But also they need to not put out an electronic signature as this can be used to detonate the device intentionally or otherwise taking out the wheelbarrow. Or slightly smarter hostiles can just jam the frequencies used by the wheelbarrow if “Radio Controled”(RC).

Which as they are very far from inexpensive are not a resources where any particular unit is going to have two or more available in some ways they are considered more valuable than “man power”…

So in the main they are controlled by a heavy duty umbilical cable which because it can not realistically be “dragged” has to be “payed-out” from the wheelbarrow. Which has quite a number of issues. The primary one being the operator has to “reverse it back” and “reel it in” so in effect to be of use the wheelbarrow operator has to know where the device is, it can not go searching or roving around.

Which is why there is a lot of interest in AI-Drones to work “off leash”.

Even though this has been talked about since the 1980’s for some uncountable reason there are those that think this is “oh so super secret”.

Well the spot of bother at the East of Europe should have given even the dimmest of dimwits a heads up by now.

Which is why I find this so laughable in a very sad way,

Back in “The Troubles” in N.I. back in the 1970’s the British Government tried to ban “radio control”(RC) equipment used by enthusiasts in the UK and other European countries and the US. As a policy it failed. So soldiers were given backpack jammers that jammed the half dozen RC frequencies. As a prevention that not just failed but actually gave a “heads-up” to terrorists that troops were in the locality (so surprise element given away).

Eventually the powers that be realised they had lost this electronic watefare battle when the terrorist ECCM beat all the ECM that a “world power” could muster. When one terrorist group used small telescopes light detectors and a photographic flash gun (remember this was before lasers were available).

Some may know about “Smart Weapons” of the early “Joint Direct Attack Munition”(JDAM) “bang-bang” strap on guidance kit that converts “big iron” drop, or “dumb bombs”, into semi-glide style precision-guided munitions. Where some “laser jock” “paints the target” with an IR light source which in later versions was pulse modulated with a “secret code” to limit ECM. The detector head in the strap on nose flipped side to side and up and down to locate the “painted target” when it was found it fliped the strapped on tail fin left right and up and down to “glide down the beam” and hit the target.

The fact the actuators had only binary positioning so “banged back and forth” gave it the “bang bang” name not the fact it ...
