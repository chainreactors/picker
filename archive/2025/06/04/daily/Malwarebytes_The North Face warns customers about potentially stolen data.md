# The North Face warns customers about potentially stolen data

Posted: June 3, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

For the [fourth](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/792aded4-8b07-4c1d-86ac-5ae24253b722.html) [time](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/09/the-north-face-hit-by-credential-stuffing-attack) in its [history](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/the-north-face-resets-passwords-after-credential-stuffing-attack/), The North Face has notified customers that their account may have been compromised. This time, the company laid blame on a credential stuffing attack.

The North Face is best known for its line of outdoor clothing, footwear, and related equipment. With an annual revenue of over $3 billion, companies like The North Face are on the radar of cybercriminals.

The [notice](https://ago.vermont.gov/sites/ago/files/documents/2025-05-29%20VF%20Outdoor%20Data%20Breach%20Notice%20to%20Consumers.pdf) from The North Face says:

> “On April 23, 2025, we discovered unusual activity involving our website, thenorthface.com (“Website”), which we investigated immediately. Following a careful and prompt investigation, we concluded that an attacker had launched a small-scale credential stuffing attack against our Website on April 23, 2025.”

Credential stuffing is the automated injection of stolen username and password pairs in to website login forms, in order to fraudulently gain access to user accounts. Many users reuse the same password and username/email, so if those credentials are stolen from one site, for example in a data breach or [phishing attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing), attackers can use the same credentials to compromise accounts on other services.

With these credentials, the attackers may have found additional information like:

* Purchases made on the website
* Shipping address(es)
* Preferences
* Email address(es)
* First and last name
* Date of birth (if the user saved it to their account)
* Telephone number (if the user saved it to their account)

The North Face also said that no payment card data was compromised, as the company does not keep a copy of that information on the website. But the kind of data that was compromised still enriches a cybercriminal’s data set and helps them in performing more targeted and effective attacks.

The North Face also said:

“Please know that protecting your [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) is something that we take very seriously.”

One would think that after four credential stuffing attacks, The North Face would at least introduce the option to use [multi-factor-authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/glossary/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/) on their website, but there’s no sign of that, let alone the enforcement of MFA. Maybe that’s because the credential stuffing attacks were dwarfed by the [December 2023 ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vans-and-north-face-owner-vf-corp-hit-by-ransomware-attack/) that was later confirmed to have impacted 35 million customers.

Instead, The North Face stated that it quickly disabled passwords to halt the attack, and all users will need to create a new and **unique** password on the website if they have not already done so.

The emphasis on unique was done by me, because credential stuffing attacks are only successful because we have so many passwords that it’s no...
