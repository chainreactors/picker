# Beyond good ol’ Run key, Part 146

Posted on [2024-12-20](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2024/12/20/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-146/ "1:17 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

I did consider writing about:

```
C:\Windows\System32\WptsExtensions.dll
```

but this phantom DLL has been [documented](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22WptsExtensions.dll%22) all over the place, so let’s look at a different one:

```
C:\Windows\System32\XboxNetApiSvcExtHost.dll
```

It’s loaded by *svchost.exe* on Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2022.
