# How to bridge the MFA gap

## If a credential is worth protecting, it's worth protecting well.

Sponsored feature What do flossing and multi-factor authentication (MFA) have in common? Each is highly beneficial, yet far too few people do them consistently. MFA helps protect organizations from credential-based attacks, but according to the [Cyber Readiness Institute](https://cyberreadinessinstitute.org/resource/2024-global-multifactor-authentication-mfa-survey-insights/), only 35% of businesses globally bother with it.

Two of the biggest barriers to consistent MFA deployment are getting the money for it and sourcing the technical expertise to choose the right tool, according to that research.

That resonates with Darren James, senior product manager at [Specops Software](https://specopssoft.com/?utm_source=theregister&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=theregister_referral&utm_content=article). He points to a perplexing array of MFA options, many of which co-exist in the enterprise.

"The more MFA you have, the more confused users get," says James. Bewildered employees might encounter YubiKey authentication for VPN access, Microsoft Authenticator for email, SMS codes and different biometric techniques. Suddenly, what was mean to harden your security becomes a distraction.

### **When too much is not enough**

An improperly implemented MFA system could hinder rather than he...
