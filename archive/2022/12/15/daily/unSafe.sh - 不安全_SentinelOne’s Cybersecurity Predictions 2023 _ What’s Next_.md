2022 was a sobering year for us all. Riding on the back of the COVID pandemic of the previous two years, we entered a new reality with [war returning to Europe](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/a-cisos-guide-to-the-security-impact-of-the-attacks-on-ukraine/) in a way not seen since 1945. And yet along with tanks, missiles, and the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure came a new battlefront: cyber warfare with wipers being used to hit targets [inside](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hermetic-wiper-ukraine-under-attack/) and [outside](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe/) the physical battleground.

Meanwhile, new attack surfaces came to the fore, as cybercriminals began to understand how to [exploit identity](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/rise-in-identity-based-attacks-drives-demand-for-a-new-security-approach/) for access and [cloud workloads](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/all-eyes-on-cloud-why-the-cloud-surface-attracts-attacks/) for assets, privilege escalation and lateral movement.

It’s not been all bad. Evolving security technologies like [XDR are helping organizations](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ten-questions-a-ceo-should-ask-about-xdr-with-answers-2/) to fill the gaps in visibility, join the dots in defense, and hunt for hidden threats in the enterprise. Law enforcement [at home](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-46-4/) and [abroad](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-48-4/) has been capturing and incarcerating more cybercriminals than ever before, while also [closing the doors](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-22-2/) on some of the darknet’s worst [illicit markets](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/more-evil-markets-how-its-never-been-easier-to-buy-initial-access-to-compromised-networks/).

But defenders are still playing catch up, a point not lost on our experts who, below, offer their predictions for what we can expect in cybersecurity 2023. Our predictions [last year](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sentinelones-cybersecurity-predictions-2022-whats-next/) weren’t far off the mark, so as we look forward to another year in the trenches of cybersecurity, here’s what our researchers and thought leaders see in their crystal balls.

## Driving Painful Lessons Home

2022 has been a year of painful lessons precisely because the most intense threats weren’t technically advanced or mind-bending feats of cyber wizardry. Instead, they were mundane, pragmatic, and wildly successful. This year was largely populated by asymmetrical threat actors– hacktivists of all stripes, youthful petty criminals, and an [increasingly fragmented ransomware ecosystem](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransoms-without-ransomware-data-corruption-and-other-new-tactics-in-cyber-extortion/).

Infosec dark humor held that ransomware groups were ‘technical debt collectors’– attaching an eye watering price tag to unpatched systems, misconfigurations, and generally underserved networks. It seems that we collectively underestimated the true depth and breadth of that technical debt as a wider swath of lower tier threat actors show us the results of living on a diet of fruit so low-hanging as to have rotten on the pavement.

Cells of youthful SIM swappers and source code hoarders, best referred to as ‘disorganized crime’, have successfully hacked their way across scores of noteworthy well-resourced companies. They’ve embraced a pragmatic approach to operations– abusing the nebulous web of dubious ‘trusted’ parties that serve the customer-facing requirements of larger corporations. Whether through [social engineering](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-dangers-of-social-engineering-how-to-protect-your-organization/), stolen and borrowed credentials, or the financially-motivated shortrun insider, attackers have enjoyed all that excessive privileges across unsegmented service VPNs can net them.

The cumulative effect? A near endemic [failure of SMS 2FA](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/has-mfa-failed-us-how-authentication-is-only-one-part-of-the-solution/) as a security measure. As we enter 2023, we need to accept that hardware multi-factor authentication, short lived sessions, and severely curtailed account privileges aren’t nice-to-have paranoid bells and whistles. They are now the entry threshold of the aspirational standard of corporate security.

The ransomware ecosystem continues to shift, experiment, and fracture. The most notable incident is the ‘Conti Rica’ affair, where a ransomware group held an entire government for ransom. In 2023, our tracking will have to become more granular– moving away from the notion of monolithic ransomware cartels to acknowledge the prevalence of smaller affiliate groups (often engaged with multiple RaaS brands).

Perhaps at that level of observability, we’ll be quicker to note attempts to use ransomware as a flimsy cover for nation-state activity– as in the case of Iran ‘ransoming’ Albanian governmental institutions. This last facet jives with the abuse of an increasingly populated field of hacktivists (of [varying degrees of authenticity](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hacktivism-and-state-sponsored-knock-offs-attributing-deceptive-hack-and-leak-operations/)) emerging to represent different sides of hot conflicts and societal tensions via overrated DDoSes and underrated hack-and-leak ops whose long-term effects are entirely unforeseeable.

The cybersecurity industry enjoys cutting its teeth on advanced threats and sophisticated techniques that challenge the collective braintrust to find new solutions. But 2022 has forced us to pay attention to the state of disrepair of our networked fabric. Without a sizable, conscientious collective effort, we should brace ourselves for a 2023 that drives those painful lessons well beyond our tolerance.

## Cybersecurity Only Works When “It Just Works”

2022 has been a year where, compared to previous years, the cybersecurity market has adapted not just to the threat landscape but perhaps more strongly to how security teams want to use cyber-security products. This is something I expect to see much more of in 2023.

### Consolidation, But Not At All Costs

The sheer number of cyber-security products covering different surfaces and use cases means that customers are looking to consolidate when and where possible. With that said, there are many sides to consolidation – security teams will not satisfied with just “buying more products from the same vendor vs multiple vendors” or “pushing everything to one data-lake” – they will demand holistic workflows, unified agents and cross-product synergies that actually deliver value that is greater than the sum of its parts when consolidating around a platform as opposed to endless point solutions.

### Demand for More Vendor Collaboration

As much as we expect consolidation, customers will always end up using more than one vendor. We’re already seeing security teams demand more integration and more value from the collaborations between vendors. Gone are the days when a...
