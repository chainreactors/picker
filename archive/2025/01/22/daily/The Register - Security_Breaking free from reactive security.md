# Breaking free from reactive security

Webinar In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity teams can often find themselves trapped in an endless cycle of responding to threats.

But while threat response remains crucial, some organisations are discovering that a proactive stance on data security and identity management can transform their security posture - and their business outcomes.

"The traditional approach of waiting for attacks and then responding isn't sustainable anymore," says Vileen Dhutia, security expert at Rubrik. "Organisations need to shift from playing defence to actively shaping their security landscape."

It's this transition which will be the focus of an upcoming webinar on [23rd January 2025 at 3am PST/6am EDT/11am GMT](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/34367/proactive-data-security-and-identity-management) featuring Dhutia and Tim Phillips from The Register. Join them as they explore how organisations can break free from reactive security patterns and build proactive strategies that work in today's threat environment.

The session will tackle key challenges facing IT professionals, including:

*- How to identify and eliminate security blind spots before they become vulnerabilities.*

*- Building resilient systems that can adapt to emerging threats.*

*- Creating a security-first culture that empowers rather than restricts.*

It will offer practical insights into transforming security from a cost center into a business enabler, and instruct participants on actionable strategies for implementing proactive security measures that protect assets while supporting business growth.

Register for the [webinar](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/34367/proactive-data-security-and-identity-management) now to secure your spot.
