In 1992 EFF presented our very first awards [recognizing key leaders and organizations](https://www.eff.org/awards/past-winners) advancing innovation and championing civil liberties and human rights online. Now in 2025 we're continuing to celebrate the accomplishments of people working toward a better future for everyone with the EFF Awards!

[All are invited to attend the EFF Awards](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/register?id=498&reset=1) on Wednesday, September 10 at the San Francisco Design Center. Whether you're an activist, an EFF supporter, a student interested in cyberlaw, or someone who wants to munch on a strolling dinner with other likeminded individuals, anyone can enjoy the ceremony!

[REGISTER TODAY!](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/register?id=498&reset=1)

**GENERAL ADMISSION: $55 | CURRENT EFF MEMBERS: $45 | STUDENTS: $35**

If you're not able to make it, we'll also be [hosting a livestream of the event](http://www.eff.org/livestream-effawards2025) on Friday, September 12 at 12:00 PM PT. The event will also be recorded, and posted to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/efforg) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/%40electronic_frontier_foundation_eff_) after the livestream.

We are honored to present the three winners of this year's EFF Awards: Just Futures Law, Erie Meyer, and Software Freedom Law Center, India. But, before we kick off the ceremony next week, let's take a closer look at each of the honorees. This time—**Erie Meyer, winner of the EFF Award for Protecting Americans' Data****:**
