Lawsuits claiming that online services aid terrorist organizations just by hosting their content or having users who espouse the organizations’ views potentially could censor a vast amount of protected expression online, EFF and a coalition of other civil society groups argued in [a brief](https://www.eff.org/document/twitter-v-taamneh-eff-amicus-brief) filed this week.

In *Twitter v. Taamneh*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [ruled](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/18-16700/18-16700-2021-06-22.html) that online services can be civilly liable under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) based on claims that the platform had generalized awareness that members of a terrorist organization used its service. The Supreme Court agreed to review *Taamneh* and another case involving similar facts and legal claims (*Gonzales v. Google*) this fall.

Although the legal issues in *Taamneh* primarily center on how federal courts should interpret the ATA’s language,the Ninth Circuit’s broad interpretation would have dangerous implications for the First Amendment rights of internet users and the platforms hosting their speech, according to a friend-of-the-...
