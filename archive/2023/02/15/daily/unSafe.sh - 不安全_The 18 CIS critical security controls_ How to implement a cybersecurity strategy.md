## CIS has designed 18 critical security controls to help companies analyze their security strategies and optimize them to repel attacks

At the end of January, the U.S. subsidiary of telecommunications company T-Mobile [made public](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/analysis/t-mobile-us-again-hit-by-cyberattack/2023/01/) that a malicious actor had fraudulently accessed the personal data of 37 million of its customers last November. The criminals could get hold of names, billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth. This incident suffered by the German multinational is the umpteenth demonstration of the risks faced by companies. And it highlights the **need for companies to place cybersecurity at the heart of their strategy** if they want to avoid being faced with far-reaching economic, legal and reputational consequences.

To help them in this task, the [Center of Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls), a global reference organization, has developed and updated the **CIS critical security controls** over the years.

These **critical security controls** are based on the knowledge shared by **cybersecurity experts** worldwide and industry best practices. And their primary goal is to turn all that information into implementable measures for companies to protect themselves against cyberattacks.

Below, we will discuss what these controls consist of and briefly dissect each of the **18 critical security controls** included in the latest version of this guide. These controls highlight the importance of relying on [**cybersecurity services**](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-services/) to be protected against the magma of cyberattacks.

## 1. The CIS controls: A starting point for tackling cybersecurity

The CIS emphasizes that **critical security controls** are not just a list but are the backbone of a cybersecurity ecosystem.

These **CIS critical security controls** are a starting point for companies to implement a security strategy. Thus, the controls allow companies and cybersecurity experts to prioritize different areas depending on the business model and the available economic, human and technological resources.

From **critical security controls**, organizations can draw on industry knowledge, share experiences, learn from **success stories** and use other methodologies with which the CIS guidelines are aligned, such as the NIST cybersecurity framework or the **OWASP methodology**.

This approach shows that **critical security controls** do not constitute a checklist that guarantees that the organization is fully protected against attacks when applied in a company. Every day new threats emerge, new techniques emerge, and **new technologies open the way for the attack**. Cybersecurity is a sector in constant movement, so it is essential to be permanently connected to what is happening in this field and learn from all the knowledge generated.

## 2. How are critical security controls articulated?

Let’s get down to the nitty-gritty of **how critical security controls operate**. These controls are, above all, categories that systematize the concrete actions organizations must implement to **build an effective security strategy**.

Thus, the CIS guide establishes various safeguards for each **critical security control**, stipulating which assets they are aimed at, what security function they fulfill and what type of companies must implement them. Let us take a closer look at this structure.

### 2.1. Safeguards

Safeguards are the keystone of **CIS critical security controls**. Each safeguard is a specific action the organization must take to implement the control.

For example, safeguard 1.1. is to «establish and maintain a detailed inventory of business assets». The CIS guidance does not simply outline the action but sets out several considerations cybersecurity professionals must consider to undertake the action successfully.

Each of the **18 critical security controls** has its safeguards. For example, in the case of the first control (Inventory and ...
