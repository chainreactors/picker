# How to tell if your online accounts have been hacked

## This is a guide on how to check whether someone compromised your online accounts

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

2:10 PM PDT · March 25, 2025

More and more hackers are targeting regular people with the goal of breaking into their bank accounts, stealing their crypto, [or simply stalking them](https://techcrunch.com/tag/stalkerware/). These types of attacks are still relatively rare, so there’s no need for alarm. But it’s important to know what you can do to protect yourself if you suspect someone accessed your email, social media account, chat apps, or any other major service and platform.

A few years ago, [I wrote a guide](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjeznz/how-do-you-know-when-youve-been-hacked-gmail-facebook) to help people protect themselves, and understand that most of the companies you have an account with already offer you tools to take control of your accounts’ security, even before you contact them for help, which in some cases you still should do.

Here we break down what you can do on several different online services, including Gmail (and more broadly a Google account), Facebook, Apple ID, and more. And come back often because this is a regularly updated resource, both in terms of making sure the instructions for each individual service or platform are up to date, as well as to add new ones.

Just like in the previous guide, there’s an important caveat. You should know that these methods don’t guarantee that you haven’t been compromised.

If you still aren’t sure, you should contact a professional, especially if you are a journalist, a dissident or activist, or otherwise someone who has a higher risk of being targeted, such as a person in an abusive relationship. In those cases, the non-profit Access Now [has a digital security helpline](https://www.accessnow.org/help/) that will connect you to one of their experts.

Another caveat: If you haven’t already, you [should enable multi-factor authentication](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/25/cybersecurity-101-guide-two-factor/) on all your accounts, or at least the most important ones (email, banking, social media). [This directory of websites that use MFA (or 2FA) is a great resource](https://www.daito.io/2fa/) that teaches you how to enable multi-factor authentication on more than 1,000 websites. (Note that you don’t have to use the multi-factor app promoted on that site, there [are](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app) [plenty](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) [of other](https://authy.com/) [alternatives](https://authy.com/).)

Increasingly some online services offer the use of a physical security key or [a passkey stored in your password manager](https://techcrunch.com/tag/passkeys/), which is one of the highest safeguards to [prevent account intrusions that rely on password-stealing malware](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/snowflake-customer-passwords-found-online-infostealing-malware/) or phishing.

## Gmail lists all the places your account is active

The first thing you should do if you suspect someone has broken into your Gmail account (and by extension all the other Google services linked to it) is to scroll all the way down in your inbox until you see “Last account activity” in the bottom right corner.

Click on “Details.” You will then see a pop-up window that looks like this:

These are all the places where your Google account is active. If you don’t recognize one of them, for example if it comes from a different location, like a country you haven’t visited recently or have never been, then click on “Security Checkup.” Here you can see on which devices your Google account is active.

If you scroll down, you can also see “Recent security activity.”

Check this list to see if there are any devices that you don’t recognize. If in any of these places above you see something suspicious, click on “See unfamiliar activity?” and change your password:

After you change your password, [as Google explains here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/41078?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=What%20happens%20after%20you%20change,you've%20given%20account%20access.), you will be signed out of every device in every location, except on the “devices...
