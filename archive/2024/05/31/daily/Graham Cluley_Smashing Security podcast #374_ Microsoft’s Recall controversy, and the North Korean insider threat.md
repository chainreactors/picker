Microsoft gets itself into a pickle with a privacy-popping new feature on its CoPilot+ PCs, the FTC warns of impersonated companies, and is your company hiring North Korean IT workers?

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by author, journalist, and podcaster Geoff White.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
