# How I Think About Politics

To see what people believe, figure out the world they want to live in

I want to say a few things about what’s happening right now in politics. I especially want to do so because I’ve supported Elon and Andreessen and similar “centrist” types in the past—and continue to do so on certain topics. I want to explain how and why that is, which turns out requires an overview of how I see things more broadly.

## Core beliefs [​](#core-beliefs)

In a phrase, I am a Star Trek (Next Generation) Liberal, and I would say the following are the tenets of my political / life philosophy:

1, 2, 3, and 4 are the center of the philosophy, and subsequent items fall out of their implications. (Credit: Harris).

1. The goal of society is to maximize flourishing and minimize suffering
2. Science, compassion, and curiosity are the best mechanisms for pursuing this goal
3. Freedom from oppressive authority is a central requirement
4. Relentless pursuit of truth is essential, even when difficult or uncomfortable
5. Humans technically lack free will, and we must keep #1 in mind when thinking about how to adjust our behavior given this knowledge
6. Successful people are lucky people—whether due to genes, parenting, environment, or some combination thereof—and should therefore spend significant resources on building a society that gives everyone those same starting parameters
7. A mindset of hard work, self-discipline, and ignoring obstacles outside your control is critical to success, and is one of the most important of these starting parameters

As such, I believe that taxes and social programs are incredibly important to overcome whatever causes the lack of equal opportunity.

This doesn't mean I think they should be taken away, or that they're undeserved. It just means I think it should encourage the desire to give back and raise others.

I believe the rich are lucky, and the super-rich are super-lucky. Do they usually have good work ethics and self-disciple? Lots of talent and grit? Sure. But those come from luck as well. Good genes, good parenting, good schools, good environment, and/or a mindset bestowed onto them that makes them strive. Those are *luxuries* granted them by chance, and they shouldn't be. They’re luxuries *every* human should have.

I have [a piece here](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-difference-between-classical-liberalism-and-libertarianism) that gets to the roots of Liberalism, which is significantly about freedom from oppression.

Most importantly, you can’t look at someone who doesn't have them—due to who their parents were, a history of discrimination or oppression—and judge them the same. It’s society’s responsibility—that is, *our* responsibility—to give everyone the best possible starting parameters we can.

When we see places where that's not the case, we have to use science, curiosity, and compassion to make adjustments to society that fix those issues.

Believing this is the core of what I believe makes someone Liberal, and it’s why I will never stop being one.

## The "Ideal World" Heuristic [​](#the-ideal-world-heuristic)

Aside from core beliefs, I have another way of capturing one's politics without talking about politics at all—and that is to *describe the world you want to live in*.

Individualistic in terms of freedom and creativity, not selfishness.

*I want to live in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and highly individualistic society that values and supports everyone becoming the best version of themselves.*

Or, as a set of bullets:

Again, the Federation in STTNG is a decent (but not perfect) visual here.

* People live in harmony with each other, with concepts like race, gender, and religion being extremely secondary
* People are not oppressed by a government or religion
* Society provides extraordinary support to every new person, giving them the education and resources to help them become the absolute best version of themselves
* People can believe many different things, and pursue flourishing in vastly different ways, but they don't allow those beliefs to override the central goal of maximizing flourishing for *everyone*
* Society is largely based around art, exploration, and sharing of positive experiences—not on maximizing wealth or power

*That* is my politics.

It's largely the same as what I put in my tenets above, but it's a nice shortcut to just describe, or refer to, the type of world you wish existed.

## The questions I ask when evaluating someone's politics [​](#the-questions-i-ask-when-evaluating-someone-s-politics)

With that out of the way, it becomes a lot easier to talk about current issues. I keep a few primary questions in mind when I evaluate someone's politics:

#2 and #3 are why a rigorous and continuous defense of science and truth are so essential to building a good society.

1. What does *their* Ideal World look like?
2. What policies are they arguing for?
3. Do those policies help or hurt their or my Ideal World?

These questions—and their answers—are extremely effective at cutting through noise.

First, if they're trying to build a crappy world I don't want to live in—*we've found our problem*. Like White Christian Nationalism, or Islamic Theocracy, or Chinese Communism, as examples. No thanks. I'm happily exiting that discussion.

If their ideal world looks somewhat similar to mine, however, then I move onto the next step, which is talking about policies and their possible implications. This is where the tenets of using science, compassion, radical honesty, and curiosity come in—combined with needing a pretty expansive model of the world. As any economist knows, it's non-trivial to predict the effects of policies.

So obviously this is more of a discussion since—without the science being done—it's often impossible to know what policy would do what. But at least it's a starting point for a discussion, and it's based on a solid foundation of where we're trying to get to from our respective Ideal Worlds.

## Looking Left, Right, and Center [​](#looking-left-right-and-center)

I consider myself a pretty clear thinker, but I'm definitely not an expert on politics as a field.

Now let's talk about recent politics, going back 20 years or so. Short version—I've always been a Democrat. I've also only voted Democrat (except for Ron Paul one time back in the day), up to and including Kamala in November of 2024.

I wasn't thinking as clearly as the above back then, so I couldn't really articulate any of this, but it basically came down to:

1. Democrats care about people.
2. Republicans care about money.

Simple as that, so I've always been a Liberal / Democrat for those "reasons".

But politics got wonky as a hell starting somewhere around 2015 or so. Who knows when exactly that was. Maybe that's just when I started noticing or paying attention. Or perhaps I only then had the mental tools to break down various arguments and see the implications of policies and such.

Again, no idea about the nuances of these shifts.

Doesn't matter. Basically I think the far left of the last decade or so, but arguably going back to the 70’s, has lost its way.

They’ve taken to a primary narrative of telling certain people that they’re lesser than others. That they’re disabled. That it’s someone’s fault. And that they should be angry.

And worst of all—*that this should become their identity*.

It’...
