## Vendor plans to aggressively defend its case before listing catalog of shortcomings at the airline

CrowdStrike says it is "highly disappointed" and rejects the claims made by Delta and its lawyers that the vendor exhibited gross negligence in the events that led to the global IT outage a little over two weeks ago.

That's according to a letter, seen by *The Reg* and sent to [David Boies](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/crowdstrike_delta_microsoft_lawsuit/), partner at the law firm Delta hired to investigate the airline's legal options after it struggled more than most to bring its systems back online, leading to a sprawling list of flight cancellations.

The Falcon vendor reiterated its apology to Delta and the wider customer base. It then went on to remind Boies, known for his work as special counsel during the 1990s US antitrust trial against Microsoft, that it had been proactive in reaching out to Delta, offering support to the airline "within hours" of the incident unfolding.
