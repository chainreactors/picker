In just a few years, the world of [cybersecurity](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity) has changed dramatically. New technologies and threats have emerged, old ones have fallen by the wayside, and the stakes have never been higher.

As we move into 2023, it’s important to take stock of the past year and learn from our mistakes. Here are some of the biggest cybersecurity mistakes of 2022 – and how to avoid them in the New Year.

With the increasing reliance on technology in our personal and professional lives, it is essential to have strong cybersecurity measures in place to safeguard against threats such as [hackers](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-hacker/), [malware](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-malware-everything-you-need-to-know/), and data breaches. Making mistakes in this area can have serious consequences, including losing sensitive information, financial damage, and damage to an organization’s reputation.

Besides implementing the right level of [security](https://www.sentinelone.com/request-demo/) (using AI), here are a few of the main mistakes we observed in 2022:

* Failing to update software and security patches
* Using weak and easily guessable passwords
* Neglecting to back up important data
* Falling for phishing scams
* Neglecting to train employees on cybersecurity best practices
* Relying on outdated security measures
* No Identity protection implemented
* No threat hunting and lack of regular monitoring for security breaches

## Failing to Update Software and Security Patches

Not keeping software up to date can be risky as new [security vulnerabilities](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/enterprise-security-essentials-top-15-most-routinely-exploited-vulnerabilities-2022/) are regularly identified and patched by software vendors. One example is vulnerabilities like those found in Microsoft products, designated with a [CVE](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/our-cves/) (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure) label.

[Zero-day](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-day-vulnerabilities-attacks/) vulnerabilities, where no patch yet exists from the vendor, can quickly become N-day vulnerabilities, meaning a patch has been issued but the organization has not yet applied it. N-days are potentially more dangerous than zero-days because the vulnerability’s existence is now public, and threat actors are quick to develop exploits and search for organizations who have yet to patch. The infamous [WannaCry ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/are-we-done-with-wannacry/) that wreaked havoc across the world was a N-day vulnerability in Microsoft’s SMBv1 server protocol, more popularly known as [EternalBlue](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/eternalblue-nsa-developed-exploit-just-wont-die/).

These kinds of scenarios provide even greater reason for organizations to keep their environment current and running the most recent versions of each product. Proactive maintenance can help protect data centers and networks against breaches and data loss.

Here’s a typical lifecycle of an attack utilizing a zero day to compromise devices:

1. A malware author discovers a vulnerability or new attack vector.
2. The capability is weaponized and proven to work
3. The zero-day is kept secret and utilized by cybercriminals.
4. Defenders discover the vulnerability.
5. The OS vendor or application vendor delivers a patch.
6. The zero-day becomes an N-day.

The challenge is that patching requires time. It starts with the disclosure of the vulnerable software, then there is the time it takes the vendor to create a fix, and lastly, the time it takes to deploy the fix.

## Using Weak and Easily Guessable Passwords / Reusing Passwords for Multiple Accounts

Using weak and easily guessable passwords is a common mistake that can seriously affect cybersecurity. [Passwords](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/password-security-business-tips/) are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to an online account or device, so it is crucial to use strong and unique passwords that are difficult for others to guess or crack.

Weak passwords are short, use common words or phrases, or include easily guessable personal information such as a name or birthdate. These passwords can be easily cracked by attackers using automated tools, which can then be used to gain access to an account or device.

Using weak and easily guessable passwords puts sensitive information and the security of the account or device itself at risk. Using strong, unique passwords and avoiding using the same password for multiple accounts can help mitigate password compromises.

Maintaining a secure [identity](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/singularity-identity/) and account protection is critical for everyone in today’s connected world. Unfortunately, keeping track of multiple [passwords](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/password-security-business-tips/) is difficult, prompting many people to reuse the same or similar passwords on multiple accounts – a dangerous security practice that can easily lead to breaches. Organizations can take advantage of multifactor authentication ([MFA](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/)) and two-factor authentication (2FA) options to help strengthen account security. Hardware security keys and biometric authentication are also recommended for extra security.

## Neglecting to Back Up Important Data

Neglecting to back up necessary data is a mistake for cybersecurity because it can have severe consequences in the event of a cyber attack or other incident resulting in data loss. Backing up data regularly creates a copy of important files and information, which can be used to restore the original data if it is lost or corrupted. Without backups, recovering lost or damaged data may be impossible, leading to significant disruption, financial loss, or other negative consequences.

In addition to protecting against [data loss](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-data-loss-prevention-dlp/), regularly backing up critical data can also help to restore data encrypted in [ransomware attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/). Although this may not prevent attackers from attempting to extort victims with threats [to leak stolen data](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransoms-without-ransomware-data-corruption-and-other-new-tactics-in-cyber-extortion/), it can help businesses to restore essential services and minimize business disruption caused by such attacks.

## Falling for Phishing Scams

In the second quarter of 2022, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) [observed](https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2022.pdf) a record number of phishing attacks, with over 1 million instances. This marks the worst quarter for phishing that APWG has ever observed. There has also been an increase in the amount requested in wire transfer [Business Email Compromise](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/business-email-compromise-bec/) (BEC) attacks, and industries such as [healthcare and transportation](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/venus-ran...
