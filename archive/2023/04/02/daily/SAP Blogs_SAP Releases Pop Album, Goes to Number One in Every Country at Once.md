Amazing as it may seem, this fine day, 1st April 2023, the board of SAP SE have released a pop album which has instantly shot to number one position in every single country in the world.

Here is the album cover.

SAP Pop Album Cover

Who would have thought that every one of the managing board of a multi-national company all had such good singing voices? But they do, and so the original idea was that on the 50th anniversary of SAP’s existence last year an album with the eponymous title “SAP” would be released. The full name of the album is “SAP by VORSTAND ON THE RUN”

Sadly, nothing at SAP is ever released on time or under budget, so we had to wait till this year to enjoy the album.

I know all you out there in SDN world are going to buy this album anyway, making it the top selling album of all time, but in any event since I have been given an advance edition, I am going to do a review.

It is a little-known fact that before I became an ABAP Programmer, I was a writer for UK pop magazine SMASH HITS which won many literary awards for its in-depth analysis of the musical trends of the day. It was not taking the mickey, no no no, when they asked the singers in “Bananarama” if there was life on other planets that was a dead-set serious question. The journalist just wanted to know – is there or isn’t there? And who better to ask than Bananarama?

**Play List**

You may get a bit disappointed by this, but there are only ten songs on the album. The good news however is that every single one is a masterpiece. People said that about “Thriller” but this new album beats that old one into a cocked hat. They are all cover versions, because no concept in IT is ever new, but they are all vast improvements on the originals.

**Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (1)**

This song was originally written in 1933, but then covered by the pop group “The Hasso Plattners” in 1959, just before the lead singer left the pop industry to work for IBM.

The lyrics “*Do do do, do do do, Do do do ahh*” were later used a template for standard SAP error messages, as in telling the end user they need to do something to correct the erroneous situation, but do not tell them what.

**Moves Like Jagger (2)**

This song was originally sung by the USA pop group “Maroon UI5” back in 2010 for the film “Magic Mike”. Little did people know that Maroon UI5 were actually all SAP senior executives. Indeed the cast of “Magic Mike” was comprised entirely of SAP employees.

If anyone had looked closely there were two giveaway clues in the lyrics

* *But when you're with me / I'll make you believe / That I've got the SCCR key*

* *you wanna know how to make me smile / Take a GUI control, own me just for the night*

**In Memories (3)**

This song was originally written for the musical “Cats” (1983). That musical was about a group of talking cats who were trying to invent an in-memory database, with a column store as opposed to a row store. It was a bit of a novel concept for a musical, but it went down well.

**WOT? (4)**

This was originally a song by CAP Sensible in 1983, in which various programmers tried to explain to him the concept of the “Cloud Application Programming Model” (hereafter CAP)  and he had no idea what they were on about. Thus the lyrics went:

*“He said CAP! I said WOT?”*

*“He said CAP! I said WOT?”*

*“He said CAP! I said WOT?”*

*“He said CAP! I said WOT?”*

**We BUILD This City (5)**

This was originally a song by “Starship” in 1985. They correctly predicted that in 2023 SAP would rename every single one of its products, be it invented in-house or acquired, such that the word BUILD was included in the product name. If you think about it, that was quite a good guess, given the over thirty-year gap.

I am guilty here also, as I improved the lyrics to “We BUILD this City” some years back to refer to my SAP monster books as in:

“Who counts the Monsters, Underneath the Bed?

Who writes the stupid books for SAP PRESS?”

**Datasphere (6)**

This was a disco song by comedian Russ Abbot in 1985 from his album “I Love a Party”. It was all about the best way to integrate SAP data with non-SAP data thus forming a kind of “Business Warehouse” of information. He predicted that there would be several different versions of the product that did this, each one claiming that “*Until today, accessing and using data located in disparate systems and locations – across cloud providers, data vendors and on-premise systems – has been a complex challenge*” and the new version would solve that problem. He predicted the naming would change as follows over the years:

* BIW (Business Information Warehouse)

* BW

* Business Intelligence

* Corporate Information Factory

* BW (again)

* BW4HANA

* SAP Data Warehouse Cloud

* SAP Datasphere

Here he is at an SAP conference with a fellow Data Warehouse specialist.
