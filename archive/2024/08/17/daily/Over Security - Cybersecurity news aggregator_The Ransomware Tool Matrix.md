**Introduction**

Ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly damaging, but one thing remains consistent: the tools these cybercriminals rely on. The Ransomware Tool Matrix is a comprehensive resource that sheds light on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by ransomware and extortionist gangs.

This repository provides defenders with actionable intelligence on the tools frequently leveraged by adversaries, thanks to the insights shared publicly by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)'s #StopRansomware advisories and The DFIR Report's publications, among others.

This repository offers straightforward insights from compiled open source intelligence (OSINT) research that can be directly applied to threat hunting, detection engineering, and incident response operations.

**Project Background**

As defenders, we can turn the tables by exploiting a crucial flaw committed by ransomware gangs: tool reuse. Many ransomware gangs repeatedly rely on the same set of utilities and scripts, creating opportunities for defenders to pre-emptively identify, block, or mitigate these threats before they escalate further. The Ransomware Tool Matrix is designed to be an evolving resource, regularly updated with the latest threat intelligence as new information on ransomware TTPs becomes available.

Whether you're hunting for threats within your environment, investigating incidents, or trying to identify behavioural patterns among ransomware affiliates, this matrix serves as a valuable reference. With categorized lists covering everything from Remote Management and Monitoring (RMM) tools to exfiltration and defense evasion utilities, this project provides defenders with the insights needed to disrupt adversarial operations.

Explore detailed breakdowns of the most-used tools by top ransomware groups, dive into threat intelligence sources, and become informed with content like the Conti Playbook and Bassterlord Networking Manual. If you’re serious about proactive defense against ransomware, the Ransomware Tool Matrix is an indispensable tool in your arsenal.

Logo credit: RedCanary Ever since it first appeared in late 2021, the Raspberry Robin malware campaign has been propagating globally. A number of threat intelligence reports by vendors such as RedCanary (who named it) and Microsoft (who track it as DEV-0856/Storm-0856) have covered the malware campaign in great detail.  In fact, the list of blogs I do recommend to read to catch up on this threat are as follows: https://redcanary.com/blog/raspberry-robin https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/10/27/raspberry-robin-worm-part-of-larger-ecosystem-facilitating-pre-ransomware-activity https://blog.sekoia.io/raspberry-robins-botnet-second-life/ https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/raspberry-robins-roshtyak-a-little-lesson-in-trickery/ https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/raspberry-robin-anti-evasion-how-to-exploit-analysis/ https://securityintelligence.com/posts/raspberry-robin-worm-dridex-malware/ https://blogs.cisco.com/security/raspberry-robin-highly-evasive-worm-sprea...

The BlackBasta ransomware group’s leaked chat logs have proven to already be another unique and fascinating opportunity for researchers to better understand the internal operations of a Russia-based organised cybercrime enterprise. These leaks followed a major leak of Conti chat logs in 2022, which also proved to be a treasure trove of intelligence on the cybercrime enterprise. The BlackBasta gang consists of former Conti ransomware members and it should come as no surprise that their operations are similar in nature and structure. Ransomware researchers have several valuable resources to conduct investigations with nowadays. This includes ransomware.live , which contains several resources including ransomch.at , a collection of negotiation chats between ransomware gangs and their victims, as well as the ransomware tool matrix and ransomware vulnerability matrix . These resources allow to deeply understand the capabilities and motivations of these ransomware gangs. However, leaked...
