As customers move to SAP cloud solutions, our partners are looking for new ways to package and deliver their IP to our joint customers. One increasingly important route to market for our partners is SAP Store, and I want you to consider three important factors to get there:

* choosing the right SAP technology

* accessing the best programs and resources from SAP

* achieving a trusted outcome for customers.

As a member of Partner Solution Adoption, I have spent more than 13 years with SAP Partner Innovation Lifecycle Services (PILS) supporting partners to help SAP customers transform their digital journey. Partner can always reach out to me for guidance around SAP Partner programs and SAP software integration certification related services, to transform partner solution ideas into strategic innovative solutions for SAP and its customers, and to understand how to maximize customer success through SAP Partner Innovation Lifecycle Services (PILS). I hope the swim lanes below lead to your project’s success.

**1) Choosing the right SAP technology - SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)**

SAP is always a trusted partner in guiding our customers, industries, and the entire world to transform and become more resilient, more profitable, more sustainable and solve complex challenges at scale.

[**SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)**](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html) is the foundation of SAP application portfolio, which is the center of our product strategy. It allows enterprises to optimally manage resources, spend, human capital, and customer relationships. SAP BTP is the platform for SAP and its ecosystem delivering an exceptional user experience, innovation, better integration, localization, and operational excellence in the cloud. Combining both the platform and application portfolio, SAP is fully capable of supporting industry-specific, end-to-end processes and business process insights to enable every organization & every industry to become a network of intelligent, sustainable enterprises.

**The Partner opportunity**

Based on [IDC](https://news.sap.com/2020/10/new-research-sap-partner-revenue-opportunity-nearly-double-2024/) forecast models, the SAP partner opportunity will EXPAND TO $260 BILLION. This growth is underpinned and driven by SAP Cloud adoption. By 2024, with IDC’s forecasted growth of SAP revenues, the estimated new employment in the ecosystem will GROW TO 1.6 MILLION and SAP partners are forecasted to generate $5 for every $1 of SAP revenue, and for the Cloud…. partners will generate $7 for every $1 of SAP cloud revenue.

The business value provided by partners around SAP BTP is multifaceted, from consulting services to resale, implementation, and integration services, to support and managed services, to software development (both custom and packaged applications).

The [**three-step partner enablement path**](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-business-technology-platform/learn-more-with-our-sap-btp-partner-enablement-path/ba-p/4301) *(SAP Partner access only)* helps partners to navigate the available SAP BTP training offerings which will equip partners with knowledge on SAP BTP strategy, portfolio and go-to-market across any use case and Line of Business

The SAP PartnerEdge program is truly an integrated global program with four tracks, which is designed to recognize partners for their total business contribution within one track or across multiple tracks

1. Build (design, develop, and commercialize applications, software, and direct integrated solutions using APIs from SAP software)

2. Sell (resell SAP solutions)

3. Service (design, development, implementation, and integration of SAP solutions), and

4. Run (cloud services based on SAP solutions).

Partners are seeing significant benefits from working with SAP BTP to accelerate project delivery, prototype new use cases, and build out minimum viable products that customers can see and test. SAP continuously invests in the partner ecosystem by providing more incentives, and proactive positioning of partner intellectual property (IP) – to engage different partner types.

**Partner Solution Progression via SAP Store**

[SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/) is the place where SAP partners can market and deliver solutions, add-ins, and integration kits to SAP customers worldwide.

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Picture2-25.png)**

The SAP Store marketplace provides multiple performance-recognition levels with increased benefits based on activity around partner solution(s). This is called the solution progression journey, and it links each partner solution with a progression level – giving partners a quick way to match increasingly vetted and certified applications to your customer’s requirements so you can be confident in your solution recommendations, and at the same time know your compensation.
