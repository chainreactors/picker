# QuickBooks popup scam still being delivered via Google ads

Posted: November 18, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Accounting software [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/), by Intuit, is a popular target for India-based scammers, only rivaled for top spot by the classic Microsoft tech support scams.

We’ve seen two main lures, both via Google ads: the first one is simply a website promoting online support for QuickBooks and shows a phone number, while the latter requires victims to download and install a program that will generate a popup, also showing a phone number. In both instances, that number is fraudulent.

The fake QuickBooks popup was previously [described](https://www.esentire.com/blog/threat-actors-using-fake-quickbooks-software-to-scam-organizations) in detail by eSentire and reveals how scammers are able to hijack the software functionality by generating bogus alert messages.

We ran into an active [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) campaign recently, indicating that this scheme is still very much alive and well. In this blog post, we review how QuickBooks users that downloaded the program from a malicious ad will be plagued with a popup generated at certain intervals, instilling fear that their data may be corrupt so that they call for assistance.

## Fake QuickBooks download

When searching for ‘*quickbooks download*‘ on Google, we see a sponsored result appear at the top. This ad promotes a website where users can supposedly download the latest version of QuickBooks.

Here is the website, showing the official logo and even a “Solution Provider” seal of approval:

One thing that may alert users is that the download is hosted on Dropbox:

```
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ybket868cp7nx5dhj11cu/QuickBooks_Installer.msi?rlkey=gp1t0siqr2j089vhgysn4nm33&st=4ajnlxze&dl=1
```

## The form (zeform)

This installer serves two purposes: one is to download the real QuickBooks program from Intuit’s website, and the other is to surreptitiously install a sort of [backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor) “*zeform.exe*“. This simple binary was designed to integrate with QuickBooks in such a way that it can generate a fake error message, as seen below:

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_10bd90.png?w=1024)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_10bd90.png)

This type of error may be alarming to people who have spent hours loading data into QuickBooks and aren’t aware that this popup, although appearing to come from QuickBooks itself, is in fact totally made up.

The application that creates it is a program written in Microsoft .NET, which contains two important methods that control when and how the popup appears:

* *MonitorAndShowForm(),* which calls *CalculateNextDisplayDate* and is incremented on week days
* *CheckTimeWindow()* to make sure it is a weekday and within a certain time window
