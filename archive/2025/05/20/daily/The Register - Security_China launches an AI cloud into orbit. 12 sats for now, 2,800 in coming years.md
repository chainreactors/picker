Asia In Brief Chinese company Guoxing Aerospace last launched a dozen satellites, each packing a 744 TOPS of computing power, in the first step towards creating an orbiting constellation of 2,800 such satellites.

The outfit’s [social media feed](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aYZXOxxT8d5nwfye-oiZmA) states the satellites communicate with each other over 100Gbps laser links, and runs an eight-billion parameter AI model that will help to perform astronomical observations.

The sats look like a classic edge compute play – put compute near workloads to avoid latency – to help instruments including a cosmic X-ray polarimeter. Guoxing Aerospace also hopes its satellites assist emergency services and help drone users down on earth.

### New supercomputer for South Korea

South Korea’s Ministry for Science and Information and Communications Technology last week [announced](https://www.msit.go.kr/bbs/view.do?sCode=user&mPid=208&mId=214&bbsSeqNo=88&nttSeqNo=3175833) it’s buying a supercomputer from HPE, which [revealed](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/newsroom/press-release/2025/05/korea-institute-of-science-and-...
