## Exploit Title: Enlightenment v0.25.3 - Privilege escalation
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 12.26.2022
## Vendor: https://www.enlightenment.org/
## Software: https://www.enlightenment.org/download
## Reference: https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre/tree/main/CVE-2022-37706
## CVE ID: CVE-2022-37706
## Description:
The Enlightenment Version: 0.25.3 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation.
Enlightenment_sys in Enlightenment before 0.25.3 allows local users to
gain privileges because it is setuid root,
and the system library function mishandles pathnames that begin with a
/dev/.. substring
If the attacker has access locally to some machine on which the
machine is installed Enlightenment
he can use this vulnerability to do very dangerous stuff.

##### About The Exploit Database

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
