# Weekly Update 331

20 January 2023

Well and truly back into the swing of things in the new year, I think what I've found most satisfying this week is to sit down and pump out a decent blog post on something technical. It's an itch I just haven't had enough time to scratch properly in recent times and I really hope Pwned or Bot makes up for that. I love that it's generating discussion (both for and against) and that it's causing people to stop and think about how we establish the legitimacy of identities in an increasingly bot-centric world. I hope you enjoy this week's update and all the conversation surrounding it.
