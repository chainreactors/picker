*Graham Cluley Security News is sponsored this week by the folks at **Edgescan**. Thanks to the great team there for their support!*

Edgescan simplifies Vulnerability Management (VM) by delivering a single full-stack SaaS solution integrated with world-class security professionals.

Edgescan helps enterprise companies consolidate managing multiple point scanning tools for each layer of the attack surface ‚Äì focusing on what matters.

**One single dashboard**
Edgescan offers automated and accurate contextualized alerts across the entire attack surface on one single dashboard.

**Smart vulnerability management**
A team of experienced penetration testers are available on demand to validate all results and to support your Operations team to ensure timely remediation.

When security staff professionals no longer need to track down false positives, Edgescan‚Äôs clients experience improved employee engagement and productivity.

The folks at Edgescan have produced a [white paper](https://grahamcluley.com/go/edgescan/ "Link to white paper") which looks at a new model for vulnerability management ‚Äì the hybrid model.

Why would we retreat from the advances and sheer scale that automated scanning technology can deliver and burden ourselves with the slow pace of a team of humans? Should we rely on software to secure software alone? Does the hybrid model make sense?

Find out more by reading Edgescan‚Äôs white paper, **[‚ÄúDoes a hybrid model for vulnerability management make sense?‚Äù](https://grahamcluley.com/go/edgescan/ "Link to white paper")**, now.
