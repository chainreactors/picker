Lessons learned from the Glovo-Foodinho digital labour platform case

### New challenges for workersârights

According to the authors of this ETUIâs report, collecting evidence about algorithmic management is critical for workers seeking to enforce their rights by filing complaints with national DPAs or competent courts.

Ultimately, we believe that, by helping workers understand the apps that control them, we can give them the key to unlock their rights and build a fairer future of work for all.
