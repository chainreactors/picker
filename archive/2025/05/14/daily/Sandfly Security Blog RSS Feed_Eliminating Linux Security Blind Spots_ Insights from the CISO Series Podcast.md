# Eliminating Linux Security Blind Spots: Insights from the CISO Series Podcast

13 May 2025

Podcast

Sandfly CEO Craig Rowland was recently featured on the CISO Series podcast "Security You Should Know" in the episode, "[Getting Linux Visibility with Sandfly Security](https://cisoseries.com/getting-linux-visibility-with-sandfly-security/)."

The episode explores why Linux often flies under the radar in security programs despite powering our most critical systems. Craig explains how legacy servers, embedded systems, and the misconception that Linux is "secure by default" create dangerous visibility gaps.

> *Linux is not Windows. Agent-based systems take Windows antivirus security ideas and shoehorn them onto Linux, creating performance impacts and compatibility issues that leave security gaps.*

Craig discusses how Sandfly's agentless approach solves critical Linux security challenges including:

* Providing comprehensive visibility across diverse Linux environments without agents
* Using tactics hunting to detect sophisticated attacks that signature-based solutions miss
* Eliminating operational risks while protecting critical infrastructure and OT systems

Guest experts Jerich Beason (CISO at WM) and Steve Zalewski (podcast host and CISO) join the conversation to validate why this approach matters for securing modern environments. You’ll gain practical insights into how security professionals can achieve better Linux security without operational drama.
