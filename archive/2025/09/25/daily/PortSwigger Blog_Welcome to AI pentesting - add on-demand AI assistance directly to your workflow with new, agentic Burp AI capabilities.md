### Whether you’re navigating a client pentest or chasing a bounty target, even the most experienced testers hit roadblocks, burn time on repetitive tasks, or just want a second opinion.

### [Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) is designed to sit alongside you, not above you, guiding and speeding up your work without taking control. Get ready to remove friction, accelerate analysis, and allow yourself to stay focused on the creative parts of testing with these brand new capabilities.

![](/cms/images/8a/6d/8dd2-article-burp_ai_tom_stacey_.png)

## What is Burp AI?

Smarter, faster [pentesting](/solutions/penetration-testing) - without losing control.

With natural language prompts, you can ask [Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) to explain tricky behavior, explore attack ideas, validate findings, or automate repetitive steps.

From “help me with this”, all the way to “conduct in-depth analysis”, prompting [Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) helps you push through roadblocks - all while you stay in control. Imagine having an AI-powered security expert at your side at all times: one who reduces time-to-insight and time-to-impact, so you can focus on the creative, high-value parts of testing.

[Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) feels more like a peer than a bot: suggesting next moves, checking your work, and helping you turn complex data into actionable insight. You stay in the driver’s seat; [Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) speeds the route.

![](/cms/images/41/28/2b93-article-blog_gif_2.gif)

## Where can I find Burp AI?

In addition to providing on-demand [AI enhancements](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai/capabilities) to various features in Burp (including AI powered extensibility, and AI [recorded logins](/burp/vulnerability-scanner/authenticated-scanning)), you can now pair with Burp AI directly in Repeater.

That means no context switching and no juggling extra tools. Simply open Repeater and you’ll see Burp AI ready to help, right where you already work. It’s pentesting assistance embedded at the point of execution.

## How can Burp AI help me?

Burp AI helps you cut through noise and focus on what really matters, finding and exploiting the vulnerabilities that make a difference. It gives you faster paths from idea to insight, whether that means suggesting payloads, refining attack angles, or providing an expert second opinion on tricky findings.

You can offload the tedious parts (repetitive validation, summarizing complex behavior, or drafting report text) while still keeping full control over each step. The result is more time for the high-value, puzzle-solving work that makes security testing rewarding.

And whether you’re working alone or leading a team, Burp AI helps scale impact without sacrificing quality. It reinforces good practice for less-experienced testers and keeps everything inside PortSwigger’s trusted boundary, so your data and process stay secure.

## How can I optimize my workflow by using Burp AI in Repeater?

### Spot leads to investigate

Burp AI can scan request and response data for anything unusual or potentially sensitive.

Instead of manually combing through, you can ask it to highlight interesting behavior worth digging into, or even let it begin probing the functionality itself.

### Automate repetitive XSS tests

Testing for [stored XSS](/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored), [CSRF](/web-security/csrf), or other classic issues can be slow and repetitive.

With Burp AI, you can simply prompt, "test whether this functionality is vulnerable to stored XSS", and it will generate and send payloads, then analyze responses - saving you the grind all while keeping you in control.

### Bypass filters and input sanitization

Many vulnerabilities lurk behind filters or sanitization. Burp AI can try crafting payloads that evade defenses for cases like XSS, [SQL injection](/web-security/sql-injection), or template injection.

Just tell it what you’re testing, and it will attempt filter bypasses automatically.

### Demonstrate impact beyond a proof-of-concept

Once you’ve proven a bug with a harmless payload, Burp AI can help escalate the finding.
