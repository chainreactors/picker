CVE-2024-55447: Potential PII leak and incorrect access control in
Paxton Net2 software

```
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
Insecure backend database in the Paxton Net2 software.
Possible leaking of PII incorrect access control.
Access cards can be cloned without physical access to the original card.
Audit log integrity compromised.
No physical access to computer running Paxton Net2 is required.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Paxton Net2Â  (all current versions)

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================
```

By exploiting MSSQL single user mode it is possible to gain
administrator rights to the Net2 database.
In this database plaintext PIN codes for building entrance can be found
and changed. It is also possible to add
users to the system and enable/disable users in the system. By reading
tables in the MSSQL table PII is leaked.
Apart from the PII in plaintext in the database, card data is also
stored unencrypted in the database.
Using the data in the database cards can be cloned without having the
original card if a Mifare or multi-protocol

```
reader is used for building entrance.
```

The above vulnerabilities are also relevant for the integrity of the
audit logs in Paxton Net2 software. These audit
logs should never be used as forensic data. Not only is it possible
cards are cloned, but audit log data can be

```
manipulated directly in the database tables.
```

In order to gain access local access to the computer running Net2 is
necessary, but this can also be over a network

```
using e.g. Anydesk which makes physical access not necessary.
```

The vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability after contact. There
is no fix planned.

```
========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
```

As the vendor has not acknowledged the vulnerability there is no
effective remediation for this vulnerability.
The most effective measure at this moment is closely monitoring who has
local access to the machine running the Net2

```
software.

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================
```

There is no known effective mitigation. Limiting who has local access to
the machine running the Net2 software seems

```
the most effective measure. Card cloning can be mitigated by not using
