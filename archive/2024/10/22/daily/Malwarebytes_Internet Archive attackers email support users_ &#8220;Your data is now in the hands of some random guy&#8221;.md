# Internet Archive attackers email support users: “Your data is now in the hands of some random guy”

Posted: October 21, 2024

Those who hacked the Internet Archive haven’t gone away. Users of the Internet Archive who have submitted helpdesk tickets are reporting replies to the tickets from the [hackers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) themselves.

Internet Archive, most known for its Wayback Machine, is a digital library that allows users to look at website snapshots from the past. It is often used for academic research and data analysis. Earlier in October, the Internet Archive suffered from a [data breach and DDoS attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/internet-archive-suffers-data-breach-and-ddos).

During that breach the attackers were able to steal a user [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) database containing 31 million records.

While the Wayback Machine is almost fully functional again, in a recent turn of events the attackers have started replying to those users that have opened a support ticket with the Internet Archive.

This is one of the replies a user [reported](https://x.com/AntonioMA_dev/status/1847952198065401886/photo/1):

> “It’s dispiriting to see that even after being made aware of the breach 2 weeks ago, IA has still not done the due diligence of rotating many of the API keys that were exposed in their gitlab secrets.
>
> As demonstrated by this message, this includes a Zendesk token with perms to access 800K+ support tickets sent to info@archive.org since 2018.
>
> Whether you were trying to ask a general question, or requesting the removal of your site from the Wayback Machine—your data is now in the hands of some random guy. If not me, it’d be someone else.
>
> Here’s hoping that they’ll get their shit together now.”

An Application Programming Interface (API) token is like a special pass that allows a computer program or app to access and use services provided by another program or website. It is used as proof that the user or app has permission to access the service.

It appears as if the Internet Archive uses Zendesk to manage its support tickets. Having the Internet Archive’s Zendesk token would certainly explain why the hackers can reply to customer tickets.

Changing a Zendesk API token is not very hard, but it can have unexpected consequences, so it may require some advance planning to minimize potential disruptions. This could be why the Internet Archive may not have gotten round to it yet. But not changing API keys that would grant the attackers access to the organization’s important infrastructure like Zendesk would be a serious omission.

On October 18, 2024, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, posted an [update](https://blog.archive.org/2024/10/18/internet-archive-services-update-2024-10-17/) stating the stored data of the Internet Archive is safe and work on resuming services safely is in progress.

> “We’re taking a cautious, deliberate approach to rebuild and strengthen our defenses. Our priority is ensuring the Internet Archive comes online stronger and more secure.”

Customer service platform Zendesk said it worked with the Internet Archive to help resolve the situation even though it was not their fault.

So far, the Internet Archive has not responded to the new developments, and the motivation for the attacks on the Internet Ar...
