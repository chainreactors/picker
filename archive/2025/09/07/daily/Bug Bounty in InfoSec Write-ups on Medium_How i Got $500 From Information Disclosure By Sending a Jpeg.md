Hello Hacker

### I‚Äôm Mohamed also known as Mado, a dedicated security researcher and bug hunter

> NOTE: **The target is an external application with a disclosure program, but since I haven‚Äôt received official permission yet, I‚Äôm using** `target.com` **as a placeholder in this write-up**

## Target Overview

The target platform provides a **team workspace** where members can collaborate by creating and managing tasks. In addition, the platform offers a **built-in team chat feature** that allows users to communicate directly within the workspace

## The Discovery

During my testing I focused on the **chat functionality** specifically the file upload feature since it allows users to share images and documents with other team members

While uploading an image I noticed that the request included a parameter called `file_url`This parameter pointed to the location of the uploaded image. Naturally I wondered: *what if I change this value to an external domain under my control*

Request After Change

**I also checked the server response to confirm whether the request returned a** `200 OK` **or a** `400 Bad Request`

**Then I switched to the victim account opened the chat and went back to The IP logger Then BOOM**

## Impact:

Black Hat Hackers can get critical information about all The Target users in Team The information obtained is very important for the privacy of the users and includes information such as IP address, OS version , city ‚Ä¶

## The Result:

In the end I was able to prove that simply by uploading a modified JPEG in the team chat it was possible to trigger requests to an external server As a result I successfully collected sensitive information from other team members including their (**IP address, time zone, operating system version country and browser details (User-Agent)** all **without any user interaction)**
