The zero-day exploitation of a now-patched security flaw in Google Chrome led to the distribution of an espionage-related tool from Italian information technology and services provider Memento Labs, according to [new findings](https://securelist.com/forumtroll-apt-hacking-team-dante-spyware/117851/) from Kaspersky.

The vulnerability in question is [CVE-2025-2783](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/zero-day-alert-google-releases-chrome.html) (CVSS score: 8.3), a case of sandbox escape which the company disclosed in March 2025 as having come under active exploitation as part of a campaign dubbed **Operation ForumTroll** targeting organizations in Russia. The cluster is also tracked as [TaxOff/Team 46](https://habr.com/ru/companies/pt/articles/841176/) by [Positive Technologies](https://ptsecurity.com/research/pt-esc-threat-intelligence/kvartalnyj-otchet-iyun-2025/) and [Prosperous Werewolf](https://bi.zone/eng/expertise/research/threat-zone-2025/) by BI.ZONE. It's known to be active since at least February 2024.

The wave of infections involved sending phishing emails containing personalized, short-lived links inviting recipients to the Primakov Readings forum. Clicking the links through Google Chrome or a Chromium-based web browser was enough to trigger an exploit for CVE-2025-2783, enabling the attackers to break out of the confines of the program and deliver tools developed by Memento Labs.

Headquartered in Milan, [Memento Labs](https://mem3nt0.com) (also stylized as mem3nt0) was formed in April 2019 following the merger of InTheCyber Group and HackingTeam (aka Hacking Team), the latter of which has a [history](https://securelist.com/the-return-of-hackingteam-with-new-implants-for-os-x/74063/) of [selling](https://thehackernews.com/2018/01/android-spying-malware.html) offensive intrusion and surveillance capabilities to governments, law enforcement agencies, and corporations, including [creating spyware](https://theintercept.com/2015/07/16/hackingteam-attacked-tor-browser/) designed to monitor the Tor browser.

Most notably, the infamous surveillance software vendor [suffered](https://thehackernews.com/2015/07/Italian-hacking-team-software.html) a [hack](https://www.vice.com/en/article/hacking-teams-equipment-got-stolen-in-panama/) in July 2015, [resulting](https://thehackernews.com/2015/07/Hacking-Team-Flash-Zero-Day.html) in the [leak](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/how-a-russian-hacker-made-45000-selling-a-zero-day-flash-exploit-to-hacking-team/) of hundreds of gigabytes of internal data, including [tools and exploits](https://securelist.com/the-mysterious-case-of-cve-2016-0034-the-hunt-for-a-microsoft-silverlight-0-day/73255/). Among these was an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) development kit dubbed [VectorEDK](https://github.com/hackedteam/vector-edk) that would later go on to become the foundation for a UEFI bootkit known as [MosaicRegressor](https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/uefi-bootkit-malware.html). In April 2016, the company courted further trouble after Italian export authorities [revoked](https://thehackernews.com/2016/04/hacking-team-loses-license-to-sell.html) its license to sell outside of Europe.

In the latest set of attacks documented by the Russian cybersecurity vendor, the lures targeted media outlets, universities, research centers, government organizations, financial institutions, and other organizations in Russia with the primary goal of espionage.

"This was a targeted spear-phishing operation, not a broad, indiscriminate campaign," Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), told The Hacker News. "We observed multiple intrusions against organizations and individuals in Russia and Belarus, with lures aimed at media outlets, universities, research centers, government bodies, financial institutions, and others in Russia."

Most notably, the attacks have been found to pave the way for a previously undocumented spyware developed by Memento Labs called LeetAgent, owing to the use of [leetspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) for its commands.

The starting point is a validator phase, which is a small script executed by the browser to check if the visitor to the malicious site is a genuine user with a real web browser, and then leverages CVE-2025-2783 to detonate the sandbox escape in order to achieve remote code execution and drop a loader responsible for launching LeetAgent.

The malware is capable of connecting to a command-and-control (C2) server over HTTPS and receiving instructions that allow it to perform a wide range of tasks -

* 0xC033A4D (COMMAND) – Run command using cmd.exe
* 0xECEC (EXEC) – Execute a process
* 0x6E17A585 (GETTASKS) – Get a list of tasks that the agent is currently executing
* 0x6177 (KILL) – Stop a task
* 0xF17E09 (FILE \x09) – Write to file
* 0xF17ED0 (FILE \xD0) – Read a file
* 0x1213C7 (INJECT) – Inject shellcode
* 0xC04F (CONF) – Set communication parameters
* 0xD1E (DIE) – Quit
* 0xCD (CD) – Change current working directory
* 0x108 (JOB) – Set parameters for keylogger or file stealer to harvest files matching extensions \*.doc, \*.xls, \*.ppt, \*.rtf, \*.pdf, \*.docx, \*.xlsx, and \*.pptx

The malware used in the intrusions has been traced all the way back to 2022, with the threat actor also linked to a broader set of malicious cyber activity aimed at organi...
