# Top 5 ransomware detection techniques: Pros and cons of each

October 12, 2022

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

In the fight against ransomware, much of the discussion revolves around prevention and response. Actually detecting the ransomware, however, is just as important to securing your business. To understand why, just consider the following example.

Let’s say you’re a farmer taking care of a flock of sheep and you’re worried about wolves. You’ve installed a fence: that’s prevention. You have an air horn to scare away the wolf in the event of an attack: that’s response. Great! But what if you had an alarm system and could take action as soon as the wolf got through your fence, before it started attacking at all? That’s what detection is all about.

Detection sits right between both prevention and response, and it’s a critical first defense against ransomware. You see, ransomware will get through your systems one way or another. And when it does, we want to detect it right away so we can stop it from moving through your network and encrypting any valuable or sensitive files.

But detecting ransomware can be tricky. Attackers use obfuscation and evasion techniques to avoid detection, and new ransomware variants are being produced every day. As a result, businesses should be using multiple different ransomware detection techniques, fully aware of the pros and cons of each.

In this post, we’ll look at 5 ransomware detection techniques and their pros and cons.

## 1. Static file analysis

Let’s say you’re on an IT or security team and an alert has triggered on a key server within the organization. The alert is rather vague but is reporting that the file is potentially malware.

Making matters worse, the hash of the file isn’t on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/)and you can’t find any information on the Internet to determine if the file is malicious or not.

To see if this file is potentially ransomware (or any malware for that matter), one option is to do static file analysis. Static file analysis is a type of malware analysis that looks at whether an executable file is suspicious without actually running the code.

In the context of ransomware, static file analysis looks for known malicious code sequences or suspicious strings, such as commonly targeted file extensions and common words used in ransom notes.

One of the free tools that you may find useful for this purpose is [PeStudio](https://www.winitor.com/). This free tool flags suspicious artifacts within executable files and can be used to examine the embedded strings, libraries, imports, and other indicators of compromise (IOCs) in a file.

### Pros:

* Low false positive rate
* Effective against known ransomware
* Can stop attacks before execution so no files are encrypted

### Cons:

* Time consuming if conducted manually
* Can be bypassed easily using Packers / Crypters or by simply replacing characters with digits or special characters

## 2. Common file extensions blacklist

With file access monitoring tools, you can blacklist file rename operations for well-known ransomware extensions, or be alerted as soon as a new file is created with such an extension.

For example, a file-access monitoring tool [by Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/blog/fighting-ransomware-tools/)allows you to block certain types of extensions from being saved on the storage system and shares, such as the WannaCry ransomware (.wncry).
