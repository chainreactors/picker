@ ALL,

Considering the article statement,

> *‚ÄúThe Social Media Use by Minors bill was ‚Äúindefinitely postponed‚Äù and ‚Äúwithdrawn from consideration‚Äù in the Florida **House of Representatives** earlier this week. Lawmakers in the Florida **Senate** had already voted to advance the legislation, but a bill requires both legislative chambers to pass before it can become law.‚Äù*

You have to ask if it was actually ‚Äúself interest‚Äù that tipped the scale to ‚ÄúNO‚Äù‚Ä¶

@ Clive Robinson,

Of course, the politicians in the USA are even offended when called ‚ÄúPublic Servants.‚Äù

Backdoors should only be allowed when pi can be legislated to be 3.

@ Peter Galbavy,

With regards,

> ‚ÄúBackdoors should only be allowed when pi can be legislated to be 3.‚Äù

Not in Australia‚Ä¶ There the writ of ‚ÄúPustulent Encrusted ‚ÄúStale White Insipid Males‚Äù(PE-SWIM) was made clear by some looser who said,

> *‚ÄúThe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia‚Äù*

<https://www.newscientist.com/article/2140747-laws-of-mathematics-dont-apply-here-says-australian-pm/>

This was back in 2017, and in due course Malcolm Turnbull PM proved he was a looser in about a year (Aug 2018) he was gone. And got replaced by something even worse ‚ÄúScotty from Marketing‚Äù).

But‚Ä¶ Getting back to Pi a lot of people tried geometric tricks to make it not 3.14159‚Ä¶ but 3 and an 1/7th or 22/7. Which to use a derogatory Australian phrase,

‚ÄúGood enough for Government work‚Äù

(The US version was ‚ÄúClose enough‚Ä¶‚Äù and ment high standards).

But there is a fun ‚Äúshuffle box‚Äù mathematical way of getting Pi to any arbitrary precision. Have a look at,

<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6dTyOl1fmDo>

It‚Äôs actually a fascinating algorithm.

@ Clive Robinson

Australia‚Ä¶ the country that has ever been ‚Äúumop apisdn‚Äù. üòâ

Don‚Äôt know a lot about the United States; in my country, an incredibly invasive law that makes our intelligence service spy in the country citizens when they suspect some action against the government interests, did not pass the Senate.

One year later it was approved, this time without consultation, on a sunday morning.

FYI
PI may be equaled to SQRT(10) where appropriate.

Your work in opposing the bill that would have compromised user privacy is greatly appreciated.

@Bauke Jan Douma

For practical use with hand tools, early Chinese engineers ussed pi=3, or for more precise work sqrt10. In the late Han dynasty Liu Hui independently derived Archimedes polygon method to achieve the figure of 355/113, but this was rejected by most at the time as impractical.

@ALL

The Florida Bill‚Äôs LEA backdoor appears to be an amendment as it went thru Senate, added as sub-para 5 in several Sections of the Bill. Also added were: Parents must be able to read all minors‚Äô messages; and no ‚Äúvanishing‚Äù messages for minors. Sub-paras 1 thru 4 of the various sections appear fairly harmless, but big tech would kick and scream at losing a lucrative chunk of their market.

Australia has introduced a law to ban social media for users under 16 years of age. It is supposed to come into effect in December, reportedly to give the tech giants time to work out how to do it. I haven‚Äôt read it yet. RZ? New Zealand following suit introduced a private bill which has vamished into the ballot for Members Bills. A usually red-neck talk-back host admitted it was a good idea, but the government had absolutely no way of enforcing it.

This is good news. Since decades ago US courts have been ordering defendants to hand over passwords to encrypted files, accounts, and safes. Since knowing the secret to encrypted data is tantamount to confession, the better the encryption and passphrase (in whatever form), the stronger the proof, I never understood how that is constitutional.
Backdoors remain the one step needed to bypass the mere probable cause, and requisite arrest, and courtroom command needed to get the data. Which is pretty weak tea respect for the constitution if you ask me. But getting around that pesky document seems to be what representative government wants most.
The effort on the privacy side should focus on the unreasonable US case law that commands coughing up passwords. Meanwhile make use of weaknesses enabling an excuse or two.

@ lurker,

There is an argument that there are an infinite number of vulgar[1] fractions of the form a.P/b.Q ‚Äìwhere a&b are natural numbers and P&Q are primes‚Äì that will approximate Pi or similar.

22/7 is 2.11/1.7
355/113 is 5.71/1.113

A way to find some of them is the ‚Äúshuffle box‚Äù idea I mention above. The argument goes on that the form a.P/Q works as well.

Then you...
