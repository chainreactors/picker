# Analysis to action: Operationalizing your threat intelligence

## Timing is everything in the war against ransomware thieves, says Prelude Security

Partner content When a new security advisory drops or an alarming new ransomware campaign makes the news, the question from leadership inevitably follows: "Are we covered?"

For many security teams, answering that question can be a slow and reactive process. Mapping new threats to your current configuration, authoring tests, and validating detection typically involve manual processes, scattered consoles, and spreadsheets. Days can pass before you have any assurance about your defensive posture, potentially leaving your organization exposed.

### **New threats don't wait for you to catch up**

Threat actors exploit overlooked gaps as soon as they identify them. If your defenses can't address new techniques or rapidly evolving campaigns, vulnerabilities can linger undetected.

As days and weeks pass, [threat intelligence decays](https://www.preludesecurity.com/blog/battling-threat-intelligence-decay) because adversaries adapt their techniques and behaviors. Its value to an organization depends on how quickly teams can use it.

Most organizations struggle to do that. While many have access to high-quality intel, they often lack the processes and tools to translate it into action quickly enough for it to be useful. By the time they adjust their defenses in response to new intel, attackers are already onto the next vulnerability.

### **Bridging the gap between intel and implementation**

Let's consider a common scenario for a SOC or IT team. The team receives a detailed threat report loaded with guidance on the relevant techniques or variations, typically mapped to a framework like MITRE ATT&CK. This may include examples of Process Injecti...
