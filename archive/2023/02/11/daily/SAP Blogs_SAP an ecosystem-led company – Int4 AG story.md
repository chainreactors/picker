Just this week SAP launched "SAP Partner Live: Global Partner Success Kickoff 2023" session by by Karl Fahrbach (SAP Chief Partner Officer) which shows that SAP is not only saying it's becoming an ecosystem-led company but also confirming that with many actions that are already taking or took place.

## Why do I say this is already taking place?

Here at Int4 AG we've witnessed it a lot in 2022 but let me share with you the whole story.

Int4 AG is a >50 people company from Switzerland which provide niche solutions (Int4 Suite) that automate the testing of SAP business integration scenarios, SAP API automated testing and simulate 3rd party systems and B2B/EDI partners to secure their complex supply chains and API led strategies. As a company we've been in the ecosystem for over a decade now and we've always tried to support SAP with many activities:

a) writing SAP Press books (over 10 already) - [Int4 SAP Press books](https://learning.sap-press.com/author/int4)

b) helping SAP Product Owners run many SAP Teched sessions (at over 18 different SAP Teched events in Europe and USA)

c) helping to grow SAP communities, Int4 has two (now former) SAP Mentors

d) taking part in amazing challenges organised by SAP - like Hack2Build where we've won an amazing award: ![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-10-at-15.52.31.png)

## Where and when is SAP supporting small companies you might ask?

But this is just one side of the story - SAP is also doing it's part to prove they are already an ecosystem-led company as they support even small companies and I will give you a few examples.

First of all we were given an opportunity to publish 2 official openSAP courses: "Avoid SAP S/4HANA Project Delays with Third-Party Systems Service Virtualization" and "Virtualize and Automate Your SAP Testing Using Int4 IFTT". This was an amazing experience for our team that we can host our course on an official SAP massive online learning platform.

## SAP OEMed your solution for a RiseWithSAP Service?

It does not end there. At the beginning of 2022 we've signed an [OEM partnership](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/20/accelerate-sap-s-4hana-projects-with-sap-s-4hana-interface-testing-service/) with SAP Enterprise Cloud Service team where a RiseWithSAP service called "[SAP S/4HANA interface testing](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/20/accelerate-sap-s-4hana-projects-with-sap-s-4hana-interface-testing-service/)" service is running on Int4 Suite. The whole SAP ECS CAS team run under Peter Pluim were very supportive in each aspect of the partnership. Thank you: Christoph Hermann, Lalit Patil, Rod Pobre, Martin Biet, Akshay Subramanya and the rest of the team.

## SAP Recommends Int4 solutions at SAP Teched?

Even this is possible with SAP! When I saw Juergen Mueller mention our new SAP BTP Integration Suite partnership at SAP Teched 2022 I couldn't believe it but it was true!

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-10-at-20.52.31.png)

Thanks to the amazing team of SAP BTP Integration Suite Product Owners lead by Piyush Gakhar and his team Shilpa Vij, Ron Chermin, Paul Medaille, Ryan Champlin, Andreas Quenstedt our solutions for testing integration platform migrations - Int4 Shield - due to this partnership is now offered for free to any of the few thousands of SAP Process Orchestration customers who want to migrate to SAP Integration Suite. Not only that but our solution is also mentioned on the SAP Roadmap - how amazing is that?

## Technology move! Why move to SAP BTP ABAP Cloud? Because you get support from SAP!

There are many reasons why we're moving our solutions to the SAP BTP ABAP Cloud but one of them is frankly unexpected - we get tons of support from Frank Jentsch - Chief Development Architect for SAP BTP ABAP Cloud and his team. Our Head of Products and Chief Architect can get almost real time help from SAP team and this allows us to speed up the migration to SAP BTP ABAP Cloud a lot! How can you ask for more?

## SAP ecosystem-led company - you better believe it!

Who would expect a company like Int4 AG would get this much help from such competent support? Now we know, SAP believes in partners and these are not just words. Thank you SAP and hope to work with your teams even more in the future!
