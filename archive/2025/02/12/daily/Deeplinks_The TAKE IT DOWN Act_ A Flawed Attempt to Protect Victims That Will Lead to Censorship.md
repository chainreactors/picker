Congress has begun debating the TAKE IT DOWN Act ([S. 146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/146)), a bill that seeks to speed up the removal of a troubling type of online content: non-consensual intimate imagery, or NCII. In recent years, concerns have also grown about the use of digital tools to alter or create such images, [sometimes called deepfakes](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/congress-should-not-rush-regulate-deepfakes).

While protecting victims of these heinous privacy invasions is a legitimate goal, good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy. As currently drafted, the Act mandates a notice-and-takedown system that threatens free expression, user privacy, and due process, without addressing the problem it claims to solve.

### **The Bill Will Lead To Overreach and Censorship**

S.B. 146 mandates that websites and other online services remove flagged content within 48 hours and requires “reasonable efforts” to identify and remove known copies. Although this provision is designed to allow NCII victims to remove this harmful content, its broad definitions and lack of safeguards will likely lead to people misusing the notice-and-takedown system to remove lawful speech.
