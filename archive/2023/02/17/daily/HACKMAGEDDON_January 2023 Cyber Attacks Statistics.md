After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/01/31/1-15-january-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/02/13/16-31-january-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of January 2023 where I have collected and analyzed 284 events, a value higher than December. The new year does not look good.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, once again above 80% with a value similar to the previous month (**82.2%** vs. **82%** in December). The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** are down to **6.8%** from **7.9%**. **Hacktivism** goes up to **6.4%**from **3.7%**from **5.1%**, and **Cyber Warfare** goes down to **2.1%** from **3.7%**, of December 2022.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, and once again the growing number of ransomware attacks push its percentage above 40%, to **44.8%**from **40.4%**, ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers**, up to **12.5%** from **10.1%**, and the exploitation of of **Vulnerabilities** at number three, among the known attack techniques, with **8,2%**, the same value of December 2022. Once again **Targeted Attacks** are immediately behind with **4.3%** down from **6.4%** of December 2022.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, with **23.5%**, a value close to **24.3%** of December 2022, ahead of **Education** (**11.9%** vs. **6.4%**), and **Healthcare** (**10.1%** vs **10.5%**).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/January-2023-Statistics.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
