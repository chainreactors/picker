# 1. Introducing warehouse management

Every warehouse is different and should be managed by a unique, customized
software solution. Although SAP Business ByDesign is a Cloud ERP
Suite with extensive standard processes and functions, you can use it to
develop a flexible and dynamic Warehouse Management System to meet the
requirements of every company that operates a warehouse.

The solution simplifies operation and boosts productivity. The capabilities and functions
of SAP Business ByDesign meet or exceed the vast majority of other
dedicated warehouse management systems.

In a study by ibi Research, 62 percent of surveyed online retailers state that
they use their merchandise management system to automate processes or
reduce manual processes. A total of 49 percent also wanted more transparent
processes, while 66 percent introduced merchandise management
because of the consistent data inventory it provided. Making the change to
software-based automation generally pays dividends even for businesses
handling small package numbers per day.

### *Intralogistics – the flow of goods in the company*

From goods receipt **1** , the goods pass through an incoming inspection before moving on to the warehouse system/high-rack storage area **2** . **3** Goods are taken from the warehouse to the production area. **4** The goods and products manufactured are moved to the high-rack storage area/warehouse system. **5** The goods in the warehouse are picked according to the customer orders. **6** Goods issue. The picked customer orders are prepared for shipping and handed over to freight forwarding. **7** and **8** represent the internal stock transfer of products in the warehouse.

###

### *Simple operation*

The integrated merchandise management (WaWi) of SAP Business ByDesign
uses automated data acquisition and workflow compliance to streamline all
warehouse tasks. We drastically reduce errors that occur during tasks such
as goods receipt, placement in storage, picking, consolidation, and packaging.
SAP Business ByDesign introduces the concept of process validation,
which means that employees cannot continue until the current task is
correctly completed.

### *Enhanced productivity*

Thanks to this simplicity, items are recorded, placed into storage, picked,
bundled, packed, and dispatched with greater speed and accuracy.
Warehouse workers can spend more time carrying out necessary tasks
instead of wasting time rectifying errors such as misplaced items and
incorrectly completed orders. Increased productivity boosts customer
satisfaction because customers receive their orders quicker and return
them due to errors less frequently.

### *Return on investment*

The business benefits associated with ease of use and enhanced
productivity are sufficient to generate a rapid return on investment, so that
these functions and processes justify the use of SAP Business ByDesign –
in addition to all the other functions of this ERP suite.

# 2. Getting started

The use of software solutions delivers the most consistent increase in your
warehouse efficiency. The software reduces human error and misconduct
while at the same time ensuring that each action is validated and completed
on time.
First and foremost, your merchandise management system (WMS) administers
all operations involved in the receipt of goods and shipping of orders. It
assigns the orders by priority, allows you to sort them according to criteria
that are important to you, and creates step-by-step instructions to guide your
order pickers. Order priorities can be changed according to specified rules if
you wish. This would be virtually impossible using manual sorting procedures.
As a result, more orders are shipped and picked, and your team members
are informed at all times of their tasks.

## Determining the warehouse layout

The warehouse layout is an important aspect when it comes to increasing
the efficiency of your warehouse. Many small companies begin with an overflowing
room that functions as a warehouse. Employees gradually stack
products or components there as they see fit. They find it very difficult to
find these items again later on. What you do next can determine the future
of your business. Successfully maintaining warehouse efficiency begins with
**three simple steps**:

* maximizing the warehouse space

* minimizing the physical steps

* Keeping order

### *Maximizing the warehouse*

Your warehouse space is measured in three dimensions. When planning your
warehouse layout, you must take a...
