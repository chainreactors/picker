Zero Trust is a journey where you may choose to address it one capability at a time.

Where should you begin?

You start by identifying and prioritizing the problems you are trying to solve. First, taking inventory of the technology you are already using plus the current in-house expertise will allow you to identify quick and easy wins, as well as intermediate steps to take before addressing the challenges that will be hardest for your organization.

For example, many organizations already have investments in Web Security or Cloud Security, but don’t yet have Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) capabilities.  Identifying where you want to go with ZTNA and seeing if your current Web or Cloud security vendor has ZTNA capabilities that satisfy your needs is a good way to plan future convergence of security.

Micro-segmentation of the network and wholistic data tagging are two of the more difficult challenges for most organizations, but intermediate capabilities with unified security platforms can help ease the journey.  Unified DLP capabilities in SASE platforms can help identify types of sensitive data stored across the organization and normal patterns of accessing and moving that data.  Additionally, integrated SD-WAN capabilities can help converge security and networking as you move towards micro-segmentation.

Take a look at the key steps to simplify Zero Trust—Five security challenges that are addressed by one of the core SASE components. Tthen watch demos of how Forcepoint solves each of them.

**1. Protect Sensitive Data in the Cloud and Devices with Forcepoint ONE CASB**

**2. Protect Access to Private Apps with Forcepoint ONE ZTNA**
Virtual private network (VPN) access to corporate resources is costly, difficult to manage, and vulnerable to penetration. ZTNA offers a more viable approach to providing internal access to private apps from remote locations.

**3. Protect Dangerous and Inappropriate Web Use with Forcepoint ONE SWG**

The line between good and bad websites has become forever blurred. Organizations must provide safe access to websites on a much broader level.

**4. Deploy Data Security Consistently with Forcepoint ONE DLP**

Protect sensitive data and keep out threats like malware from getting in while employers are accessing and using websites that fall somewhere in the middle.

**5. Improve the Security and Connectivity of Remote Sites with Forcepoint Secure SD-WAN**

Use Secure SD-WAN to safely and efficiently connect remote sites and resources while always insuring high quality of service for business-critical applications.
