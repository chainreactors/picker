Webinar As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, staying informed is crucial for IT professionals.

Cloudflare's 2024 Global Security Brief delves into the most pressing issues facing the cybersecurity landscape today. With increasing activity and new attack methods, understanding these threats can be essential for maintaining robust security protocols and protecting organizational infrastructure.

You can join experts Trey Guinn and Trevor Lyness for an in-depth discussion on the latest developments in this [webinar](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/30389/why-informed-is-forearmed-understanding-escalating-threat-trends) on August 20th at 12pm ET/9am PT.

Trey and Trevor will cover:

**- DDoS attack evolution:** Gain insights into the newest strategies in Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks, which continue to evolve in complexity and frequency.

**- API and network security:** Learn about the emerging threats specifically targeting APIs and network infrastructures, critical areas for any IT professional.

**- AI-enhanced phishing:** Discover how artificial intelligence is being leveraged to create more sophisticated phishing attacks, making them more challenging to detect and counter.

**- Zero Trust security:** Explore the principles of Zero Trust and how this approach can significantly bolster your cybersecurity defenses by assuming no part of your network is inherently secure.

This session is designed to arm IT and security professionals with the latest knowledge and practical strategies to combat the complex and evolving threats in today's cyber landscape.
