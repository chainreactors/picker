# Give your PC a fresh start: New free tools to boost your PC’s speed, security, and peace of mind

Posted: September 4, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

If you ever have the feeling your computer is dragging its feet, or shows odd behavior, you’re not alone. In some cases, the culprit is indeed [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), but often it’s something more mundane. Over time, baggage accumulates, much like a toddler’s backpack after a day in the forest.

Too many apps starting up at once, Windows settings not tuned for your needs, or even a [firewall](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall) that’s too confusing to manage.

That’s why we’re launching Malwarebytes Tools, a new set of free features designed to give your Windows PC a breath of fresh air.

Think of Malwarebytes Tools as spring cleaning for your computer: clearing out what slows you down, tidying up behind the scenes, and strengthening defenses—without having to read a manual as lengthy as The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

And the best part? They’re completely free, available today in preview mode inside the Malwarebytes app.

As Michael Sherwood, VP of Product at Malwarebytes, explains:

> “For years, people have come to Malwarebytes when something’s not right with their computer. But issues aren’t always caused by malware. Sometimes it’s slow performance, privacy settings, or other configuration issues. With our new optimization tools, we’re making it easier for users to spot these problems and take proactive steps to keep their devices running smoothly and securely.”

Here’s what you get with Malwarebytes Tools:

* **Startup Applications:** If your PC takes forever to start up, it could be because too many apps are trying to start all at the same time. Our feature gives you a clear view of what’s booting up with Windows, and the power to say “no thanks” to the ones that don’t need to be there.

* **System Tweaks\*:** These are like quick-fix buttons for your PC. You can use them to repair common issues, adjust privacy settings, and fine-tune how Windows behaves.

* **Firewall Control:** Firewalls are essential for [online security](https://www.malwarebytes.com/internet-security), but for many people, managing them can be challenging. That’s why we don’t give you another firewall to figure out, we simplify the one you already have. With our new Firewall Control, you can block unwanted traffic, manage which apps have internet access, and switch filtering modes with just one click. Simple, powerful, and built right into what you already use.

*\*Windows 11 only*

Malwarebytes Tools are available now in preview, meaning you get early access, free of charge, and can help shape what the full version becomes.

Your computer deserves to run light, fast, and secure, without you having to become its full-time mechanic. With Malwarebytes Tools, we’re making that possible.

Curious to try it out? Open [Malwarebytes on Windows](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium), test its user-friendliness, and immediately feel the difference it makes to your digital experience.
