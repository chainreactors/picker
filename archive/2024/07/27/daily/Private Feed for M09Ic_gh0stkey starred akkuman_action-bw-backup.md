# Bitwarden Backup To WebDAV

## Importance

If you use jianguoyun, your WEBDAV\_ENDPOINT should be setted to '<https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav>' instead of '<https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav/>'

The main reason is because opendal will add '/' in front of root, and the endpoint combination will become '<https://dav.jianguoyun.com/dav//rootpath/>'
