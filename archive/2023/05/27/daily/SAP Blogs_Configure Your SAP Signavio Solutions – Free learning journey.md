Do you think you already know SAP Signavio quite well? Do you want to put the finishing touches to your knowledge? Then the ‘[Configure Your SAP Signavio Solutions](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/configure-your-sap-signavio-solutions?url_id=text-blogs-LSCPLCoE-ConfigSignavio)’ learning journey might be just what you are looking for. This journey is designed for advanced users, takes only one working day to complete, and can be paused any time according to your needs.

While some chapters focus on different workspace and security settings to improve your workspace management, others give you tips on how to customize your BPMN notations and attributes to pimp your diagrams.

For example, do you know how to implement rules to improve the visualization of certain attributes? It is possible to apply a rule, so your prices within a diagram are marked by color depending on their value.

And have you ever tried to upload your own graphics to your diagram element types so that you can use them when modeling?

The learning journey will also help you to understand the true power of SAP Signavio’s Dictionary and teach you how to define your own modeling conventions. This feature allows your colleagues to validate that diagrams follow the rules you specify. Process documentation templates, which can include diagrams, element descriptions, and dictionary entries, as well as the Collaboration Hub are also part of the learning journey and can assist to increase your team’s productivity.

Last but not least, SAP Signavio’s dedicated query language for process analytics, SiGNAL, is one of the focal points. Did you know that it is very similar to SQL and can be used within Process Intelligence to perform many different data queries?
