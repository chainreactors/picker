# AnimeFenix Shuts Down & GogoAnime/Anitaku Freezes in Time

Trouble continues for some of the largest pirate sites specializing in Asian entertainment. Coinciding with the shutdown of Dramacool, GogoAnime and Anitaku stopped uploading new content. This weekend, AnimeFenix added to the trouble with a 'voluntary' shutdown citing more copyright pressure. "Piracy will never go away as long as there are companies with more greed than heart," the AnimeFenix team notes in its farewell message.

Pirates who are into Asian drama and anime were hit hard over the past week.

On Wednesday, [Dramacool announced](https://torrentfreak.com/dramacool-shuts-down-pirate-operation-following-legal-pressure-241128/) that it would shut down its Asianc, Watchasia, Dramanice and Runasian websites, facing pressure from copyright holders.

These sites catered to millions of users, as is exemplified by the shutdown message on X, which has been viewed more than [five million times already](https://x.com/dramacoolcom/status/1861628424147869919). While alternatives still exist, pressure is mounting.

Yesterday, the Spanish-language anime streaming portal AnimeFenix announced that it will also close its doors indefinitely. According to the team, the domain will be terminated following pressure from copyright holders. While exact details are lacking, the operators point a finger at Sony.

“Sony now owns more than 60% of the anime industry with the purchase of Funimation and now also Kadokawa. The call is for you as consumers to be aware of the monopolies that the big companies are creating and through local regulations in your countries,” AnimeFenix writes.

The pirate site is concerned that, by monopolizing the anime industry, legal content will become increasingly expensive. The creators themselves are not necessarily bearing the fruits of this. AnimeFenix’s role is finished, but the operators caution that piracy will prevail as long as the anime industry puts profits before its key assets; the creators and fans.

“Piracy will never go away as long as there are companies with more greed than heart,” the site’s operators warn.

With over 12 million monthly visits, AnimeFenix will certainly be missed by many. However, there are even darker clouds forming on the horizon as another anime juggernaut appears to be in trouble. Over the past few days, GogoAnime, also known as Anitaku, has stopped adding new content.

Together, GogoAnime and Anitaku have well over a hundred million monthly visits, making it one of the largest piracy portals to ever exist. While both sites are still accessible today, fresh content is no longer being added.

So far, the site’s operators remain silent. The sites have been linked to Dramacool, which means that it may face similar copyright pressure. However, even the main moderators of the Discord channel, who are typically in the know, haven’t heard from the site’s operators in days.

“No words from operators,” Discord moderator Undo wrote yesterday, dismissing rumors that the operators have formally thrown in the towel.

*No Word*

On the surface, GogoAnime’s downtime is reminiscent of the FMovies troubles that started earlier this year. At the time, FMovies simply [stopped updating](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-streaming-giant-fmovies-hasnt-updated-in-a-week-240702/) as well and, after a few weeks, the site shut down completely, together with many other piracy portals. We later learned that the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment helped Vietnamese authorities to [topple the ‘piracy ring’](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-piracy-ring-was-shut-down-by-vietnam-assisted-by-ace-240829/).

Regardless of the reasons for GogoAnime’s troubles, they are being felt at many other anime streaming sites that use it as a primary content source. All sites that scrape or mirror GogoAnime face the same dry spell today.

## Seeking Alternatives

Rightsholders hope that these enforcement actions will drive people to legal alternatives. While these may get a boost, many former Dramacool, AnimeFenix, and GogoAnime users will simply look for new pirate homes.

As a result, sites that remain online have seen an influx of new traffic over the past few days. This will undoubtedly increase the legal pressure on these alternatives, starting the cycle all over again. After all, an ‘invincible’ pirate site has yet to be invented.

On that topic, it’s interesting to note that the relatively unknown file-sharing software [Tribler](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/tribler/) reportedly saw an influx of Asian content last week. This includes many Korean drama series.

Tribler is a [BitTorrent client](https://www.tribler.org/) that’s been around for nearly two decades, developed by a research group at Delft University of Technology. The software uses decentralized search, removing the need for torrent sites, and has implemented ‘anonymity‘ by adding an onion routing layer to file transfers.

This technical setup makes the file-sharing network resilient to external pressure. While we can’t draw any direct connections, the fact that Tribler’s userbase more than doubled this week suggests that the recent Asian troubles drove some people to the software.

TorrentFreak spoke to Dr. Johan Pouwelse, leader of the university’s Tribler Lab, who confirmed that interest in the project surged over the past few days.

“Our network is running red-hot, but thankfully it is fully operational,” Pouwelse says. “We’re completely in the dark why we’re suddenly a hit as we are blind to the anonymous downloads on the network.”

Pouwelse notes that Tribler also witnessed a massive boost in users twelve years ago when Megaupload was pulled offline. At the time, Fox News touted [Tribler as ‘invincible’](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/forget-megaupload-researchers-call-new-file-sharing-network-invincible) and the software has survived the rise and fall of many pirate sites since.

Whether any of these alternatives will ‘stick’ has yet to be seen, but the recent shutdowns and disruptions show that anti-piracy tensions remain elevated.

**Update:** Animefenix now redirects to ACE’s Watch Legally page.
