School is back in session!¬†Perfect timing to hit the books and catch up on the latest digital rights news. We've got you covered with bite-sized updates in this issue of our [EFFector newsletter](https://eff.org/effector/37/11).

This time, we're breaking down why [Wyoming‚Äôs new age verification law](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/book-bans-internet-bans-wyoming-lets-parents-control-whole-states-access-internet) is a free speech disaster. You‚Äôll also read about a big win for [transparency around police surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/fourth-amendment-victory-michigan-supreme-court-reins-digital-device-fishing-1), how the Trump administration‚Äôs [war on ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/president-trumps-war-woke-ai-civil-liberties-nightmare) threatens civil liberties, and a welcome decision in a [landmark human rights case](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/torture-victims-landmark-hacking-lawsuit-against-spyware-maker-can-proceed-judge).

Prefer to listen? Be sure to check out the audio companion to EFFector! We're interviewing EFF staff about some of the important issues they are working on. This time, EFF Legislative Activist Rindala¬†Alajaji discusses the real harms of age verification laws like the one passed in Wyoming. Tune in on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YjvEdKxFLc) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.11).
