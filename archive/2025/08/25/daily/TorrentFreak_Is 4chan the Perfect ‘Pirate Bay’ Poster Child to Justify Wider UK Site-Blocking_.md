# Is 4chan the Perfect ‘Pirate Bay’ Poster Child to Justify Wider UK Site-Blocking?

In light of increasing pressure on free speech in the UK, new site blocking powers under the Online Safety Act are a cause for concern. The UK may need a Pirate Bay-style poster boy to justify blocking of non-pirate sites, just as the Pirate Bay was used to justify pirate site blocking 15 years ago. After being threatened by Ofcom, the infamous 4chan appeared to swallow the bait this week. A question: who has who on the hook?

The UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) claims to protect children but has faced fierce criticism for censoring everything from legitimate news reporting from war zones, to critical discussion of the Act itself.

There are many problems, not least a requirement for adults in the UK to prove their identity when accessing sites meeting criteria dictated by Ofcom. Large sites, many in the United States, face huge fines for allowing children to access age-inappropriate content.

This means that unverified adults are treated as children with the same content restrictions. Ofcom’s global threats have led some sites to conclude that the safest option is to ban UK visitors altogether.

## Degraded Internet Experience? Hand Over Your Papers

Successive UK governments understood there were risks, or rather, they were informed of the risks and went ahead regardless. Whether the internet is any safer is almost impossible to measure; the same can’t be said for the hours wasted or lost, and the corresponding increases in blood pressure, all thanks to artificial restrictions that punish those who value their privacy.

Guided by the mantra, “a problem shared is a problem halved” those who air their OSA grievances in public find themselves presented with a 50/50 ultimatum. According to Peter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, those with an opinion on the legislation fall into two categories:

1) People who want to protect kids and 2) People who side with online predators.

## You’re Either With Us, or Against Us

The imposition of a binary choice is a well-worn political tactic. It aims to shut down dissent and/or discredit the speaker; in this case ordinary members of the public branded ‘predator enablers’ by a government minister.

VPN users warranted direct advice; no allegations this time but a suggestion that, just like the unverified, VPN users aren’t helping to keep children safe.

*Just verify your age (impossible without verifying your identity)*

In the event that the above fails to silence the troublemakers, the UK government has recently been discovered filing requests with overseas companies to delete posts made by UK citizens’ criticizing certain aspects of government policy. A United States Department of State [report](https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/united-kingdom), criticizing the UK government for degrading the right to freedom of expression, remains stubbornly accessible.

## No Border Too Distant

Of course, attempting to silence the State Department would be a truly historic mistake, especially in the wake of comments made by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley.

Last summer Rowley threatened to “throw the full force of the law at people” for unacceptable social media comments, warning that “whether you’re in this country committing crimes on the streets or committing crimes from further afield online, we will come after you.”

Widely interpreted as a warning to citizens of the United States, and by extension a direct threat to their constitutional rights, U.S. officials intervened. Congressman Keith Self warned that “harassing Americans will do absolutely nothing to resolve Great Britain’s internal issues” and risks damaging the US/UK alliance.

As the United States attempts to introduce home turf pirate site blocking from [three](https://torrentfreak.com/new-bill-aims-to-block-foreign-pirate-sites-in-the-u-s-250129/) [different](https://torrentfreak.com/second-u-s-piracyiblocking-bill-incoming-mpa-google-verizon-meet-to-discuss-250227/) [directions](https://torrentfreak.com/unveiled-new-u-s-anti-piracy-bill-acpa-proposes-alternative-site-blocking-path/), the UK government is already preparing to take site blocking to the next level.

Thanks to provisions in the Online Safety Act, the UK will soon begin drawing on 15 years of pirate site blocking experiences, to block regular sites that fail to meet their ‘obligations’ as laid out [in the legislation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer).

## Site Blocking For The People?

Ofcom’s stated purpose is to serve the public, within duties defined by parliament, independently, using funds provided by the companies in the sectors it regulates. As regulator, Ofcom doesn’t need permission from the public to start blocking sites, although general approval would likely make the process less controversial.

With the whole world watching and various platforms waiting to see if Ofcom’s threats of global enforcement can be ignored, there’s little room for error.

In the current climate any blocking could be perceived as a further restriction of free speech, or even straightforward censorship. The conundrum is how to make site blocking appear less like censorship while satisfying the people that it’s absolutely necessary. It’s a big ask, but not impossible.

## The Pirate Bay: Default Poster Child of Piracy Blocking

In 2012 when the major recording labels obtained their first UK site blocking injunction on copyright grounds, they could’ve picked a no-name MP3 download site and walked away with an easy win. They picked The Pirate Bay instead, and not just because of the site’s profile and unparalleled infamy.

**#1 Perfect Candidate:** After years in the headlines, The Pirate Bay’s belligerent stance was well understood and at this point, helpfully predictable. First, there was never any chance of TPB spontaneously complying with copyright law. Since blocking injunctions came to exist for the purpose of tackling uncooperative entities, no candidate was more perfectly matched than the most uncooperative pirate site in the world.

**#2 No Appearance? No Win:** The odds of TPB’s operators making an appearance at the High Court in London were always vanishingly slim, but not just for the reasons one might expect. The site’s alleged operators were never served in the blocking case, and they never appeared at the hearing. In fact, the site wasn’t represented in any way, at any stage.

**#3 If Done Right, No Defense:** After it was determined that the law didn’t require TPB’s operators to be na...
