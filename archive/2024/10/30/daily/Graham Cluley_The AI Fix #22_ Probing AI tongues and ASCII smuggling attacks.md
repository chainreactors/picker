In episode 22 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, our hosts encounter a bowl of buttermilk king crab ice cream prepared by a baby hippo, a TV station finds an even better way to generate programme ideas than using a tank full of manatees, and Elon Musk does the world‚Äôs most expensive Blade Runner cosplay.

Graham discovers a robot tongue and ponders the implications of AIs with an appetite, and Mark explains ASCII smuggling ‚Äî a prompt injection attack that uses completely invisible characters.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
