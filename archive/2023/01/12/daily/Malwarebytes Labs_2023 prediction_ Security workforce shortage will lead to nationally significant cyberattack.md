# 2023 prediction: Security workforce shortage will lead to nationally significant cyberattack

Posted: January 11, 2023
 by [Marcin Kleczynski](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mkleczynski)

If 2022 was any indication, businesses are about to face an unprecedented volume, frequency, and sophistication of cyberthreats in 2023. Global cyberattacks have increased by 483 percent over the last two years, and at the current rate of growth, damage from such attacks will amount to [$10.5 trillion in 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/cybersecurity/new-survey-reveals-2-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity-for-cybersecurity-technology-and-service-providers).

Against that backdrop, and despite increased spending on cybersecurity, the skills gap has widened to a canyon. According to the [(IC)² 2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study](https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study), the global security workforce gap increased by 26 percent, with 3.4 million additional workers needed to effectively secure businesses. It’s this discrepancy that I believe will lead to a nationally significant cyberattack on a major US organization this year.

As an industry, we need to preemptively address these risks, both by immediately hiring and onboarding new cyber talent and introducing new tools and resources to help simplify operations for SMBs and other thinly-stretched teams.

## How to find (and keep) diverse security staff—and when to turn to MSPs

Business leaders are doing a lot of hand-wringing these days. Fears of recession, geopolitical instability, and rising tides of cybercrime compete for attention and have already impacted budget decisions for 2023. But with the average cost of a US [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) at $9.44 million—more than twice the global average—many executives are putting their eggs in the cybersecurity basket. A [recent Gartner survey of CIOs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cybersecurity-tops-the-cio-agenda-as-threats-continue-to-escalate-11666034102) revealed that two-thirds plan to increase cyber spending this year.

And yet—will that be enough? Cybercriminals don’t retreat in the face of economic trouble. If anything, they up the ante to meet their financial goals, as has been witnessed firsthand with record cyberattack volume since the start of the pandemic. Cybercrime surged to meteoric heights in 2020 and 2021, and 2022 continued the upward trend with [an additional 28 percent increase](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2022/10/26/third-quarter-of-2022-reveals-increase-in-cyberattacks/) in global attacks. These numbers hardly do the crimes justice, as they don’t include the effect on employee productivity and morale, lost profits and investments, and irrevocable damage to company reputation.

While organizations have made major investments in cybersecurity recently, hiring additional staff members to manage complex systems, processes, and people does not appear to be a priority. In 2022, the security employment gap expanded by [40 percent to 700,000 unfilled positions](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/19/tech/biden-cyber-workforce-gap/index.html) in the US alone. “The cybersecurity talent shortage is one of the most significant and threatening challenges facing our industry today,” said Barbara Massa, executive vice president at Mandiant, in an article for CNN.

Indeed, an estimated 70 percent of respondents to the [(IC)² 2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study](http...
