# Open Sources Show Myanmar Junta Airstrike Damages Despite Post-Earthquake Ceasefire

Bellingcat has identified at least 22 villages damaged by airstrikes in Myanmar, despite [a temporary ceasefire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ydkvxdvno) declared by the State Administrative Control (SAC) or the military junta from April 2 to 22 following a [7.7 magnitude earthquake](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/eq-2025-000043-mmr) that hit the country on March 28. The ceasefire has been [extended](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-junta-extends-temporary-ceasefire-april-30-support-earthquake-relief-2025-04-22/) to April 30.

The [earthquake’s epicentre was recorded](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/region-info) just 16km northwest of Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, and it struck just before 1pm local time. [More than 3,000 people died](https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-ceasefire-military-resistance-earthquake-disaster-05329d5a2448d0afd9d7c09e55a1c759) and aid groups report that over 17 million people living in earthquake-affected areas are in urgent need of food, water, shelter and healthcare.

The country, which has already been devastated by four years of civil war, continues to be hit with multiple aftershocks. The SAC, ruling Myanmar since seizing power from the democratically elected government in 2021, declared a temporary pause to fighting only after the main opposition coalition announced one – except in the case of defensive actions.

Bellingcat has geolocated at least 19 villages damaged in military assaults during the first 20 days of the ceasefire. Two of them were identified from ground reporting. Three additional villages were damaged after the earthquake but before the ceasefire – bringing the total to 22 villages.

The airstrikes targeted civilian areas in territory held by rebel forces and territory where the junta is fighting to regain control. The villages damaged after the ceasefire were geolocated by cross-referencing our findings with NASA FIRMS or satellite imagery alongside local and other media sources.

“It’s quite clear that only the military can do airstrikes. The rebels don’t have aircrafts,” Aye Chan Naing, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), one of Myanmar’s largest independent media organisations, told Bellingcat.

Lacking jets or fighter planes, resistance groups heavily [rely on commercial drones](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/01/20/myanmars-rebels-get-resourceful-with-improvised-drones/) “improvised into sort of military use,” Naing said.

Targeting and scaring civilians is part of the military’s strategy, he explained. “If you support the rebels, then you know we [the military] are going to burn the village.”

“At a moment when the sole focus should be on ensuring humanitarian aid gets to disaster zones, the military is instead launching attacks,” [said UN Human Rights Office spokesperson](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162166) Ravina Shamdasani on April 11.

“Since the earthquake, military forces have reportedly carried out over 120 attacks – more than half of them after their declared ceasefire was due to have gone into effect on 2 April,” she told journalists.

According to [local media reports](https://www.facebook.com/theirrawaddy/posts/junta-airstrikes-target-tnla-territorymarch-29-2025myanmars-regime-has-continued/1091365443018612/), the Myanmar military carried out an aerial attack just hours after the earthquake struck. Anti-junta armed group TNLA claimed that the military bombed [Nawng Len village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qS9jZiWpZ4LsFTPx9), approximately 120km from the earthquake’s epicentre in the eastern Shan State. Seven members of a TNLA-aligned ethnic armed organisation (EAO) were reportedly killed in the attack.

We were not able to independently confirm the airstrike, but we were able to geolocate images of several damaged buildings, to a location in the north of the village. The intact buildings can be seen on Google Earth imagery in late January.

The military junta did not respond to Bellingcat’s request for comment.

## Attacks in Worst-Affected Earthquake Areas

Out of the 22 villages we identified, 14 of them are in either [Sagaing or Mandalay](https://mmpeacemonitor.org/en/infographic/95-towns-captured-and-controlled-by-revolutionary-forces-2/), which were some of the worst affected areas by the earthquake. Large parts of both regions are located in central Myanmar, where a lot of townships are either contested or under junta control.

The military tries to cut the rebels’ survival pipeline, Naing told Bellingcat.

“They understand that the rebels [cannot survive without civilians](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/asia/myanmar-war-rebels.html) because that’s where they get food and maybe tax money,” he said.

Since the rebels don’t have permanent bases, members are difficult to locate. While drones might strike and kill a few individuals, it’s much easier for the army to identify and target areas where civilians live, Naing added.

On April 9, twenty people were [reportedly](https://burmese.dvb.no/post/699987) killed in an airstrike in Nan Khan in Sagaing’s Wuntho Township. We were able to geolocate images of damaged buildings to the coordinates [23.9983922,95.8881422](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xMVAsVw1uWf7ZnUS8).

Just days before this attack, on April 6, [Thone Pan Hla](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z39DjCr737phHPYK9) in Chaung-U Township was reportedly attacked in an airstrike, killing three members of a family. “The motivation for such an attack on a village of melon farmers is difficult to understand. It seems to be an effort to terrorise a civilian population that strongly supports the anti-regime National Unity Government (NUG) and its armed rebel PDF wing,” [reported](https://www.thetimes.com/world/asia/article/the-carnage-that-proves-myanmars-junta-is-still-bombing-civilians-rqzh6sjdq) The Times n...
