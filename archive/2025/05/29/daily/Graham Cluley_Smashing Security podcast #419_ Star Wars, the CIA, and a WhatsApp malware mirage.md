Why is a cute Star Wars fan website now redirecting to the CIA? How come Cambodia has become the world‚Äôs hotspot for scam call centres? And can a WhatsApp image really drain your bank account with a single download, or is it just a load of hacker hokum?

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Allan Liska.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
