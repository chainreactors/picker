Canadian lawmakers are considering a bill, [S-210](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/S-210/third-reading), that’s meant to benefit children, but would sacrifice the security, privacy, and free speech of all internet users.

First introduced in 2023, S-210 seeks to prevent young people from encountering sexually explicit material by requiring *all* commercial internet services that “make available” explicit content to adopt age verification services. Typically, these services will require people to show government-issued ID to get on the internet. According to bill authors, this is needed to prevent harms like the “development of pornography addiction” and “the reinforcement of gender stereotypes and the development of attitudes favorable to harassment and violence…particularly against women.”

The motivation is laudable, but requiring people of all ages to show ID to get online [won’t help](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online) women or young people. If S-210 isn't stopped before it reaches the third reading and final vote in the House of Commons, Canadians will be forced to a repressive and unworkable age verification regulation.

### **Flawed Definitions Would Encompass Nearly the Entire Internet**

The bill’s scope is vast. S-210 creates legal risk not just for those who sell or intentionally distribute sexually explicit materials, but also for those who just transmit it–knowingly or not.
