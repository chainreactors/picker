## Palo Alto Networks is the only vendor recognized as a Leader in Single-Vendor SASE, SSE and SD-WAN Magic Quadrants.

For the fifth consecutive year, Palo Alto Networks was recognized as a Leader in the [2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SD-WAN](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sd-wan-mq-2024.html). Palo Alto Networks is furthest in the Completeness of Vision, which we believe is a testament to our Prisma SD-WAN solution’s ability to deliver a Zero Trust Branch that is secure, connected and resilient. Palo Alto Networks also has been recently recognized as a Leader in the [Single-Vendor SASE](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sase-mq-2024.html) and [Security Service Edge (SSE)](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sse-mq-leader-2024.html) 2024 Magic Quadrant reports, making us the only vendor named a Leader in all three SASE-related reports.

## Power Your Zero Trust Branch with Prisma SASE

With the rapid adoption of SaaS applications, the explosion of devices like IoT, and the rise in branch digitization, the branch has evolved. Organizations require secure and reliable connectivity for all users, applications and devices in their branches. Only a unified [SASE solution](/cyberpedia/what-is-sase) can meet and exceed their needs by combining SD-WAN and security. Gartner states that “by 2027, 65% of new software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) purchases will be part of a single-vendor SASE offering, an increase from 20% in 2024,” in the [2024 Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sase-mq-2024.html) report.

At Palo Alto Networks, we help customers build a Zero Trust Branch with [Prisma SASE](/sase) that unifies [Prisma SD-WAN](/sase/sd-wan) with [Prisma Access](/sase/access) – a massively distributed [SSE](/cyberpedia/what-is-security-service-edge-sse) – delivered from the cloud to achieve key business outcomes:

* **Exceptional User Experience for all Applications** – Providing end-to-end application assurance for all applications, including SaaS, which are distributed and dynamic in content. Prisma SD-WAN’s application awareness accurately identifies apps up to layer 7 to provide direct-to-app access, intelligent traffic engineering, and prioritization based on application SLAs for all applications, like SaaS, Cloud, internet and data center apps. Prisma SD-WAN ensures last-mile resiliency by connecting and extending this app-defined intelligence to low-latency, closest proximity Prisma Access nodes. This, combined with a hyperscale backbone at the middle mile and application acceleration at the first mile provided by Prisma Access, further improves and accelerates today's dynamic and distributed applications.
* **Integrated Security to Protect all Users, Apps and Devices, Including IoT** – Enforcing least-privileged access and continuous trust verification to minimize risks. Additionally, it uniquely discovers and protects all IoT devices by providing complete IoT visibility and security with accurate device and firmware identification.
* **Operational Simplicity and Resilience** – Delivering comprehensive visibility of the entire network, security and application performance with Strata Cloud Manager. Prisma SD-WAN provides segment-wise insights and trend analysis with [Autonomous Digital Experience Management](/sase/adem) (ADEM), complete with SD-WAN analytics and Strata copilot for SD-WAN that enable natural language processing to improve mean time to resolution significantly.

For example, Westfield, one of the leading global retailers, has [migrated to Prisma SASE](/customers/westfield-responds-rapidly-to-a-changing-market-with-prisma-sase) to secure and connect its 40 million global customers while delivering a great user experience. Ken Ogami, senior vice president and CIO at Westfield, said:

> Prisma SASE provided reliable and flexible networking services, and a robust cloud-based security model, which gave us the ability to secure users and devices with Zero Trust.

With branch offices facing fundamental shifts, Prisma SD-WAN’s ability to deliver innovations in application assurance, IoT visibility and AI capabilities, such as Strata Copilot for SD-WAN, is essential to power the Zero Trust Branch today.
