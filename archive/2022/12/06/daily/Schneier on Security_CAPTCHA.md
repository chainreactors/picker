## CAPTCHA

This is an actual CAPTCHA I was shown when trying to log into PayPal.

![](https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bc5c9f8f-6e44-4dfc-b1a9-0bc888c1218f.jpg)

As an actual human and not a bot, I had no idea how to answer. Is this a joke? (Seems not.) Is it a Magritte-like existential question? (It’s not a bicycle. It’s a drawing of a bicycle. Actually, it’s a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle. No, it’s really a computer image of a photograph of a drawing of a bicycle.) Am I overthinking this? (Definitely.) I stared at the screen, paralyzed, for way too long.

It’s probably the best CAPTCHA I have ever encountered; a computer would have just answered.

(In the end, I treated the drawing as a real bicycle and selected the appropriate squares…and it seemed to like that.)

It’s a photo of the painting of a stencil of the drawing of a bicycle icon. No bicycles were harmed in the making of this image.

Personally, it’s always a relief when Captcha affirms that I am not a robot.

> Is it a Magritte-like existential question?

I think this captcha does indeed summarizes the Human Condition in a single CAPTCHA. In that sense, it is the best CAPTCHA I have ever seen.

And indeed, only a human would answer Yes.

I was once showing one that asked “Identify the cats”.

Among the normal house cats was a Bengal tiger, which I duly identified as a cat.

The System told me that the tiger was not a cat.

Captchas are like clicker training for cats or dogs.

Has anyone tried to figure out how the CAPTCHA’s work in the background? Is there a ‘correct’ answer or are they training a model as more people answer?

Could be either a turing test, or they time your response to get an idea how you think

It is indeed and entertaining question.

But it does surprise me that as a Director of EFF, an organisation championing free expression, you still have an account with PayPal given that they have declared their intention to police speech which they (whoever “they” are) do not agree with and simply take your money as punishment if you voice or support the “wrong” opinions.

This brings back to mind a novel alternative CAPTCHA system:

Optical illusions may be employed to distinguish between humans and non-human agents. Non-human agents are unlikely to suffer the same visual illusions as we do.

I’ve had similar indecision when asked to select all squares containing a ship. One square, as I recall, had one speedboat and part of another. Another had a sailboat. A third had a ferry, which in practice means (IIRC) a motor vessel. I stared at that pic a minute or so before hitting Skip. Apparently that was the wrong answer.

What would you answer to this CAPTCHA “Type the two words”:

1. Is clearly a word – but very hard to make out.
2. 4 fields of a chess board showing the queen and 3 pawns.

Clearly, CAPTCHA generators have long outsmarted us and the generator
is infact *testing us* (for nefarious purposes?).

In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised that our (human) answers are indeed used to help train a machine(!) trying to “understand” images.

Maybe they (re-Captcha) are using this where the algorithm/training material isn’t sufficient to recognize particular patterns?

After all, re-captcha is widely used… and Google… knows how to “crowd source”… what should they let this (the time we spend on solving CAPTCHAs) go to waste?

@securitymonk

I’m convinced that the CAPTCHAs with the grainy pictures of schoolbuses, fire hydrants and steps aren’t really for distinguishing humans from bots; they’re for training image-recognition models with ML. Which is ironic; because if you’re a bot trying to get past a CAPTCHA, a better image-recognition system is exactly what you want.

Honestly the system can barely tell what anything is. I’ve made myself a fun game of constantly messing with it. I have about a 60% success rate clicking all kinds of wonky poor bounds or completely mislabelling it. The only one that seems to really be testing you is the “click all of the X” where there’s always 3 of them. These image segmentation tasks tend to just accept whatever you say.

Precisely none of the squares have bicycles (plural) in them.

Clicking on squares that have pictures of parts of a whole bicycle does not meet the definition required in the question.

But it’s another of those times where I have to stop and consider how most other people think to give the most popular answer, which isn’t the logically consistent one.

What is 2+2?

1) 4
2) 22
3) IIII
4) 11 (base 3)
5) A mathematical equation.
6) A set of symbols given meaning by context.
7) A type of seating arrangement in a sporty car.
8) Four
9) τέσσερα
10) Two plus two
11) Due più due
12) A four character string, or a three character string if the question mark is not included.

Click on all the wrong...
