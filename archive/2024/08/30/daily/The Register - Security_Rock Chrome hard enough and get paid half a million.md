Google's Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP) is now significantly more rewarding – with a top payout that's at least twice as substantial.

Citing the challenge of finding consequential, exploitable bugs in its Chrome browser after 16 years in release, Amy Ressler, information security engineer at the Chocolate Factory, explained it was time to rethink Chrome VRP rewards to incentivize higher quality bug reporting and deeper research into Chrome vulnerabilities.

Google's approach, [according to](https://bughunters.google.com/blog/5302044291629056/chrome-vrp-reward-updates-to-incentivize-deeper-research) Ressler, reflects a move away from a list of specific rewards that has separated memory corruption issues from other classes of vulnerabilities. For the past few years, memory safety has become [an industry and government priority](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/03/darpa_c_to_rust/) because the majority of meaningful bugs in large C++ codebases like Chrome are down to flaws like use-after-free and buffer overflows.
