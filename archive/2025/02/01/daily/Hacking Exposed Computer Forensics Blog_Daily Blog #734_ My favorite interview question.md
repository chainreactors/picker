**Hello Reader,**

I’ve read countless articles and attended many trainings about interview questions: what to ask, what not to ask, how to be clever, how to avoid bias, and how to make sure you’re assessing candidates thoroughly. But what I rarely see discussed is this: **how do you truly get to know a candidate when you don’t even know who they are?**

I’ve been interviewing and hiring people for over 25 years, and one thing I’ve learned is that the most important aspect of a candidate is what makes them *special.* This might be their hobbies, accomplishments, recoveries from setbacks, volunteer work, side projects, or unrelated jobs. The challenge, of course, is that you don’t know these things beforehand—so you don’t know which questions will bring them to light.

That’s where my favorite interview question comes in. If you’ve ever interviewed with me in the last seven years, you’ve likely heard me ask:

> **“What is the thing you are most proud of that I would never know to ask you about?”**

That’s it. It seems simple, but it’s incredibly powerful. As soon as I ask it, I see a different person emerge—eyes light up, smiles appear, and the energy in the room shifts. The candidate is suddenly sharing something they’re deeply passionate about, and I get to learn something unexpected that I never would have guessed.

Because of this single question, I’ve learned about candidates who:

* Started charities or volunteer organizations
* Recovered from life-altering injuries with sheer determination
* Launched businesses or open-source projects
* Organized DJ events or found creative ways to bring people together
* Crypto currency entrepreneurs
* Provided extensive care for parents or siblings
* …and so much more

These stories give me a glimpse into who they really are, beyond the resume bullet points, GPAs, and certifications. I see the personal drive that shapes them—an indicator of whether they’ll be hungry for success and eager to learn everything we have to teach.

So, do yourself a favor. The next time you sit down to interview someone, step away from the standard list of questions and ask this one. You’ll open a window into who they are, and gain insights you’d never uncover otherwise. You’ll see the person behind the application—*and that* is the "one simple trick".
