## Some worry multiple languages will make it harder to maintain this open source uber-project, others disagree

Updated Developers trying to add Rust code to the Linux kernel continue to face opposition from kernel maintainers who believe using multiple languages is an unwelcome and risky complication.

Concerns surfaced last September when Microsoft software engineer Wedson Almeida Filho [stepped away](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/02/rust_for_linux_maintainer_steps_down/) from the [Rust for Linux project](https://rust-for-linux.com/), citing frustration with "nontechnical nonsense" – which is one way to describe the difficulty of collaborating with those who have different goals.

> Don't force me to deal with your shiny language of the day. Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain

The issue flared again last month, when a [proposed abstraction](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20250108122825.136021-1-abdiel.janulgue%40gmail.com/) to allow Rust-written device drivers to call the primarily C-based kernel's core [DMA API](https://docs.kernel.org/core-api/dma-api-howto.html) met resistance from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig.
