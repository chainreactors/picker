### [Ghanaian fraudsters arrested for BEC/Sakawa](https://garwarner.blogspot.com/2025/08/ghanaian-fraudsters-arrested-for.html)

In Nigeria, scammers who specialize in Romance Scams and BEC are called "Yahoo Boys."  In Ghana, the term for the same activity is "Sakawa."  Several Ghanaian headlines are talking about this case with headlines such as "Multimillion dollar Sakawa" or "Sakawa Chairman Busted" or "Sakawa Kingpin Bows to Extradition!"

On 08AUG2025 the US Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York announced the extradition of four Ghanaian scammers who stole more than $100 Million via Romance Scams and Business Email Compromise.

The names likely are not well known in the US, but the first two are creating a stir in some parts of Ghana: Isaac Boateng, Inusah Ahmed, Derrick Van Yeboah, and Patrick Kwame Asare.

Inusah Ahmed, also known as Pascal, and "Agony" is the owner of the PAC Academy Football Club in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Ghana Soccer quotes one source as saying "Pascal was not just the owner; he was the heart and soul of PAC Academy.  This is a huge blow!"

Shatta, whose real name is Charles Nii Armah, was featured on the Beyonce track "Already" on her 2019 Lion King album.  Last week he had his 2019 Lamborghini Urus seized by the government of Ghana, after the FBI informed them it was purchased with stolen funds.

### Ghana and the City of Lexington BEC

The source of those Lambo funds was Nana Kwabena Amuah, another Ghanian, who performed a $3.9 Million Business Email Compromise against the city of Lexington, Kentucky. When Amuah was arrested in 2023, he posted bail and four days later was arrested attempting to flee to Canada on an Amtrak train.

In an unusual court document, 58 victims of Amuah's BEC crimes are listed with complete street address and the amount of money stolen.  Victims are identified in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  Collectively they were tricked into sending $4,743,443 to Amuah and his co-conspirator, Shimea Maret McDonald.  McDonald had opened a shell company, Gretson Company LLC, and had bank accounts at many major banks in that name that were used to receive the funds.

There were others arrested in this ring, including Samuel Kwadwo Osei, who was recruited into "Sakawa" by a Nigerian computer programmer, Sapphire Egemasi, who the Nigerian media calls a "Tech Queen." Nigerian blogger Linda Ikeji (who I've followed for many years) shared this photo of Sapphire:

Samuel Kwadwo Osei ("Tuga"), Derick Nii Ashitey, Chinemezu Sapphire Egemasi, and Fred Brobbey Awuah were all charged in the same ring as McDonald and Amuah.

Osei laundered funds through his BofA account in the name "Lasko Company LLC."
