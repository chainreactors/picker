# Sandfly Performance White Paper

09 June 2024

White Paper

Sandfly is known for our wide compatibility and high performance when protecting Linux. Customers often ask us what we do to make sure their critical systems are not impacted with our agentless approach. In this white paper, we go into detail about the measures we take to protect against system impacts, including the following:

* How we limit CPU, memory, disk, and network I/O use.
* Fail-safes we employ to prevent impacting system performance.
* Benchmarks on low-spec systems showing real-world impacts.

Learn the above and more in our performance white paper available from our resources section below.
