California’s Governor should sign [S.B. 7](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB7), a common-sense bill to end some of the harshest consequences of [automated abuse](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/fighting-automated-oppression-2024-review-0) at work.

They’re using algorithms to predict when employees are [organizing a union](https://prospect.org/labor/2025-03-13-amazon-uses-arsenal-of-ai-weapons-against-workers/) or [planning to quit](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/10/this-algorithm-can-predict-when-workers-are-about-to-quitheres-how.html). They’re automating choices about [who gets fired](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/dangers-ai-hiring-firing-employees-focus-book/story?id=108890705). And these employment algorithms often [discriminate](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/three-ways-ai-can-discriminate-hiring-and-three-ways-forward) based on gender, race, and other protected statuses.
