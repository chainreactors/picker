6:00 AM PST · December 24, 2024

Since 2018, along with colleagues first at VICE Motherboard, and [now at TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/22/techcrunch-security-desk-jealousy-list/), I have been publishing a list at the end of the year highlighting the best cybersecurity stories reported by other outlets. Cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy are huge topics that no one single publication can cover effectively on its own. Journalism is by definition competitive, but also a highly collaborative field. That’s why it sometimes makes sense to point our readers to other publications and their work to learn more about these complicated and sprawling beats.

Without further ado, here are our favorite cybersecurity stories of this year written by our friends at rival outlets. *— Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.*

## [AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete a stolen cache of “nearly all” of the company’s phone records](https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/)

In one of the biggest and most brazen mass-hacks in recent history, hackers this year raided hundreds of insecure cloud storage accounts hosted by cloud computing company Snowflake, relied on by some of the world’s largest tech and telecom companies. The hackers then held the huge troves of stolen data for ransom. One victim of the hacks, AT&T, confirmed that it [lost the call and text records of “nearly all”](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/) of AT&T’s 110 million customers in the breach, accounting for more than 50 billion call and text records.

Days after AT&T went public with news of its breach, independent security reporter [Kim Zetter](https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/) broke the news that [AT&T had weeks earlier paid a hacker $370,000 to delete the huge cache of stolen phone records](https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/) and not publicly release the data. Zetter’s reporting uncovered a major piece in the puzzle of who was behind the intrusions — at the time known only as UNC5537 by Mandiant — and who were [later identified as Connor Moucka and John Binns and indicted for their role](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/snowflake-hackers-identified-and-charged-with-stealing-50-billion-att-records/) in the mass-thefts from Snowflake’s customer accounts. *— Zack Whittaker.*

## [Automakers were caught sharing consumers’ driving habits with price-hiking insurance companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html)

Kashmir Hill’s latest investigative report in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html) revealed that automakers are sharing consumers’ driving behavior and habits with data brokers and insurance companies, which use the data to hike customer rates and premiums, a dystopian use of a driver’s own information against them. For GM vehicle owners, drivers are [often not informed](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html) that enrolling in its Smart Driver feature would automatically result in vehicles sharing their driving habits with third-parties. The story [prompted a congressional inquiry](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/technology/driver-data-sold-for-pennies.html), which revealed that the carmakers sold consumers’ data in some cases for mere pennies. *— Zack Whittaker.*

## [The CIA sent an officer deep undercover to spy on Islamic radicals. The operation cost him everything.](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/cia-agent-deep-undercover-spy-islamic-radicals-war-on-terror-1235075156/)

This is just a wild story. If this story was a movie — heck, it should be — it would still be shocking. But the fact that this actually happened is just incredible. Zach Dorfman pulled off an incredible feat of reporting here. Writing about intelligence operations is not easy; by definition, these are supposed to stay secret forever. And this is not one of those stories that the intelligence community would secretly be happy to see out there. There’s nothing to be proud or happy of here. I don’t want to spoil this story in any way, you just have to read it. It’s that good. *— Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.*

## [Crypto’s legacy is finally clear, per Charlie Warzel](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/12/cryptos-legacy-finally-clear/680956/)

This is not purely a cybersecurity story, but in some ways crypto has always been part of hacking culture. Born as a libertarian pipe dream, [it’s been clear for a few years](https://theoutline.com/post/2592/bitcoin-is-none-of-the-things-it-was-supposed-to-be) that Bitcoin and all its crypto offshoots have nothing to do with what Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious inventor of the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, imagined back in 2008 in his founding paper on Bitcoin. Now, crypto has become a tool for the far-right to wield their power, as Charlie Warzel explains very well in this piece. *— Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai.*

## [Hackers scored a record ransom payment of $75 million for Cencora’s data breach](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-18/gang-got-75-million-for-cencora-hack...
