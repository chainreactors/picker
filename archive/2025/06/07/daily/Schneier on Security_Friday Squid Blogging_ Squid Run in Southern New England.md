## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Run in Southern New England

Southern New England is having the [best squid run](https://onthewater.com/best-squid-run-in-years-in-southern-new-england) in years.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Using HDMI EMI for Fast Wireless Data Transfer

by Oona Räisänen February 27, 2023

“This story, too, begins with noise. I was browsing the radio waves with a software radio, looking for mysteries to accompany my ginger tea. I had started to notice a wide-band spiky signal on a number of frequencies that only seemed to appear indoors. Some sort of interference from electronic devices, probably. Spoiler alert, it eventually led me to broadcast a webcam picture over the radio waves… but how?

`[...]`

This was a fun project but this kind of a vulnerability could, in the tinfoiliest of situations, be used for exfiltrating information out of a supposedly airgapped computer.”

Read entire article with pics and video:

Also – this project looks interesting:

<https://github.com/martinmarinov/TempestSDR>

A software toolkit for remotely eavesdropping video monitors using a Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver. It exploits compromising emanations from cables carrying video signals.

@final donut

That would be a “supposedly” airgapped computer, because in the tinfoiliest situation the perp would have the device inside a Faraday cage (or two).

I have the inverse problem, because like Oona Räisänen I browse the shortwave bands, and have a broadband helical antenna on my bike. Down the main street of the village, outside the bank or the police station are no-reception areas from the computing devices there. Other dead spots occur wherever there are outdoor “security” cameras.

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Mass layoffs blaim Tax Code 174 change**

Put simply in the US 100% of R&D costs could be written off in the year they occured untill 2022.

A single line tax change made it 5 or 15 years in the previous Trump administration with a time delay.

All prospective R&D got the “slasher treatment” and only R&D that was essential remained and is still getting trimmed back and with it US Innovation.

Most of the Mega Corps used that tax break to in essence pay no tax as nearly all employees and costs were in “development” or “research”.

It does not matter how much new income even a short term development might bring in, it will get starved of resources and jobs will go.

But an R&D job has other jobs supporting it… They too loose their jobs as the much over hyped “trickle down” effect likewise stops. Then there is the loss of charity and other funding of arts and culture, it all gets starved of donations etc and jobs go…

<https://qz.com/tech-layoffs-tax-code-trump-section-174-microsoft-meta-1851783502>

There are three questions that arise,

1, Can the change be reversed?
2, Will it be reversed?
3, Will the required tax balancing have similar effect?
4, Will the jobs come back any time soon?

The answers are,

1, Yes,
2, Probably not currently,
3, Very definitely,
4, Most likely not.

I think people can see from that, that US Innovation has in effect been given the “teen slasher flick” treatment, and as a result now US society is getting the “zombie plague” effect.

People might want to look into why the change to 174 was made, ie what it really funded… It’s not really mentioned in the article but it’s not hard to look up via the bill name/date and MSM Articles from the time.

@ final donut, ALL,

**The Aether betrays you[1].**

I’ve advised on the blog and other places that “Red Teams” and “Blue Teams” especially buy “Software Defined Radio”(SDR) and appropriate directional antennas and get to “See the EM Spectrum” and what hemorrhages out in the form of information leaking “side channels”. And how to “Direction Find”(DF) or “Fox hunt” the sources[2].

It’s also why I talk of “energy gapping” not the very deficient “air gapping” that has not moved on since the 1960’s outside of certain Gov entities and the military.

I’ve even described how you can build effective RF cages from hardware store components. And even more importantly for some, how you can quickly build covert SCIFs / RF Cages from house hold items such as blankets and very inexpensive clothes drying racks. That can be quickly taken apart and be made to look completely innocent to most guard labour eyes.

Also the use of two computers, the first being energy gapped from and used to do your “Private stuff”.

The second stripped down to boot from immutable memory used as the computer for communications now we are being forced by Gov’s and Corp’s to “be online” for their “cost savings” and such incredibly poor security you have to wonder if it’s deliberate policy to make spying on the citizens easier for the more “lead footed Guard Labour”.

Which is why I described how to build a “garden path” security zone between two routers so you can more easily check for suspicious activity.

I like “Windy Tan” as she shows people how to have curiosity about the EM World and importantly how to chase things down using SDR.

There is much that security people can learn from what she has written and as before I encourage people to go look and think.

[1] The notion of Aether or Ether as a way for energy and forces to exist started back before way before Sir Issac Newton and was seen as the 5th prime physical element. It lasted in one way or another as an idea untill just over a century ago when Einstein effectively killed it off.

However radio engineers still talk about it tongue in cheek when talking about the EM spectrum,

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_theories>

Likewise they also jokingly talk of the firmament as well when talking about radio waves and propagation.

Both make a useful shorth...
