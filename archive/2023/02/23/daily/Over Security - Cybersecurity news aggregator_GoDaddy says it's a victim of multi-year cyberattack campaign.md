# GoDaddy says it’s a victim of multi-year cyberattack campaign

Posted: February 20, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

Hosting and domain name company GoDaddy [says it believes](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001609711/e4736ddb-b4c7-485b-a8fc-1827691692c9.pdf) a “sophisticated threat actor group” has been subjecting the company to a multi-year attack campaign, the most recent of which occurred in December 2022.

In December, it received complaints about customer websites being periodically redirected to malicious sites. It turned out [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) caused the redirection after threat actors compromised GoDaddy’s cPanel shared hosting servers. *How* the attackers got in remains a mystery.

GoDaddy said in [a statement](https://aboutus.godaddy.net/newsroom/company-news/news-details/2023/Statement-on-recent-website-redirect-issues/default.aspx):

> “As our investigation continued, we discovered that an unauthorized third party had gained access to servers in our cPanel shared hosting environment and installed malware causing the intermittent redirection of customer websites. Once we confirmed the intrusion, we remediated the situation and implemented security measures in an effort to prevent future infections.”

The company also said it believes that previous breaches in March 2020 and November 2021 were part of the multi-year attack campaign from the same threat actor group.

In March 2020, an attacker compromised [28,000](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/godaddy-notifies-users-of-breached-hosting-accounts/) hosting account login credentials belonging to customers and some GoDaddy employees. Then, in November 2021, [1.2 million](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/11/millions-of-godaddy-customer-data-compromised-in-breach) Managed WordPress hosting environments were compromised. The stolen data included email addresses, original WordPress admin credentials, database credentials, and private keys.

GoDaddy said it’s working on the ongoing issue:

> “We are working with multiple law enforcement agencies around the world, in addition to forensics experts, to further investigate the issue. As we continue to monitor their behavior and block attempts from this criminal organization, we are actively collecting evidence and information regarding their tactics and techniques to help law enforcement.”

## Make sure your hosting account is secure

If you are using GoDaddy or other hosting services, now is a good time to review your credentials and ensure your account is as locked up as possible. The guideline below is for GoDaddy customers:

* Remotely log out of your account. If you think your hosting account has been compromised, doing this will sign you and the possible attacker out from accounts opened on different devices and browsers.
* Use a password manager, which will help you create long and complicated passwords without having to commit them to memory. [Password managers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) also help you avoid [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) sites by not filling in credential fields if you mistakenly end up on a phishing page you can’t distinguish from the real thing.
* Change your Support PIN. You can find this on your GoDaddy [Login & PIN](https://uk.godaddy.com/help/find-my-support-pin-5804) page.
* Change all your hosting-related email credentials and FTP passwords.
* Use [two-factor authentication]...
