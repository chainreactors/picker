> Guardio Labs has uncovered a critical in-the-wild exploit of Proofpoint’s email protection service, responsible for securing 87 of the Fortune 100 companies. Dubbed “EchoSpoofing”, this issue allowed threat actors to dispatch millions of perfectly spoofed phishing emails, leveraging Proofpoint’s customer base of well-known companies and brands such as Disney, IBM, Nike, Best Buy, and Coca-Cola. These emails echoed from official Proofpoint email relays with authenticated SPF and DKIM signatures, thus bypassing major security protections — all to deceive recipients and steal funds and credit card details.
>
> The following comprehensive report outlines the mechanisms of this ongoing malicious campaign, from its initial detection and the discovery of the exploit to its full replication, notably involving the abuse of Microsoft’s Office365 accounts.
>
> This research underscores our collaboration with Proofpoint, which swiftly took action and implemented measures to mitigate the issue, thereby protecting their customers and the broader public. This effort not only illuminates persistent vulnerabilities within email protocols but also highlights the need for continuous vigilance and cooperation within the cybersecurity community to safeguard digital communications against sophisticated threats.

## The Perfect Spoof of Major Brands

Just a few years ago, spoofing an email's “FROM” header was straightforward; you could write whatever you wanted. Nowadays, security protocols require emails to be sent from approved servers and authenticated with the domain’s private DKIM encryption key — all aligned with the domain mentioned in the FROM header. And yet, threat actors still manage to launch large-scale phishing email campaigns, swiftly taking hold of the identities of major brands like Disney, IBM, and Coca-Cola.

Our team recently uncovered a massive phishing campaign that takes spoofing to the next level. Attackers successfully sent millions of emails that appeared to be from well-known companies and brands, all **properly signed and authenticated**, with the ultimate goal of stealing our credit cards.

Abusing Proofpoint infrastructure with perfectly spoofing emails in their customers’ names

Digging deeper, we realized this is a well-orchestrated campaign that somehow manages to get their phishing emails properly DKIM signed and SPF approved. More notably, all those emails were dispatched from one specific family of email relay servers — `pphosted.com` — owned and operated by the Email security vendor [**Proofpoint**](https://www.proofpoint.com).

## “Now Spoofing on Disney+”

To understand the inner workings of this, we start with analyzing a sample of one of the millions of daily sent emails — a spoofed Disney+ account notification email sent from the real `disney.com` domain:

Clicking on this compelling offer will send you to a classic phishing flow. It presents a fake branded landing page with an offer you can’t refuse disguised as a customer quiz.

Back to the email itself, we see it was sent from the address `admin_support.XXXX@disney.com`, when the **XXXX** is randomly generated per each email in this batch. This is the real `disney.com` domain presented in the FROM header. It even gets the Disney logo next to it. This means that, Amazingly, this email fully complied with authentication and security measures explicitly built to fight this:

* **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**— The Email was dispatched from an approved server as set on the SPF record on the `disney.com` domain
* **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** — The email content was signed with the authentic key owned only by `disney.com`.

Looking at the email headers, where the metadata of the delivery and authentication process is logged, we can clearly see that the receiving service, Gmail, has fully authenticated this email:

```
Authentication-Results: mx.google.com;
       dkim=pass header.i=@disney.com header.s=ppdkim header.b=MVl6clAB;
       spf=pass (google.com: domain of admin_support.dnrj@disney.com designates 205.220.164.148 as permitted sender) smtp.mailfrom=admin_support.dnrj@disney.com;
       dmarc=pass (p=NONE sp=NONE dis=NONE) header.from=disney.com

ppdkim - The DKIM key code generated by Disney to be used with Proofpoint (pp)
205.220.164.148 - The Disney dedicated Proofpoint outbound server (mx0a-00278502.pphosted.com)
```

Looking at `disney.com`’s DNS record, we couldn’t find any misconfiguration that can be abused for SPF approval or use of other arbitrary IPs or domains. Plus, getting the genuine private DKIM key to sign those emails suggests Disney’s data was breached?! Well, this is not the case here, not at all…

## Proofpoint’s Relay Servers as the Enabler

When we analyzed the path those emails took to reach the victims' inboxes, we realized they all share the same characteristics—starting at a simple SMTP server on a virtual server, going through an Office365 Online Exchange server, and later entering a domain-specific Proofpoint server that dispatches the email to the targets.

We see different SMTP servers, as well as different Office365 instances, in other samples from this campaign. Yet, the endpoint is always a Proofpoint `pphosted.com` server —so it’s time to understand better what this relay server is all about.
