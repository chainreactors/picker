Education is crucial in defending your website against emerging threats. That’s why we are thrilled to share our [2022 Website Threat Research Report](https://sucuri.net/reports/2022-hacked-website-report/). Disseminating this information to the community helps educate website owners about the latest trends and threats.

This year, we’ve included new insights to highlight the most prevalent tactics and techniques observed in compromised web environments and remote scanners.

## Key takeaways

Some of the key findings from our 2022 Website Threat Research Report include:

* **50.58%** of all CMS applications were outdated at the point of infection.

A more detailed look at the data shows that WordPress’ automatic updates are helping users maintain updated CMS’. **49.8%** of WordPress installations were outdated at the point of infection, lower than other CMS applications in our environment.

* **36%** of all compromised websites had at least 1 vulnerable plugin or theme present in the environment at the point of remediation.

This data point stresses the importance of patching and maintaining website software and third-party components to mitigate risk. Easily exploited vulnerabilities are a top choice for attackers. If they don’t require authentication, attackers are able to easily automate their attacks and monetize affected environments. By patching software to the latest version, website owners can minimize risks from bugs, known vulnerabilities, and other security threats.

* **69.63%** of compromised websites were found to have at least one backdoor at the point of remediation.

Backdoors can be difficult to detect and found in a wide range of formats — it’s common to find several different types of backdoors responsible for specific tasks on a compromised server environment. In total, our team removed **1,188,864** backdoors from infected websites last year.

* SEO spam was detected on **46.76%** of all infected websites in 2022.

SEO spam was a prevalent issue, with over **584,000** websites found to contain SEO spam during a remote SiteCheck scan in 2022. It was also the third most common malware family detected on hacked websites; **46.76%** of all remediated websites were found to be infected with some form of spam, and our teams removed **4,695,695** instances of spam from files and **670,721** from compromised databases.

* **23.63%** of compromised websites contained at least one hack tool.

This category is used to identify automated tool kits like [AnonymousFox](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/06/how-to-find-clean-up-the-anonymousfox-hack.html) along with configuration stealers, DDoS attack tools, botnet scripts, mass defacement tools, and spam mailers.

* Malicious WordPress admin users were found in **32.69%** of infected databases.

Our data revealed the top ten most common user names and email addresses associated with these malicious admins.
