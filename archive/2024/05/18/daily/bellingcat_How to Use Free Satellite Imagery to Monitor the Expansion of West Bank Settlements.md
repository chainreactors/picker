# How to Use Free Satellite Imagery to Monitor the Expansion of West Bank Settlements

Since the beginning of 2024, the [US has issued a series of sanctions](https://www.state.gov/west-bank-sanctions/) against a small number of Israeli settlers for jeopardising peace and security in the West Bank. The impact the sanctions will have is [debated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/12/could-new-us-sanctions-threaten-future-of-west-bank-settlements), but it marks a new development amid ongoing attempts to address widespread Israeli settlement of the West Bank which is [illegal](https://press.un.org/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm) under international law.

The first Israeli settlement was established in the West Bank in 1967 after the territory was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War. Today there are now reportedly [500,000 Israeli settlers](https://www.timesofisrael.com/were-here-to-stay-settlers-say-over-500000-israelis-now-living-in-west-bank/) living in the West Bank. Settlements range from small enclaves to large, well-developed communities and urban areas. According to the [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/west-bank-snapshot-14-december-2023#:~:text=2023%20is%20already%20the%20deadliest,of%20Palestinian%20killed%20in%202022.), 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since the UN began recording in 2005. In March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that the region was on “the brink of catastrophe”, [noting](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/Palestine-March2024.pdf):

“The transfer of wide administrative powers relating to settlements and land administration from the military authorities to Israeli civilian officials, who are elected and accountable to the population of Israel, could facilitate the annexation of the West Bank.”

To research the scale of the settlements and developments over time, analysing satellite data is key. While you can pay for  high resolution satellite imagery to gain detailed, on-the-ground information about changes in the West Bank, free-to-access satellite tools can also be useful  for examining settler expansion in the West Bank. Although Google Earth imagery of the region has often been of [poorer quality](http://bbc.com/news/57102499), compared with other services and regions, it can still be effectively used  – as long as its shortcomings are kept in mind. In addition to Google Earth, Sentinel Hub EO browser is also a useful free service. Both of these were used by Bellingcat in our [recent collaboration with Scripps News](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/29/the-hidden-war-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/) investigating the conflict in Gaza and escalating tensions in the West Bank.

In this guide we provide a breakdown of free-to-access satellite tools and how they can be used to monitor West Bank settlement expansions.

## Introduction to Google Earth Pro

Google Earth Pro is a free tool that allows you to travel virtually anywhere in the world!

This tool gives you satellite images of the earth and is widely used here at Bellingcat because it provides tools for measuring, analysing and displaying geographic data. You can read more Bellingcat guides to Google Earth Pro, [here](https://www.bellingcat.com/tag/google-earth/).  One of its best features is that it provides historical satellite images. You can compare historic and recent imagery to view changes in land use and infrastructure development over time. It is useful for researchers with an interest in monitoring urban expansion and environmental changes such as  those occurring in the West Bank. The amount of historical images depends a lot on what area of the world you’re looking at. The most recent satellite images for Washington DC for example are from March 2024, the most recent images from Jerusalem or the West Bank are from 2022, well before the recent Gaza conflict. Despite the limited amount of recent imagery, Google Earth Pro can still be useful for researchers looking at the region.

## How to use Google Earth Pro to Monitor Urban Expansion

First, you’ll have to download Google Earth Pro on your device, you can download it [here](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/).

*The Betar Illit Settlement and steps you can take to scroll through historical images on Google Earth Pro*.

In Google Earth Pro, enter the coordinates of the area you want to take a closer look at. At the top of your screen, you should see an image of a small clock. Once you click that, a slider should appear on your screen. Using this slider, you can scroll through historical images, the range for this particular area  is from 2004 as the first clear image to 2022 as the most recent.

If the clock isn’t visible go to the ‘View’ tab at the top of your screen and check that the option for ‘Historical Imagery’ is selected.

Using this slider to go through the historical satellite imagery can assist with researching the change in landuse.

However, keep in mind that the range of historical satellite imagery depends on the location, some areas have more recent imagery than others. This also depends per settlement, some have images from 2021, others from 2022.

## Another Option: Google Earth Engine Timelapse

 The Timelapse tool can also help detect changes on the ground and spot earthworks and developments. It allows us to observe trends over long periods of time. The website gives you the option to visit a location and see a timelapse of the area from 1984 to 2024.

The timelapse gives a good overview of an area and the changes that took place over the year-  you can often make out structures or roads appearing when looking at areas of suspected settlements and expansions. The downside to using this tool is that the resolution is low and the timelapse can not be downloaded as a GIF or MP4.

## Introduction to Sentinel Hub EO Browser

If you need to monitor multiple, large areas, a good alternative to Google Earth Pro is Sentinel Hub EO Browser. [Sentinel Hub EO Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/) is a web based tool that provides us direct access to a large collection of satellite images collected by the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Programme. You can explore large amounts of data and monitor environmental and human-induced changes.

Although the quality of the satel...
