Updated Meta's enthusiasm for training its AI on user data is not shared by the users themselves – at least for some Europeans – according a study commissioned by Facebook legal nemesis Max Schrems and his privacy advocacy group Noyb.

Noyb (None Of Your Business) got Gallup to do a poll of 1,000 Facebook and Instagram users in Germany, and found that just 7 percent wanted Meta to train its AI models on their data. Perhaps more damningly, 27 percent of the users participating in the survey didn't even know that Meta was using their data in this way.

"Meta probably knows that no one wants to provide the data from their social media accounts just so that Meta gets a competitive advantage over other AI companies that do not have access to such data," said Schrems, whose [decade plus](https://www.theregister.com/2012/06/01/facebook_terms_vote/) crusade against the company has been responsible for the [collapse of two US-EU data-sharing agreements](https://www.theregister.com/2021/06/21/final_guidance_on_schrems_ii/), along with [significant changes to Meta’s data-collection practices in Europe](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/23/metas_payorconsent_model_und...
