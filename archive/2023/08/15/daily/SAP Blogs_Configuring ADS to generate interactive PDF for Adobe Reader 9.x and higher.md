## The setup

My organization performs periodical inspection (audit) of NWA installations. During inspection of ADS instance (Adobe Document Services) the following case was discovered. Every time a PDF form was generated by request from S/4HANA a warning entry in system logs was generated:

```
$$$/com/adobe/document/XMLForm/msg.XFA=[30923] Invalid version: The current version of the XFA template model exceeds the capability of Acrobat / Adobe Reader 7.0.5.
```

Followed by the following 54 identical warning messages:

```
$$$/com/adobe/document/XMLForm/msg.XFA=[30923] Invalid version: rid is not a valid attribute of text for the target version of the document.
```

The issue was linked to a mismatch of default ADS configuration and PDF print forms (XDP forms by Adobe). Below is the my journey to fix inconsistency between ADS configuration and S4/HANA print forms.

##

## Every log message has a reason

Before we begin we need to be familiar with PDF versioning and Reader compatibility schema ([helpful source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_PDF)) in order to better understand ADS configuration settings and the issue we were facing.

Each print form is represented in Adobe XML Form (XDP) file format that is an XML-based description of the print form. Every form Is designed with specific set of features in mind so it bears target PDF version inside which supports those set features. An example below is a SAP form created with Adobe LiveCycle Designer 9.0.

Contents of XDP file

Each print form is created and edited with specialized Adobe LiveCycle Designer software. This software package is distributed by SAP and can be downloaded from SAP Software Center. Latest available release as of the time of writing is Adobe LiveCycle Designer 11.0 PL25 (last updated 24.05.2023). However if you create a new form using Designer 11.0 you will face an issue that XML Form can only be created compatible with Adobe Reader 9.0 or higher.

List of target versions in Adobe Designer 11.0

If you open a print form created for Adobe Reader 8.0 or lower then LiveCycle Designer 11.0 will show a warning message and will update the form to a new target version.

LiveCycle Designer warning when opening older XDP files

**This means that using latest software from Adobe distributed by SAP it is not possible to create Adobe XML Form compatible with Reader 8 or lower.**

We decided to fix discrepancy by aligning our ADS server configuration to match Adobe Designer 11.0 compatibility levels. This way all the features form developer decided to use inside XDP form template they would work as expected.

##

## Finding a path to success

ADS instance was configured with default (out-of-the-box) parameters. That is with default configuration of producing **PDF version 1.65**. This version of PDF is compatible with Acrobat Reader 7.0.5 or higher.  There is a way to change ADS configuration to higher version as [described in official SAP documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/JAVA_SERVER_FOR_S4HANA/cc3e2153b8504419bc7114f5ae2f693c/4b95ae2e26f26e83e10000000a421937.html). The problem is that it is limited to PDF version 1.7 (Reader 8.0). No mention of upgrading to higher PDF version.

PDF document properties when vesion = 1.7 is used

Since ADS component is basically a wrapper to Adobe XML Forms library I also looked through official Adobe documentation. Official Adobe documentation did not describe the ways to set up higher PDF version.

Target value was in the end deduced by looking at XDP form which has configuration options similar (in the same namespace) as those described in ADS configuration file.

Version info for XDP file version 1.7 extension level 3

We finally settled on version 1.7 and extension level 5 (Reader 9.1). This configuration was applied to ADS server in test environment. Unit tests were performed on some print forms without any visible problems with rendering. These tests were performed by developers only since it was only a technical update without any changed to business logic of the source system. Generated PDF document's properties also confirmed that correct version was applied to the PDF:

Also we checked NWA log file, error messages about PDF version mismatch were missing. So we decided to deploy this change to p...
