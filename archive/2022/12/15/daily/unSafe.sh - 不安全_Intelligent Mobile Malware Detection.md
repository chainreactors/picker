The popularity of [Android](https://reconshell.com/android-architecture-ebook/) [mobile](https://reconshell.com/dirtypipe-for-android/) phones has caused more [cybercriminals](https://reconshell.com/apt-cybercriminal-campaign-collection/) to create [malware](https://reconshell.com/malware-techniques/) applications that carry out various malicious activities. The attacks, which escalated after the COVID-19 pandemic, proved there is great importance in protecting Android mobile devices from malware attacks. Intelligent Mobile [Malware](https://reconshell.com/malware-analysis-tools/) Detection will teach users how to develop intelligent Android malware detection mechanisms by using various graphs and stochastic models. The book begins with an introduction to the Android operating system accompanied by the limitations of the state-of-the-art static malware detection mechanisms as well as a detailed presentation of a hybrid malware detection mechanism. The text then presents four different system allbased dynamic Android malware detection mechanisms using graph centrality measures, graph signal processing and graph convolutional networks. Further, the text shows how most of Android malware can be detected by checking the presence of a unique subsequence of system calls in its system call sequence.
