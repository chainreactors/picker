[![Sliver C2 Framework](data:image/png;base64... "Sliver C2 Framework")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_F2TnrFuDI4fcked58mUJXnv-3aVfv2YOWZ2KTyxspixd-SgXb2IELvC_vkQ7sb-e56TEHjGKzY-xM5a6Lmoe2AZgHmst3gKBtVKRWYi0-S0wErx5ajzqDROMhUSphpAM3QY2aMpiXbUrim-WKwsR6DrQDcGxoK9VCEuFuJiUrzFcDrd3uTvUw3dR/s790-rw-e365/malware.png)

Threat actors are leveraging known flaws in Sunlogin software to deploy the Sliver command-and-control (C2) framework for carrying out post-exploitation activities.

The findings come from AhnLab Security Emergency response Center (ASEC), which discovered that security vulnerabilities in Sunlogin, a remote desktop program developed in China, are being abused to deploy a wide range of payloads.

"Not only did threat actors use the Sliver backdoor, but they also used the [BYOVD](https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/ransomware-attackers-use-microsoft.html) (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) malware to incapacitate security products and install reverse shells," the researchers [said](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/47088/).

Attack chains commence with the exploitation of two remote code execution bugs in Sunlogin versions prior to v11.0.0.33 (CNVD-2022-03672 and CNVD-2022-10270), followed by delivering Sliver or other malware such as [Gh0st RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.ghost_rat) and XMRig crypto coin miner.

In one instance, the threat actor is said to have weaponized the Sunlogin flaws to install a PowerShell script that, in turn, employs the BYOVD technique to disable security software installed in the system and drop a reverse shell using Powercat.

The BYOVD method abuses a legitimate but vulnerable Windows driver, mhyprot2.sys, that's signed with a valid certificate to gain elevated permissions and terminate antivirus processes.

It's worth noting here that the anti-cheat driver for the Genshin Impact video game was previously utilized as a precursor to ransomware deployment, as [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/ransomware-attackers-abuse-genshin.html) by Trend Micro.

"It is unconfirmed whether it was done by the same threat actor, but after a few hours, a log shows that a Sliver backdoor was installed on the same system through a Sunlogin RCE vulnerability exploitation," the researchers said.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

The findings come as threat actors are adopting [Sliver](https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/threat-actors-turn-to-sliver-as-open.html), a Go-based legitimate penetration testing tool, as an alternative to Cobalt Strike and Metasploit.

"Sliver offers the required step-by-step features like account information theft, internal network movement, and overtaking the internal network of companies, just like Cobalt Strike," the researchers concluded.
