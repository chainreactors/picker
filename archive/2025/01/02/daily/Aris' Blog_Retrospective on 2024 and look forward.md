# Retrospective on 2024 and look forward

It’s the first of January 2025 and it’s time for looking back on 2024. Up until 20th of October this year, it was probably the best year I’ve had in a decade, and it’s not an overstatement.

## Work

The work part is going well. Business is going ok. I’m getting better at focusing and doing the parts I dislike. I’ve also started taking other gigs from other companies, helping me break the monotony of having a single activity and the risk of a single source of income. Note for the reader: I’m a freelance in cybersecurity (previously known as computer and information security), focusing on embedded devices.

Last year, one of my goals was to do security research and present it at a major security conference. [That’s what I did!](https://blog.0xbadc0de.be/archives/507) I presented research on TLD security from the attack surface provided by DNSSEC.

I also gave a series of lectures on cryptography and information security. I enjoyed it but the context wasn’t right for me to thrive into it.

I participated to a F/OSS SSH developers meeting, but due to timing and mood swings it wasn’t as productive for me as I expected when it was planned. It was really nice to meet so many great developers in person, though!

## Astronomy

2024 was a particularly bad year for astronomy due to a pattern of bad weather. However I still managed to take a few decent pictures:

M81 and M82 through my ED72 (or TS80?) and LRGB processing. We can see color signal in the cigar galaxy and have a little glimpse at the space dust between us and the galaxies in the background.

This is NGC6888, the Crescent Nebula. It’s a collaborative work for which I only contributed a few dozen hours of wide field pictures.

M101. This was taken in 2022 but with the progress I made with PixInsight I managed to get something better out of it.

I was lucky enough to see the Northen Lights twice this year! The first time was in May, all I had to do was step outside of the house and take this amazing picture:

Northern Lights in Belgium! We can see the red and the green components of the lights, together with some clouds, in the west direction.

I went on a small astronomy backpack trip during my vacation in Greece. I walked alone (14 km) on a mountain path and took this picture. I didn’t process the pictures in the end, but the instant of silence and standing alone in the Milky Way was worth it.

Aris in front of the Milky Way, somewhere on an almost forgotten historical site dedicated to Athena in the mountains.

I spent one week at Saint Véran, pic de Chateau-Renard in Southern France. This is a professionally-equipped observatory dedicated to the discovery of astronomy by motivated amateur astronomers. We founded a small group of 10 astronomers, wrote a project plan and were given a week in October to use the facilities. What we did there is worth another blog post.

The observatory of Saint Véran under the snow

We were extremely lucky and experienced Aurora Borealis on a clear night! These events are rare because they happen mostly during the solar activity peaks (roughly on a cycle of 11 years) and this one was so high, it could be seen from South of France.

The Andromeda Galaxy, Northern lights from inside a telescope dome. The red color we see on the dome is due to the red lights we use to see what we’re doing down there. The red in the sky is due to Aurora Borealis! Picture taken from a mobile phone dropped horizontally on a table.

Picture of the Milky Way. Half of the sky was completely red, the junction being around the Milky Way cutting the sky in half.

The Heart and Soul Nebulae, with Persei Double Cluster. Taken from St Véran with my own equipment.

I saw a few comets too! The first one was in April and the second one in October right after Saint Véran.

12P/Pons-Brooks. Single picture taken with the worst equipment I could use that day.

C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS, single picture, ~20th October. We can see the anti-trail which isn’t bad at all for a unique 13 seconds shot.

## Health

My physical health improved dramatically this year. I went from running time to time a few kilometers a week to consistently running at least thrice a week. My set goal in the tracking app is 25km a week and 2 activities. I also go to the gym every other week, where my goal is mostly to not lose muscle. I ran 1025km in 2024 which is more than double of 2023. I also joined a running club and ran in an official race. I’ll continue in 2025. Together with a better diet, I lost most than 15 kilos and it dramatically improved my self confidence about my body.

This is what I look like when I like what I see in the mirror

Exercising consistently improved my sleep, anxiety and body issues. However I have a feeling of diminishing returns and I gained some weight back in November despite running more kilometers. Which is related to the fact the I’m an anxiety eater, going to the subject of:

## Mental health

One of my objectives this year was to make significant progress to my difficulties with lack of motivation, difficulties to focus and pathological procrastination. I passed a series of psychological tests and I’m most definitively neurodivergent (the WAIS-IV is not over the top but completely asymmetrical) and the questionnaire-based tests indicate that I have ADHD, as confirmed by the neurologist. This is validating my experience but not directly actionable. I tried medication a few years ago but it didn’t help. The diagnosis is making it easier for me to get actual help from the medical field (to go a bit farther than “did you consider using a planner?”). This is one of the big milestones for 2025.

From this momentum, I bought myself (I mean, my incorporated company bought) a beautiful used car from a luxury brand. I wanted a classy EV that was not Tesla. I spent two months learning to not apologize for driving a beautiful car. Not everyone understands.

Another goal from 2024 was to get back to dating business. A small attempt at connecting back with a crush from high school failed but motivated me to go on with exercising and diet. With me being happier with my physical appearance and being in the best mental shape I’ve ever been in the last 10 years, in August I thought I was ready for the *dating apps*[1](#c20b97a1-4c59-4b7b-b06e-67444a162574).
