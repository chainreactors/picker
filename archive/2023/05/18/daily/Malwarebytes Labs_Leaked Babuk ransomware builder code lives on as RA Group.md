## Leaked Babuk ransomware builder code lives on as RA Group

May 17, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

The bones of long gone ransomware group Babuk continue to rattle in the breeze, in the form of [reused code](https://therecord.media/ra-ransomware-group-using-leaked-code). Researchers from Cisco Talos have named this new team the “RA Group”, a ransomware collective which may have only been up and running since last month.

Babuk famously [threatened to leak law enforcement data](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/04/ransomware-group-threatens-to-release-information-about-police-informants), relented, and then had its [ransomware builder tool leaked](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/06/babuk-ransomware-builder-leaked-following-muddled-retirement) during the weirdest retirement ever. While some of these antics may sound faintly comical, the ransomware was no joke. Babuk popped up in all sorts of attacks, like being [deployed via Microsoft Exchange exploits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-exchange-proxyshell-exploits-used-to-deploy-babuk-ransomware/). Babuk code has also been reused prior to this latest group, for example as the basis for [Rook ransomware at the end of 2021](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/rook-uses-babuks-leaked-code-in-kazakh-bank-attacks-a-18209).

The leaked builder has proven to be very useful for those in the ransomware realm, and people wanting to get in on the act. Its versatility and relative ease of use ensures that—sadly—we’ll likely be seeing Babuk lurking at the edges of ransomware development for a long time to come.

Our latest Babuk beneficiary, the RA Group, already has four[known compromises](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ra-group-ransomware/) in the US and South Korea. According to Talos, like many other forms of ransomware, the attacks are based around double extortion tactics. This is where the target isn’t just stuck with encrypted, inaccessible files, they’re also threatened with the stolen data being leaked should the ransom not be paid.

In this case, RA Group is sticking with the tried and tested leak portal technique. Watching confidential information be spilled across the internet for download is certainly one way to encourage a business to pay up, and an effective tactic. Talos reports that the main leak site is undergoing various cosmetic tweaks and alterations, confirming the impression that this is all very new indeed.

If you’re unfortunate enough to end up on the leak portal, your details are organised like so:

* Organisation name
* A list of stolen data / file size
* Organisation URL

Customised ransom notes are used for compromised entities, with three days given to pay up or risk the data being made public. When the three day mark is reached, “sample files” are made public. After 7 days, everything goes public.

A list of the stolen data is also provided in the ransom note, which isn’t something you see all the time. There’s no better way to show you mean business than explain exactly what you’ve done to supplier, tax, and financial information across every compromised desktop. Talos notes that the impacted organisation is also mentioned inside the code of the executable too.

Should your data eventually end up for sale, the below message may eventually provide lots of sleepless nights:
