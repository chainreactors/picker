# Advanced Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Framework

## 0. Problem Classification and Framework Selection

Before starting, evaluate the type and complexity of the problem to choose the appropriate framework version:
- Simple problems: Use the simplified version (Steps 1, 2, 8, 9)
- Moderately complex: Use the standard version (Steps 1-9, optionally use 3-7)
- Highly complex: Use the full version (all steps)

## 1. Problem Definition and Complexity Assessment

### Problem
Provide a detailed description of the problem to be solved.

### Complexity Assessment
Assess the complexity of the problem by considering the following factors:
- The field and difficulty of the problem
- The number of variables to consider
- The potential number of solutions
- The depth of reasoning required

Estimate the initial step budget: [Estimated number of steps]

## 2. Initial Thoughts and Multidimensional Analysis

### Thinking
Initial thoughts and multidimensional analysis of the problem:
- Explore at least three different solution directions
- Consider cross-domain analogies
- Apply extreme thinking (unlimited/very limited resources scenarios)
- Try reverse thinking

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution Process (Optional)

Use "### Step" to mark each step, and display the used steps and remaining budget with "- Count" after each step.

### Step
Step 1: Describe specific actions.

- Count: Used steps: 1...
