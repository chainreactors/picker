[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Authority bias is one of the many things that shape how we think. Taking the advice of someone with recognized authority is often far easier (and usually leads to a better outcome) than spending time and effort in researching the reasoning and logic behind that advice. Put simply, it’s easier to take your doctor’s advice on health matters than it is to spend years in medical school learning why the advice you received is necessary.

This tendency to respect and follow authoritative instructions translates into our use of computers, too. If you’re reading this, you’ve likely been the recipient of many questions about computer-related matters from friends and family. However, your trust can be abused, even by someone who seems knowledgeable and respectable.

Attackers have learned that by impersonating individuals with some form of authority, such as banking staff, tax officials or IT professionals, they can persuade victims to carry out actions against their own interests. In our most recent [Incident Response Quarterly Trends update](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ir-trends-q1-2025/), we describe how ransomware actors masquerade as IT agents when contacting their victims, instructing them to install remote access software. This allows the threat actor to set up long-term access to the device and continue the pursuit of their malicious objectives.

If someone contacts you out of the blue professing to be an IT or bank/tax expert with urgent or helpful instructions, end the conversation immediately. Follow up with a call to the main contact details of the team or organization that contacted you to verify if the call was genuine. Be aware of the scams that the bad guys are using and spread awareness far and wide. Expect threat actors to attempt to exploit human nature and its own vulnerabilities.

## The one big thing

Threat hunting is an integral part of any cyber security strategy because identifying potential incursions early allows issues to be swiftly resolved before harm is incurred. There are many different approaches to threat hunting, each of which may uncover different threats.

### Why do I care?

As threat actors increasingly use living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) — i.e. using either dual-use tools or the tools that they find already in place on compromised systems — detecting the presence of an intruder is no longer a case of simply finding their malware.

Spotting bad guys is still possible, but requires a slightly different approach: either looking for evidence of the potential techniques they use, or finding evidence that things aren’t quite as they should be.

### So now what?

[Read about](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/proactive-threat-hunting-with-talos-ir/) the different types of threat hunting strategies the Talos IR team uses and investigate how these can be used within your environment to improve your chances of finding incursions early.
