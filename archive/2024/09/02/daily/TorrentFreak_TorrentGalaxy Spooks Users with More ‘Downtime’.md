# TorrentGalaxy Spooks Users with More ‘Downtime’

Popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy once again confuses users with a mysterious message. Instead of the usual list of downloads, it simply shows an image from the film Logan and the brief message "TG Forever". This is similar to a notice that appeared on the site a few weeks ago, after which it eventually resumed business as usual.

**Update September 4:** TorrentGalaxy returned.

The site originally set out to ‘[bridge the gap](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-torrents-and-streaming-181104/)‘ between torrent and streaming sites, and it ultimately became much more than that.

With a dedicated group of uploaders and an active community, TorrentGalaxy provided a safe haven for many avid torrenters. The disappearance of other key torrent sources, including the demise of RARBG last year, has made TorrentGalaxy’s position as a torrent distribution portal increasingly important.

## TorrentGalaxy Forever?

[In June](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-goes-offline-with-mysterious-message-to-users-upd-240614/), many users feared that the site had thrown in the towel, as it directed visitors to a cryptic message that simply read “4ever?” This came as a surprise, even to the site’s moderators, who had no clue what was going on.

The site eventually returned as if nothing ever happened and resumed its operations. The purpose of the downtime was never clarified but that didn’t seem to matter anymore; until now.

A few hours ago, TorrentGalaxy started displaying an image from the movie Logan across its website, along with another mysterious message: “TG(X) Forever”. No further information is being provided at this time.

The image in question is titled “johntucker.jpg”. It’s not clear what this refers to, but if we put on our speculation hats, the film “[John Tucker must Die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455967/)” comes to mind, of which a [remake](https://people.com/john-tucker-must-die-sequel-in-the-works-cast-reveals-18-year-reunion-script-epic-cons-8619979) is currently in the works.

These types of unsubstantiated theories do not give the site’s users much hope. However, it’s also possible that these vague messages are simply intended to confuse people, while regular maintenance is performed on the site. We simply don’t know.

In any case, a message that’s currently displayed on the TorrentGalaxy proxy portal doesn’t instill much hope for the site’s confused users. “*Executing End-Program.exe…*,” it currently reads.

TorrentFreak reached out to a TorrentGalaxy moderator, but at the time of writing, we have yet to hear back. As mentioned earlier, during the last downtime, the moderator team was not kept in the loop. If any news comes in, we will update this article accordingly.
