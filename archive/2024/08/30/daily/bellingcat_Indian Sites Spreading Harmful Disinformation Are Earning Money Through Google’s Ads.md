# Indian Sites Spreading Harmful Disinformation Are Earning Money Through Google’s Ads

In August 2022, four Muslim men were arrested after they were accused of causing deadly floods that hit the north-east Indian state of Assam.

A barrage of comments on social media claimed that they were waging “flood jihad” in the Hindu-majority city of Silchar by deliberately damaging flood defences, but the police found no proof of this. Investigations by [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-62378520) and Indian fact-checking outlet [Alt News](https://www.altnews.in/flood-jihad-newsx-other-media-outlets-journos-communalise-silchar-floods/) also found these claims to be false at the time. *(Disclaimer: this author used to work for Alt News.)*

Yet, at least four websites not only continue to carry stories about the debunked conspiracy theory, but also to profit from them through advertisements placed on those articles. Through Google’s AdSense programme, these online publishers are estimated to earn [$10-$20 for every 1,000 views](https://adsense.google.com/start/) on these stories – even while Google has actively promoted its efforts to [fight online disinformation](https://safety.google/intl/en_uk/stories/fighting-misinformation-online/) and a policy against [hateful conduct](https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies/answer/10522641?hl=en&ref_topic=10436798&sjid=7892147177562054783-NA).

*Google ads on articles published by One India, Panchjanya, The Frustrated Indian and Sanatan Samachar promoting the false “flood jihad” conspiracy theory*

Bellingcat searched on Google for articles published between 2022 and 2024 that repeated [17 falsehoods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lTe0p0RESlw_Nc0T_sWZds4J3Ocqx9YU48soIVUijjM/edit?usp=sharing) that had previously been debunked by International Fact Checking Network (IFCN)-accredited organisations or [Alt News](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/world/asia/india-debunking-fake-news.html), a leading fact-checking website in India, and that fit Google’s [definition of “hate speech”](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/search/policies/usercontent/).

We manually checked articles to find those that repeated the hateful disinformation as fact, instead of debunking it. In total, we found 53 unique websites, including 21 media outlets, carrying 91 active articles repeating these statements.

Google confirmed that 44 of these websites – many of which are well-known within India’s disinformation and hate ecosystem – were actively monetising 72 of the articles we identified by runnings ads through the AdSense programme.

This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg: our data only includes articles containing debunked disinformation in English, with a small portion in Hindi. Our search was also limited to sites we found indexed on Google. In all likelihood the universe of websites making money in this manner could be much larger.

(*Editor’s note: We are not sharing our full dataset of sites and articles containing hateful disinformation to avoid amplifying this content.

## Real World Impacts

As in the “flood jihad” case, disinformation in India is frequently used to target minorities and plays on insecurities of the mainstream Hindu population. Its proliferation especially through media outlets with a wide reach can have real world impacts, such as the arrests of innocent people and promoting hate against certain groups.

For example, 16 Muslim men were arrested in 2021 under sedition and national security charges [after a video was shared with the claim](https://www.boomlive.in/india/pakistan-zindabad-slogan-fake-viral-video-arrest-sedition-19548) that they raised slogans praising Pakistan – with whom India has a fractious relationship – at a religious celebration in the city of Ujjain. Although [Alt News](https://www.altnews.in/ujjain-videos-qazi-saab-zindabad-slogan-mistaken-for-pakistan-zindabad/) debunked these claims, finding that the crowds were instead chanting to welcome a local leader, numerous websites continue to carry the disinformation. At least 17 of them, including eight media outlets, feature active Google ads.

Bellingcat asked Jaskirat Singh Bawa, Global Head of Editorial Operations at Logically Facts, an IFCN-accredited fact-checking organisation, about the role of media in the disinformation ecosystem in India.

“It is definitely disheartening to see publications with the means and the wherewithal to have a wide reach and amplification being irresponsible with the content that they sometimes put out there… whether this is being driven by political motivations, or whether it's being driven by greed to get more revenue based from ad clicks, we don't know,” he said.

## Google’s Contradictory Approach

In theory, Google [does not allow](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6149990?hl=en) content that incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group on the basis of their race, ethnic origin or religion. Google also requires publishers to adhere to similarly worded [publisher policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/10502938?visit_id=638554608240698246-1559171639&rd=1) which further prohibits content “associated with systemic discrimination or marginalisation” across all of its products, and has invested a significant amount in fact-checking [initiatives](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/how-google-and-youtube-are-investing-in-fact-checking/).

But in reality, disinformation continues to appear both on the company’s search engine and the sites that its ads appear on. Google [has said that](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/7315336?hl=en) it neither removes nor downgrades content on its search engine based on fact-check reports because it “does not endorse any of these fact checks”. And as our investigation has found, the company's ads continue to generate revenue for the very sources spreading harmful disinformation.

The company [said that](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/more-ads-transparency-publishers/) it has historically removed all ads from a publisher’s site for most policy violations. However, in 2017 it rolled out a page-level policy ...
