New year, new Binary Ninja version, [new survey and sweepstakes](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_1Mx_0dGQ1yMN4g-A4sJ-pKbZtJbSAFKfOoCkC44n2QPGnQ/viewform). Take the survey to help shape the future of reverse engineering tools and have a chance to win some great prizes! The survey starts today, January 26, 2023 and will end on February 8, 2023 at 12pm EST.

* **Grand Prizes:** One (1) winner will receive a Binary Ninja [Commercial named license](https://binary.ninja/purchase/) (may be substituted for a license extension if the winner has an existing license)
* **Runners Up:** Five (5) winners will receive a Binary Ninja [t-shirt](https://shop.binary.ninja/collections/all/products/extra-soft-tee-shirt) or can receive or extend a personal license

Itâs been way too long since our last survey ([September 2021](https://binary.ninja/2021/09/29/how-humble-are-reverse-engineers-survey-2020-recap.html)) and wow, has Binary Ninja changed. Since then weâve released: Binary Ninja [3.0](%7Bbase%7D%7D/2022/01/27/3.0-the-next-chapter.html), [3.1](%7Bbase%7D%7D/2022/05/31/3.1-the-performance-release.html), [3.2](%7Bbase%7D%7D/2022/10/28/3.2-released.html), and â most recently â [3.3](%7Bbase%7D%7D/2023/01/18/3.3-the-bytes-must-flow.html). Your feedback has been crucial to our decision making. Weâve listened to your feedback and weâve addressed most of it, but weâre sure you have new things to tell us and we want to hear them.

We distilled some of the most frequent requests for Binary Ninja from the last survey into the following list and Iâm happy to say weâve addressed each of them in very significant ways:

* [Decompile to C (not just HLIL)](/2022/01/27/3.0-the-next-chapter.html#pseudo-c)
* [Memory/CPU Performance](/2022/03/24/memory-usage-and-performance-optimizations.html)
* [Documentation](/2022/10/28/3.2-released.html#documentation)
* [Debugger](/2023/01/18/3.3-the-bytes-must-flow.html#debugger)
* [Type parser issues](/2022/10/28/3.2-released.html#default-to-clang-type-parser)
* [Window Layout Options](/2022/01/27/3.0-the-next-chapter.html#fresh-ui)
* [Stack View](/2022/01/27/3.0-the-next-chapter.html#stack-and-variable-views)
* [Collaboration](/2021/11/19/binary-ninja-enterprise-is-now-available.html)
* [Apple Silicon](/2022/01/27/3.0-the-next-chapter.html#m1-native)
* [HLIL/Decompilation improvements](/2022/10/28/3.2-released.html#decompiler-improvements)
* [Type Lib/Func Sig improvements](/2023/01/18/3.3-the-bytes-must-flow.html#type-libraries-and-signatures)
* [Enumeration support](/2023/01/18/3.3-the-bytes-must-flow.html#enumeration-dialog)
* [Personal being single-threaded](/2022/05/31/3.1-the-performance-release.html#non-commercial-multithreading)

Weâre really looking forward to all of your feedback and the improvements that will come as a result over the coming year!

## New User Study

In addition to the survey weâre also conducting another series of user studies. This time, weâd like to evaluate individuals using either IDA or Ghidra. The study will last 30 minutes and will require you to share your screen while you open a binary and start working. We will ask some questions about what youâre doing and why. If youâre interested in participating, please indicate so in the survey.

## About Us

Binary Ninja is brought to you by Vector 35, a group of hackers who started to make games and reverse engineering tools. Or, maybe they're game developers who still think they can hack? Either way, they're having fun doing it.
