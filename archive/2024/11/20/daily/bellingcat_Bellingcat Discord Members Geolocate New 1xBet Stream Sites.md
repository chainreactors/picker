# Bellingcat Discord Members Geolocate New 1xBet Stream Sites

A recent [Bellingcat investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/10/21/1xbet-hosts-thousands-of-amateur-sports-streams-on-its-website/) revealed that a controversial Russian-founded gambling platform takes bets on thousands of amateur sports events that are live-streamed to its website from secret locations.

We examined hundreds of videos broadcast to 1xBet – an official partner of FC Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain FC – and geolocated six venues in three countries. They included a children’s football school in Russia, a basketball arena in Belarus, and a sports hall in Ukraine’s capital city.

But we only scratched the surface and the locations of many other sports venues remained unknown. We enlisted the help of [Bellingcat’s Discord community](https://discord.gg/bellingcat) to shed further light on the scale of the amateur bookmaker leagues.

These volunteers geolocated more than 10 new sites which host football, basketball, ice hockey and cricket tournaments that are broadcast to 1xBet around the clock. We traced the leagues to Russia, Belarus and India.

The venues either denied any connection to 1xBet or did not respond to questions from Bellingcat. 1xBet has not replied to repeated requests for comment, though it did [issue a statement](https://sigma.world/news/sigma-exclusive-1xbet-responds-to-recent-allegations/) through Sigma, a Cyprus-based gambling and events firm that gave the bookmaker an award for ‘Best Mobile Sports Betting App 2024’ last week.

In comments attributed to its spokesman “Alex Sommers”, 1xBet told Sigma that it complies with all applicable laws and regulations in countries where it operatesand requests the removal of streams provided by third parties that are found to be noncompliant. The statement said betting on amateur sports “is not illegal” and that “many global bookmakers offer this to customers”. 1xBet also said it had written “to all of our streaming providers reminding them of their obligations to filter videos and ensure those hosting are in full compliance with copyright laws”.

## Moscow Tent Soccer

MLS+ is a “short football” league where teams of up to five players compete. Branding suggests it was modeled after Major League Soccer in the US, with teams named after American cities. They face off in indoor venues, two of which appear to be in large tents or air domes.

Discord user Rory White geolocated the first venue through a reverse image search on Yandex, which led to a YouTube channel containing footage from the venue. From there, Rory discovered the name of a sports facility in Moscow, and a search on Yandex Maps confirmed the venue was the Football Arena Nagatino.

Matching details include the markings on the inside tent wall, the identical seam pattern and pitch layout. Entering the coordinates from Yandex into Google Maps [shows](https://www.google.com/maps/place/55%C2%B041%2723.1%22N%2B37%C2%B037%2735.0%22E/%4055.6896583%2C37.6255643%2C208m/data%3D%213m1%211e3%214m4%213m3%218m2%213d55.68975%214d37.6263889?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) satellite imagery of a large, rectangular tent.

A search of websites and social media profiles associated with the arena led to another MLS+ domed venue in Moscow, the Angelovo Football Arena. Matches live-streamed to 1xBet show the same pitch seen in photos on the venue’s VK profile and Yandex.

## Minsk ‘Box’ Football

Inside what appears to be a warehouse, “Short Football D1” games take place in front of a large banner showing professional footballers including Germany’s Mario Götze and France’s Zinedine Zidane.

*Eagles play Wolves in this 1xBet stream*

A member of Bellingcat’s Global Authentication Project identified this venue through a reverse image search of the banner, which led to the social media profile of Box 365 Football Complex in Minsk. Box 365’s Instagram posts confirm these games are streamed from its “Betbox” venue in the northwest of the city.

## Bryansk Leagues

Bryansk, where 1xBet’s three Russian founders are from, appears to be a key location for Short Football leagues. Our first investigation into the bookmaker found multiple short football games were streamed simultaneously from in and around a children’s football school in the city. Just a few kilometres away from that venue, the Titan Sports House hosts the “Urban Short Football Cup”.

This venue was geolocated by Global Authentication Project volunteer Thomas Bordeaux and Discord user Rory White, who found it by examining stream promotional footage and searching the keywords “volleyball” and “Bryansk”. Images from the venue’s social media posts confirm the location.

Just outside the Titan Sports House, an outdoor pitch set up in a car park hosts multiple 3×3 short football matches, which are live-streamed to 1xBet day and night.

Rory White suggested that the outdoor pitch could be in the vicinity of Titan Sports House in Bryansk. This was corroborated by Bellingcat’s Galen Reich, using our [Shadow Finder](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/08/22/shadow-geolocate-geolocation-locate-...
