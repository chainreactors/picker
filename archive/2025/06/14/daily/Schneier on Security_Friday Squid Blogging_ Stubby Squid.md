[Video](https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/marine-animals/stubby-squid-vancouver-island) of the stubby squid (*Rossia pacifica*) from offshore Vancouver Island.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven‚Äôt covered.

The USA is reviewing AUKUS <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-12/aukus-pentagon-review-donald-trump-america-first/105406254>. If the security of Aus is in the interests of the USA, it will decide to cancel because Aus will pay a whole lot and receive **nothing**.

That would snap the govt and opposition out of their trances. They are making the same mistake the Athenians made during the Peloponnesian War. Armies win wars. Required right now are more infantry, armour, artillery and transport.

In any event the submarine is the wrong sort, a boomer, exactly what Aus does not need.

@ StephenM, ALL,

With regards,

> ‚ÄúAus will pay a whole lot and receive nothing.‚Äù

Not quite true‚Ä¶ It will receive international ridicule and the Aus negotiation team will be invited to be the table center piece at the next ‚ÄúThanksgiving Dinner‚Äù just like any well stuffed turkey‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve pointed out that the US has no intention of delivering let alone ‚Äúvalue for money‚Äù, it‚Äôs just a never never plan to get money in the door to off-set US horrendously bad ship building. Even the UK will be pushed past the Parson‚Äôs Nose as the people here making the UK side of it were ‚Äúidiots squirming under Boris the blob‚Äù.

Note the very recent less than subtle blackmail from Mr ‚ÄúSignal Group with Journo‚Äù Headsmack.

The US is telling NATO countries the same ‚ÄúSpend more on defence‚Äù actually meaning ‚ÄúOnly spend it with the US‚Äù and have what you‚Äôve paid for be grabbed or worse.

I‚Äôve mentioned the whole reason behind the US Chips Act etc is to get the Semiconductor FABs and technology into the US where they will be in effect ‚Äúgrabbed under the war act‚Äù along with all IP etc (and employees with commercially confidential information will have it extracted in one way or another‚Ä¶).

The Taiwanese Government is certainly aware of thid which is why they‚Äôve put pressure on TSMC not to do anything more than ‚Äúplay along‚Äù.

Because the Taiwanese Government knows the only thing keeping CCP boots off of their island, is the US military, and the only reason the US military is in the South China Seas and environs is the likes of the TSMC plants providing chips the US Mil are reliant upon in more ways than one.

So watch TSMC play along, yes they will build plants in the US over the next half decade or so, but without really investing. But you can probably guess it will be ‚Äúthird line‚Äù chips for the Auto industry etc using FAB equipment not upto making first line chips.

At a ‚Äúpickpocket convention‚Äù you keep your gold watch in your inner button down pocket, and put a polished ‚Äúbrass ring‚Äù on your waist coat chain[1].

[1] A brass ring was once a marketing tool on carousel rides. It cost the ride owner nothing, and even helped make the ride look more popular thus brought in more people with money to be fleeced. For some reason I‚Äôve never really grasped people in the US think grabbing the brass ring is a measure of status (read Catcher in the Rye). Rather than the marketing gimmick that they had been fobbed off with as part of the capitalist path to ‚Äúrob them blind for profit‚Äù.

We‚Äôre introducing a custom set of Claude Gov models built exclusively for U.S. national security customers. The models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments.

Claude Gov models were built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs, and underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models. The result is a set of Claude models that understands our customers‚Äô unique national security requirements while maintaining Anthropic‚Äôs unwavering commitment to safety and responsible AI development.

You have to wonder, on reading,
