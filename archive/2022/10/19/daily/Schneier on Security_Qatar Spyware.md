## Qatar Spyware

Everyone visiting Qatar for the World Cup needs to install [spyware](https://www.nrk.no/sport/everyone-going-to-the-world-cup-must-have-this-app---experts-are-now-sounding-the-alarm-1.16139267) on their phone.

> Everyone travelling to Qatar during the football World Cup will be asked to download two apps called Ehteraz and Hayya.
>
> Briefly, Ehteraz is an covid-19 tracking app, while Hayya is an official World Cup app used to keep track of match tickets and to access the free Metro in Qatar.
>
> In particular, the covid-19 app Ehteraz asks for access to several rights on your mobile., like access to read, delete or change all content on the phone, as well as access to connect to WiFi and Bluetooth, override other apps and prevent the phone from switching off to sleep mode.
>
> The Ehteraz app, which everyone over 18 coming to Qatar must download, also gets a number of other accesses such as an overview of your exact location, the ability to make direct calls via your phone and the ability to disable your screen lock.
>
> The Hayya app does not ask for as much, but also has a number of critical aspects. Among other things, the app asks for access to share your personal information with almost no restrictions. In addition, the Hayya app provides access to determine the phone’s exact location, prevent the device from going into sleep mode, and view the phone’s network connections.

Despite what the article says, I don’t know how mandatory this actually is. I know people who visited Saudi Arabia when that country had a similarly sketchy app requirement. Some of them just didn’t bother downloading the apps, and were never asked about it at the border.

I assume any enforcement will be far below the radar, if there is any. The World Cup has had enough bad press as it is. I cannot envision how the Qatari would like to have even more bad press.

Anyhow, traveling with two smartphones should cover the case for anyone who does not like it.

I love the assumption that everyone has their phone with them 24/7. Or that everyone even has a mobile phone.

I have a basic 2G phone. Works fine for me. But I don’t take it anywhere, it stays at my place 24/7. Even if it was one of those fancy “smart” phones, it would still stay at my place 24/7, with stickers over the camera lenses, the microphone removed, and use an external plug in microphone when I need to use it as an actual phone and talk to anyone.

The assumption is a valid one. For those under the age of 90 – smartphones are a fact of life and are with us most of the time.

(even my 85 year old father has an iphone to communicate with his grandchildren)

even for something as innocuous as internal apps that my employer forced all employees to install during “work from home” (and to some extent even now), I just put it all on a second phone

I wonder what the qataris would say to that solution. Would they insist you download it on both phones?

@Q

But you are not visiting Qatar.

A tourist without a smartphone tends to be utterly lost. Such a tourist will also be isolated without means of communication (try finding a public phone booth nowadays). And I might add that not everybody speaks English. Google translate et al. helps a lot in such cases.

I have not seen a tourist without a mobile phone for a decade or so.

Winter: I agree most people can’t get out of their door without a smartphone today – that’s the majority Qatar tries to target. Very few people, like me, carry a dumbphone, mostly for my family to be able to call me. I rarely have a need to use it throughout my day.

But then, I am not going to travel to Qatar… All my international travel was to countries where the local language was at least somewhat known to me already (or I made effort to learn some basics), and there was a good chance of meeting someone speaking an internationally or regionally popular language I know. Come on, just a decade or two ago millions of people travelled internationally without smartphones, communicated with locals somehow, payed for their stay and food, did whatever sightseeing they wanted, and returned back safely.

And what if I have a LineageOS phone, without Google Play Store (or any other app store for that matter)? I doubt they provide .apk’s…

Also, @Peter, in most of USA, anything lower than 4G is not going to work. Yes, there are some 4G dumb phones, but their cost is comparable to an entry-level smartphone.

Finally, at least in Android, it is easy to take away “special” permissions, like “modify system settings” or “display over other apps”. I doubt there is a system dialog that an app can display to ask for it. Once you show officials that the required app is started (with min permissions), you can take away all perms.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Only when it binds you.

With regards,

> “I don’t know how mandatory this actually is.”

The world appears to be full of victimless crimes, where people think they can safely not do so, but are actually committing a crime.

So you don’t download the apps, nothing apparently happens, you go home…

But for some an odficial for what ever reason will give the modern equivalent of,

“Papers Please!!”

And that is when your very personal world of hurt starts. Because you a...
