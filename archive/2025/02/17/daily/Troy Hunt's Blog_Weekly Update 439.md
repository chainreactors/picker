# Weekly Update 439

16 February 2025

We're now eyeball-deep into the HIBP rebrand and UX work, totally overhauling the image of the service as we know it. That said, a guiding principle has been to ensure the new looks is immediately recognisable and over months of work, I think we've achieved that. I'm holding off sharing anything until we're far enough down the road that we're confident in the direction we're heading, and then I want to invite the masses to contribute as we head towards a (re)launch.

Whilst I didn't talk about it in this week's video, let me just recap on why we're doing this: the decisions made for a pet project nearly 12 years ago now are very different to the decisions made for a mainstream service with so many dependencies on it today. We're at a point where we need more professionalism and cohesion and that's across everything from the website design and content, the branding on our formal documentation, the stickers I hand out all over the place, the swag we want to make and even the signatures on our emails. Our task is to keep the heart and soul of a humble community-first project whilst simultaneously making sure it actually looks like we know what we're doing ðŸ™‚
