**Mauro Vignati:**

So and you start to think about why we are here, right? What is doing humanitarian organization here? So it's because we are seeing with the digitalization of societies there is an increase, a transformation of how the wars are fought. So states are adding more and more digital means and methods to their arsenal. And one of the worst trends we are seeing nowadays is that digital technologies are bringing civilians and private sector technology companies into the battlefield.

So when I talk about private companies, I mean cybersecurity companies, technology companies that are bringing into the battlefield. So one of the most important principles in ICRC is international humanitarian law. This is a body of law.

And one of the most important principles in this law is that we define two main groups of individuals and objects. So the first one is the combatants, and the military objectives and the competence are the people that are fighting on behalf of an army. And the second group are the civilians and then civilians objects.

**Mauro Vignati:**
And they should refrain from the resource. They should refrain to a combat to go in the battlefield, and thus they should be protected against the arms and dangers that the war is producing. So this is the principle of distinction. So we have to distinguish between who is fighting the war and the rest of the population.

So and this shift in the digital technologies, so is bringing us to a to a qualitative aspect, 1 to 1 qualitative aspect, one quantitative one. So from the qualitative perspective, so the digitalization of societies is bringing some some effect. One of them is that this lowering the threshold of entering the battlefield. So with some exaggeration, we can say that everyone with a smartphone nowadays can join the battlefield and do something for an army to a conflict.

And the other perspective is that is also modifying completely, modifying the sense of remoteness that we have. So we can sit in our couch and we can participate to to the battlefield on the other side of of the planet. And from a quantitative perspective is that the states can scale up a massive amount of civilians to do what they need to do, like hundreds of thousands of civilians regrouping them in hours, in days to be able to fight for them. And another perspective is the expansion of the attack surface. So the same smartphone that they can use to attack could be also a victim of of of an attack.

**Mauro Vignati:**
So it's not just the smartphone, laptop, computer server, whatever. So the attack surface is way bigger than what we have in the physical world. So this brings us to the civilization. So we call the civilization of the battlefield. So based on that, let's have a couple of scenarios to better explain the situation and the challenges we are facing here.

So the first scenario is about states that may encourage civilians to engage in offensive cyber operations against targets associated with the enemy. So it's the states that is asking its own civilians to participate to a conflict in the digital battlefield. So this has multiple advantages for a state so individual can be easily mobilized and coordinated.

So as I said before, you can put together hundreds of thousands of people to fight in your name and you can federate all already existing activists that they can be deployed for, for your purpose and all those characteristics that bring us to this lower cost for entering the battlefield and for the states to fight in the battlefield because they can use the civilians to do this work. So this is the first scenario we are talking about. The second scenario is that the states may repurpose existing e-government apps or create new ones that will be used for the battlefield.

**Mauro Vignati:**
So here we are talking. In about two states that are provide an app that you can use to, for instance, take a picture of a tank of the enemy and then send them back to a to the to the army, to the Central Command and control and be used for the effort on the on the kinetic side. So this has multiple advantages from the state's perspective because you are tapping into an existing community of digital citizens.

So can you imagine if you if you have a new government app that is being used by three or four or 5 million of people that some point, you transform, you enhance this application providing new methods in the application, and then you provide these applications, this new version of applications to already three or four or five million people that are already using these applications. So they are tapping into this kind of situation.

So this means that you don't need any training for the people that are using the application because they are already used using these applications. So it's everything. We open download, take a picture, and send the picture. This is a normal gesture we do daily, so no training is required. This also means that there is no latency. You don't have to train military people on the ground. You just have civilians in the in the digital battlefield that can adapt and use this application in a very quick way.

**Mauro Vignati:**
And this means that the civilians are becoming sensor sensors to the army, not just for intelligence purposes, but for any other kind of activity that the state would like to start in in the digital battlefield. This brings us to a third scenario where we have the presence of technology companies, and cybersecurity companies. And so, generally speaking, private companies are jumping into the digital battlefield.

So as you may know, I mean, the majority of the networks are owned or managed by private companies and they are also managing asset that our military asset, not only civilian assets. So when war start those companies, they are inside the battlefield because they are already providing support or they are managing the networks of those governmental bodies. So this may bring us to the characteristic of that. Those companies are defending against deliberate cyber attacks. If you are already providing this kind of situation to a to governmental bodies, you find yourself in in defending against deliberate cyber attacks and you share threat intelligence with government bodies, with states that are at the moment in war.

So those are the three scenarios of how civilians and and private companies are involved in the battlefield. And these are, first a first batch of consideration about the situation that we are expecting we are seeing since the moment. So apt so state sponsored cyber attack is not the only way to assess no more, the only way to assess state capabilities in the digital sphere.

**Mauro Vignati:**
So we have a lot of more digital means and metho...
