Web forms are incredibly useful tools. They allow you to gather important information about potential clients and site visitors, collect comments and feedback, upload files, subscribe new users to your blog, or even collect payment details. But if your forms aren’t properly validating user inputs, you might be in for a nasty surprise: a variety of website security issues can occur if data is uploaded to your site’s environment without specific controls.

In fact, bad actors regularly test forms and enter all sorts of malicious data (including JavaScript or SQL queries) which, if not properly sanitized and validated, can be executed on your website.

So, let’s take a look at what input validation is and why it’s so important — along with some examples of how to ensure proper validation to prevent arbitrary file uploads, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection attacks.

## What is input validation?

Input validation is a technique used to ensure that data entered into any system, website, or web app is **valid and meets specific criteria**. It’s typically implemented for websites and web apps that receive and process user-inputs (such as forms) to check for properly formed data. And it’s one of the most essential steps you can take to prevent unexpected behavior on your site.

There are many different types and levels of validation, from **syntactic validation** (which checks the input, types, and lengths) to **semantic validation** (which ensures supplied values make sense in the application context).

If a website or app doesn’t perform proper input validation checks, malformed data may be entered to wreak havoc on the system or trigger malfunctions. For this reason, data from all untrusted sources (such as website visitors) should be validated as early as possible to mitigate risk.

> **Always validate all data from untrusted sources before performing any actions.**

As a best practice, input validation should occur on both the client and server levels. While it’s certainly nice to have client side validation, it’s not enough on its own — attackers may pass unvalidated data through a specially crafted HTTP request that totally bypasses the site’s form validations.

So, you’ll want server-side code to check and verify that it’s receiving valid data as soon as it’s been passed from the client side. And be sure to only use it after proper sanitization!

A few guiding principles of input validation include:

* Never, *ever* trust user input.
* Validating and rejecting inputs is better than sanitizing them.

So now that we have a general overview of what input validation is, let’s take a look at why we want to use it on our website and web apps.

## Why is input validation important?

Input validation is important for three main reasons:

### 1 – Functionality

By verifying that data inputs are in the correct format and within expected ranges, you can ensure data is received and processed correctly by your website’s back-end. For example, if a user specifies incorrect credit card details on your purchase process, you won’t be able to charge them.

Furthermore, if you process corrupt or invalid data, it could crash your web server — or an application might return incorrect results or simply fail to load.

### 2 – Security

Validating user inputs is extremely important for website security because it helps prevent bad actors from entering potentially harmful data, mitigating the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection attacks.

### 3 – User experience

Input validation can drastically improve user experience by informing users if they have entered invalid data. For example, if a user accidentally provides their name instead of email address in a certain field, input validation can catch the error and inform them of the mistake.
