We’re thrilled to announce that EFF’s “How to Fix the Internet” podcast is a finalist in the Signal Awards 3rd Annual Listener's Choice competition. Now [we need your vote](https://vote.signalaward.com/PublicVoting#/2024/shows/general/technology) to put us over the top!

[Vote now!](https://vote.signalaward.com/PublicVoting#/2024/shows/general/technology)

We’re barraged by dystopian stories about technology’s impact on our lives and our futures — from tracking-based surveillance capitalism to the dominance of a few large platforms choking innovation to the growing pressure by authoritarian governments to control what we see and say. The landscape can feel bleak. Exposing and articulating these problems is important, but so is envisioning and then building a better future.

That’s where our podcast comes in. Through curious conversations with some of the leading minds in law and technology, “How to Fix the Internet” explores creative solutions to some of today’s biggest tech challenges.
