First, let’s understand what are ‘[GROW with SAP’](https://www.sap.com/products/erp/grow.html) and ‘[RISE with SAP’](https://www.sap.com/mena/products/rise.html) offerings. Both offerings have many things in common, in fact both are designed to support organizations in their digital transformation to an intelligent enterprise which requires the adoption of new technologies and redesign business processes, and ‘SAP S/4HANA Cloud’ sits in the heart of these offerings. One of the key differences between these offerings is that ‘GROW with SAP’ focus mainly on ‘SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition’, while ‘RISE with SAP’ is more tailored program and more flexible, targeting large and complex business needs and for that ‘SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition’ is another deployment option to provide flexible pathways for on-premise customers to have first step in the cloud world.

Since people are critical to any successful digital transformation, SAP is offering different HCM solutions for both ‘SAP S/4HANA Cloud’ editions (public and private) with different localization scope, so let’s take them one by one to know how localization is included in each edition.

# Let’s start with ‘SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition’.

SAP SuccessFactors Suite – which is public cloud offering – should be your final destination in HCM digital transformation journey where you land on environment of innovations focusing on reimagining HCM and legal compliance.

However, not all customers are ready to go for full (public) cloud HCM so SAP has offered HCM solutions for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition to facilitate cloud transformation of classic ‘SAP ERP HCM’ and make use of enhancements & cloud value, at same time, retain investments by migrating existing core HR, time and payroll to private cloud without taking away the advantage of flexibility of extending and customizing the landscape with modifications and partner add-ons.

## What are the Key Capabilities of ‘HCM solutions for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition’ and localization scope?

HCM solutions for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition solution available in 35 languages and includes ‘Core HR’, ‘Time Tracking’ and ‘Payroll Processing’ which is localized for 105 countries (including partner local versions).
