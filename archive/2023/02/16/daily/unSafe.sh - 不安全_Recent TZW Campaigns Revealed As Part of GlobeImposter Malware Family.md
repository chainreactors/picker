In recent years, efforts to apprehend threat groups and shrink their operating landscape have gone international. As authorities across multiple countries continue to implement sanctions and openly communicate current trends to the public, threat groups increasingly resort to rebranding or creating similar variants under different names to sidestep crackdowns and obfuscate their identities.

In a February 2023 blog post, [Ahnlab](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/46812/) described a new ransomware campaign affecting South Korean organizations which deployed a malware they dubbed “TZW” ransomware. Our research links TZW ransomware to a known malware family called GlobeImposter (sometimes referred to as LOLNEK or LOLKEK). Close inspection of host origins and prominent file similarities used in both TZW and GlobeImposter campaigns suggest that actors behind GlobeImposter are updating their payloads and obfuscating their infrastructure in a manner consistent with a rebrand effort.

## Overview of GlobeImposter & New Variant TZW

GlobeImposter has a long and winding history. First observed in-the-wild in 2016, the name “GlobeImposter” is based on the ransomware’s mimicry of Globe ransomware payloads. [Multiple](https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/globeimposter-which-has-more-than-20-variants-is-still-wildly-growing/) new [versions and variations](https://www.cyber.nj.gov/threat-center/threat-profiles/ransomware-variants/globeimposter) of GlobeImposter have appeared in the years since. Frequently, these have been referred to by their extension (e.g., `.DREAM`, `.Nutella`, `.NARCO`, `.LEGO`). However, these are all part of the same umbrella malware family. In that same year, Emisoft released a decryption tool for early versions of GlobeImposter. Shortly after, the malware authors responded with an updated version for which no decryption tools are available.

Since 2017, campaigns delivering GlobeImposter have continued to proliferate even though the ransomware has only evolved slightly. The ransomware has also been used in conjunction with some well-documented high-end cybercriminal groups. For example, in 2017 [TA505](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/breaking-ta505s-crypter-with-an-smt-solver/) (also known as G0092, GOLD TAHOE) began using GlobeImposter in replacement of Jaff, [GandCrab](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sentinelone-detects-protects-gandcrab-ransomware/), and [Snatch](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-ransomware-attacks-are-threatening-our-critical-infrastructure/) to extend the reach and effectiveness of their campaigns.

## GlobeImposter’s Delivery Methods Explained

GlobeImposter is most often delivered via phishing email as an attachment or a link to a malicious attachment. The payloads are typically distributed via 7zip or traditional zip file archives. The archives [often include](https://labs.vipre.com/javascript-in-a-7zip-archive-attachment-installs-a-variant-of-globeimposter-ransomware/) a JavaScript (`.js`) file that downloads and executes the GlobeImposter payload.

More recent campaigns from within the past three years still tend to follow this formula.

GlobeImposter has also been distributed as a later-stage infection within some well-known botnets. For example, [in 2017](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/12/26/index.html) GlobeImposter was distributed via the [Necurs](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-11/) botnet. This occurred as part of multiple spam campaigns that also included 7zip archives and followed the execution flow previously described.

## Linking TZW Attacks to GlobeImposter

AhnLab’s research revealed a ransomware campaign they referred to as “TZW” with victims in South Korea. The name is derived from the first 3 characters of the TOR-based victim portal. A closer look suggests that “TZW” samples represent a new variant of the GlobeImposter family.

The pre-TZW GlobeImposter ransom notes follow the same template as the current TZW samples. Ransom note similarities are far from reliable, but it’s worth noting their likenesses.

Once a machine is infected, more concrete markers indicate a deeper level of similarity. One such marker is the “CRYPTO LOCKER” string appended to the tail of the encrypted files. This is a known marker present across GlobeImposter variants.

GlobeImposter has the ability to delete volume shadow copies, thereby inhibiting the recovery of data. There are clear similarities around the methodology of the VSS removal.

Code and functionality, by and large, are identical across GlobeImposter payloads pointing to `obzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.] onion` and those pointing to the newer `tzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion`.

A thorough comparison of the two respective samples shows there are only minor differences.

AhnLab’s research describes artifacts from a specific sample within a specific campaign. We have seen the newer TZW variations vary somewhat with regards to file metadata.

A majority of the TZW variant samples that we have analyzed resemble the version on the left hand side. The version on the right was seen in the samples noted by AhnLab.

## Understanding TZW and GlobeImposter’s Shared Infrastructure

Previous GlobeImposter payloads directed victims to a TOR-based portal at `obzuqvr5424kkc4unbq2p2i67ny3zngce3tbdr37nicjqesgqcgomfqd[.]onion`.

Beginning in late 2022, we start to see victims also being directed to `tzw7ckhurmxgcpajx6gy57dkrysl2sigfrt6nk4a3rvedfldigtor7ad[.]onion`. The interfaces and required steps are identical:
