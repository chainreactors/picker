Release Notes: New Search Operators in TI Lookup, MISP Integration, Multi-admin Support

As we wrap up 2024, we’re excited to share the final release notes of the year, and they’re packed with updates you’re going to love!

This December, we’ve shared some great news with our [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_24&utm_term=020125&utm_content=linktolanding) community. From new wildcards and search operators in [TI Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_24&utm_term=020125&utm_content=linktoti) to the launch of our MISP instance and an upgraded [Teamwork](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-for-enterprises/) feature, we’ve been working to make your workflows smoother and more collaborative.

And of course, we’ve expanded our threat coverage to ensure you’re ready to tackle whatever comes next.

Let’s dive in!

## New Wildcards and Search Operators in ANY.RUN’s TI Lookup

Searching through massive amounts of cyber threat data isn’t exactly fun. It can be frustrating when small variations in domain names or IP addresses make it hard to connect the dots. That’s why we’ve updated [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_dec_24&utm_term=020125&utm_content=linktoti) (TI Lookup) with [new wildcards and search operators](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/search-operators-and-wildcards-in-ti-lookup/) to give you more control and flexibility when crafting queries.

Before this update, TI Lookup allowed you to use the basic operators **AND** along the wildcard **\***, which work great for flexible searches.

In December, we’ve expanded this functionality by adding new wildcards and operators to make threat intelligence even more versatile.

What’s new?

* **OR:** The OR operator broadens your search by including results where at least one of the specified conditions is met.

* **NOT:** The NOT operator excludes results matching specific conditions, narrowing your search to focus on relevant entries.
* **Parentheses ()**: They group conditions to ensure your query processes operators in the correct order, enabling precise, complex searches.
* **Question mark (?):** Acts as a placeholder for a single character or none, making it perfect for handling variable strings.
* **Dollar sign ($)**: Ensures your search term appears at the end of a string, useful for pinpointing entries with specific endings.
* **Caret (^)**: Makes sure your search term appears at the beginning of a string, ideal for narrowing searches to items starting with specific patterns.

## MISP Integration: A New Option for Threat Intelligence Sharing

We’re excited to share that in December, we introduced our [own MISP instance](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/misp-integration/), providing access to Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds. This new feature brings even greater collaboration and efficiency to threat intelligence sharing.

MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is a free, open-source tool that streamlines the sharing of threat intelligence, enabling organizations to exchange data, identify compromises, and automate correlations.
