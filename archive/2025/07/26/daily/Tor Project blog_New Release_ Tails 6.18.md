## New features

### *WebTunnel* bridges

You can now use *WebTunnel* bridges to connect to the Tor network from Tails.

[*WebTunnel*](https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-webtunnel-evading-censorship-by-hiding-in-plain-sight/) is a bridge technology that is
particularly good at circumventing censorship and might work from places where
*obfs4* bridges are blocked. *WebTunnel* disguises your connection as ordinary
web traffic.

To get *WebTunnel* bridges, visit
[https://bridges.torproject.org/](https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=webtunnel).

## Changes and updates

* Update *Tor Browser* to [14.5.5](https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-1455).
* Update *Thunderbird* to [128.12.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/128.12.0esr/releasenotes/).

For more details, read our
[changelog](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/debian/changelog).

## Get Tails 6.18

### To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

* Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 6.0 or later to 6.18.
* If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an automatic upgrade, please try to do a [manual upgrade](https://tails.net/doc/upgrade/#manual).

### To install Tails 6.18 on a new USB stick

Follow our installation instructions:

* [Install from Windows](https://tails.net/install/windows/)
* [Install from macOS](https://tails.net/install/mac/)
* [Install from Linux](https://tails.net/install/linux/)
* [Install from Debian or Ubuntu using the command line and GnuPG](https://tails.net/install/expert/)

The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if you install instead of
upgrading.

### To download only

If you don't need installation or upgrade instructions, you can download Tails
6.18 directly:

* [For USB sticks (USB image)](https://tails.net/install/download/)
* [For DVDs and virtual machines (ISO image)](https://tails.net/install/download-iso/)
