## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid the Care Dog

The Vanderbilt University Medical Center has a pediatric care dog named “[Squid](https://news.vumc.org/2025/02/03/pediatric-nursing-grand-rounds-on-impact-of-squid-the-facility-dog-is-feb-12/).”

The DOGE website doesn’t give much confidence that what they’ve gained access to is being kept secure.

@ Bruce,

Another AI dog ate my briefs contents…

You would have thought the legal brethren would not just have heard about but learned from the first reported case of a GPT hallucinating in a case bundle and a judge being less than amused…

But apparently not. So as a dog returns to it’s vomit…

“Mi-Lord may I present exhibit B in the case of the AI barfing it up”,

@Dancing

It’s information that is supposed to be public record…no?

@ Bruce,

Italian’s caught at it again.

As you are probably aware I point the finger at both Israeli and Italian “companies” that closely align with their respective Government Agencies to produce “Spyware” and worse. That they also make available –often through Bulgaria– to just about anyone with the money to pay… And so people get hurt and killed by these companies profit making.

Well here is another article confirming an Italy Company and it’s Government are still at it,

> *“Italian spyware maker SIO, known to sell its products to government customers, is behind a series of malicious Android apps that masquerade as WhatsApp and other popular apps but steal private data from a target’s device”*

<https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/>

And apparently not just Android,

> *“Kaspersky said in a 2024 report that the people behind Spyrtacus began distributing the spyware through apps in Google Play in 2018, but by 2019 switched to hosting the apps on malicious web pages made to look like some of Italy’s top internet providers. Kaspersky said its researchers also found a Windows version of the Spyrtacus malware, and found signs that point to the existence of malware versions for iOS and macOS as well.”*

The Register has a interview with Bruce . . .
“Nearly 10 years after Data and Goliath, Bruce Schneier says: Privacy’s still screwed”

@ Tom Kenney

No, much of what is being accessed includes classified or personal information like social security numbers by those that would not pass a background check..

This site is about security issues.
Young inexperienced engineers not following basic security practices should not be glossed over just because one blindly agrees with a certain political viewpoint.

@ Tom Kenney

Examples of things that not everyone needs to know are our social security numbers, military capacities of allies and advesaries and criminal investigations.

Things that may raise red flags in a background check are people I knew almost 50 years ago but have worked with local political leaders of both parties for the past 15 years or so.

@ Bruce, ALL,

The wall Sam denied he has run into.

Prof Gary Marcus who has madeca few comments and books about current and earlier AI systems over the years has written a piece that people should read,

<https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-openais-efforts-at-pure>

His opening paragraph resonates with my thinking and what I’ve been saying for a while now, so I’m neither shocked or surprised, but others almost certainly will be.

As he indicates for Altman the dog has not barked… and from my perspective it almost certainly won’t with current LLM and ML systems.

As Prof Marcus dryly observes,

> *“All this time, it turns out, Altman was bluffing.”*

I’d disagree, bluffing is not the word I’d use… Of the systems Altman has pushed there are two terms of art “Hallucinations” and “Hard Bullshit” you can pick your choice which applies most to Altman’s words.

However consider what he and similar have done in terms of “knowingly misleading” those who would be and have been invesstors.

It’s hard to say just how much money has disappeared into the current AI money pit… But we do know that it more than tripled the value of Nvidia well into the trillions.

The same nonsense is what “Hell-on Rusk” is selling to POUTUS to “run the country under his control”.

It would be considered “unfair” if I was to scream “Scam”, but I have been warning that the current AI LLM and ML “GPT” systems bubble really is “puffed up” and full of “hot air” and lacks any recognisable substance beneath all the “windmill in a storm” arm waving, which is rather more than a broiling “tempest in a teapot”.

Because despite Altman’s confident words Orion is not and nowhere near Altman’s GPT-5 and AGI… So Orion is re badged into potential ignominy of at best 4.5…

Put simply “Scaling has failed” it won’t give you AGI, but lets be honest neither will,

1, The worlds largest library
2, The worlds fastest database

Which at the end of the day is all LLM systems are, in the same way all current computers are in fact Turing Engines. They are useful but some things they just ...
