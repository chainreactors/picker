Sponsored social media content has become increasingly present on feeds. Sponsored ads can often be beneficial as they are customized to suit online personas, offering relevant content tailored specifically for you. While personalized ads can help enhance your online experience, not all are legitimate. In fact, scams originating from phony ads on social media have increased dramatically, with potentially severe consequences for consumers.

### Sponsored supplement scams on social media platforms

Health and well-being are favored topics cybercriminals use in their campaigns to steal information and dupe people out of money.

These scams involve criminals creating fake ads and websites that offer low-cost miracle products, medication, or treatments that promise to cure persistent conditions, even cancer.

Researchers at Bitdefender Labs collected and analyzed health related scams across the globe over a three-month period from March-May 2024.

**Key Findings**

* A marked increase of health-related fraudulent ads leveraging AI-generated images, videos and audio promoting various supplements on Meta’s social platforms: Facebook, Messenger and Instagram
* The highest number of followers of a compromised/fake page that promoted false advertisements is over 350,000
* Scammers used over 1,000 different deepfake videos across communities
* Over 40 medical supplements ads were promoted
* Most of the ads cater to targeted geographical regions with tailored content using the names of celebrities, politicians, TV presenters, doctors and other healthcare professionals to bait consumers
* Impersonated figures include Brad Pitt, Cristiano Ronaldo, George Clooney, Dr. Ben Carson, Bill Maher, Denzel Washington, Dr. Heinz Lüscher, Dr. Jan Šula, Dr. Roman Šmucler, Dr. Marko Noč, Dr. Tomaž Klokočovnik, Dr. Fekete Andrea, among others
* Impersonated figures in Romania include Andreea Esca, Dr. Mihail Pautov, Dr. Monica Pop and many others. A boosted sponsored advertisement impersonating a well-known Romanian priest gathered over 6000 reactions and 900 shares
* Campaigns targeted millions of recipients across the globe including Europe, North America, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.

### Socially engineered deepfakes are changing the landscape

Today's technological advancements, including AI, allow scammers to significantly increase the reach and success rate of their fraudulent activities, making it much harder for individuals and organizations to defend against them. In the context of health scams, such as the ones we describe in our report below, the rise of deepfakes grants fraudsters a fresh take on old schemes and more credibility than ever before.

Here’s why:

* AI allows threat actors to tailor scam messages and ads to the interest and vulnerabilities (health problems) of individuals, and as such increases the likelihood of engagement with fraudulent content
* It enables scammers to generate highly convincing messages that are both grammatically correct and in context with the ads they push through social media platforms
* Tailored ads associated with fake videos of celebrity figures and well-known medical professionals further increase the likelihood of a successful scam campaign

The analyzed deepfake samples are of all possible qualities. While most of the videos show clear signs of tampering, our researchers found many instances of videos that were more difficult to put down in the deepfake category.

All samples use the same technique, adapted to each targeted audience --use the credibility and fame of a well-known figure to promote easy cures for common ailments in the targeted group. We have observed deepfakes in the following languages: English (which include audiences from the US, UK, Australia and so on), Romanian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Russian, Czech, Slovak, Slovene, Latvian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Polish, Greek, Croatian and others.

### The phenomenon in numbers

While it may seem that the supplement scams just changed means of propagation, the fact that millions of people can be reached by paying modest sums is extremely alarming and needs urgent moderation. Here are some statistics that prove how dangerous this phenomenon has become:

* Thousands of pages promoting medical supplement scams
* Tens of thousands of social media advertisements created by the actors behind the campaign

### Cybercriminals cheat users out of money, time and health

Malicious actors utilize various strategies to strengthen their credibility and deceive social media users. Here are some of the most used tactics:

* Scammers will say anything to convince you to buy their fake products and services. They include catchy phrases designed to captivate and manipulate emotions
* Rush individuals into deciding on the spot with limited time offers and discounts. Although they initially bait individuals with a discount for purchasing a single product, the scammers are extremely insistent over the phone trying to convince you to purchase multiple products at once to ensure that the “treatment” will be effective.
* Spread false promises to exploit vulnerable individuals in need
* Use deepfake technology to make convincing but entirely fabricated content. These methods are all part of a concerted effort to deceive and manipulate targets for their purposes.

Despite the often too-good-to-be-true nature of such advertisements, many individuals still fall prey to this deceptive content. This can be attributed to several factors, including a lack of awareness, blind trust in online information, the prevalence of false reviews, and the need for individuals to regain their health. In some cases, the scammers even exploit individuals who are desperate in finding a solution or treatment that will help them ease symptoms or even cure chronic underlying diseases.
