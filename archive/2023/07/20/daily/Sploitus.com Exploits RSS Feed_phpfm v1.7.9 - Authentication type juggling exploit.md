"""
An authentication bypass exists in when the hash of the password selected by the user incidently begins with 0e, 00e, and in some PHP versions, 0x. This is because loose type comparision is performed between the password hash and the loggedon value, which by default for an unauthenticated user is 0 and can additionally be controlled by the attacker.  This allows an attacker to bypass the login and obtain remote code execution.

A list of vulnerable password hashes can be found here.
