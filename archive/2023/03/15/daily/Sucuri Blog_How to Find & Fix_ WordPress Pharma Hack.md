Finding bogus content and unexpected links for prescription drugs on your WordPress website can be a frustrating experience. But don’t blame your site: it just got caught up in a bad crowd of [black hat SEO](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/02/what-is-black-hat-seo.html) spammers and fell victim to a pharma hack.

Pharma spam occurs when bad actors inject a website with keywords for pharmaceutical products. Their end goal is to use an innocent site’s good reputation to lure traffic to a scam. In fact, in 2022 over [40% of SiteCheck’s SEO spam detections](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/07/sitecheck-malware-trends-report-2022-q2.html) were related to pharma spam injections — indicating just how prevalent these infections are.

If you’ve recently encountered redirects to online pharmacies or spam keywords in your website’s search results, you may have been infected with pharma spam. In this post, we’ll explain what the pharma hack is, outline the symptoms you should look out for, and how to find and remove pharmaceutical spam on your WordPress website.

## What is a pharma hack?

A pharma hack is an SEO spam infection that exploits vulnerable WordPress sites, hijacking the website and injecting pages with keywords for pharmaceutical products like Xanax, Levitra, Cialis or Viagra. These pages are indexed by major search engines like Google and Bing, helping to rank the attackers’ spam.

Pharmaceutical spam can be an absolute nightmare for website admins. In these attacks, bad actors leverage a website’s resources and SEO, piggybacking off the site’s own rankings and often redirecting site visitors to spammy websites and content.

Unfortunately, pharmaceutical spam and redirects often lead to blocklisting which in turn can result in decreased organic traffic, loss of reputation, and fewer sales. And if your web host detects malware, there’s a risk that your site may be suspended.

So, you’ll want to address a pharma hack as soon as possible to mitigate risk for your visitors, reputation, and revenue.

## Why pharma spam?

Pharmaceutical prices are much higher in the U.S. than other countries, and many of these spammers are exploiting the fact that they can resell medication they buy locally to Americans at a much lower price than obtaining it through legal options.

Spammers also target drugs that are still under U.S. patent law. The patents prevent cheaper generic options from hitting the market, so spammers will expect American customers to be on the lookout for a cheaper option.

However, don’t consider this a reason to give pharma spam sites a shot for saving money. Buying pharmaceuticals online without a doctor’s prescription in the U.S. is still illegal, and there is no guarantee the spammers won’t take your money and run. And while you may be able to obtain the drugs in question there is no guarantee that they are safe to consume, the correct product, or cut with other cheaper drugs or substances.

## How to know if your site is infected with pharma spam

Finding out if your WordPress site is infected with a pharma hack may take a few steps, but isn’t an overly complex process.

Here are four steps you can take to pinpoint a pharma hack on your website.
