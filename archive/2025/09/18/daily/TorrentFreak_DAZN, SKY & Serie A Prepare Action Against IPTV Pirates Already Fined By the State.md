# DAZN, SKY & Serie A Prepare Action Against IPTV Pirates Already Fined By the State

Under new legislation passed in 2023, consumers of illegal IPTV services in Italy were warned that if police obtained their details, a fine would likely be issued by the state. This year a reported 2,500 people have already been fined but even for those who pay up, more trouble could be just around the corner. DAZN, SKY and Serie A say they have obtained the identities of those fined by the police, who they intend to pursue for "thousands of euros" each in civil damages.

IPSOS research had previously estimated that around 25% of the adult population consume pirate streams in Italy. On one hand, that means there are millions of potential targets for [fines starting at around €150](https://torrentfreak.com/italian-pirate-iptv-customers-risk-a-5000-euro-fine-starting-august-8-2023-230728/), and increasing depending on the severity of the alleged offense.

On the other, a large pool of potential targets still meets the finite resources available to the authorities, and the reality that they can’t fine them all. Inevitably, some pirates would’ve noted the odds, rolled the dice, and carried on pirating regardless.

## Lack of Action and Clarity

From the perspective of the general public, a series of warnings claiming that fines were ‘imminent’ began in the summer of 2023 and continued for almost two years.

A [seemingly credible](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-iptv-subscribers-warned-they-face-automated-fines-240929/) announcement in September 2024 indicated that when fines arrived they would be part of an automated system. Unfortunately, a March 2024 announcement previously claimed that people could also be fined for downloading apps from legal marketplaces operated by Google, Apple, and Amazon.

## 2,282 Alleged IPTV Pirates Fined

Whether the series of delays, lack of clarity, diminishing credibility, or general public apathy had any effect on behavior is hard to say. What became crystal clear in May 2025 is that fines were already being issued, and the initial batch had targeted 2,282 alleged IPTV pirates spread across the country.

In line with earlier predictions, the targets were subscribers of a service shut down in an October 2024 law enforcement operation in Lecce.

Since administration of an IPTV business is not dissimilar to running any other with thousands of customers, it appears that documents seized by the authorities made the investigation somewhat easier. That led to the positive identification of over two thousand subscribers who subsequently [received a fine](https://torrentfreak.com/italy-fines-over-2200-pirate-iptv-subscribers-in-new-crackdown-250516/) in the mail.

## Surprisingly Reasonable Fines With a Surprisingly Bitter Aftertaste

Receiving a fine in the mail for a subscription terminated in October 2024 would’ve been a double blow for any pirates who paid up front. However, many received a fine of just €154, right at the very bottom of the scale, which may have helped to soften the blow.

While mostly still unwelcome, €154 represents a mere drop in the ocean compared to the expense of defending a rightsholder-led copyright lawsuit, which may not have even crossed the minds of those who paid up to put the episode behind them.

Yet, in an unlikely, maybe even unprecedented development, rightsholders DAZN, SKY, and Serie A, appear to have spotted an opportunity to further punish pirates; specifically, those whose pirate IPTV transgressions led to them being fined by the Italian state.

## Two Bites of the Same Cherries

A local [report](https://www.ilmattino.it/schede/pirateria_dazn_sky_risarcimento_utenti_pezzotto-9060000.html) referencing the action in Lecce in 2024, reveals that the subscribers of the shuttered pirate IPTV service were traced through a detailed analysis of their personal information, banking details, and geographic data.

From the beginning of 2025 to date, nearly 2,500 pirate IPTV subscribers have been fined by the authorities, a figure in line with earlier reports. An even larger number of subscribers, over 3,000 according to the report, are currently in the process of being identified and presumably yet to face fines.

The details of those previously identified and subsequently fined are reportedly in the hands of the rightsholders. A request filed at the Prosecutor’s Office for access to the data collected as part of a criminal investigation, led to it being handed over to the rightsholders for use in civil action and the pursuit of damages.

## It’s Not Smart. It’s Not Free. It’s Not Without Consequences

DAZN, SKY and Serie A showed zero sympathy for the plight of those about to be double-tapped for the same offense. Having issued several warnings in the past, it’s now time for them to deliver.

“Watching content illegally puts those who do it at risk and strikes at the very foundations of sport. It’s not smart. It’s not free. It’s not without consequences,” said Stefano Azzi, CEO of DAZN Italy.

“A compensation claim, which can amount to several thousand euros, is equivalent to about ten years of legal season tickets. Cheering legally from the stadium or from home is a safe option for those who watch and the only way to keep the spectacle we love alive. A heartfelt thanks to law enforcement and all the institutions for their work.”

Andrea Duilio, CEO of Sky Italia, warned that fighting piracy means targeting both suppliers and consumers, noting that only greater awareness can change attitudes that have become ingrained in Italian society.

“The fight against piracy isn’t just about those who manage illegal platforms: those who choose to use them must also be aware that they’re committing actual theft, with real consequences,” Duilio said. “These illicit behaviors not only harm rights holders, but also undermine entire economic sectors and put the jobs of many people at risk. Only greater awareness can contribute to a cultural shift that is now essential.”

## Fines and Compensation

Never one to shy away from saying whatever he believes needs to be said, Luigi De Siervo, CEO of Serie A, removed any doubt over what will come next.

“What we’ve always said is coming true: whoever makes a mistake pays. From today, in fact, anyone who chooses to watch pirated content, in addition to being prosecuted and fined by the Guardia di Finanza, will also have to compensate the licensees for the rights they have unlawfully exploited,” De Siervo said.

“The era of impunity is finally coming to an end: the net around digital pirates is tightening month by month, marking a decisive step forward in the fight against piracy.”
