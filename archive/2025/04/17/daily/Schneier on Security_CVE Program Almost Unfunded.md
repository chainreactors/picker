## CVE Program Almost Unfunded

Mitre’s CVE’s program—which provides common naming and other informational resources about cybersecurity vulnerabilities—was about to [be cancelled](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3963190/cve-program-faces-swift-end-after-dhs-fails-to-renew-contract-leaving-security-flaw-tracking-in-limbo.html), as the US Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contact. It was funded for eleven more months at the last minute.

This is a big deal. The CVE program is one of those pieces of common infrastructure that everyone benefits from. Losing it will bring us back to a world where there’s no single way to talk about vulnerabilities. It’s kind of crazy to think that the US government might damage its own security in this way—but I suppose no crazier than any of the other ways the US is working against its own interests right now.

> Sasha Romanosky, senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, branded the end to the CVE program as “tragic,” a sentiment echoed by many cybersecurity and CVE experts reached for comment.
>
> “CVE naming and assignment to software packages and versions are the foundation upon which the software vulnerability ecosystem is based,” Romanosky said. “Without it, we can’t track newly discovered vulnerabilities. We can’t score their severity or predict their exploitation. And we certainly wouldn’t be able to make the best decisions regarding patching them.”
>
> Ben Edwards, principal research scientist at Bitsight, told CSO, “My reaction is sadness and disappointment. This is a valuable resource that should absolutely be funded, and not renewing the contract is a mistake.”
>
> He added “I am hopeful any interruption is brief and that if the contract fails to be renewed, other stakeholders within the ecosystem can pick up where MITRE left off. The federated framework and openness of the system make this possible, but it’ll be a rocky road if operations do need to shift to another entity.”

More similar quotes in the article.

My guess is that we will somehow figure out how to transition this program to continue without the US government. It’s too important to be at risk.

I live in Northern Virginia and “But a little notice would have been nice.” applies to so much of what’s been happening lately.

Not quite “Some random person in Nebraska” is it? I wonder how many more of these things most people haven’t heard about are getting destroyed on no notice.

“But a little notice would have been nice.” Chaos is the name of the game baby! Keep the proletariat jumping with the latest outrage while those at top get rich. The extent of damage being done to the US is tragic. If only the voters had known how bad Shitler was going to be. If. Only.

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “… as the US Department of Homeland Security failed to renew the contact.”

Whilst technically true, the reality is some sad sack bag of old post digestive eruptions, just stuck a pin in a list of,

“Funding to cut to crow about to those who have less comprehension than he.”

And withdrew the funding thus giving the DHS no real choice (even though those in charge there may have foolishly thought it was a good idea).

Unfortunately for the miasma of post digestive eruptions it got serious kick back and some other suspiciously timed news items turned up the heat to near the flash point.

So as noted, and perhaps unsurprisingly,

> “It was funded for eleven more months at the last minute.”

After all we can not have the Donald looking like a bad roast duck, “Peking” or otherwise.

But,

> “My guess is that we will somehow figure out how to continue this program without the US government.”

I’m not sure if that is entirely a good idea.

Lets say it’s academic rather than corporate interests that continue it…

The recent Executive attacks on US Universities indicates an all to likely “arms length” way for the Executive to kill things off. We’ve already seen this with certain subjects where certain people who are most definitely NOT US Citizens and do not want “Freedom of Speach” etc getting in the way of their “alternative truth” “propaganda machines”.

Likewise with Corporates, but they are likely to “fold more quickly” in most cases.

What’s clear at this point is that it would be hard to find a worse steward than the Federal government. American voters just aren’t that smart, to say nothing of both the Senate and the Electoral College acting as DEI for the worst and dumbest among us.

As long a a dozen farmers in Wisconsin who have never met a black person get to be the deciding factor in our federal elections, the federal government needs to be viewed as an adversary. This is the second rise of the Confederacy. Even if they could help, they wouldn’t.

The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) program is vital because it standardizes the identification of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, enabling easier and more consistent tracking across the industry. Without it, organizations would face significant challenges in coordinating efforts to address and patch vulnerabilities, leading to increased exposure to security threats. The program facilitates communication and helps prioritize responses to vulnerabilities, thereby playing a crucial role in protecting the integrity and security of software systems worldwide. It seems like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stepped in to provide a bridge, executing an option period on the contract to ensure no lapse in critical CVE services.
