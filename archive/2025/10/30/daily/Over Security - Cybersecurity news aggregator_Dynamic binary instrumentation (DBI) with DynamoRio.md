* This blog introduces dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) and guides you through building your own DBI tool with the open-source DynamoRIO framework on Windows 11.
* DBI enables powerful runtime analysis and modification of binaries critical for malware analysis, security auditing, reverse engineering, and performance profiling — all without access to source code.
* Learn DynamoRio's strengths, its practical applications in evading anti-analysis techniques, and step-by-step instructions for developing and testing your own instrumentation clients.
* Explore hands-on examples with access to a GitHub repository with sample code to jumpstart your own research and tooling.

Binary instrumentation involves inserting code into compiled executables to monitor, analyze, or modify their behavior — either at runtime (dynamic) or before execution (static) — without altering the original source code. Tools like DynamoRIO, Intel PIN, Valgrind, Frida, and QDBI are commonly used in the field. Static binary instrumentation (SBI) injects code before a binary runs, typically by modifying the file on disk, whereas dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) operates in memory while the program runs. These techniques are widely used for profiling, debugging, tracing, security analysis, and reverse engineering.

## Introduction to DynamoRIO

[DynamoRio](https://dynamorio.org/) (DR) is a matured, well-maintained, and frequently updated open-source DBI framework. HP and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the first version in collaboration around 2000. Derek Bruening, DynamoRio's lead developer, described the main concept in his [PhD Dissertation](https://www.burningcutlery.com/derek/phd.html) in 2004, and further information about the history of DR can be found [here](https://dynamorio.org/page_history.html).

The main reasons why Talos uses DR for Windows- and Linux-based malware analysis is its low performance impact at execution time, the excellent transparency (the target application does not recognize it is instrumented), and the open source license. Table 1 provides a brief comparison of some of the common instrumentation frameworks used in the industry. Please consider this as a general reference only, as this comparison might be biased by our use cases and may not remain accurate over time due to the ongoing development of the different frameworks. There is also not a best overall toolkit, as it depends on the use case.

It should also be noted that it always depends on the user code how well a certain instrumentation framework works. Even the best framework cannot fix bad user code.

| Feature | DynamoRIO | Intel PIN | Frida |
| Type | DBI | DBI | Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation via API Hooking |
| Instrumentation granularity | Basic blocks and instructions | Instruction-level (very fine-grained) | Function-level and instruction-level (via memory hooks) |
| Language (API) | C/C++ | C/C++ | JavaScript, Python, C |
| Target platforms | Windows, Linux (limited macOS, Android forks) | Windows, Linux (x86/x64 only) | Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS |
| Architecture support | x86, x64, ARM (partial), AArch64 (forks) | x86, x64 | x86, x64, ARM, ARM64 |
| License | Open source (BSD-like) | Proprietary (free for non-commercial) | Open-source core and commercial license (Frida Pro) |
| Performance overhead | Medium (2–10× depending on tool complexity) | High (10–20× or more with deep instrumentation) | High (especially with many hooks or on mobile) |
| Transparency (anti-debug evasion) | Medium (code caching may leak) | Medium to low (can be fingerprinted) | Low (easily detectable by injected libraries or syscalls) |
| Best use cases | Runtime analysis, instrumentation, sandboxing | Deep instruction analysis, academic research | API hooking, mobile analysis, debugging, live patching |
| Shellcode detection feasibility | Excellent (module-level execution monitoring) | Good, but more effort needed | Limited (good for allocation and hook, not raw exec detection) |
| Community and documentation | Active community, used in research and industry | Older, still maintained by Intel | Very active, large community, modern docs |

## Why use DBI to analyze malware?

Ultimately, the possibilities are only limited by your creativity and malware technology knowledge. However, here are some examples:

### Anti-anti-VM detection

Malware samples can be executed on real hardware and still be monitored and analyzed. Alternatively, VM detection functions can be patched at runtime to make sure the malware does not recognize it is running in a VM.

### Anti-anti-analyzing techniques

Malware uses many simple but common anti-X techniques (such as anti-debugging, anti-emulation, anti-tamper, anti-disassembler, self modification, etc.) that do not recognize DBI or do not have any impact on the DBI analysis. Many code runtime manipulation techniques which the frameworks are using are either transparent or hidden to the malware or the malware is just not trying to find them. The latter probably applies to the majority of malware today.

### De-obfuscation

For example, code traces and memory dumps based on certain conditions can give the analyst a better idea of what the malware is actually doing.

### Finding interesting functions within the malware

It is relatively simple to build a shellcode execution detection tool with DBI to find a second stage in a packer by looking for functions whic...
