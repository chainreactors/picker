## SAP Fiori tools update for 2211

While SAP Fiori tools releases new functionality every two weeks, we only summarize the innovations every few months. This time, we cover TypeScript support, easier troubleshooting, and harnessing the power of the flexible programming model.

## News in SAPUI5 flexibility - adaptation projects

Adaptation projects in SAP Business Application Studio extend SAP's standard applications and now also [extend already-deployed projects](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/9d2028f106d44424a0f4637541b6e25f.html) created by SAP (e.g. industry solutions) or SAP partners. This enables customers to adapt even more solutions to meet their needs. Another new capability is that developers can [preview an adaptation project](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/584e0bcbfd4a4aff91c815cefa0bce2d/2644b855e6324afb8d9c029e3cc0d897.html#preview-in-a-separate-browser-tab) in a separate browser tab. This enables a standalone preview for e.g. automated/manual testing.
