## You’ve had almost two years to patch and some of the software is EOL, now attackers *déployer un rançongiciel*

France's Computer Emergency Response Team has issued a [*Bulletin D'Alerte*](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/alerte/CERTFR-2023-ALE-015/) regarding a campaign to infect VMware’s ESXI hypervisor with ransomware.

We get a little language lesson with this one: France's CERT describes this as an attempt to "déployer un rançongiciel," while Italy's Agenzia per la Cybersicurezza Nazionale – which has also [warned](https://www.csirt.gov.it/contenuti/rilevato-lo-sfruttamento-massivo-della-cve-202121974-in-vmware-esxi-al01-230204-csirt-ita) of the campaign – warns that a "rilascio di ransomware" is under way.

Neither nation's infosec authorities offer any information about the source of the attack, but both note that it goes after CVE-2021-21974 – a 9.1/10 rated bug [disclosed and patched](https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/23/vmware_vsphere_critical_bugs/) almost two years ago in February 2021.
