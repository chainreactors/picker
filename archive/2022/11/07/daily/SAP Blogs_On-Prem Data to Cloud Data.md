## Introduction

This blog would help you as an Architect to speed-up the migration process for your On-Prem / SAP Commerce from CCv1 (SAP Commerce Cloud on SAP Infrastructure) to CCv2 (SAP Commerce Cloud on Microsoft Azure Cloud). We will also see the difference between CCv1, On-Prem, and CCv2 and then look into detailed solutions for Data Compatibility and Data migration which is always the major concern of Architects and Project Management which will be the focus of this blog.

## Back to Basics

### CCV1:

This is also known as SAP Commerce cloud on SAP Infra since the Infrastructure and Data centers on which the environment runs are from SAP. Customers use to receive a detailed architectural diagram of the server configuration for each environment. Any deployment on STG and PROD required a service request ticket to SAP. The DB used here was HANA DB. We also use Splunk in many cases to check the server logs from QA/STG and PROD. The process to deploy any fix or troubleshooting issues was very complicated and had to go through a very slow process.

### On-Prem:

This is purely hosted on the customer location and managed by the customer alone without much involvement from SAP. The customer has their own choice to select any cloud providers (such as GCP / AWS ). The only support that SAP usually provides is those which is related to the Commerce Framework/Solution. The customer has the choice to select their own DB such as HANA, Oracle, or MySQL.

### CCv2:

This is based on a public cloud which is from Microsoft Azure. DB in the case of CCv2 is Microsoft Azure SQL Database which is provided from Azure Cloud. Here we use Kibana for checking server logs and Dynatrace for monitoring.

## Data Model Compatibility for CCv2

Before you migrate it's very important that you check that your data model has been declared with Microsoft Azure SQL database-specific mapping.
