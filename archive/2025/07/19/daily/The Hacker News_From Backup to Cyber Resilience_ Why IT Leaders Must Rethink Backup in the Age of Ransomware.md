With IT outages and disruptions escalating, IT teams are shifting their focus beyond simply backing up data to maintaining operations during an incident. One of the key drivers behind this shift is the growing threat of ransomware, which continues to evolve in both frequency and complexity. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) platforms have made it possible for even inexperienced threat actors with less or no technical expertise to launch large-scale, damaging attacks. And these attacks don't just encrypt data now. They exfiltrate sensitive information for double and triple extortion, alter or delete backups, and disable recovery infrastructure to block restoration efforts.

This is especially critical for small and midsize businesses (SMBs), which are increasingly targeted due to their leaner defenses. For an SMB generating $10 million in annual revenue, [even a single day of downtime can cost $55,076](https://www.encomputers.com/2024/03/small-business-cost-of-downtime/), without factoring in the long-term impact on customer trust and brand reputation. While also considering the mounting pressure to meet compliance mandates, tightening regulations in sectors like finance and healthcare, and the evolving standards set by cyber insurance providers, it's no longer enough to simply back up critical data. Organizations need a cyber resilience strategy that enables them to maintain operations even during major disruptions.

Let's examine where traditional backup strategies fall short and how SMBs can build true cyber resilience to keep their businesses running when it matters most.

## Why traditional backups are necessary but no longer sufficient

For years, backup strategies have followed a familiar playbook: periodic snapshots of critical systems, defined recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO), off-site replication and an occasional test restore. It's a setup that's served many IT teams well — after all, if restoring a lost file worked the last time, why wouldn't it work again?

However, here's the problem: that thinking is rooted in a time when failures were usually accidental — caused by hardware faults, human error or software issues. It doesn't account for today's reality: targeted, persistent cyberattacks that are designed specifically to destroy your ability to recover.

Attackers now routinely wipe or corrupt local backups, compromise admin credentials to gain control of backup systems and disable recovery infrastructure entirely. Many use double and triple extortion tactics, encrypting data, exfiltrating it and threatening to leak it publicly. Worse, the risk doesn't stop within your own perimeter.

Many ransomware campaigns now target supply chains to disrupt multiple organizations at once. As an IT leader, it's essential to recognize the operational risks introduced by third-party vendors in your supply chain. Consider asking:

* How you plan to extend cyber resilience expectations to vendors and partners
* What contractual clauses (such as HITRUST in healthcare) actually give you confidence in their backup and disaster recovery readiness

Frame the situation in terms of risk appetite.

* Would your board tolerate a scenario where your backups were encrypted by ransomware? Ask the hard questions:
* Are we willing to accept a three-day infrastructure rebuild just to restore from legacy backups?
* Are we comfortable with a recovery that could take weeks, risking data loss due to untested systems?
* Can we prove to auditors — and cyber insurers — that we can restore operations within the documented window?

**If the answer is "no" to any of these, then it's time to rethink your approach to business continuity and resilience.**

## What is cyber resilience & why it's a strategic shift

Backup focuses on copying data and restoring it later. However, cyber resilience goes one step further and keeps your business running even during an attack.

A resilient cyber posture integrates:

* Immutable backups that are stored off-site in the cloud. These backups can't be modified or deleted by ransomware, unlike local systems that may be compromised if admin credentials are breached.
* Automated, verified recovery testing to ensure your systems can actually restore under pressure. An untested backup is only a theory, not a plan.
* Orchestrated recovery playbooks that rebuild entire services and applications, not just files. Solutions like Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaaS) help streamline this, enabling faster, more reliable business service restoration.

Before taking a decision, also consider the budget vs. risk conversation: What costs your organization more — a week-long outage that stalls production, delays payroll or halts customer transactions, or investing in tooling that prevents it entirely?

Cyber resilience reduces both the likelihood of severe disruption and the impact when it occurs. Insurance may cover losses after the fact, but resilience ensures the business can still operate while the threat unfolds.
