# Linux Process Running with Hidden Binary Name Attack

29 December 2024

Videos

Hidden process binaries on Linux are often malicious. In this video we describe what this attack is, why processes with hidden binaries are usually up to no good, and command line forensics you can use to investigate the activity. We also show you how to quickly find this attack with Sandfly's agentless Linux EDR and security platform.

Sandfly is able to find this and many other types of Linux attacks without deploying any endpoint agents. Get your [free license](https://sandflysecurity.com/get-sandfly/) today or [contact us](https://sandflysecurity.com/contact-us/) for more information.
