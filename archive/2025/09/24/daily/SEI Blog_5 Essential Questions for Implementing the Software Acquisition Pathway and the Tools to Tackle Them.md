Software engineering techniques continue to evolve and improve, with SEI research playing a key role in helping the Department of Defense (DoD) gain the benefits of these improvements and drive changes to revolutionize software acquisition. Our work helps simplify rules, adapt practices to enable decisive actions, improve workforce capability, and accelerate adoption of commercial and scientific innovations. Since its inception, the SEI has been leading the DoD's embrace of [modern software engineering methods](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/news/new-dod-memo-accelerates-software-acquisition-modernization/), such as Agile and DevSecOps. The SEI contributed its expertise to the development of the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), which was issued in 2020 as [Department of Defense Instruction 5000.87](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500087p.PDF?ver=virAfQj4v_LgN1JxpB_dpA%3d%3d?). The policy departed from decades of regulations geared toward hardware acquisition by encouraging these modern software practices to streamline the development and acquisition of software-enabled systems to deliver capabilities at the speed of ever-changing mission needs.

The release of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s March 6 memo, [*Directing Modern Software Acquisition to Maximize Lethality*](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/07/2003662943/-1/-1/1/DIRECTING-MODERN-SOFTWARE-ACQUISITION-TO-MAXIMIZE-LETHALITY.PDF), launched a new imperative that DoD programs must increase and accelerate their adoption of the SWP as the preferred path for software acquisition. The March 2025 memo aims to scale up SWP successes across the entire Defense Department to speed, streamline, and secure the development and delivery of software-driven mission capabilities, from the back office to the front lines. As we outline in this post, this focus on the SWP has been the catalyst behind our efforts to develop a [new collection of tools](/projects/software-acquisition-go-bag/) to help DoD programs adapt their acquisition practices to accelerate software delivery.

## A Brief Introduction to the Software Acquisition Pathway

Unlike prior generations of acquisition policy, the SWP is designed for software-intensive systems. Its [objective](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/) is “to facilitate rapid and iterative delivery of software capability to the user.” The SWP emphasizes modern, iterative software development methods, automated tooling (including automated testing and cybersecurity testing), and active user engagement to deliver software capabilities at the speed of need and enable users to adapt to changing conditions. Figure 1 below shows the iterative nature of engagement between users, program offices, and product teams under the SWP.

## Implementing the SWP: 5 Important Questions

In the past five years our SEI team of software acquisition experts has collaborated extensively with DoD program teams and policy owners to implement the SWP in different contexts, identify barriers and challenges, and monitor outcomes. In the course of that work, we have identified common questions and stumbling blocks that programs encounter as they adopt the SWP. Addressing these questions often warrants additional tools and resources to enable teams to position their SWP programs for success.

The most common questions we encounter about launching SWP programs include

1. **Are we really ready to adopt the SWP?** Entering the [SWP Planning phase](https://aaf.dau.edu/aaf/software/planning-phase/) requires a signed Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) and draft Capability Needs Statement (CNS). But there’s a lot more to being adequately organized and equipped for the successful execution of an SWP effort. It’s not enough, for example, for the program’s product team to just *do Agile*. Program teams often don’t have experience implementing modern software development approaches and need to gain an understanding of what those approaches mean in practice.
2. **What is a Capability Needs Statement (CNS), and how exactly do we develop one that fits our situation?** Many users and program office teams struggle to shift from a [Capability Development Document (CDD)](https://www.dau.edu/glossary/capability-development-document) articulation of needs to crafting a CNS at the appropriate level. This struggle often results in a CNS that is merely CDD content that has been copied and pasted into the CNS template. The up-front level of investment in the specificity required to create a CDD runs counter to the flexibility and adaptability the SWP is designed to enable. An appropriate CNS provides the right level of detail to enable the needed flexibility.
3. **How do we assess progress and identify ris...
