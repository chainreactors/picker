Artificial Intelligence (AI) is receiving a warm welcome from users and big-league developers around the world as more companies pursue an effort to integrate some form of artificial technology into their software and leverage machine learning capabilities to enhance the end-user experience.

Silicon Valley has seen an explosion in the number of AI projects currently in the pipeline, with everyone from Apple, Google, and Meta to Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, and Visa all experimenting with artificial intelligence technology and baking these features into their new line of products.

As more big-time players and smaller startups [jump onto the AI bandwagon](https://hackernoon.com/beyond-automation-charting-the-global-impact-of-artificial-intelligence?ref=hackernoon.com), the greatest impact AI could potentially have on our lives is perhaps in a place much closer to us than we might think - our homes.

Yet, having smart devices plugged into our homes isn’t anything new. For the last several years, households have introduced a plethora of digital devices, from smart doorbells and security cameras to smart fridges, ventilation systems, and a handful of smart speakers scattered around each room.

In many ways, smart speakers have become the epitome of creating an autonomous environment in our homes, with [65 percent of Americans](https://www.statista.com/chart/23943/share-of-us-adults-who-own-smart-speakers/?ref=hackernoon.com) claiming to own an Amazon Echo pod, while 24% and 18%, own a Google Home device or Apple HomePod, respectively.

On the surface, we might understand the basic workings of these devices through our day-to-day interactions with them. While many of us may be using our home pods for simple tasks such as checking the weather or giving traffic reports, there’s a deeper and more sophisticated level of AI technology already built into their stack of code.

Just as this technology can go deeper, and resolve more complicated everyday problems, so could the potential of artificial intelligence in our homes further enhance automation efforts, helping to improve our lives and reduce our need to complete mundane tasks around the house.

## How Smart Our Homes Can Be

Artificial smart home technology runs deeper than we think. Sure, it might not be what we’ve come across in dated futuristic sci-novels and movies, but we’re reaching the cusp of a smart home revolution that will completely change the way in which we live and interact with the resources and systems in our homes.

### Intelligent Automation

Different devices in and around our homes can now all be linked together to create a more intelligent ecosystem that can track and analyze all our daily activities. These actions move beyond the somewhat traditional actions, such as requesting certain tasks from home speakers.

By connecting smart devices to the internet, you can now control your entire environment to become exactly the way you want it to be. Temperature sensors can monitor outside weather conditions and change the heating and cooling around your house to make it more pleasant without you having to input these actions.

Security cameras can now track and analyze when you’re having guests over and adjust the environment to be more comfortable based on their preferences and previous activities. Taking it another step further, you can link your home operating system with your mobile device, allowing your operating system to track and schedule important maintenance that may be required in the near future.

Though for me these actions might seem foreign, the reality is that we’re already seeing much of this sort of technology being applied to our appliances, enabling us to have a more efficient lifestye, while spending less time on mundane tasks that can become automated.

### Enhanced Activity Analyses

Aside from smart speakers and home pods being able to schedule routine maintenance for things around the house, devices can now track and analyze your behavior and make the necessary adjustments.

For instance, smart water heaters can track your daily activity, including the amount of water used, visits to the bathroom, and how much time you spend getting ready in the mornings. This data will help smart heaters control water temperatures more accurately and track water usage across your home.

The same goes for lighting in your home. Smart devices will analyze how often you use a specific light, and which you tend to use more than others. They can then adjust to this behavior, and ensure those lights turn on and off automatically when you’re entering or leaving a room or be switched on for when you come home later.

By allowing smart home devices to monitor and then analyze our behavior around the house, we can adjust our environment to become exactly the way we want it to be without having to request these instructions.

### Upgraded Hands-Free Digital Security

One of the biggest benefits of artificial intelligence has been the development of smarter, more reliable security systems that can now be installed in and around your house. Already, devices such as Ring doorbells and smart locks provide an added layer of security, but moving beyond that, we could see how AI will help make security systems more effective.

Linking security cameras to the internet will enable better facial recognition should there be trespassers on your property. Unusual activity could prompt security systems to automatically notify you and contact local law enforcement.

The average cost of installing a new security system can range anywhere from $600 upwards. On top of this, homeowners [spend on average $289 per year](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowners/home-security-habits.html?ref=hackernoon.com#:~:text=Respondents%20spent%20an%20average%20of,twice%20as%20much%20as%20couples.) on home security systems, while women and families consisting of two or more household members tend to pay twice as much.

By improving our home security systems, and building on top of the protocols that we already have in place, basic security measures can become more reliable, and perhaps more affordable for those residents and families spending twice as much as the everyday individual.

### Improved Home Accessibility

Incorporating artificial intelligence into our homes is making basic everyday living more accessible for individuals with disabilities. By allowing these tools to automate certain activities around the house, [individuals with disabilities](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c982zz8gqxgo?ref=hackernoon.com) can become more dependent on these digital resources that aid in addressing the barriers and challenges these people may face.

Voice-controlled tools equipped with AI capabilities can be partnered with assistive devices. Smart home systems can monitor and analyze a person’s behavior to better understand their movement, and to adjust the environment based on their needs without having to provide input voice prompt requests.

Additionally, AI can further automate certain tasks, such as scheduling repairs and maintenance, or monitor the overall condition of certain appliances and inform them when an upgrade is needed. Other things, such as adjusting lights or the temperature of each room, can become more manageable and may require less physical interaction to improve the living environment and lifestyle of those in...
