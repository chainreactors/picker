In episode 74 of The AI Fix, we meet Amazon‚Äôs AI-powered delivery glasses, an AI TV presenter who doesn‚Äôt exist, and an Ohio lawmaker who wants to stop people from marrying their chatbot.

Also, we learn how Geoffrey Hinton and Steve Wozniak have teamed up with the unlikely coupling of will.i.am and Steve Bannon to pull the brakes on ‚Äúsuper-intelligence.‚Äù

Meanwhile, Graham wonders if you should really trust an AI browser with your passwords, or your credit card, or, frankly, anything at all, and Mark reveals what AGI really means ‚Äì and how close we are to reaching it.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
