Twitter is in chaos.

The company has kicked out thousands of its engineers (as well as thousands of the contractors responsible for battling misinformation and harmful content.)

Meanwhile Twitter‚Äôs CISO and head of Trust & Safety both quit, both the chief privacy and compliance officers suddenly departed, alongside other top executives inside the company.

And what‚Äôs Twitter‚Äôs new owner doing?

Elon Musk is [scaring off advertisers](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/11/14/eli-lilly-twitter "Link to advisory.com article") with his bizarre behaviour, as decisions he made allowed pranksters to [impersonate big brands](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/technology/twitter-blue-fake-accounts.html "Link to NY Times") and post tweets that did untold damage to business‚Äôs reputation and erased billions of dollars from their market cap.

We talked about some of the problems at Twitter a couple of weeks ago, on the [‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast](https://www.smashingsecurity.com/296). Little did we know that things were going to go from bad to worse.

The latest screw-up at Twitter? An ill-considered initiative by Musk to [rid Twitter of ‚Äúbloatware‚Äù](https://www.iflscience.com/elon-musk-turns-off-bloatware-services-and-now-twitter-users-cannot-log-in-66214 "Link to IFLScience") seemingly accidentally locked some users out of the site for a while, as SMS-based two-factor authentication was accidentally disabled.

It sounds like someone was ordered to rip some code out of Twitter, and they simply didn‚Äôt understand the complexity of Twitter‚Äôs system ‚Äì the gazillions of dependencies and consequences that just making one change can have on other parts of the site.

The only people likely to understand those links and dependencies between Twitter‚Äôs systems, and raise a warning of possible consequences, are most likely people that Twitter has already fired. If they even were still employed by the company, chances are that Twitter‚Äôs new boss wouldn‚Äôt listen to them.

So, what does this mean for you if you‚Äôre a Twitter user? Well, I‚Äôm a Twitter user‚Ä¶ and I find it worrying.

Because although most of what I do on Twitter is public, I have also had plenty private direct message (DM) conversations in the almost 15 years I‚Äôve been a user on the site.

I can‚Äôt remember everything I‚Äôve said in those conversations, or what people may have said back to me.

If Twitter is careless enough to break how 2FA works for some of its users a few days ago, what mistake might they make next? If Twitter‚Äôs security experts have either been fired, have quit, or ‚Äì presumably ‚Äì are wondering where they should go next, then just how safe is my data on Twitter?

It may be a remote possibility that Twitter will have a monumental security screw-up or suffer a hack that it simply doesn‚Äôt have the expertise to protect against, but it is a possibility. And it‚Äôs a possibility that seems more probable today than before Elon Musk bought the company.

There‚Äôs not anything I can do to make a chaotic Twitter safer. But I can reduce the potential risk to me, by deleting my DMs.

![Delete dm conversation](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/delete-dm-conversation.jpeg)

I don‚Äôt need all those old DM conversations, they can be erased. They *should* be erased.

It‚Äôs a laborious process (Twitter doesn‚Äôt give you an automated way of doing it), but I‚Äôd rather delete them one-by-one than one day find that they are in the hands of a hacker or a disgruntled Twitter employee who goes rogue.

PS. You know what‚Äôs really galling? Erasing your Twitter DMs *doesn‚Äôt actually stop* Twitter from [keeping a copy of your private messages unbeknownst to you](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/twitter-direct-messages/ "Link to TechCrunch article"), even if you one day completely close your account.

Some final thoughts:

1. Encourage your Twitter buddies to delete their DMs too, so ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù of the conversation are wiped.
2. Even if Twitter doesn‚Äôt delete them behind-the-scenes, if \*your\* account is breached the messages shouldn‚Äôt be readily accessible by a hacker.
3. If Twitter keeps your private messages even after you have requested they are deleted, is that potentially a (costly) GDPR violation?
4. If you want to keep a permanent record of your DMs (and your other Twitter activity) consider [downloading your Twitter archive](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive "Link to twitter knowledgebase article").
