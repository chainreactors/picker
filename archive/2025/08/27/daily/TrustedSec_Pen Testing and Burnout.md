It's that feeling of your nerves being stretched like sinew over mounting expectations and due dates. When your attention keeps an exhausted but stubborn focus on an ever-shifting goal because there is always one more attack to check, one more use-case to implement, or one more task added to the pile that, before you realize it, has already broken out of manageable control. But you ***have to do it***!

Coping mechanisms kick in as a redoubling of efforts is made. Perhaps caffeine becomes your lifeblood, nicotine your connection to capability, or another vice sustains your focus. Whatever it is, it provides short-term relief, but eventually that relief is so brief that it's almost non-existent. After all, the work must not only be finished, but be better than expected and quicker than anticipated.

That is, until you simply can't do it anymore. The mere thought of getting out of bed to push harder or to "just muscle through it" is enough to cause a physical and emotional response. You've...***burned out*** (and probably look as well adjusted as Charlie Jones from Coraline). In this blog, I provide some tips, guidance, and suggestions for testers and companies to help manage and prevent burnout.

But before we dive into things, it should be mentioned that TrustedSec is by no means a mental health organization. So, it is highly advised for anyone in need of immediate help to seek professional medical support. As penetration testers, our clients seek out our professional support to address their concerns, and I argue that seeking mental health support is no different. Everyone who pursues support becomes an advocate for their own wellbeing and future. It's true that securing a therapist can be its own challenge, but for those in need of help, free support lines such as <https://988lifeline.org/>, <https://www.crisistextline.org/>, and others provide voice and text support options.

## What is it? Why isÂ it?

It's something we all may feel at one time or another. Offensive security testing can be a high-stress, high-reward career: we operate under multiple customer deadlines, deliver high-value results, and contribute to or constantly learn from the offensive and defensive community. Combined, these factors can lead to performance paralysis through a snowballing effect, resulting in more tasks landing on your plate in a short timeframe.

But what is ***burnout***? Listed as QD-85 in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11 Version 11)1, the World Health Organization (WHO) classifies burnout as "a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed but that is not considered a mental disorder", with the following characteristics:

* Feeling of energy depletion or exhaustion
* Increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job
* A se...
