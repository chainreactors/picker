It's time once again to pay our respects to the once-famous cybersecurity solutions whose usefulness died in the past year. The cybercriminal world collectively mourns the loss of these solutions and the easy access they provide to victim organizations. These solutions, though celebrated in their prime, succumbed to the twin forces of time and advancing threats. Much like a tribute to celebrities lost in the past year, this article will look back at a few of cybersecurity's brightest stars that went dark in the past year.

## **1. Legacy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

**Cause of Death:** Compromised by sophisticated phishing, man-in-the-middle (MitM), SIM-swapping, and MFA prompt bombing attacks.

The superstar of access security for more than twenty years, legacy MFA solutions enjoyed broad adoption followed by almost-universal responsibility for cybersecurity failures leading to successful ransomware attacks. These outdated solutions relied heavily on SMS or email-based codes often sent in unencrypted plain text. Their vulnerability to phishing, SIM swapping, and MitM attacks grew glaringly apparent in 2024, leaving their users in a state of near-defenselessness in the face of [Generative AI-based attacks](https://www.tokenring.com/blog/identity-security-gen-ai).

The Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency [CISA], part of the Department of Homeland Security, stated that 90% of successful phishing attacks started with phishing. Legacy MFA's inherent weakness is that it relies on users who are well-meaning but no match for modern attack techniques.

Legacy MFA was fan-favorite and broadly deployed, but it is the most significant vulnerability in most organizations. Jen Easterly, the director of CISA, captured the urgency of evolving beyond outdated solutions, "…make no mistake, any form of MFA is better than no MFA. But recent attacks make it clear: legacy MFA is no match for modern threats."

**The Role of FIDO2 and Phishing-Resistant Authentication:** In place of legacy MFA, [phishing-resistant, FIDO2-compliant solutions](https://www.tokenring.com/learn/phishing-resistant-mfa) have emerged as the gold standard for authentication, driving the industry toward a passwordless future. By leveraging public key cryptography, FIDO2 eliminates shared secrets like passwords, making phishing and replay attacks nearly impossible. Its reliance on hardware security keys and biometrics provides unparalleled security while maintaining simplicity for end users. Biometric authentication greatly enhances security by ensuring that only authorized users can gain network access. It also improves the user experience by removing the need to remember and enter passwords and OTPs.

## **2. Signature-Based Antivirus**

**Cause of Death:** Overwhelmed by polymorphic malware and fileless attacks.

The faithful companion of early internet users, signature-based antivirus software, finally bowed out in 2024. Its reliance on known malware signatures proved inadequate against today's threats, which mutate faster than databases can be updated. Polymorphic malware, fileless attacks, and AI-driven threats exploited its inability to adapt dynamically.

Replacing it are advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) platforms that harness machine learning to detect unusual behavior. Signature-based antivirus didn't just lose its battle against attackers; it lost relevance in a world demanding predictive security.

**A Look at What's Next:** Modern EDR and XDR platforms combine heuristic analysis, AI-driven insights, and real-time monitoring. These systems not only detect and block threats but also offer predictive capabilities to anticipate and neutralize potential attacks before they manifest, setting a new standard for endpoint security. Unlike their signature-based predecessors, EDR and XDR platforms rely on behavioral analysis to identify unusual activity, such as lateral movement within a network or abnormal file execution patterns. These platforms utilize AI and machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data and adapt to the changing threat landscape. These solutions also integrate seamlessly with other tools, including threat intelligence feeds and incident response platforms. They offer a unified view of an organization's security posture by correlating data across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments.

## **3. Legacy VPNs**

**Cause of Death:** Replaced by zero-trust network access (ZTNA).

The venerable VPN, once a cornerstone of secure remote access, saw its relevance take its last breaths in 2024. Performance bottlenecks and vulnerabilities to lateral movement attacks made them unacceptable for the modern era of cybersecurity.

ZTNA solutions, with their ability to enforce granular, identity-based access policies, are now the better alternative. The shift marked the end of trusting once and accessing all, a concept that outlived its usefulness in the face of persistent threats.
