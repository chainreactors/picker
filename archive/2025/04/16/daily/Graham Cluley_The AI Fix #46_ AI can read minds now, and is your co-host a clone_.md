In episode 46 of The AI Fix, China trolls US tariffs, a microscopic pogoing flea-bot makes a tiny leap forward for robotics, Google unveils the Agent2Agent protocol, a robot dog is so cute it ruins Graham‚Äôs entire day, and Europe commits ‚Ç¨20 billion and all of its buzzwords to five moonshot AI gigafactories.

Graham brings his clone to work for a game of ‚ÄúCluley or Cloney‚Äù, and Mark introduces Graham to a mind-reading technology that could transform the lives of people with serious neurological disorders.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
