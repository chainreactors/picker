We need your help to make [a common-sense bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/tell-governor-newsom-make-it-easier-use-your-privacy-rights) into California law. Despite the fact that California has one of the nation’s most comprehensive data privacy laws, it’s not always easy for people to exercise those privacy rights. A.B. 566 intends to make it easy by directing browsers to give all their users the option to tell companies they don’t want personal information that’s collected about them on the internet to be sold or shared. Now, we just need Governor Gavin Newsom to sign it into law by October 13, 2025, and this toolkit will help us put on the pressure. Tweet at Gov. Gavin Newsom and help us get A.B. 566 signed into law!

First, pick your platform of choice. Reach Gov. Newsom at any of his social media handles:

* X: [@CAgovernor](https://x.com/CAgovernor)
* Bluesky: [@governor.ca.gov](https://bsky.app/profile/governor.ca.gov)
* TikTok: [@cagovernor](https://www.tiktok.com/%40cagovernor?lang=en)
* Facebook: [@CAgovernor](https://www.facebook.com/CAgovernor)

Then, pick a message that resonates with you. Or, feel free to remix!

**Sample Posts**

* It should be easy for Californians to exercise our rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, but major internet browser companies are making it difficult for us to do that. @CAgovernor, sign AB 566 and give power to the consumers to protect their privacy!
* We are living in a time of mass surveil...
