# IPPrint C2

### TL;DR

A Proof-of-Concept for using Microsoft Windows printers for persistence / command and control via Internet Printing.

Printing systems are an often overlooked target for attackers looking to establish command and control (C2) channels on a victim's network. An attacker can abuse the operating system's printing system to add and remove printers and create and manipulate printing jobs to achieve full C2 communication. We have developed a complete proof of concept of such a solution that we have successfully tested in real-world red teaming exercises. By understanding the approach taken in this specific abuse of printing systems, we can take steps to secure them and prevent them from being exploited by malicious actors.
