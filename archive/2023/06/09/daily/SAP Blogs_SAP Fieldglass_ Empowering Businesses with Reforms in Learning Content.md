Exciting changes to SAP Fieldglass learning offerings have been launched, empowering businesses to harness the application's full potential. In this blog post, we’ll explore the wealth of content available on Learning.sap.com and summarise what these changes mean for you.

A little over a year ago, I challenged our leadership on how we could better support SAP Fieldglass customers and partners in their use of Learning Hub. Historically, Fieldglass was founded (like most start-ups) on providing free educational content. Whilst that approach was never fully scalable, we weren’t seeing the desired consumption levels in a chargeable content model compared to other products in the SAP family.

The SAP Fieldglass Product Learning team, alongside supportive business stakeholders, proposed and successfully secured SAP Fieldglass content as the first of its kind within the Intelligent Spend and Business Network (ISBN) group to be migrated onto Learning.sap.com, reinstating much of our learning content as free of charge and refocusing our commitment to deliver value.

But we didn’t stop there – listening to feedback from customers and partners, we’ve revamped and specialised our previous singular learning path into two distinct Learning Journeys; [Contingent Workforce Management](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/discovering-sap-fieldglass-contingent-workforce-management?url_id=text-blogs-LSCPLCoE-WorkforceMgmt) and [Services Procurement](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/discovering-sap-fieldglass-services-procurement?url_id=text-blogs-LSCPLCoE-ServicesProcurement). We’ve continued to enhance our role-based approach with Transactional focused and Administrative based content whilst now catering to our customer’s unique adoption journey.

Learning.sap.com creates opportunities through learning and development for all, offering various educational content in the form of courses, tutorials, documentation, and community engagement. It provides learner access to a wealth of resources specifically tailored to enhance their understanding and utilisation of SAP Fieldglass, among other key SAP products.

But what about those looking for a premium digital experience providing best-in-class certified status? Learning Hub is your gateway to accessing an expanding list of reimagined premium services. Subscribers can seamlessly access exclusive self-paced guided learning, hands-on practice systems and certification, all in one place.

SAP Fieldglass offers organisations the agility and control required to navigate the complexities of the modern workforce. Learning.sap.com plays a pivotal role in enabling users to maximise the benefits of SAP Fieldglass by providing comprehensive training, resources, and a vibrant community to learn, share, and grow. Whether you’re an administrator, program management office, or business user, the content available on learning.sap.com empowers you to optimise your workforce management practices in today's dynamic business environment.

*Fill the gap through upskilling and enjoy SAP’s learning offerings on the [SAP Learning site](https://learning.sap.com/?url_id=text-blogs-LSCPLCoE-LSC "https://learning.sap.com/?url_id=text-blogs-LSCPLCoE-LSC"). This article is created and brought to you by SAP Product Learning CoE experts!*
