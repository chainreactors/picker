Hi all,

A list of CVEâ€™s in a bunch of IoT devices that never made it to the general public through other means, but have either
been fixed, or never will be fixed, since they are a couple of years old.
```

> ```
> [Suggested description]
> An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
> By sending a specific request to the webserver, it is possible to
> enable the telnet interface on the device. The telnet interface can
> then be used to obtain access to the device with root privileges and a
> default password. This default telnet password is the same across all
> Siime Eye devices.
> In order for the attack to be exploited, an attacker must be physically
> close in order to connect to the device's Wi-Fi access point.

> ------------------------------------------
>
> [Additional Information]
> The vulnerability was first discovered by Pentest Partners, later on it was also discovered by Qbit as the issues
> remain unaddressed by the vendor.

Use CVE-2020-11915.
```

Use CVE-2020-11916.
```

> ```
> [Suggested description]
> An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
> It uses a default SSID value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
> discover the physical locations of many Siime Eye devices, violating the
> privacy of users who do not wish to disclose their ownership of this type of device.
> (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)
>
> ------------------------------------------
>
> [Additional Information]
> The access point is only detectable when the device is turned on. As the device is turned on for limited times less
> devices are detected via Wigle then one might expect.
>
> Wigle.net is a site which maps SSIDs to physical locations. Using this
> site, it is possible to filter on specific SSIDs. When a filter is
> applied to find the default SSID of the Siime Eye, it is possible to
> find several devices across the globe. The map shown on wigle shows an
> approximate physical location for the device and hence makes physical
> or physical proximity attacks more likely.
>
> In addition it violates the user's privacy as everyone on the internet
> is capable of detecting where the devices are being used.

Use CVE-2020-11917.
