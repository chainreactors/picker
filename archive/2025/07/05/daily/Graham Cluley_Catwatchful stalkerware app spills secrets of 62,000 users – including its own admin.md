Another scummy stalkerware app has spilled its guts, revealing the details of its 62,000 users ‚Äì and data from thousands of victims‚Äô infected devices.

Security researcher Eric Daigle [found a vulnerability](https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/taking-over-60k-spyware-user-accounts/ "Link to Eric Daigle's blog post") in the Android spyware app Catwatchful, which allows non-consensual surveillance of others. Users‚Äô email addresses and plaintext passwords have been revealed as a result, alongside detals of compromised devices mostly located in Latin America, dating back as far as 2018.

Irony of ironies‚Ä¶ one of those whose personal details have been breached appears to be the administrator of Catwatchful, who *TechCrunch* [names as Omar Soca Charcov](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/ "LInk to Techcrunch article").

Despite the breach, Catwatchful remains operational ‚Äì as Google hasn‚Äôt yet confirmed any violations of its terms of service.

If you have an Android and are worried Catwatchful might secretly be on your phone, you can detect it: just dial `543210` and then press the call button. If Catwatchful is installed, the app should appear on your screen.
