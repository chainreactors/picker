## Picture This

A convicted murderer, sentenced to death, stands on the brink of his final moments. The air is thick with tension, the clock ticks ominously, and the atmosphere in the room feels like something out of a Hitchcock movie. His last words? “Let’s do it.”

Sounds like the opening scene of a true-crime Netflix documentary, right?

Well, believe it or not, this is the bizarre origin story behind Nike’s iconic "Just Do It" slogan—a phrase that has since transcended billboards and sneakers to become a global mantra for motivation, empowerment, and let’s face it, guilt-tripping us into hitting the gym.

![Yes, that was me](https://hackernoon.imgix.net/images/null-zf332s3.gif.webp?auto=format&fit=max&w=1080)

## Wait... What?

Yeah, it sounds nuts, I know. But buckle up, because we’re about to dive into how a few chilling words muttered by a man on death row were rebranded by one of the world’s biggest companies, turning something grim into a goldmine for fitness, fashion, and motivation enthusiasts everywhere.

So, grab your Nikes, and let’s run through the wild, unconventional journey of how this happened.

Spoiler alert: It’s a marketing masterclass in making magic from madness.

## The Man Behind the Madness

So, who exactly was this guy with a Hitchcockian stare?

Meet Gary Gilmore. He wasn’t exactly the kind of guy you’d expect to inspire a motivational slogan. In the late 1970s, Gilmore was convicted of two cold-blooded murders in Utah and became the first person executed in the United States after a 10-year moratorium on the death penalty.

Gilmore’s last words were nothing particularly poetic — “Let’s do it” —a seemingly unremarkable statement that could just as easily have been uttered before a high school basketball game as before his execution by firing squad.

But here’s where the story takes a sharp left turn into the world of advertising genius.

## Enter “Nike” - The Brand

Fast forward to the late '80s. Nike wasn’t yet the athletic giant we know today. Sure, they were doing okay, but they needed something big, something that would solidify their brand in the annals of sports culture. They had the gear, the athletes, and some great shoes, but they needed a slogan, a rallying cry that would make people sit up, pay attention, and—most importantly—*buy*.

Enter advertising legend [Dan Wieden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Wieden?ref=hackernoon.com). Yep, the guy behind the magic. While brainstorming ideas, Wieden recalled Gilmore’s eerie last words. He tweaked them slightly, turning “Let’s do it” into “Just Do It.” A minor change, sure, but it made all the difference.

Now, I know what you’re thinking—why on earth would Nike want to associate their brand with a convicted killer’s final words?

Isn’t that, well, *super dark*?

But here’s the thing about marketing (and life, if we’re being philosophical here): sometimes, it’s the bold, unexpected risks that lead to the greatest rewards.

## The Campaign That Changed It All

When Nike unveiled their "Just Do It" campaign in 1988, it was an instant hit. The slogan wasn’t just catchy; it struck a nerve with people. It was simple, direct, and, dare I say, a little cheeky. But more than that, it tapped into a universal feeling—whether you were a seasoned marathoner or someone just trying to muster the motivation to get off the couch and go for a walk.

The brilliance behind “Just Do It” wasn’t just about fitness—it was about life. It was a call to action, a no-excuses mantra that could apply to anything. Having second thoughts about starting that new business? Just do it. Too tired to work out? Just do it. Scared of failing? Well... you get the idea.

Nike’s bold move didn’t just help them sell shoes. It cemented their position as a cultural juggernaut. They weren’t just about athletics anymore—they were about attitude, resilience, and chasing after your dreams, no matter how far out of reach they seemed.

Pop culture was quick to catch on. The slogan appeared everywhere, from motivational posters to music videos to the conversations of everyday people. Suddenly, "Just Do It" wasn’t just an ad—it was a way of life.

## Anything Can Be Transformed into Gold — If You Dare

Now, let’s pause for a second and think about what Nike did here. They took something as morbid and unsettling as the last words of a convicted killer and, with a little creativity, turned it into one of the most successful marketing campaigns of all time. If that doesn’t show the power of daring to experiment and think outside the box, I don’t know what does.

The point is, inspiration can come from the most unexpected places, and sometimes, the riskiest ideas yield the biggest rewards. Of course, you’ve got to handle it with care—turning something dark into something motivating without being tone-deaf is a delicate dance, to say the least.

But as Nike proved, if you’re bold enough to take that leap, the sky's the limit.

## Wrapping It Up: From Execution to Excellence

**So, what’s the lesson here?**

***Simple - Don't hold back.***

In the world of marketing—or heck, in life—it’s often the ideas that seem the craziest, the most unconventional, that end up being the game-changers. Nike could have easily played it safe with a generic slogan, but instead, they took a bold risk that paid off in ways no one could have anticipated.

And what’s the result?

Next time you're brainstorming an idea or hesitating to pursue something daring, remember Gary Gilmore's infamous words—or, better yet, Nike’s version: ***Just Do It***.

Sure, maybe your idea won’t be inspired by something quite as bizarre, but the message remains the same. When it comes to creativity and success, sometimes, you’ve just gotta take the leap and see where it lands.

And who knows? You might just stumble upon the next big thing.

So, until then-
