What is slushygate and how does it link to sextortion in the States? What is the most impersonated brand when it comes to delivering phishing emails? And what the flip is nano-targeting?

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by fan favourite Maria Varmazis.

No contortionists were hurt during the making of this episode.
