The dark web is a collective name for a variety of websites and marketplaces that bring together individuals willing to engage in illicit or shady activities. Dark web forums contain ads for selling and buying stolen data, offers to code malware and hack websites, posts seeking like-minded individuals to participate in attacks on companies, and many more.

Just as any other business, cybercrime needs labor. New team members to participate in cyberattacks and other illegal activities are recruited right where the business is done – on the dark web. We reviewed job ads and resumes that were posted on 155 dark web forums from January 2020 through June 2022 and analyzed those containing information about a long-term engagement or a full-time job.

This post covers the peculiarities of this kind of employment, terms, candidate selection criteria, and compensation levels. Further information, along with an analysis of the most popular IT jobs on the dark web, can be found in the full version of the report.

## Key outcomes

Our analysis of the dark web job market found:

* The greatest number of ads were posted in March 2020, which was likely related to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing changes in the structure of the job market.
* The major dark web employers are hacker teams and APT groups looking for those capable of developing and spreading malware code, building and maintaining IT infrastructure, and so on.
* Job ads seeking developers are the most frequent ones, at 61% of the total.
* Developers also topped the list of the best-paid dark web IT jobs: the highest advertised monthly salary figure we saw in an ad for a developer was $20,000.
* The median levels of pay offered to IT professionals varied between $1,300 and $4,000.
* The highest median salary of $4,000 could be found in ads for reverse engineers.

## The dark web job market

Most dark web employers offer semi-legal and illegal jobs, but there are ads with potentially legal job offers that comply with national laws. An example is creating IT learning courses.

Sketchy employment arrangements can border on the illegal and sometimes go against the law. An example of a dubious job is selling questionable drugs for profit on fraudulent websites.

Dirty jobs are illegal and often present a criminal offense. An individual engaged in these can be prosecuted and jailed if caught. Fraudulent schemes or hacking websites, social network accounts and corporate IT infrastructure all qualify as dirty jobs.

Offers like that come from hacker groups, among others. Cybercrooks need a staff of professionals with specific skills to penetrate the infrastructure of an organization, steal confidential data, or encrypt the system for subsequent extortion.

People may have several reasons for going to a dark web site to look for a job. Many are drawn by expectations of easy money and large financial gain. Most times, this is only an illusion. Salaries offered on the dark web are seldom significantly higher than those you can earn legally. Moreover, the level of compensation depends on your experience, talent, and willingness to invest your energy into work. Nevertheless, unhappy with their pay, a substantial percentage of employees in the legitimate economy quit their jobs to find similar employment on the dark web market. Changes on the market, layoffs, and pay cuts, too, often prompt them to look for a job on cybercrime websites.

Other factors are a lack of certain candidate requirements, such as a higher education, military service record, absence of prior convictions, and so on. Legal age is the main requirements that many ads have in common. Dark web jobs look attractive to freelancers and remote workers because there is no office they have to show up in, and they can remain digital nomads. Candidates are attracted by a large degree of freedom offered on the dark web: you can take as many days off as you want, there is no dress code, and you are free to choose any schedule, tasks and scope of work.

Another reason why people look for a job on the dark web is poor awareness of possible consequences or a flippant attitude to those. Working with underground teams, let alone cybercrime groups, poses serious risks: members can be deanonymized and prosecuted, and even getting paid is not a guarantee.

## Dark web job market statistics

To analyze the state of the dark web job market in January 2020 through June 2022, we gathered statistics on messages that mentioned employment, posted on 155 dark web forums. Messages were selected from forum sections on any jobs, not necessarily those in IT.

A total of roughly 200,000 employment-related ads were posted on the dark web forums during the period in question. The largest number of these, or 41% of the total, were posted in 2020. Posting activity peaked in March 2020, possibly caused by a pandemic-related [income drop](https://www.bea.gov/news/2020/personal-income-and-outlays-march-2020) experienced by part of the population.

The impact of the pandemic was especially noticeable on the CIS markets.
