### **Talking about AI: Definitions**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) —** AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making and problem-solving. AI is the broadest concept in this field, encompassing various technologies and methodologies, including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning.

**Machine Learning (ML) —** ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that allow machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. ML is a specific approach within AI, emphasizing data-driven learning and improvement over time.

**Deep Learning (DL) —** Deep Learning is a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze and interpret complex data patterns. This advanced form of ML is particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, making it a crucial component of many AI applications.

**Large Language Models (LLM) —** LLMs are a type of AI model designed to understand and generate human-like text by being trained on extensive text datasets. These models are a specific application of Deep Learning, focusing on natural language processing tasks, and are integral to many modern AI-driven language applications.

**Generative AI (GenAI) —** GenAI refers to AI systems capable of creating new content, such as text, images, or music, based on the data they have been trained on. This technology often leverages LLMs and other Deep Learning techniques to produce original and creative outputs, showcasing the advanced capabilities of AI in content generation.

## **Overview: AI for Good and Bad**

Almost daily now we watch the hallowed milestone of the "Turing Test" slip farther and farther into an almost naïve irrelevance, as computer interfaces have evolved from being comparable to human language, to similar, to indistinguishable, to arguably superior [1].

The development of large language models (LLMs) began with natural language processing (NLP) advancements in the early 2000s, but the major breakthrough came with Ashish Vaswani's 2017 paper, "Attention is All You Need." This allowed for training larger models on vast datasets, greatly improving language understanding and generation.

Like any technology, LLMs are neutral and can be used by both attackers and defenders. The key question is, which side will benefit more, or more quickly?

Let's dive into that question in a bit more detail. This is but an excerpt of our coverage in the [Security Navigator 2025](https://www4.orangecyberdefense.com/security-navigator-25-thn2), but it covers some of the main points that should be relevant to everyone who works in a security- or technology context. If you want to read more on 'Prompt Injection' techniques or how AI is productively used in security technology I invite you to get the full report!

## **AI in defense operations**

* May improve general office productivity and communication
* May improve search, research and Open-Source Intelligence
* May enable efficient international and cross-cultural communications
* May assist with collation and summarization of diverse, unstructured text datasets
* May assist with documentation of security intelligence and event information
* May assist with analyzing potentially malicious emails and files
* May assist with identification of fraudulent, fake or deceptive text, image or video content.
* May assist with security testing functions like reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery.

**AI in one form or another has long been used in a variety of security technologies.**

**By way of example:**

* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Threat Detection.** Security vendor Darktrace, employs ML to autonomously detect and respond to threats in real-time by leveraging behavioral analysis and ML algorithms trained on historical data to flag suspicious deviations from normal activity.
* **Phishing Detection and Prevention.** ML models are used in products like Proofpoint and Microsoft Defender that identify and block phishing attacks utilizing ML algorithms to analyze email content, metadata, and user behavior to identify phishing attempts.
* **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).** EDR offerings like CrowdStrike Falcon leverage ML to identify unusual behavior and detect and mitigate cyber threats on endpoints.
* **Microsoft Copilot for Security.** Microsoft's AI-powered solution is designed to assist security professionals by streamlining threat detection, incident response, and risk management by leveraging generative AI, including OpenAI's GPT models.

## **AI in offensive operations**

* May improve general office productivity and communication for bad actors as well
* May improve search, research and Open-Source Intelligence
* May enable efficient international and cross-cultural communications
* May assist with collation and summarization of diverse, unstructured text datasets (like social media profiles for phishing/spear-phishing attacks)
* May assist with attack processes like reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery.
* May assist with the creation of believable text for cyber-attack methods like phishing, waterholing and malvertising.
* Can assist with the creation of fraudulent, fake or deceptive text, image or
* video content.
* May facilitate accidental data leakage or unauthorized data access
* May present a new, vulnerable and attractive attack surface.
