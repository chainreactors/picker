A customer portal allows businesses to interact with their customers in a more efficient and personalized manner. These portals can provide a wide range of features and capabilities, but there are a few critical ones that every business should consider when implementing a customer portal.

**User Authentication and Access Control**

One of the most important capabilities of a customer portal is the ability to authenticate and control access for different users. This includes not only the ability to create and manage user accounts, but also the ability to set permissions and roles that determine what each user can do within the portal and what gated information can be accessed.

**Digital Self-Services**

Another critical capability of a customer portal is the ability to provide self-service support. This includes providing users with access to frequently asked questions (FAQs), knowledge bases, and other resources that can help them find the answers they need. Additionally, a good customer portal will also allow users to create and track support tickets, as well as view their past interactions with the business.

**Personalization**

A customer portal should be able to provide personalized experiences for each user. This includes the ability to customize the layout, branding, and content of the portal based on the user's preferences and past interactions with the business. Personalization can also include features such as personalized product recommendations, targeted marketing campaigns, and personalized customer service and support interactions.

**Communication and Collaboration**

Effective communication and collaboration between the business and its customers is a critical capability of a customer portal. This includes the ability to send and receive messages, share documents, and collaborate on projects with customers. Additionally, a customer portal should also allow businesses to send targeted notifications and alerts to users based on their preferences and past interactions with the business.

**Analytics and Reporting**

Finally, a customer portal should provide businesses with the ability to collect and analyze data on customer interactions and behavior. This includes the ability to track user engagement and activity within the portal, as well as the ability to generate reports and insights on customer behavior and preferences. This data can be used to inform business decisions, such as product development, marketing, and customer service.
