“[Privacy First](https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms)” is a simple, powerful idea: seeing as so many of today’s technological problems are also *privacy* problems, why don’t we fix privacy first?

Whether you’re worried about kids’ mental health, or tech’s relationship to journalism, or spying by foreign adversaries, or reproductive rights, or AI deepfakes, or nonconsensual pornography, you’re worried about a problem rooted in the primitive, deplorable state of American privacy law.
