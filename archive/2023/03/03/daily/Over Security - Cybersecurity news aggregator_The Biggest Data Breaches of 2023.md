Similarly to what I have done in [2022](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/01/27/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-2022/) and [2021](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/17/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-2021/), I am collecting the main mega breaches (that is breaches with more than one million records stolen by the attackers and possibly leaked). The information is derived from the [cyber attacks timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/) that I published, normally, on a bi-weekly basis.

For the sake of readability, the size of the bubbles in the corresponding diagram are in logarithmic scale.
