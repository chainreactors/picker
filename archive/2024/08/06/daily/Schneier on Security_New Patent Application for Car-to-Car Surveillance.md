## New Patent Application for Car-to-Car Surveillance

Ford has a [new](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1143913_future-fords-might-detect-speeding-and-report-you-to-the-cops) [patent application](https://trea.com/information/systems-and-methods-for-detecting-speeding-violations/patentapplication/c4b2664e-cb75-4a81-a47d-3d1449623362) for a system where cars monitor each other’s speeds, and then report then to some central authority.

The patent mentions that it’s for law enforcement vehicles. Patrol cars that can measure another’s does not seem new to me. It’s a nice feature that it can be done without radar.

Now the technique would allow citizens cars to do the same weather that happens is more up to politicians than Ford.

Nobody likes speeders who kill other road users, but why do I feel

Some numbers for the USA might make this idea somewhat better understandable

All numbers for 2020 (USA, 331M inhabitants) [1]
Total number of traffic fatalities:

> 38,824

Speeding related:

> 11,258

Alcohol Impaired driving:

> 11,654

Unrestrained Passenger Vehicle Occupants
(ie, passenger does not wear safety belt):

> 10,893

Compare with EU (EU 27 448M inhabitants) [2]
Total number of traffic fatalities (2020):

> 18,800

So, traffic fatalities are a preventable death cause that could be improved.

” a system where cars monitor each other’s speeds, and then report then to some central authority.”
I took the unusual step of actually reading the patent claims and it’s pretty clear that the car doing the monitoring and reporting would be a police car. That is, not every car would be monitoring and reporting, but only police cars would.

Essentially it would turn police cars into mobile speed cameras.

More of the nanny state…. I think we already have enough surveillance in individuals in this country. Ford needs to work more on their quality control and possibly the autonomous cars or Hydrogen fuel cars and less on helping the gov. spying on people.

@ ALL,

Whilst I don’t doubt that the patent is what it says it is…

Patents by big companies are all to often “Market Control” for Monopolistic or Cartel reasons. In the case of start-ups it’s,

“Kill the competition.”

Or with bigger Corporates to “tax the competition” or “trade favours with the competition” over their patent portfolios.

So keep that in the back of your mind when walking down the,

“Show me the money path.”

But importantly if you want to get in on the “Patent Game” a piece of advice.

Most Western Nations/Federations have not just maxed out their “personal taxation” ability they are nolonger able to tax anything above small businesses as “Corporates are Off-Shore” in oh so many tax avoidance ways.

So where is a Government going to get the money to bribe voters with?

Well we’ve already seen swingeing cut backs on all but big corporate hand outs so society is already starting to collapse. We’ve seen this in various “social support” etc. As @JonKnowsKnothing has pointed out several times the “supposed benefits” remain, but are “means tested” beyond availability in various ways much the same as US health care at something like six times price of equivalent other nations healthcare, and with an effectiveness in many cases on par with third-world healthcare in outcomes.

So about the only thing left is to turn the population into low grade Crimnals, to raise money via “Fines and Confiscations”.

So anyone who thinks up a way to “automate criminalisation” which this patent clearly is, are preparing to make money off of “Fines and Confiscations”

Oh and when the “fines and Confiscations” well runs dry, and it will do, ask yourself,

“Where will they get the money next?”

Because that has the opportunity to be another gold mine for someone holding a patent or hundred as leverage.

But think carefully, primary patents on “methods” rarely pay as they are in effect “before their time” it’s secondary patents on “applications” where the primary patents have been applied to technology that is “in the market or about to be” where the money is to be made.

In the Grim Darkness of the Far Future, I imagine a rich model of everything an autonomous vehicle must consider as it navigates a route through the environment – lane markings, potholes, road debris, coefficient of friction, moose density, etc. It makes sense that vehicles would propose updates to the model based on observations. Think of V2V Waze. It might make sense to model vehicles also. Existing standards define ways for vehicles to share their position and velocity with other vehicles. It might be useful to share observations about third parties- truck X has a poorly secured load, sedan Y is driving erratically, etc.
