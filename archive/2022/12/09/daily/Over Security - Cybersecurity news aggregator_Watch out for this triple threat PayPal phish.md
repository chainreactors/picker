# Watch out for this triple threat PayPal phish

Posted: December 5, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

ZDNet reports an interesting form of PayPal scam [sent to one of their own writers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/watch-out-for-this-triple-pronged-paypal-phishing-and-fraud-scam/). The scam is a so-called “triple threat” phish, in that it gives the scammer three different ways to potentially collect some ill gotten gains from potential victims. The idea is that if one of the three tactics fails, there are two more waiting in the wings primed to take another swing at your digital wallet.

## A genuine (but bogus) money request

For this phish attempt, the scammers make use of legitimate services to make it all look a bit more convincing. Why bother to set up a fake PayPal website, when you can just send a genuine request for money on the site itself?

The twist here is that the money request, weighing in at $699.99, comes with a note attached which is written as though it’s from a PayPal employee. It’s worth noting that the message is not written particularly well, which may clue in more than a few people receiving it. On the other hand, urgent requests for payment sprinkled with fraud attempt references will make some folks smash that “send money” button. Here’s the message in question:

*“We have detected some fraudulently activities with your PayPal account. If you did not make this transaction, please call us as soon as possible at tool free number [removed] to cancel and claim a refund. If this is not the case, you will be charged $699.99 today. Within the automated deduction of the amount, this transaction will reflect on PayPal activity after 24 hours. Our service hours: (06:00 a.m. to 06.00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday)”*

This is not particularly sophisticated. If a scammer sends people a request for $600 and dresses it up with references to fraudulent transactions, then they’re going to lose a lot of victims via a final destination which presents recipients with “Send money” and “Cancel” buttons. Sure, some might hit “Send money” by accident. However, most of them will likely dodge this one.

## Ramping it up

This is where stages two and three of the scam come into play. According to the PayPal support rep that the ZDNet writer talked to, the phone numbers are there to try and trick people who don’t initially fall for the somewhat overt “please send me money via this “Send money” fake out. The numbers may direct callers to international lines, where complying with the “press X number to continue” instruction ends up billing the caller with expensive premium rates.

Additionally, further numbers put potential victims through to the scammers directly. At this point, it’s all about [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) personal details under the guise of a PayPal fraud department. They may try to extract payment information over the phone, or just grab as much personal data as possible for use at a later date.

## Keeping your PayPal safe

PayPal offers several forms of security to help keep accounts safe.
