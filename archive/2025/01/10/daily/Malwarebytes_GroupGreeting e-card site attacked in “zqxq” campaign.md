# GroupGreeting e-card site attacked in “zqxq” campaign

Posted: January 9, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

*This article was researched and written by Stefan Dasic, manager, research and response for [ThreatDown, powered by Malwarebytes](https://www.threatdown.com/)*

Malwarebytes recently uncovered a widespread cyberattack—referred to here as the “zqxq” campaign as it closely mirrors NDSW/NDSX-style malware behavior—that compromised GroupGreeting[.]com, a popular platform used by major enterprises to send digital greeting cards.

Upon learning of the attack, GroupGreeting quickly responded and resolved the threat.

This attack is part of a broader malicious campaign that takes advantage of trusted websites with high traffic, especially those that could experience a spike in visitors during busy seasons like the winter holidays. That includes greeting card websites, like GroupGreeting[.]com, that allow users to send group e-cards for birthdays, retirements, weddings, and, of course, holidays like Christmas and New Year’s.

According to public data, over 2,800 websites have been hit with similar malicious code. The seasonal increase in user interactions with greeting card sites provides ample opportunities for cybercriminals to quietly inject malware and target unsuspecting visitors.

## **Explaining the “zqxq” malware**

Understanding this cybercriminal campaign requires a little bit of understanding of the web. Online today, nearly every single modern webpage uses a programming language called JavaScript. JavaScript allows developers to make interactive webpages, but it can also be vulnerable to attacks, as cybercriminals can “inject” pieces of JavaScript into a website that are not approved by the site’s developers.

At the core of this breach is an obfuscated JavaScript snippet designed to blend in with legitimate site files. Hidden within themes, plugins, or other critical scripts, the malicious code uses scrambled variables (e.g., zqxq) and custom functions (HttpClient, rand, token) to evade detection and hamper analysis.

Despite its complexity, the malware performs some very typical functions seen in large-scale JavaScript injection campaigns:

* **Token generation and redirection**. Generates random tokens (rand() + rand()) for queries or URLs, a technique often used in Traffic Direction Systems (TDS) to disguise malicious links.

* **Conditional checks and evasion**. References properties in navigator, document, window, or screen to determine if the user has visited before, or to avoid re-infecting the same machine. This helps keep the campaign under the radar by reducing repeated alerts.

* **Remote payload retrieval**. Uses an XMLHttpRequest (labeled as HttpClient in the code) to silently fetch further malicious scripts or to redirect visitors to exploit kits, [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) sites, or other malicious destinations.

## **Overlap with NDSW/NDSX and TDS Parrot campaigns**

Though Malwarebytes recently discovered the attack on GroupGreeting[.]com, the malware campaign bears similarities to another malware injection campaign that is referred to as bo...
