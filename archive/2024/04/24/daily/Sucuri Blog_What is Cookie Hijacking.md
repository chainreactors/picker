**Cookie hijacking** involves unauthorized access to [cookies](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/01/what-are-cookies-a-short-guide-to-managing-your-online-privacy.html), which are small pieces of data stored on your browser by websites you visit. Cookies often contain sensitive information, including session tokens that authenticate users to a web application. By hijacking these cookies, attackers can impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to private accounts and sensitive data.

Given the potential risks associated with these attacks, it’s important to understand what cookie hijacking is, how it occurs, and the steps you can take to protect yourself and your website against it.

So, let’s dive in!

## What is cookie hijacking?

Cookie hijacking, sometimes also referred to as session hijacking or cookie theft, occurs when an attacker gains access to a user’s cookies and, by extension, their authenticated session. This access allows the attacker to impersonate the user on various websites or web applications, potentially leading to unauthorized activities and data breaches.

## How attackers hijack cookies

Cookie hijacking can pose a significant threat to both your website and personal security, directly impacting user trust and the integrity of site operations or even affecting your personal life.

Here’s a breakdown of the primary techniques used to hijack cookies and how they can affect your website.

### Malware Infection

Malware, particularly trojans and spyware, can be used to hijack cookies by infecting user devices or even server infrastructure.

#### Man-in-the-browser attack:

This malware modifies browser actions to intercept and transmit cookie data to the attacker. Website administrators should encourage users to use reputable anti-malware tools and keep their browsers updated to fend off such attacks.

Installing add-ons from untrustworthy sources is one of the most common ways that this can be added to a web browser.

#### Trojans and keyloggers:

Trojans and keyloggers are known to capture keystrokes and other input before it is encrypted by the browser, sending cookie data directly to the attacker. Promoting good security practices, such as avoiding downloads from unknown sources and using comprehensive security software, can help protect users.

Installing software or opening files from untrustworthy sources is the most common infection vector.

#### Email attachments and phishing:

Cookie hijacking is especially problematic if you are a public figure or a public facing entity, as it may make you the subject of targeted phishing attacks. Let’s go over an example:

Imagine you constantly receive B2B emails from other businesses; it’s quite common for this scenario to include back and forth conversations or file attachments that include contracts or agreements. One day you receive a contact from a partner and the email includes a file to go over the “details” of the partnership, but you open the file to discover it contains no details whatsoever. Instead, it contains malware that gets triggered when you open the file and the malware sends all the cookies your browser had stored from sessions you had logged in on several websites, effectively giving control over your accounts to the attackers.

There are many steps that can be taken to properly mitigate such a scenario, but the two most important ones are to use an up-to-date antivirus solution and do not open attachments from contacts you do not trust and cannot verify the identity of.

### Exploitation of vulnerabilities

Web vulnerabilities provide another vector through which attackers can then access cookies. Two common vulnerabilities are cross-site scripting (XSS) and buffer overflows.

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
