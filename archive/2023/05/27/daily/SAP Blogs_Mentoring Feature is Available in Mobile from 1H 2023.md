The SAP SuccessFactors Mobile Mentoring feature enables employees to accelerate their personal development throughout a career journey. With mobile devices at hand, users can easily update activity lists on the go rather than relying on a computer to do their job. Whether being a mentor or mentee, they can access mentoring information and complete relevant tasks more efficiently thanks to a streamlined user experience.

Our Mobile Mentoring feature was requested with over 30 votes from our customers so w invested in this feature to deliver rich experiences in the June 2023 release.

These're a few typical things users can do in Mobile Mentoring:

* Explore recommended mentoring programs and mentors.

* Join mentoring programs as a mentor or mentee as recommended.

* Contact mentors and mentees by phone or email.

* (For mentees) Submit mentoring requests to preferred mentors, cancel requests, or end mentoring relationships.

* (For mentors) Accept mentoring requests or decline them with or without comments.

* Check their progress in mentoring programs and the status of mentoring relationships.

* Edit mentoring preferences as necessary.

Text replacement at the program level is also supported in Mobile Mentoring.

**How It Works**

Users log in to the SAP SuccessFactors Mobile app and access the Mentoring feature:
