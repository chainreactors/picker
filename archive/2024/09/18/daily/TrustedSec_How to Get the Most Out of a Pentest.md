**TL;DR**

1. Define the goal of an assessment.
2. Take time to choose the right assessment type.
3. The more detail you give about an asset, the better quality your report will be.
4. Select the right environment for the assessment.
5. Consider the timing for performing the assessment.
6. Communicate internally and make sure everyone is up to speed.
7. Do more than remediate findings—use findings to help remediate other areas of an environment.
8. Fix low-severity issues.
9. Ask questions and get feedback.
10. Make sure to change things up once and a while.
11. These are all just suggestions; do as you please.

There are many types of penetration tests and security assessments. Although most of the suggestions below apply to a variety of tests, I am focusing specifically on the following: External and Internal Penetration Tests, and Black-Box, White-Box, Grey-Box, and Hybrid (Source-Assisted Grey-Box) Application Assessments.

## Define your goals

It is important to know why an assessment is being performed. Is it required to pass an audit? Do new features or functionality need to be reviewed? Maybe assessments are part of an overall security posture and are being used to measure improvement. Knowing the goals for an assessment will help you gauge whether a test was successful and help the penetration tester know where to focus efforts.

## Choose the right type of assessment

Once you understand the goals of an assessment, you will be able to select the type of assessment needed to achieve those goals. Sometimes, multiple assessments are needed to cover all sections of a network or application. Based on the budget and type of asset being assessed, you can narrow options down to a few types of assessments.

If you are still unsure which assessment to select, make sure each assessment can achieve the desired goals and base the decision on the differences between each assessment. For each difference, you should be able to perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine the best overall choice. Keep in mind that an assessment that is a good fit for one asset might not be the same for another. Each assessment will be different, and taking time to select the best assessment type can prove beneficial down the road. Of course, if a decision is still not obvious, there is usually an account manager that can make some recommendations.

## Give more detail to get the most out of a report

In most cases, each type of assessment comes with its own set of pre-defined rules, including a time constraint. The more information you can provide to a penetration tester about an asset, the more time can be spent finding security issues. This info...
