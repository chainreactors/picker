After the corresponding cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/10/12/1-15-september-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/10/28/16-30-september-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of September 2022 where I have collected and analyzed 281 events, a lower value than August, but equally considerable if compared with the average of the last 12 months, an additional proof that this period is quite complicated (and not only from a threat landscape standpoint)

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart with a percentage stable around 80% (80.1%), despite in slight decrease compared to **82.4%** of August. The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** experienced a growth to **9.6%** from **6.5%** of the previous month. **Hacktivism** showed a light decrease to **5%** from **6.2%** similarly events motivated by **Cyber Warfare** got a tiny **2.1%** from **2.6%**.

**Malware** is steadily on top of the **Attack Techniques**, but its percentage dropped to **31.7%**from **38.9%** of August, ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers** with **17.4%** from **14.7%** and (again) **Vulnerabilities**(**8.5%** vs **5.6%**of August) and **Targeted Attacks** that jump to **7.8%** from **4.6%**).

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by attacks against multiple targets with **19.6%**, close to **21.9%** of August, ahead of **Governments** (**12.8%**, slightly up from **11.8%**) and **Healthcare**, the privileged target of ransomware attacks (**11.4%**).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/September-2022-Statistics-IG-R.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
