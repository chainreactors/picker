# SoS - State of the Space 2025,5

## We're going somewhere, and we want you to come with us

Posted by ceres-c

Hello, it’s about time we give you an update on what we’ve been up to in the
past few months.

## Services

We did a lot of infrastructure work in the last few months, and we have a lot
of services running now. Here’s a brief list of what we have:

* **Google Workspace** Every member of the space now has a @muhack.org email
  address that can be used to access all Google Workspace services, as well as
  all muhack-related services. See [here](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/MuHack_Account)
  the policies.
* **SSO** Through the Google Workspace account (and a KeyCloak instance),
  you can now log in to all our services with a single account. This can also
  be used with any future project built at the space, just let the sysadmins
  know if you need it.
* **Wiki** We finally have a wiki! It’s available at
  [wiki.muhack.org](https://wiki.muhack.org) and it’s meant to be a place where
  we can document our projects, share knowledge, and keep track of everything
  we do. It’s still a work in progress, but please feel free to contribute!

  On the sidebar you can find links to the most important pages.
* **VPN** We have a Tailscale VPN to access the internal network from anywhere,
  especially the services running on servers located in the space. See
  [here](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/Tailscale_VPN) for more details.
* **Servers** There are now 2 servers running in the space, both in a Proxmox
  cluster. [One](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/CPU_Server) is more focused on
  CPU-intensive tasks, while [the other](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/GPU_Server)
  has a couple of GPUs for AI and stuff. One of these GPUs has been donated
  by NVIDIA, and we are very grateful for that.
* **Status monitor** There is a status monitor website available at
  [status.muhack.org](https://status.muhack.org) that shows the status of all
  our services. See the [wiki page](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/Status_monitor)
  for more details.
* **Open WebUI** We have an Open WebUI [instance](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/Open_WebUI)
  to play around with our local AI models.
* **Much more** Take a look at the [whitepages](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/Whitepages)
  on the wiki to see a complete list of all the services we have running
  and how to access them.

## Projects

Some of the projects we started are moving forward, like the electronic
parts inventory: all the SMD components are now in our partsbox inventory
(thanks again to Jan for the free organization account). We still need to find
a way to organize the through-hole components, but we have a
[plan for that too](wiki.muhack.org/view/Electronics_part_storage).

## Wishlist

We have a [wishlist](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/Wishlist) for things we need
to improve the space and the projects we’re working on. If you have any of
those things lying around and you’d like to donate them, please let us know!

## Tshirts

We have a new t-shirt design, and we’re going to print them soon. Take a look
on the [wiki](https://wiki.muhack.org/view/T-Shirt) for more details. Thanks,
Mattia!

## Failed ideas

Well, it seems that we’re not going to have a **bank account** anytime soon, as
the Italian government really hates small associations… We’d have to pay
**100€** a year just to have a bank account, and honestly we have better ways
to use that money. We’ll see if we can find some funds to cover the costs next
year.

## Conclusion

We still have a lot of work to do, but we’re making progress and we’re
excited about the future of the space. The infrastructure is getting there,
and we’re looking forward to having more members join us and contribute to the
projects we’re working on :)
