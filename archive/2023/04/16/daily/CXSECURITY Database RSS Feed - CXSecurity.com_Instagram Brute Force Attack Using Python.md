With this script, you can easily perform an Instagram Brute Force attack using Python
If you notice that Instagram has less than 6 passwords, it will always accept your password input
If you ask me "is it vulnerable?" I totally said no, I think the Instagram developer was very smart to create this login feature. So when the input is more than six characters, the login page will process it to check if the password is correct or not. And if you enter the wrong password three or five times, we have to wait a few minutes to re-enter it.
No, we see that if we can enter passwords under six characters, we can do this over and over and over as many times as we want without waiting a few minutes. This is a big reason why this script was created üòè
