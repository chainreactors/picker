Europol and law enforcement agencies from several countries have seized the servers and websites of [iSpoof](http://web.archive.org/web/20220820111737/https%3A//ispoof.cc/), a service that allowed users to make calls and send SMS messages using spoofed identities.

The service launched in December 2020 and advertised itself as a way for users to protect their phone numbers and identities online, but Europol said that iSpoof was widely abused for fraud as it allowed cybercrime gangs to pose as banks and other financial organizations.

An investigation into iSpoof began in 2021 after Dutch Police identified the service during one of its fraud investigations. [Dutch Police said](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2022/november/23/03-grote-spoofingdienst-uit-de-lucht-gehaald-door-internationale-samenwerking.html) they linked the service to a web host in Almere, where they deployed a wiretap that allowed them to map the site's reach and learn the identities of its registered users and administrators.

Officials said iSpoof had more than 59,000 registered users before it was taken down this month.

One hundred forty-two suspects were detained throughout the month of November, with more than 100 individuals detained in the UK alone, including iSpoof's administrators, [the UK Met Police said](https://news.met.police.uk/news/more-than-100-arrests-in-uks-biggest-ever-fraud-operation-457840).

[Europol said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/action-against-criminal-website-offered-%E2%80%98spoofing%E2%80%99-services-to-fraudsters-142-arrests) iSpoof was being used to place more than one million spoofed calls each month, that administrators made more than €3.7 million, and that the service has been linked to fraud and losses of over €115 million worldwide.

UK police said they plan to notify all UK users who received spoofed calls made through iSpoof.

### Breaches and hacks

**EU Parliament DDoS attack:** The EU Parliament said its servers were subject to a DDoS attack hours after they proclaimed the Russian government as a [sponsor of terrorism](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-lawmakers-name-russia-a-state-sponsor-of-terror/a-63818422). A pro-Kremlin hacktivist group took credit for the attack, [according to Roberta Metsola](https://twitter.com/EP_President/status/1595443471518777345), President of the EU Parliament. The agency's website resumed operations after two hours.

**Guadeloupe cyberattack:** In a [message](http://web.archive.org/web/20221123095137/https%3A//www.regionguadeloupe.fr/accueil/) posted on its official website, the government of the Caribbean island Guadeloupe, a French overseas region, said it was hit by "a large-scale computer attack." Officials said they shut down all affected systems to protect data and diagnose the problem. The incident took place on Monday, and systems have yet to be restored. Security experts believe this is a ransomware attack, although the perpetrators have not yet been identified.

**Ransomware on Indian hospital:** A suspected ransomware attack has disrupted the IT network of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), one of India's largest medical schools and hospitals. [The Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ransomware-suspected-as-aiims-servers-go-down-trigger-long-waits-101669229051577.html) said this would mark the first instance of a major Indian hospital being affected by ransomware. Healthcare organizations, and especially hospitals, have been constantly targeted by ransomware gangs all over the US and Europe for the past five years, but as these organizations are getting better at protecting their networks, ransomware attacks are now hitting other countries as well.

**Westmount ransomware attack:** The local government of Westmount, part of the Montreal urban area, said it's dealing with a ransomware attack that crippled its IT network. [Local press said](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/2022-11-23/attaque-au-rancongiciel-a-westmount/les-pirates-affichent-des-dossiers-sensibles-qu-ils-auraient-voles.php) the attackers have already demanded a ransom payment, but officials do not intend to pay.

**Continental ransomware attack:** German authorities have [called](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-fbi-joins-continental-cyberattack-investigation-handelsblatt-2022-11-23/) in the FBI to help with their investigation into the ransomware attack that hit Continental, a major supplier for the international automotive industry. According to a [Handelsblatt](https://www.golem.de/news/ransomware-continental-schon-vier-wochen-frueher-infiltriert-2211-170006.html) report, the LockBit ransomware gang breached Continental in July and spent a month exfiltrating data from its network before attempting to extort the company for $50 million. In August, Continental [gleefully said](https://www.continental.com/en/press/continental-informs/) that it had averted a cyberattack before admitting that it got hacked earlier this month after the LockBit gang leaked some of its data.

### Government, politics, and policy

**Don't cyberattack here, plz:** Retired US General Ben Hodges [told Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/cyber-important-missile-defences-ex-nato-general-2022-11-21/) that a cyber attack on the German ports of Bremerhaven or Hamburg would severely impede NATO efforts to send military reinforcements to its allies. That's one way to say, "*don't cyberattack here*." I wonder how many threat actors have had their interests piqued by this article.
