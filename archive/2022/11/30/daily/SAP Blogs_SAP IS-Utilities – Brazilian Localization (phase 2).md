# Introduction

The IS-Utilities Brazilian Localization was developed focusing on legal requirements and changes. In 2020, an entire technical team has been allocated by SAP to work on this product, focusing not only to the legal changes, but also on enhancing features from SAP S/4HANA Utilities core solution to attend the Brazilian market.

In the following blogpost, you will be able to understand all the developments done for the Phase 2, already delivered on SAP S/4HANA OP2022 SP0:

* [Average Service Time](#Average_Service_Time)

* [Dynamic Schedule Service](#Dynamic_Schedule_Service)

* [Improvements for IS-U Loss Management](#IS_U_Loss_Management)

To check the deliveries for Phase 1, click [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/06/sap-is-utilities-brazilian-localization-phase-1/).

## Average Service Time

The Average Service Time is a dashboard, based on Interaction records from S4CRM. It allows managers from CRM to understand and analyze, in one place, an immense amount of data, to take decisions on suggesting new training courses for their employees and providing a better customer relationship.

To improve the analysis, it’s possible to filter the data, it is also possible to click on each dashboard’s card, to open the Analytical app, showing more information in detail related to that specific context.

## Dynamic Schedule Service

This development allows customers to run their schedules, change Portions of Meter Reading Units, massively, from one day to another day. It brings a Fiori App with a better visualization to the process flow of the standard transactions E1DY and E2DY.

Also, it is possible for the user to create a new simulation of these changes to test the data, before making this official. To make these simulations official, users can activate the “workflow mode”, allowing an approval/review process, depending on a Four-eyes Check.

## Improvements for IS-U Loss Management

This development happened in two phases, the first one in release SAP S/4HANA OP2021 SP0 had no support for multiple registers. In the phase 2, SAP has included the feasibility to equipment’s change and multiple registers.
