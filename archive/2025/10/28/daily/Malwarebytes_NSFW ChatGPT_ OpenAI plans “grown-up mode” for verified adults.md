# NSFW ChatGPT? OpenAI plans “grown-up mode” for verified adults

Posted: October 28, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

If you’ve had your fill of philosophical discussions with ChatGPT, CEO Sam Altman has news for you: the service will soon be able to engage in far less highbrow conversations of the sexual kind. That’s right—sexting is coming to ChatGPT. Are we really surprised?

It marks a change in sentiment for the company, which originally banned NSFW content. In an October 14 [post on X](https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1978129344598827128%7Ctwgr%5Eaacab35f2788d3bd2c121949f5b1aaf028121b15%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F10%2F14%2Fsam-altman-says-chatgpt-will-soon-allow-erotica-for-adult-users), Altman said the company had kept ChatGPT “pretty restrictive” to avoid creating mental health issues for vulnerable users. But now, he says, the company has learned from that experience and feels ready to “experiment more.”

> “In a few weeks, we plan to put out a new version of ChatGPT that allows people to have a personality that behaves more like what people liked about 4o (we hope it will be better!). If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it (but only if you want it, not because we are usage-maxxing).”

He added that by December, as age-gating expands, ChatGPT will “allow even more, like erotica for verified adults.”

This isn’t a sudden pivot. Things started to change at least as far back as May last year, when the company [said in its Model Specification](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#dont-respond-with-nsfw-content) document that it was considering allowing ChatGPT to get a little naughty under the right circumstances.

> “We believe developers and users should have the flexibility to use our services as they see fit, so long as they comply with our usage policies. We’re exploring whether we can responsibly provide the ability to generate NSFW content in age-appropriate contexts through the API and ChatGPT. We look forward to better understanding user and societal expectations of model behavior in this area.”

It followed up on that with another statement in a February 2025 update to the document, when it starting mulling a ‘grown-up mode’ while drawing a hard boundary around things like age, sexual deepfakes, and revenge porn.

## A massive market

There’s no denying the money behind this move. Analysts believe people [paid $2.7 billion worldwide](https://market.us/report/ai-girlfriend-app-market/) for a little AI companionship last year, with the market expected to balloon to $24.5 billion by 2034—a staggering 24% annual growth rate.

AI “girlfriends” and “boyfriends” already span everything from video-based virtual partners to augmented reality companions that can call you. Even big tech companies have been getting into it, with Elon Musk’s X [launching](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/grok-companions-include-flirty-anime-waifu-anti-religion-panda-rcna218797) a sexualized virtual companion called Ani that will apparently strip for you if you pester it enough.

People have been getting down and dirty with technology for decades, of course (phone sex lines began in the early 1980s, and cam sites have been a thing for years). But AI changes the scale entirely...
