Threat: Backdoor.Win32.Serman.a
Vulnerability: Unauthenticated Open Proxy
Family: Serman
Type: PE32
MD5: f312e3a436995b86b205a1a37b1bf10f
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0659
Disclosure: 11/22/2022
Description: The malware listens on TCP port 21422 by default but it can be changed. Third-party attackers who can connect to the infected system can relay requests from the original connection to the destination and then back to the origination system. Attackers may then be able to launch attacks, download files or port scan third party systems and it will appear as the attacks originated from that infected host.

E.g. using port 5555
