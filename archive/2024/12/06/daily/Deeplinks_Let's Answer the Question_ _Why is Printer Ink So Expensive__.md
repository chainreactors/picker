Did you know that most printer ink isn’t even expensive to make? [Why then is it so expensive to refill the ink on your printer](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org/topics/why-is-printer-ink-so-expensive)?

The answer is actually pretty simple: monopolies, weird laws, and companies exploiting their users for profit. If this sounds mildly infuriating and makes you want to learn ways to fight back, then head over to our new site, [Digital Rights Bytes](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org)! We’ve even created a short video to explain what the heck is going on here.

We’re answering the common tech questions that may be bugging you. Whether you’re hoping to learn something new or want to share resources with your family and friends, Digital Rights Bytes can be your one-stop-shop to learn more about the technology you use every day.

Digital Rights Bytes also has answers to other common questions about device repair, ownership of your digital media, and more. If you’ve got additional questions you’d like us to tackle in the future, let us know on your [favorite social platform](https://www.eff.org/pages/where-find-eff) using the hashtag #DigitalRightsBytes!
