# iPhone user watches as stolen phone travels from UK to China

Posted: December 13, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Have you ever wondered what happens to your phone if it’s stolen while on vacation or a business trip? The answer may surprise you, as it did one Mastodon user who graciously shared a tale of a smartphone gaining some serious air miles. Our intrepid business traveller was in London when their phone was [snatched from their hand in the street](https://hachyderm.io/%40em0/109494779578990831).

Thankfully, they’d taken the precaution of setting up Apple’s [Find My](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_My_iPhone) service prior to making their trip.

In practical terms, this meant that the phone could be remotely wiped (via Find My) and essentially turned into a paperweight. This has a two fold advantage: Keeping valuable data out of the thief’s hands, and also making the phone considerably less useful to a criminal.

You might think a theft such as this stays local, and that’s what it looked like for a while with the phone [coming to a halt](https://hachyderm.io/%40em0/109494855455381888) a few miles away. I would have assumed the phone would be sold locally or scrapped, but in this story our thief had other ideas in mind. What followed was an attempt to revive the phone via [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing), and a very long flight.

## When a theft gets phishy

The thief was not just interested in grabbing the device and selling it on in its bricked form. They wanted to reactivate the device too. This was attempted via a [text message](https://hachyderm.io/%40em0/109494876603962275) sent to the phone owner’s emergency contacts. The text reads as follows:

The site, which spoofed the Find My website, was phishing for an Apple ID login to kickstart the reviving process. I’m sure the thief wouldn’t have objected to whatever data was locked behind that Apple ID too, but we can presume that getting the phone up and running is the primary concern.

Roughly a month after the phone was stolen, the [activation lock](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201365#:~:text=Find%20My%20includes%20Activation%20Lock,Find%20My%20on%20your%20device.) for the device started pinging home. This is the feature which prevents random people from unlocking a lost or stolen device.

The victim of this crime was surprised to learn that the stolen device had [travelled from the UK to Shenzen in China](https://hachyderm.io/%40em0/109494947636636603). You may wonder if the Find My service was perhaps malfunctioning and the stolen device was still in London somewhere, but as we’re about to see, this is far from the only example of this happening.

## Why do stolen phones end up in China?

Stolen phones ending up in China is, perhaps surprisingly, not uncommon. In fact, searching for this kind of thing brings up a wealth of results (try it!) and they all tend to look something like this:

> My phone was swiped from my hand in London a month ago. Annoyed, I immediately blocked the phone and erased its contents.
>
> Anyway, I got a notification today and that my phone has now been switched on in Shenzen, China. [pic.twitter.com/nPNEGaflQT](https://t.co/nPNEGaflQT)
