Logistics visibility has become a lot more…  well, *visible*, since our supply chains were tested like never before during the Covid-19 global pandemic.  Even now, as transportation and supply chains have begun to rebound sufficiently to feed our economic engines, we still face labor, climate and geo-political risks and inflationary cost pressures that make avoiding supply chain disruption a persistent daily challenge.  This new normal is what keeps the pursuit of logistics visibility as a top priority for the C-suite.

[Another recent post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/19/four-reasons-why-you-need-logistics-visibility/) provided the definition of logistics visibility:

**“Logistics visibility is the ability to track an order or movement of goods, products, and materials for a clearer view of status and progress along a process or route.”**

But what if the practice of logistics visibility has not yet come into focus for you?  Maybe you are still wondering, what is logistics visibility?  Why do I need it?  How do I achieve it?

Well, feel free to set down your bifocals.  Here are two recent podcasts that lay out the business case for logistics visibility, and do well to explain the essential role that logistics visibility plays in resilient supply chains, customer satisfaction, profitability, and growth.

In this podcast, Rene Vallejo, SAP Business Network Executive, cuts to the chase to say that uncertainty is “the new normal.”

“The real full extension of logistic visibility is, how is [risk and disruption] going to impact across everything that I do in my business,” Vallejo explains to dig deeper into the topic.  “It is important to have the updates of logistic events at the fingertips of the people who work with commercial transactions.”

This podcast goes beyond the old adage, “no one plans to fail, they just fail to plan.”  The insightful analysis from this discussion helps to underpin that, as Vallejo comments, “Poor planning, or poor decision making, is not a choice. It's a symptom of lack of visibility, and this is what we are trying to tackle.”
