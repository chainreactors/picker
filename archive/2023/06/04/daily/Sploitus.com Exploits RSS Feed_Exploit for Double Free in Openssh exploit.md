CVE-2023-25136 POC
POC For A Pre Auth Double Free Vulnerability Affecting OpenSSH 9.1 To 9.2

Neccessary libraries
Please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3 (duh)
termcolor
argparse
fabric

You can also install these libraries directly from the included requirements.txt file using pip.
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

How to use:
To use the script to check if OpenSSH is vulnerable on a single specified IP address, run the script with the -t or the --target parameter, followed by the IP address you wish to test.
NOTE: IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DEFAULT TO PORT 22
Example: python3 CVE-2023-25136_POC.py -t 127.0.0.1
To check for the vulnerability on more than one IP address, create a file with one IP per line and specify it to the script with the -p or the --filepath parameter.
Example: python3 CVE-2023-25136_POC.py -f listofips.txt

Understanding output
Pretty straight forward, if OpenSSH is exploitable, it will print it 127.0.0.1: Exploitable in green
If it isn't, it will print it 127.0.0.1: Exploitable in red
