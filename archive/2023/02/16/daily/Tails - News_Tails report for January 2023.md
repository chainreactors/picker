# Tails report for January 2023

2023-02-15

2. [Highlights](#index2h1)
3. [Releases](#index3h1)
4. [Metrics](#index4h1)

# Highlights

* We agreed internally on strategic goals for the new 3 years.

  In terms of product strategy, we will focus on learning about *existing*
  users who match our [personas](../../contribute/personas/) and how to serve them
  better. We will focus less on acquiring new users from our target audience.

  In terms of features, we will prioritize better interoperability with tools
  like mobile messaging apps, online video calls, and social media.
* We updated our documentation to the new Persistent Storage and added a page
  about [opening your Persistent Storage from another operating
  system](../../doc/persistent_storage/open/index.en.html).
* We made Tails Upgrader use our new pool of mirrors at
  <https://download.tails.net/> instead of our previous custom solution.

# Releases

[Tails 5.9 was released on January 23](../version_5.9/).

It fixed most of the regressions introduced in Tails 5.8 in December:

* Fixed support for some graphics cards.
* Fixed starting AppImages that use the Qt toolkit like *Feather* and
  *Bitcoin-Qt*. ([#19326](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19326))
* Fixed clipboard encryption and decryption in *Kleopatra*. ([#19329](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19329))
* Fixed at least 2 cases of Persistent Storage not activating:

  + When activation takes longer ([#19347](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19347))
  + When the Dotfiles feature includes symbolic links ([#19346](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19346))
* Fixed 3 clipboard operations with *KeePassXC*.

# Metrics

Tails has been started more than 713 228 times this month. This makes 23 007
boots a day on average.
