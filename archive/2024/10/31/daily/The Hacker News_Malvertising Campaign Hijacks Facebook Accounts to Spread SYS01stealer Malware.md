[![SYS01stealer Malware](data:image/png;base64... "SYS01stealer Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIJF3HuyoKBl3-ZoL0Ex6DieJ1Yn5mUeCnYjx_GfJsa7g5y4eOMb-3uCApLbfhvRPisKHverbocd6Ydzfx5W1Q3BtwnU0xugNpmHVIOA61szobnXoqLzNJ8ebwgRi9cL2VQxCgQYru7Cu2pidEiaTHdMxUTJooTxFY-rXTY0PRItkrO8iX2FjblA1GPbKg/s790-rw-e365/ads.png)

Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ongoing malvertising campaign that abuses Meta's advertising platform and hijacked Facebook accounts to distribute an information stealer known as SYS01stealer.

"The hackers behind the campaign use trusted brands to expand their reach," Bitdefender Labs [said](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/labs/unmasking-the-sys01-infostealer-threat-bitdefender-labs-tracks-global-malvertising-campaign-targeting-meta-business-pages/) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"The malvertising campaign leverages nearly a hundred malicious domains, utilized not only for distributing the malware but also for live command and control (C2) operations, allowing threat actors to manage the attack in real-time."

SYS01stealer was [first documented](https://thehackernews.com/2023/03/sys01stealer-new-threat-using-facebook.html) by Morphisec in early 2023, describing attack campaigns targeting Facebook business accounts using Google ads and fake Facebook profiles that promote games, adult content, and cracked software.

Like other stealer malware, the end goal is to steal login credentials, browsing history, and cookies. But it's also focused on obtaining Facebook ad and business account data, which is then used to propagate the malware further via phony ads.

"The hijacked Facebook accounts serve as a foundation for scaling up the entire operation," Bitdefender noted. "Each compromised account can be repurposed to promote additional malicious ads, amplifying the reach of the campaign without the hackers needing to create new Facebook accounts themselves."

The primary vector through which SYS01stealer is distributed is via malvertising across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn, with the ads promoting Windows themes, games, AI software, photo editors, VPNs, and movie streaming services. A majority of the Facebook ads are engineered to target men aged 45 and above.

"This effectively lures victims into clicking these ads and having their browser data stolen," Trustwave [said](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/void-banshee-apt-exploits-microsoft.html) in an analysis of the malware in July 2024.

"If there is Facebook-related information in the data, there is a possibility of not only having their browser data stolen but also having their Facebook accounts controlled by the threat actors to further spread malvertisements and continue the cycle."

Users who end up interacting with the ads are redirected to deceptive sites hosted on Google Sites or True Hosting that impersonate legitimate brands and applications in an attempt to initiate the infection. The attacks are also known to use hijacked Facebook accounts to publish fraudulent ads.

The first stage payload downloaded from these sites is a ZIP archive that includes a benign executable, which is used to sideload a malicious DLL responsible for decoding and launching the multi-stage process.

This includes running PowerShell commands to prevent the malware from running in a sandboxed environment, modifying Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings to exclude certain paths to avoid detection, and setting up an operating environment to run the PHP-based stealer.

In the latest attack chains observed by the Romanian cybersecurity company, the ZIP archives come embedded with an Electron application, suggesting that the threat actors are continuously evolving their strategies.

Also present within the Atom Shell Archive (ASAR) is a JavaScript file ("main.js") that now executes the PowerShell commands to perform sandbox checks and execute the stealer. Persistence on the host is achieved by setting up scheduled tasks.

"The adaptability of the cybercriminals behind these attacks makes the SYS01 infostealer campaign especially dangerous," Bitdefender said. "The malware employs sandbox detection, halting its operations if it detects it's being run in a controlled environment, often used by analysts to examine malware. This allows it to remain undetected in many cases."

"When cybersecurity firms begin to flag and block a specific version of the loader, the hackers respond swiftly by updating the code. They then push out new ads with updated malware that evades the latest security measures."
