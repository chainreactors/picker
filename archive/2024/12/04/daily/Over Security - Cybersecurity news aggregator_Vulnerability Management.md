## Vulnerability Management

A lot has already been said about Vulnerability Management (VM), and I’ve personally touched on this topic several times before. Yet, the reality is that managing vulnerabilities remains a significant challenge for most organizations.

Our offensive activities consistently reveal that, when successful, the attack path often hinges on software or logical vulnerabilities. More often than not, these vulnerabilities were already known to the IT department but, for one reason or another, mitigation wasn’t feasible.

In other words, the success of the offensive action stems from widely known vulnerabilities.

And this isn’t a rare scenario.

## What is a vulnerability?

In the most common (and technical) sense, a vulnerability is a software flaw that can compromise confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability. However, this definition only covers a specific category. If we broaden the concept, the term “vulnerability” can also apply to:

* **Processes**
* **People**
* **Configurations**

### Process vulnerabilities

A process vulnerability arises when workflows fail to ensure confidentiality, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized individuals. For example, I once came across a box of employee pay slips left unattended in a real-world scenario. In that case, the employee handling the box was following the correct procedure, but the procedure itself failed to account for such risks.

### Psychological vulnerabilities

These occur when attackers exploit human weaknesses through social engineering techniques. Phishing, tailgating, and piggybacking are classic examples that target psychological vulnerabilities to extract sensitive information.

### Configuration vulnerabilities

Also known as logical vulnerabilities, these arise when, for instance, a network share allows unauthorized access. Often, such issues result from oversight, but in some cases, they happen because the individual responsible for the setup lacked the necessary security knowledge.

Physical vulnerabilities (e.g., locks, doors, gates) could also be mentioned, but focusing too much on these technical aspects might detract from the broader applicability of this discussion.

## Managing vulnerabilities

Many people immediately associate “vulnerability management” with patching. But managing a vulnerability doesn’t mean simply eliminating it via a software patch. Managing a vulnerability means assessing the associated risk and mitigating it. Mitigation strategies can include:

* Patching or reconfiguring the system
* Shutting down the vulnerable system
* Training employees
* Adding additional security controls
* …

In extreme cases, risk can be transferred through insurance (though insurers typically exclude companies deemed too high-risk after their evaluations).

### Evaluating a vulnerability

Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Each vulnerability has unique characteristics regarding type, impact, exploitability, and mitigatability. This means we can’t rely solely on standard reports; we need to complement them with public information—subject to change over time—and data specific to our organization.

In other words, we need a **risk-based mindset** when addressing vulnerabilities.

One critical aspect to emphasize: the risk associated with a vulnerability **changes over time**. Typically (though not always), a vulnerability is discovered, eventually exploited, and then becomes dangerous. Furthermore, 2024 alone has shown us several examples of patches that failed to fully resolve issues. This highlights the necessit...
