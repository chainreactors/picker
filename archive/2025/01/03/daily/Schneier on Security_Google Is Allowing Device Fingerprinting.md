## Google Is Allowing Device Fingerprinting

Lukasz Olejnik [writes](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/biggest-privacy-erosion-in-10-years-on-googles-policy-change-towards-fingerprinting/) about device fingerprinting, and why Google’s policy change to allow it in 2025 is a major privacy setback.

Tracking digital ‘fingerprints’ will undermine consumers’ control over information.

Coming soon if Google gets it’s way…

In the databroker files are 3.6 billion cellphone locations enabling mass surveillance.

All of this is possible because of apps sharing location data with third parties.

If you can get 1000 hits on someone working in national security, where they go, who their partner is and even find contact details, this a problem with consequences for everyone.

The SDKs, which are automatically included in apps, share this data instantly with data broker companies as soon as location access is granted to the particular application.

Points of interest, Property, Mobility, Address, Imagery and Demographic data can be purchased by anyone for relatively cheap prices to analyze footprints of any body/thing.

Fog purchases “billions of data points” from some “250 million devices” around the United States, originally sourced from “tens of thousands” of mobile apps.

@ ALL,

There are two obvious “first glance” reasons for this change,

1, Increase influence/profit
2, Provide new input data for AI

As these would directly benefit Alphabet / Google.

That said there is another issue some will immediately think about. Which is,

3, EU data protection legislation.

This is seen by some as emboldening others in the US. With states like California passing legislation to likewise constrain the rampant surveillance on Internet users.

Thus for the “some” cutting access to “clean input” to just funnel into the input corpus of AI systems[1].

Especially as there is an increasing trend to move from central to federated social media caused by the well observed “blue bird dive of doom”.

Device fingerprinting currently has to be seen like “On Device Scanning” (something Apple apparently desperately wants). It is in effect an artifact of “device use” rather than the device it’s self. Whilst there is little research currently it is not hard to see how a users choices of apps, services and settings is going to be the same or similar across their devices. Thus even if a user separates out their activities across devices to prevent direct linking the fingerprint will cause sufficient similarity to enable correlation thus indirect but probable linking. It is just a variation on what intelligence analysts, investigative journalists, and investigators in law enforcement do.

Now consider this being done on mass, it is something that is actually well within the capabilities of “Current AI” LLM and ML systems. Thus users would in effect be corralled from federated systems back into central systems, so allowing the sorted aggregation of user output into a coherent whole thus vastly increasing it’s value as data for AI training.

I’ve previously warned of this sort of activity,

<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/06/online-privacy-and-overfishing.html/#comment-437979>

As part of the AI business plan of,

“Bedazzle, Beguile, Bewitch, befriend, and Betrayal.”

(Read the thread “overfishing” article as it explains why “the frog gets boiled” in the first place, due to another human failing that is part of “short-termism”).

[1] There is a lot of talk about “synthetic data” that is using one AI to generate input for another AI. For some reason people are not thinking this through very critically or I suspect in some cases at all. AGI output is not human output and is at best a poor facsimile of it in many ways (think randomised or chaotic semantic layers changes). For AGI to make useful output it will need to be filtered through humans to be sanity checked much as the processes for “guiderails” have to be in place. Thus ask just how fast such checking could be done on synthetic data?

The change from “don’t use” to “full disclosure” is essentially a “just do what you like” to advertizers. They will put up pages of notifications and options that nobody bothers to wade through, as so many web sites already do with cookies.

Harass the users enough and they will agree with anything to get rid of the clutter.

2 questions
Firstly how useful is device fingerprinting, without cookies or local storage, geo location or IP tracking?
Secondly why does a browser ‘app’ have access to any information at all outside the limited information of the sand box it is in. Limited in this case means things like CSS media enquiry data needed for presentation, or access to secure payment APIs for purchasing.
Aside from these highly common and non unique parameters of the sandbox there should be nothing visible to a browser ‘app’ to fingerprint.
Which comes back to the firs...
