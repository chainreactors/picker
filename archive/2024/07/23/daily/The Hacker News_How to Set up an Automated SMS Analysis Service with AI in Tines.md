The opportunities to use AI in workflow automation are many and varied, but one of the simplest ways to use AI to save time and enhance your organization's security posture is by building an automated SMS analysis service.

Workflow automation platform Tines provides a good example of how to do it. The vendor recently released their first [native AI features](https://www.tines.com/product/ai?utm_source=media&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=hackernews-article-22), and security teams have already started sharing the AI-enhanced workflows they've built using the platform.

Tines' library of pre-built workflows includes AI-enhanced pre-built workflows for normalizing alerts, creating cases, and determining which phishing emails require escalations.

Let's take a closer look at their SMS analysis workflow, which, like all of their pre-built workflows, is free to access and import, and can be used with a free Community Edition account.

Here, we'll share an overview of the workflow, and a step-by-step guide for getting it up and running.

## The problem - SMS scam messages targeted at employees

Employees often receive scam SMS messages designed to steal login credentials or install malware on devices. These messages can lead to compromised accounts, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential breaches that could cause significant harm to the organization's operations and reputation.

Responding to each report manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, making it difficult for security teams to keep up with the volume of threats.

| A web page with a form inviting employees to submit the message for analysis |

Using workflow automation, security teams can create an SMS analysis service that any employee across the organization can use.

It operates as a simple self-service model. When employees receive a suspicious message, they visit the web page and submit a screenshot of the message or a URL using the provided form. This form kicks off the workflow and they get a response within a couple of seconds. The response includes a clear and detailed analysis of the message and some recommended next steps.

Here's an example of the image they might submit:

Here's an example of the result they might receive:

| The automated analysis received by the employee |

The text reads:

*Hi! Thanks for reporting the message. I've analyzed the content and have a few observations:*

*The message claims that your Amazon account has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts. This is a common tactic used in phishing scams, where attackers try to trick you into clicking on a malicious link to "recover" your account.*

*The message has a sense of urgency, which is another red flag for phishing attempts. Legitimate companies typically don't demand immediate action in this manner.*

*The link provided in the message (hxxp://s953909557/servweb) appears to be suspicious. I've defanged the link, but I would strongly advise against clicking on it, as it could lead to a malicious website designed to steal your login credentials or install malware on your device.*

*Additionally, the message does not appear to be from any of our senior executives [executive names here]. This could be an attempt at CEO fraud, where someone is impersonating a senior leader to request sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.*

*In summary, this message exhibits several characteristics of a common phishing scam and should be treated with caution. I recommend that you do not click on the provided link and instead contact Amazon directly through their official website or customer service channels to verify the status of your account.*

*Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. I'm here to help ensure the security of our organization.*

Here are some of the key benefits of launching a service like this:

* It promotes a culture of cybersecurity by making it easy for employees to be vigilant and reinforces security-conscious decision-making
* It reduces manual, repetitive work for the security team
* It improves the speed and accuracy of threat detection
