# Weekly Update 413

18 August 2024

Whilst there definitely weren't 2.x billion people in the National Public Data breach, it *is* bad. It really is fascinating how much data can be collected and monetised in this fashion and as we've seen many times before, data breaches do often follow. The NPD incident has received a huge amount of exposure this week and as is often the case, there are some interesting turns; partial data sets, an actor turned data broker, a disclosure notice (almost) nobody can load and bad actors peddling partial sets of data. See what you make of this one, I'm sure there'll be insights come to light on this yet.
