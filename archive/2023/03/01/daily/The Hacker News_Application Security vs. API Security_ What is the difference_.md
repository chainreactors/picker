As digital transformation takes hold and businesses become increasingly reliant on digital services, it has become more important than ever to secure applications and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). With that said, application security and API security are two critical components of a comprehensive security strategy. By utilizing these practices, organizations can protect themselves from malicious attacks and security threats, and most importantly, ensure their data remains secure.

Interestingly enough, despite the clear advantages these disciplines provide, businesses are struggling to understand which security approach is best for their needs. So in this article, we'll discuss the differences between application and API security, best practices that you should consider, and ultimately make the case for why you need both.

## **What is Application Security**

Application security, better known as AppSec, is a critical aspect of any organization's cybersecurity strategy. Application security helps protect data and systems from unauthorized access, modification, or data destruction by utilizing techniques around authentication and authorization, encryption, access control, secure coding practices, and more.

The benefits of application security are numerous. It can help protect sensitive data from being stolen or misused, reduce the risk of data breaches, and ensure that applications are compliant with industry regulations. Additionally, application security can help organizations reduce the costs associated with responding to a security incident by providing proactive measures that reduce the risk of a successful attack. Finally, it can also improve customer trust by providing a secure environment for customers to interact with your business.

According to the ISACA, the [five key components of an application security program](https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/newsletters/atisaca/2022/volume-47/five-key-components-of-an-application-security-program) are:

1. Security by design
2. Secure code testing
3. Software bill of materials
4. Security training and awareness
5. WAFs and API security gateways and rule development

In the next section, we'll take a look at how API security fits into this framework, as well as where it still needs to be addressed.

## **Comparing Application Security vs. API Security**

Though often used synonymously, AppSec and API security are very distinct disciplines. API security helps to protect APIs from unauthorized access, misuse, and abuse. It also helps to protect against malicious attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks. By implementing proper API security measures, organizations can ensure that their applications remain secure and protected from potential threats.

As you can see, securing APIs is a critical aspect of a proper application security strategy. However, to be clear, API Security is different enough from 'traditional' Application Security that it requires specific consideration. AppSec focuses on protecting the entire application while API security focuses on protecting the APIs that are used to connect modern applications and exchange data.

The biggest difference between an API and an Application is how each impacts the user. APIs are intended to be used by software applications, while software applications themselves are intended to be used by humans. This implies different security controls are required. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's dig into how API security is embedded within four of the five key components of AppSec and where it still needs help:

### **Security by design**

The core idea here "is to consider security at the point of architecture and design, before any source code is written or compiled." The ISACA goes on to say that "controls can include, but are not limited to, the use of web application firewalls (WAFs) and application program interface (API) security gateways, encryption capabilities, authentication and secrets management, logging requirements, and other security controls."

With that in mind, in the 2022 Hype Cycle for Application Security, Gartner points out that "traditional network and web protection tools do not protect against all the security threats facing APIs, including many of those described in the OWASP API Security Top 10." Which illustrates the need for developers and security professionals to consider unique nuances of API protection in their cybersecurity strategy.

### **Secure code testing**

As you can imagine, application security testing (AST) and API security testing are different disciplines. Ultimately the goal of securing the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the same, but the approaches are fundamentally different. The ISACA recommends pursuing traditional security testing methods like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST). They also recommend supplementing AppSec testing with penetration (pen) testing. The problem here is that APIs require additional testing that these techniques cannot address.

According to Gartner, "traditional AST tools — SAST, DAST and interactive AST (IAST) — were not originally designed to...
