# Weekly Update 324

05 December 2022

We're in Copenhagen! Scott and family joined us in Oslo for round 2 of wedding celebrations this week before jumping on the ferry to Copenhagen and seeing the sights here. There's lots of cyber things in this week's vid relating to HIBP's birthday, Medibank and financial penalties for breaches, but I'm just going to leave you with one of the most amazing moments of my life captured in pics:
