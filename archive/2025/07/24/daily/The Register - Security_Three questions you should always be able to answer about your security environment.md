# Three questions you should always be able to answer about your security environment

## All security questions are hard to answer, but these three are non-negotiable

Partner content We've all seen those seemingly straightforward security questions that snowball into multi-day research projects across dozens of consoles, spreadsheets, and manual queries. The reality is that even the most fundamental security questions are notoriously difficult to answer with certainty.

Here are five foundational questions every security leader should be able to answer immediately, why they're harder than they appear, and practical pathways to find reliable answers.

### **1. Do I have full visibility into all the devices accessing my environment?**

This is a fundamental question for any security team. Per [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-faqs-framework-components): "Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried." Not only does it directly map to compliance, but the principle is simple: You can only secure what you know about. Yet most organizations struggle to maintain an accurate, real-time inventory of their entire device ecosystem.

**Why it matters**

Untracked or unknown devices represent some of the highest-risk attack vectors in modern environments. They're typically unmanaged, unprotected, and unscanned, creating blind spots that attackers can actively exploit without your knowledge. In fact, [Microsoft reports 90% of successful ransomware attacks](https://news.microsoft.com/source/asia/features/securing-our-digital-world-together-with-the-support-of-ai/) start with unmanaged devices, highlighting just how critical comprehensive visibility has become.
