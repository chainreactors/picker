# Pirate Bay Forum Suffers Extended Downtime After Hack

The Pirate Bay's official forum is usually a beacon of information if the main site goes offline, but for the last few days, it has become unreachable. According to a SuprBay administrator, the forum is recovering from a hack and should be back online in a week or two. Reportedly, no user data was compromised.

When the notorious torrent site goes offline, the associated SuprBay forum usually remains online. This is helpful, as the forums have a dedicated page where outsiders can check the status of the main site.

More recently, the tables have been turned. At the time of writing The Pirate Bay is online but the forums are unreachable. People who try to access [SuprBay](https://pirates-forum.org/) get a connection timeout instead, which has been the case for several days now.

## Dark Web Message

The Pirate Bay website doesn’t have any information on the issue but on the dark web, the .onion domain shows a little more information.

“Moe is still playing with himself, but we are slowly getting things sorted,” the brief notification reads.

## Hacked

The message doesn’t reveal much but suggests that if Surpbay admin “Moe” takes action, the site will eventually make a full comeback. This is confirmed by fellow administrator Spud17, who explains that the server was compromised.

An outsider reportedly hacked and messed up the server but Spud17 says that user data was not compromised in the process. The main Pirate Bay site was unaffected by the whole ordeal.

The good news is that there are recent backups in place. This means that the forums can be brought back online with relative ease. According to the SuprBay team, that should take a week, or perhaps two.
