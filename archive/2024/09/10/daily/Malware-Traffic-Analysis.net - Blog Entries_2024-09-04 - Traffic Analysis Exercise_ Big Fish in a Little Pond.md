## BACKGROUND

Reviewing the alerts in your network environment, you find indicators that a
host within your environment has been infected with malware..

## SCENARIO

LAN segment details:

* LAN segment range:  172.17.0[.]0/24 (172.17.0[.]0 through 172.17.0[.]255)
* Domain:  bepositive[.]com
* Active Directory (AD) domain controller:  172.17.0[.]17 - WIN-CTL9XBQ9Y19
* AD environment name:  BEPOSITIVE
* LAN segment gateway:  172.17.0[.]1
* LAN segment broadcast address:  172.17.0[.]255

## TASK

* Write an incident report based on malicious network activity from the pcap and from the alerts.

* The incident report should contains 3 sections:

> * **Executive Summary**: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
> * **Victim Details**: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
> * **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the activity.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
