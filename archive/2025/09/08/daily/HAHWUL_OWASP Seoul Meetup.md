# OWASP Seoul Meetup

2025.08.26 OWASP Seoul Meetup Recap

At the recent [OWASP Seoul](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-seoul/) Meetup, I had the opportunity to speak on the topic of open source. I was a bit worried that it might be a familiar topic and lead to a mundane discussion, but thanks to the enthusiastic attendees, it turned out to be a truly memorable time.

Both work and personal life have been so busy that time flew by quickly. Though a bit late, I‚Äôm jotting down some memories from that day.

## #1

First, the passion at the venue was truly impressive. Despite the hot weather and the evening timing, I was deeply moved by everyone who took the time to attend. After the event, someone in the open chat room said, `I'm super pumped! Gonna head home and jump straight into GitHub!` which actually gave me the spark to get fired up. Thanks to that, I‚Äôve been making a lot of commits and releases lately. :D

Though there wasn‚Äôt much time after my presentation, I had the chance to chat with various people. To be honest, it was a time where I gained a lot myself.

## #2

Personally, I felt my presentation left something to be desired, but listening to the next talk, ‚ÄúGather in the Forest of Translation,‚Äù completely washed away those thoughts. I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation, and I could relate to the pain points about reviews (though in my case, it‚Äôs not people but Agents ü§£). I picked up a few useful tricks from it. Also, I‚Äôm cheering for the ongoing [PR](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3216)!

## #3

Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the OWASP Seoul Chapter for organizing this wonderful opportunity and to everyone who attended. I also want to give another big thank you to [Simon](https://x.com/psiinon) for leaving such great comments for the Korean security/open-source community.

I‚Äôll make sure to attend again from time to time, so let‚Äôs meet at the next one!
