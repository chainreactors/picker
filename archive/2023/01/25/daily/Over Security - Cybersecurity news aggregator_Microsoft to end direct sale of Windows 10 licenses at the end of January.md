# Microsoft to end direct sale of Windows 10 licenses at the end of January

Posted: January 23, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Windows 10 is slowly coming to an end, with one more way to purchase the operating system riding off into the sunset. Microsoft is posting notices in a variety of locations to confirm it will [no longer sell Windows 10 licenses directly](https://www.pcworld.com/article/1477078/microsoft-will-stop-selling-windows-10-licenses-in-a-few-days.html). Support remains in place for the time being, as is the usual strategy when an operating system is gradually phased out.

## Announcing the end times

All Microsoft products [have their own life cycle](https://michaelspice.net/windows/end-of-life-microsoft-windows-and-office/), and all of these products inevitably meet their demise at the hands of the next incarnation. Those policies fall under two types, [modern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/policies/modern), for products and services serviced and supported continuously, and [fixed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/policies/fixed), for certain products bought at retail, or volume licensing.

While businesses often have the ability to pay to keep themselves patched against specific threats even after the shutters come down, this isn’t an option for everyone and a change of software and hardware is needed across the board eventually.

Windows 10 download pages now say this at the bottom of the promotional text:

*January 31, 2023 will be the last day this Windows 10 download is offered for sale. Windows 10 will remain supported with security updates that help protect your PC from [viruses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer-virus), [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) and other [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) until October 14, 2025.*

Whether or not you decide to buy Windows 10 before January 31, or ignore the warning and purchase from a third party retailer, January 31, 2025 looms on the horizon like a rather large banner advert for Windows 11. That [tiny uptake of users back in 2021](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/12/most-people-arent-upgrading-to-windows-11-not-the-end-of-the-world) is likely going to experience a spike over the next year or so.

## Windows 11: A significant boost in security…

We’ve covered many of the security improvements which Windows 11 holds over Windows 10. There’s the [multiple features and functionality of the hypervisor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/10/windows-11-security), the secure boot practices to help ward off boot kit malware, and the hardware enforced stack protection which protects various forms of running code.

Elsewhere we have [custom made phishing alerts](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/09/windows-11-pulls-ahead-of-windows-10-in-anti-phishing-stakes) for users of Windows 11(but not Windows 10), and a [default remote desktop protocol lock out](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/07/microsoft-clamps-down-on-rdp-brute-force-attacks-in-windows-11). This is before you get to the [other additions and improvements](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/windows-11-new-security-features/) which you won’t find elsewhere.
