## Introduction

*2022 was a tough year. It seemed like no one was safe. Nvidia, Samsung, Ubisoft, T-Mobile, Microsoft, Okta, Uber—and those were just some of Lapsus$’s breaches. What’s a Script Kiddie to do to be better protected in 2023?*

Another year in the books, and it was another big year for cybersecurity. While 2022 did not have the big, large-scale attacks like SolarWinds or log4j of the previous years, cyberattacks were definitely not slowing down. Even as defenses and awareness continued to grow, incidents and breaches continued to plague business and individuals alike. No one was safe, not even our cryptocurrency or password managers (looking at you, Crypto.com and LastPass). So, what can you do to protect yourself besides just unplugging and moving off-grid? Well, here are a few resolutions to make for 2023 to improve your security online.

## Turn on MFA

*So, the LastPass hack was a thing? What do I do now? Just go back to using 12345 for all my passwords, because why not?*

Passwords have been a weak point for years. First, it was easy-to-guess passwords, and then it was password reuse. If only we could have long, random passwords that were different for every website and service. The solution to all our problems: password managers. Now, we can create unique passwords for all our websites, and all we need to remember is one master password to unlock our password vault.

Well, it was the solution until it wasn’t. What happens when a hacker gets access to your vault and only needs to crack one password to get access to all the keys to your kingdom? Or, what happens when the attacker gets access to your browser’s memory and can then scrape all the stored passwords? As one of our TrustedSec researchers demonstrated, what happens is that your long, unique passwords are useless.

So passwords, even if you’re using a password manager, are practically dead—use multifactor authentication. You probably already use it for your financial accounts, but you should really start enabling multifactor authentication for all your important accounts. Most websites and services support multifactor authentication whether you are using SMS messages, an app, or a hardware token. MFA is not bulletproof, as some recent attacks have demonstrated, but it definitely raises the bar and makes you a much harder target.

## Don’t Rely on Being Alt.

*I don’t need to worry about hacks because I run macOS. Prove me wrong.*

There was a time when only the cool kids were running macOS or Linux or name-your-alternative to the big name on the block: Microsoft. Since the majority of people were using Microsoft, it became the target du jour for almost all hackers. Now, Microsoft vulnerabilities haven’t gone away, but they are becoming a much harder target, so hackers have been turning to more low-hanging fruit like macOS, ChromeOS, and other open-source software that hasn’t faced the same scrutiny over the years. Microsoft is not the only target anymore, which means the cool alternatives are no longer safe.

The shift to open-source vulnerabilities was evident with the log4j at...
