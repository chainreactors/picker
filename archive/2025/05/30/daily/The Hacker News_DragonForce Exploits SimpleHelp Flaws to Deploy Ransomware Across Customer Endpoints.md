[![MSP SimpleHelp Flaws to Deploy Ransomware](data:image/png;base64... "MSP SimpleHelp Flaws to Deploy Ransomware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyexvSCpDHDJ2Z6T2cz4OD064ThZckicBE5PVv-f4N6lPOY1lo0PVLxLmgTTGeNcPYLmOQtDdRDxL10zbykiwHUi31qW39_A-E6SGxbb85_xpw9aRfXkAL4bTsfSeqmsxLmw6-9WhKQfeT0QDaEK5bDqYKvweXWv9x2zY_MPXKEE-wih8YEAvMoi37Id2G/s790-rw-e365/ransomware-lock.jpg)

The threat actors behind the DragonForce ransomware gained access to an unnamed Managed Service Provider's (MSP) SimpleHelp remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, and then leveraged it to exfiltrate data and drop the locker on multiple endpoints.

It's believed that the attackers exploited a [trio of security flaws](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/critical-simplehelp-flaws-allow-file.html) in SimpleHelp (CVE-2024-57727, CVE-2024-57728, and CVE-2024-57726) that were disclosed in January 2025 to access the MSP's SimpleHelp deployment, according to an [analysis](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2025/05/27/dragonforce-actors-target-simplehelp-vulnerabilities-to-attack-msp-customers/) from Sophos.

The cybersecurity company said it was alerted to the incident following a suspicious installation of a SimpleHelp installer file, pushed via a legitimate SimpleHelp RMM instance that's hosted and operated by the MSP for their customers.

The threat actors have also been found to leverage their access through the MSP's RMM instance to collect information from different customer environments about device names and configuration, users, and network connections.

Although one of the MSP's clients was able to shut down attackers' access to the network, a number of other downstream customers were impacted by data theft and ransomware, eventually paving the way for double-extortion attacks.

The MSP supply chain attack sheds light on the evolving tradecraft of a group that has positioned itself as one of the most lucrative options for affiliate actors in the world of cybercrime by offering a favorable profit share.

DragonForce, in recent months, has [gained traction](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2025/05/21/dragonforce-targets-rivals-in-a-play-for-dominance/) for its [revamp](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/ransomhub-went-dark-april-1-affiliates.html) to a ransomware "cartel" and its pivot to a novel affiliate branding model that allows other cybercriminals to spawn their own versions of the locker under different names.

The emergence of the cartel coincided with the defacements of leak sites operated by BlackLock and Mamona ransomware groups, and what appears to be a "hostile takeover" of RansomHub, a prolific e-crime crew that took off post the demise of LockBit and BlackCat last year.

A string of attacks targeting [the U.K. retail sector](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/play-ransomware-exploited-windows-cve.html) since late last month has brought more spotlight on the threat actor. The [attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x4zxe418o), per [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgnndrgxv3o), have caused affected companies to [shut down parts of their IT systems](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/retailers-incident).

"While DragonForce took credit for the extortion and data leak phase, growing evidence suggests that another group – Scattered Spider – may have played a foundational role in enabling those attacks," Cyberint [said](https://cyberint.com/blog/dark-web/meet-scattered-spider-the-group-currently-scattering-uk-retail-organizations/). "Known for its cloud-first, identity-centric intrusion methods, Scattered Spider is emerging as a likely access broker or collaborator within the DragonForce affiliate model."

[Scattered Spider](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/us-charges-yemeni-hacker-behind-black.html), which itself is part of a larger loose-knit collective known as The Com, has remained something of a mystery despite arrests of alleged members in 2024, revealing little about its tradecraft when it comes to how youngsters from the U.K. and the U.S. are [recruited into the criminal network](https://www.europol.europa.eu/operations-services-and-innovation/public-awareness-and-prevention-guides/stop-criminal-networks-recruiting-youngsters).

These findings point to a [volatile landscape](https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/dragonforce-ransomware-redefining-hybrid-extortion-in-2025/) where ransomware groups are increasingly fragmenting, decentralizing, and battling low affiliate loyalty. Adding to the concern is the growing use of artificial intelligence ([AI](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/ai-driven-ransomware-funksec-targets-85.html)) in malware development and campaign scaling.

"DragonForce is not just another ransomware brand – it's a destabilizing force trying to reshape the ransomware landscape," Aiden Sinnott, senior threat researcher at Sophos Counter Threat Unit, said.

"While in the U.K., the group has dominated recent headlines after high-profile attacks on retailers, behind the scenes of the ransomware ecosystem there seems to be some jostling between it and e-crime groups such as RansomHub. As the ecosystem continues to quickly evolve after the takedown of LockBit, this 'turf war' highlights the efforts of this group, in particular, to claim dominance."

LockBit was the most prolific ransomware group until February 2024, when it suffered a [major setback](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/lockbit-ransomware-group-resurfaces.html) to its criminal enterprise after its infrastructure was dismantled as part of an international law enforcement action called Operation Cronos.

Although the group managed to rebuild and resume its activities to some extent, it was dealt with another blow earl...
