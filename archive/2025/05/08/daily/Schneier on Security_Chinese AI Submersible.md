## Chinese AI Submersible

A Chinese company has [developed](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3308410/china-launches-blue-whale-worlds-first-high-speed-typhoon-proof-uncrewed-submersible) an AI-piloted submersible that can reach speeds “similar to a destroyer or a US Navy torpedo,” dive “up to 60 metres underwater,” and “remain static for more than a month, like the stealth capabilities of a nuclear submarine.” In case you’re worried about the military applications of this, you can relax because the company says that the submersible is “designated for civilian use” and can “launch research rockets.”

“Research rockets.” Sure.

It’s good relaxation to see the Chinese respond to the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF).

@ Bruce,

I checked the date on the article and it looks like it’s nearly a month late, for what is in the photo 😉

In the UK we’ve pushed out similar style hulls for the Royal National LifeBoat Institution”(RNLI) and as North See Support Vessels. Designed to move at speed, roll over and self right.

It’s hard to tell from the photo but it looks like it’s a composite hull made from GRP or similar (carbon fiber is not considered suitable for maritime use)

The article says dive to a depth of 60m… Where the pressure would be around 6 atmospheres in salt water (~1024kg/m^3) or ~600kPa or (6 times ~14.5) 87PSI.

So a quick head calc says 87PSI on an area of 1m squared (call it ~1500 square inches in a square meter, lets not go down the XKCD squares[1] rabbit hole to Australia) that’s a little over 60tons…

So that hull and superstructure can not be sealed let alone a “pressure hull” and there are a few other indicators it’s not exactly tying up with the story line.

[1] The trouble with English and simple units of area…

Let’s see, drop one, send your ship away, and weeks from now, have it go after subsea cables?

@ Mark,

With regards,

> “Let’s see, drop one, send your ship away, and weeks from now…”

First put a couple or three nukes on board then rise up under a carrier group or other maritime convoy etc.

As I’ve mentioned before the ways in and out of the south china seas are not many nor are they really “deep water”.

A few weeks back a senior US military person advised Congress that the US needed hundreds of thousands of high capability drones to make the gap between China and Taiwan a broiling hell for a month whilst other –unstated– capability could be deployed.

I suspect China has been thinking about this and realised above the surface vessels are these days just sitting ducks not just to hypersonic missiles but swarms of low cost aerial drones. So realised submersed fully autonomous nuclear drones at depth are not really susceptable to either hypersonic missiles or aerial drones.

It’s something I’ve noted from time to time over the years that a “bottom sitting” fully autonomous drone/mine is with proper precautions very difficult to detect and they could just sit there dropped off the bottom of a ship for a year or more.

This is not exactly new thinking, back in WWII both sides used submarines for “mine laying” and they were reasonably effective. Detecting the subs basically fell to air bourn radar as the subs had to surface every day or so to recharge batteries and get fresh air in for the crew.

These days, you don’t need 80-95% of a submarine needed for the crew, and with nuclear power sources and high capacity batteries getting quite small and modern electric motors being very much more efficient…

Creating a bottom sitting sub / mine as small if not smaller than a family SUV would not be beyond the bounds of reasonable possibility.

“Research rockets.” Sure.

`And what exactly do you expect to uncover in the vast universe of rocket research?`

@ Clive

Does the hull have to be pressurized? Why not just fill the internal space with a non-conductive fluorocarbon or similar fluid instead?

@ godel,

With regards,

> “Why not just fill the internal space with a non-conductive fluorocarbon or similar fluid instead?”

Because the pressure/expansion problems don’t go away with simple moving mechanical items, nor the implicit void problems in cables, connectors and components.

Put a cable under pressure for an hour or two and at the very least the insulation will get crushed, and go “stiff” thus loose flexibility and become subject to changing resonance frequency and mode effects. Bring the cable back to nominal atmospheric pressure and the insulation will expand again. Do this repeatedly and such mechanical deformation very rapidly weakens the insulation and it undergoes “deformation hardening” or similar and so suffer structural fatigue. But similarly the wire inside gets subject to the mechanical changes and develops a form of metal fatigue.

Yes you can “design it out” with these problems I’ve so far mentioned but you pay a very heavy price for it.

There is another problem you have to consider and that is “glands” are in reality mechanical joints that are “slow leaks”. You have a “box” casing/housing that has cable or mechanical glands in and out, like a motor or actuator housing. Given time the pressure inside the box will rise to that of it’s external environment. Thus you end up with a pressurised housing that back on the surface may easily fail catastrophically like a small bomb. Adding pressure relief valves just turns it into a pump like those rubber squeeze balls on old manual medical blood pressure measuring instruments so you get an ingress ...
