Summer is flying by and before you know it, you’ll be buying backpacks and taking first-day-of-school photos. Back-to-school season brings new classes and friends, but it also brings new digital dangers. By the time you’ve dropped your kids off for their first day of class, chances are they’ve already been exposed to their first cyberthreat of the day. New devices, new online accounts, and relaxed summer screen habits could make your children vulnerable to a slew of online threats.

## Numbers you need to know

For most kids, especially teenagers, being online is a big part of daily life. From scrolling through TikTok and watching YouTube videos to chatting with friends and gaming, [46% of teens](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/) say they’re online “almost constantly.” Cybercriminals know this and are always looking for opportunities to cash in on your kids’ online activity. Threats like social media phishing have skyrocketed from [18.9% to 42.8%.](https://apwg.org/apwg-q4-report-finds-2023-was-record-year-for-phishing/) Some of these scams are directly aimed at children, including a rash of [fake school emails](https://inside.twu.edu/technology/read/be-aware-of-back-to-school-scams) designed to steal sensitive personal information. Since more than [80%](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tea/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf) of data breaches start with stolen passwords, it’s more important than ever that your children use strong passwords that are difficult to crack. The good news? We’ve put together a digital safety checklist to help you boost your entire family’s cybersecurity in just one weekend.

## Real-life risks in your child’s digital day

* **Phishing & social engineering:** Let’s say your teenage daughter gets a text that reads, “Your grades won’t post unless you verify your information now.” Or maybe she gets an email that asks for her student login to update her records. [Phishing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-phishing?ef_id=_k_EAIaIQobChMI8YWKkeKXjgMV7SzUAR1fETlEEAAYASAAEgLUUvD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmdamuj0pc_SEM__k_EAIaIQobChMI8YWKkeKXjgMV7SzUAR1fETlEEAAYASAAEgLUUvD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=14495145267&gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_vFSN7XHrMnydM3yRqrS6g-H&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8YWKkeKXjgMV7SzUAR1fETlEEAAYASAAEgLUUvD_BwE) and [social engineering](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2025/your-guide-to-identifying-social-engineering-scams-and-cyber-threats/#:~:text=Social%20engineering%20scams%20may%20be,bring%20business%20to%20a%20halt.) scams use threats and a sense of urgency to get you to click links and share personal information. Make sure your kids know to question any sudden or unusual request, and always bring it to you for verification before taking any action.
* **Gaming & app-related hazards:** Your son’s gaming buddy asks to move their conversation to a private app. Seems harmless enough, but is this someone your son really knows? Gaming sites are often part of a child’s social life, and that’s exactly why they’re a popular place for scams. Kids get urged to make in-game purchases that run up mom and dad’s credit card bills. They get invites to unfamiliar apps and private chats that can lead to crimes like credit card theft and inappropriate contact with strangers. Scammers and predators often [target kids](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/kids-action/articles/cyber-threats-lurk-in-kids-gaming-what-parents-should-know) through chat features and build trust so they can take advantage of them, both personally and financially. Remind your children that not everyone they meet online is who they say they are. For their safety, they should only trust the friends they actually know IRL (in real life).
* **Social media dangers:**
  + **Oversharing personal information:** Your child’s classmate screenshots a private message and shares it on social media. It’s a seemingly small act that can have lasting consequences, from public embarrassment to [cyberbullying](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/12/15/teens-and-cyberbullying-2022/). One of the biggest perils of social media can be oversharing personal details. Location tracking and location tagging can expose sensitive information like addresses, schools and current locations. Talk with your kids about keeping private information private by being careful who they chat with and by using location sharing and tagging wisely.
  + **Negative mental health effects**: While there are many rewards to social media, excessive use can have a negative effect on your child’s [mental health](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/social-media-and-mental-health-in-children-and-teens#:~:text=The%20advisory%20indicates%20that%20frequent,to%20social%20punishments%20and%20rewards.). Too much time spent scrolling can lead to social isolation, lack of sleep and lack of outdoor activity. Be sure to talk with you kids about creating healthy digital habits, which includes regular breaks from devices**.**
* **Academic integrity issues:** With AI use on the rise, it’s only fair to expect your kids will use ChatGPT or another AI tool to help with their homework. But it’s important to explain that while AI can be used to help them study, it shouldn’t do their work for them. As AI tools become more sophisticated, so do detection tools that identify plagiarism and other forms of cheating. The same goes for sharing homework or posting test answers online. Make sure your kids know that th...
