Security Operations Center (SOC) teams are facing a fundamentally new challenge — traditional cybersecurity tools are failing to detect advanced adversaries who have become experts at evading endpoint-based defenses and signature-based detection systems. The reality of these “invisible intruders” is driving a significant need for a multi-layered approach to detecting threats, including Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions.

## **The invisible intruder problem**

Imagine your network has been compromised — not today or yesterday, but months ago. Despite your significant investments in security tools running 24/7, an advanced adversary has been quietly moving through your systems, carefully avoiding detection. They've stolen credentials, established backdoors, and exfiltrated sensitive data, all while your dashboards showed nothing but green.

This scenario is not hypothetical. The average dwell time for attackers — the period between initial compromise and detection — still hovers around 21 days in many industries, with some breaches remaining undiscovered for years.

"We hear this story repeatedly from security teams," says [Vince Stoffer, field CTO at Corelight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRoVkfqohaE&utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article-1&utm_campaign=awareness-wave-1), the fastest growing provider of NDR solutions. "They install an NDR solution and immediately discover basic network visibility issues or suspicious activity that's been undiscovered on their networks for months — sometimes years. Adversaries have been conducting reconnaissance, establishing persistence, making lateral moves, and exfiltrating data, all below the detection capabilities of their existing security stack."

The problem lies in how modern attackers operate. Today's sophisticated threat actors don't rely on malware with known signatures or behaviors that trigger endpoint alerts. Instead, they:

* Use living-off-the-land techniques, leveraging legitimate system tools like PowerShell
* Move laterally through networks using stolen but valid credentials
* Communicate through encrypted channels
* Carefully time their activities to blend with normal business operations
* Exploit trusted relationships between systems

These techniques specifically target blind spots in traditional security approaches focused on known indicators of compromise. Signature-based detection and endpoint monitoring simply weren't designed to catch adversaries who operate primarily within legitimate processes and authenticated sessions.

How can NDR address these invisible intruders and help security teams regain control of their systems?

## **What is Network Detection and Response?**

NDR represents an evolution in network security monitoring that goes beyond traditional intrusion detection systems and complements the broader security stack. At their core, [NDR solutions](https://corelight.com/resources/glossary/ndr-network-detection-and-response?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article-1&utm_campaign=awareness-wave-1) capture and analyze raw network traffic and metadata to detect malicious activities, security anomalies, and protocol violations that other security tools might miss.

Unlike legacy network security tools that relied primarily on signatures of known threats, modern NDR incorporates a multi-layered detection strategy:

* Behavioral analytics to identify unusual patterns in network traffic
* Machine learning models that establish baselines and flag deviations
* Protocol analysis that understands the "conversations" happening between systems
* Threat intelligence integration to identify known malicious indicators
* Advanced analytical capabilities for retrospective threat hunting

The "response" element is equally important. NDR platforms provide detailed forensic data for investigations and often include capabilities for automated or guided response actions to contain threats quickly.

## **Why SOC teams are embracing NDR**

The shift toward NDR stems from several fundamental changes in the security landscape that have transformed how organizations approach threat detection.

### **1. Rapidly expanding and diversifying attack surfaces**

Modern enterprise environments have grown exponentially more complex with cloud adoption, containerization, IoT proliferation, and hybrid work models. This expansion has created critical visibility challenges, particularly for lateral movement across environments (east-west traffic) that traditional perimeter-focused tools can miss. NDR provides comprehensive and normalized visibility across these diverse environments, unifying monitoring of on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud infrastructure under a single analytical umbrella.

### **2. Privacy-centric technology evolution**

The widespread adoption of encryption has fundamentally changed security monitoring. With more than 90% of web traffic now encrypted, traditional inspection approaches have become ineffective. Advanced NDR solutions have evolved to analyze encrypted traffic patterns without decryption, maintaining security visibility while respecting privacy through metadata analysis, JA3/JA3S fingerprinting, and other techniques that don't require breaking encryption.

### **3. Unmanageable device proliferation**

The explosion of connected devices — from IoT sensors to operational technology — has created environments where traditional agent-based security is impractical or impossible. NDR's agentless approach provides visibility into ...
