## **Overview**

**How to activate e-mail alerts for utility service monitor?**

## **Usage**

E-mail notifications are preferred for the following processes:

* Match review tasks

* Rule tasks

* Rules approval process

* Terms

* Policy sets

* Policy statements

* Scorecards

## **General Steps**

Appropriate permissions are required to perform this task (For example: Administrator rights to CMC).

There are three steps which needs to be performed in CMC:

*(Configuration of e-mail notifications)*
(i) CMC Users and Groups: User e-mail address for notifications set-up.
(ii) CMC Servers: E-mail notification configuration set-up.

*(Adding applicable e-mail addresses)*
(iii) CMC Information Steward Application: Activating e-mail alerts for utilities.

(Optional) The final step has to be performed in SAP IS, if the default settings are not being changed.
- By default, the email notification is being enabled in SAP IS.
- SAP IS Manage: Set-up general e-mail notification preferences.
