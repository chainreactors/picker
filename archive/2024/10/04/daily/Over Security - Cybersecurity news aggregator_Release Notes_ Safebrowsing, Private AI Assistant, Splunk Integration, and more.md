Release Notes: Safebrowsing, Private AI Assistant, Splunk Integration, and more

Welcome to [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_note_09_24&utm_term=031024&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s monthly updates, where we share our team’s achievements over the past month.

September has been a productive month at ANY.RUN, packed with exciting new features and improvements. We’ve launched **Safebrowsing**, a powerful tool that lets you safely check suspicious URLs in an isolated browser.

In addition to that, we’ve integrated with **Splunk**, enhanced our **sandbox** capabilities, and rolled out new **signatures** and **YARA rules** to help you strengthen your security.

Let’s break down what’s new in ANY.RUN step by step.

## Safebrowsing for Quick URL Checks

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1024x576.png)

We’ve released [**Safebrowsing**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/safebrowsing/), a new tool that allows ANY.RUN users to safely analyze suspicious URLs within a fully interactive, isolated browser. It is a quick and secure way to explore websites and verify potentially malicious content without putting your local system at risk.

You can interact with suspicious links in real time, detect threats using our proprietary technology, and receive detailed reports, including [Indicators of Compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs) and [network traffic analysis](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/analyzing-the-network-stream/).

Now available in free beta for all ANY.RUN users, it adds a new layer of security to your daily operations.

## New Integration with Splunk

In September, ANY.RUN officially launched an [**integration with Splunk**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/splunk-integration/). It brings access to our [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/) and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) directly in the Splunk SOAR environment.

With this integration, Splunk users can now analyze potentially malicious files and URLs in ANY.RUN’s sandbox and enrich their investigations using TI Lookup with comprehensive threat intelligence from TI Lookup—all without leaving Splunk.

**Key features:**

* **Comprehensive threat intelligence:** Query ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence database directly from Splunk SOAR using the ‘get intelligence’ action.

* **Automated malware analysis:** Automatically detonate files and URLs in ANY.RUN’s sandbox as part of a Splunk SOAR playbook.

* **Detailed reporting & IOC extraction:** Quickly retrieve detailed reports and extract IOCs for further threat investigation and response.

* **Advanced threat hunting:** Perform complex queries against ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence database to search for file hashes, IP addresses, domains, and more.

## AI Assistant for Private Sandbox Sessions

We’ve improved the sandbox’s [AI capabilities](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/chatgpt-powered-analysis-method/) by replacing the ChatGPT assistant with our own private AI model. Now you can access AI-powered explanations in both public and private analysis sessions, without worrying about your data going to any third party.

This private AI model is especially useful for those new to the cybersecurity field.

It breaks down complex data quickly, helping you better navigate your analysis and extract useful insights.
