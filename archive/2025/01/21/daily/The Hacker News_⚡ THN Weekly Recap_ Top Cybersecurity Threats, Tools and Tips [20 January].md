As the digital world becomes more complicated, the lines between national security and cybersecurity are starting to fade. Recent cyber sanctions and intelligence moves show a reality where malware and fake news are used as tools in global politics. Every cyberattack now seems to have deeper political consequences. Governments are facing new, unpredictable threats that can't be fought with old-school methods.

To stay ahead, we need to understand how cybersecurity is now tied to diplomacy, where the safety of networks is just as important as the power of words.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**U.S. Treasury Sanctions Chinese and North Korean Entities** ‚Äî The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [leveled sanctions](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/us-sanctions-chinese-cybersecurity-firm.html) against a Chinese cybersecurity company (Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., LTD.) and a Shanghai-based cyber actor (Yin Kecheng) over their alleged links to Salt Typhoon and Silk Typhoon threat clusters. Kecheng was associated with the breach of the Treasury's own network that came to light earlier this month. The department has also [sanctioned](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/us-sanctions-north-korean-it-worker.html) two individuals and four organizations in connection with the North Korean fraudulent IT worker scheme that aims to generate revenue for the country by dispatching its citizens to China and Russia to obtain employment at various companies across the world using false identities.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Sneaky 2FA Phishing Kit Targets Microsoft 365 Accounts** ‚Äî A new adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kit called [Sneaky 2FA](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/new-sneaky-2fa-phishing-kit-targets.html) has seen moderate adoption among malicious actors for its ability to steal credentials and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes from Microsoft 365 accounts since at least October 2024. The phishing kit is also called WikiKit owing to the fact that site visitors whose IP address originates from a data center, cloud provider, bot, proxy, or VPN are directed to a Microsoft-related Wikipedia page. Sneaky 2FA also shares some code overlaps with another phishing kit maintained by the W3LL Store.
* **FBI Deletes PlugX Malware from Over 4,250 Computers** ‚Äî The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/fbi-deletes-plugx-malware-from-4250.html) that a court-authorized operation allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to delete a variant of the PlugX malware from over 4,250 infected computers as part of a "multi-month law enforcement operation." The malware, attributed to the China-nexus Mustang Panda threat actor, is known to spread to other systems via attached USB devices. The disruption is part of a larger effort led by the Paris Prosecutor's Office and cybersecurity firm Sekoia that has resulted in the disinfection payload being sent to 5,539 IP addresses across 10 countries.
* **Russian Hackers Target Kazakhstan With HATVIBE Malware** ‚Äî The Russian threat actor known as UAC-0063 has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/russian-linked-hackers-target.html) to an ongoing cyber espionage campaign targeting Kazakhstan as part of the Kremlin's efforts to gather economic and political intelligence in Central Asia. The spear-phishing attacks leverage lures related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to drop a malware loader named HATVIBE that's then used to deploy a backdoor called CHERRYSPY.
* **Python Backdoor Leads to RansomHub Ransomware** ‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have [detailed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/python-based-malware-powers-ransomhub.html) an attack that started with a SocGholish infection, which then paved the way for a Python backdoor responsible for deploying RansomHub encryptors throughout the entire impacted network. The Python script is essentially a reverse proxy that connects to a hard-coded IP address and allows the threat actor to move laterally in the compromised network using the victim system as a proxy.
* **Google Ads Users Targeted by Malicious Google Ads** ‚Äî In an ironic twist, a new malvertising campaign has been [found](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/google-ads-users-targeted-in.html) targeting individuals and businesses advertising via Google Ads by attempting to phish for their credentials via fraudulent ads on Google. The brazen tactic is being used to hijack advertiser accounts and push more ads to perpetuate the campaign further. Google said the activity violates its policies and it's taking active measures to disrupt it.
