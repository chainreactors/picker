CISO Blueprint: 5 Steps to Enterprise Cyber Threat Resilience

Why are SOC teams still struggling to keep up despite heavy investments in security tools? False positives pile up, evasive threats slip through, and critical alerts often get buried under noise. For CISOs, the challenge¬†is giving teams the visibility and speed they need to respond before damage is done.

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ciso_blueprint&utm_term=300725&utm_content=linktolanding) helps close that gap.¬†**95% of companies using the solution report faster investigations and shorter response times** because their teams aren‚Äôt waiting on static reports or incomplete data. Instead, they get real-time insight into how threats behave, enabling faster decisions, fewer delays, and a measurable boost in SOC performance.

This CISO blueprint outlines five strategic steps to help your [enterprise SOC](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-enterprise-plan/) reach new levels of resilience with proven results.

## Proven Results from the Front Lines of the SOC

Security leaders are seeing real operational gains after integrating ANY.RUN into their workflows.

üèÜ Key ANY.RUN stats

* **90% of companies** report higher detection rates after adopting ANY.RUN
* SOC teams improve performance by **up to 3x**
* **74% of Fortune 100 companies** rely on ANY.RUN in their security operations
* Trusted by **15,000+ organizations** across finance, telecom, retail, government, and healthcare

Take Expertware, for example, [a leading European IT consultancy](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/expertware-success-story/). Facing growing pressure to shorten investigation timelines and scale without hiring, they adopted ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox. What used to take hours of manual work now happens in minutes thanks to real-time, interactive malware analysis.

What changed after implementing ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox?

* **50% reduction** in malware investigation time

* **Improved team collaboration**, with shared reports and interactive analysis reducing handoff delays

* **Deeper threat visibility**, including multi-stage and fileless malware

* **Faster client response**, with clearer reports enabling quicker decision-making

ANY.RUN helped them eliminate the overhead of manual setups while improving threat clarity, leading to stronger security outcomes for both their team and their clients.

## 1. Deploy Real-Time Threat Analysis for Early Detection

When time is everything, waiting on static scans or post-execution reports just doesn‚Äôt cut it. To respond effectively, SOCs need a clear view of the threat as it happens.

ANY.RUN‚Äôs sandbox delivers that clarity through¬†**live detonation**, giving your team an immediate look at the full scope of any malware or phishing attack. From execution flow to network connections and dropped payloads, everything is visible in real time.

What sets ANY.RUN sandbox apart is [interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/). Analysts can¬†**engage with the sample mid-execution,** clicking buttons, opening files, entering credentials, just like a real user. That means no waiting for analysis to complete and no relying on partial data. Threat behavior becomes obvious in seconds, allowing your team to move faster and with greater confidence.

## 2. Automate Triage to Reduce Analyst Workload and Alert Fatigue

Not all threats reveal themselves with a simple scan. Many phishing kits and malware samples are designed to evade detection unless specific user actions are taken, like solving a CAPTCHA, clicking a hidden button, or opening a malicious link embedded in a QR cod...
