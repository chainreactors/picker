# Description

This tool dynamically calls MiniDumpWriteDump to dump lsass memory content. This process is done without opening a new process handle to lsass and using [DInvoke\_rs](https://github.com/Kudaes/DInvoke_rs) to make it harder to detect its malicious behaviour. In order to obtain a valid process handle without calling OpenProcess over lsass, all process handles in the system are analyzed using NtQuerySystemInformation, NtDuplicateObject, NtQueryObject and QueryFullProcessImageNameW.

NTFS Transaction are used in order to xor the memory dump before storing it on disk or sending it throught HTTP.

**Support added for both x86 and x64**.

# Compilation

Just compile the code on `release` mode and execute it:

```
C:\Users\User\Desktop\Dumpy\dumpy> cargo build --release
C:\Users\User\Desktop\Dumpy\dumpy\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release> dumpy.exe -h
```

In case that you want to compile the tool for a x86 system, modify the value of the option "targ...
