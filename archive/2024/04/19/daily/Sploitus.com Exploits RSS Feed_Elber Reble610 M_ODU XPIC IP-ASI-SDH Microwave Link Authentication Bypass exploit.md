Elber Reble610 M/ODU XPIC IP-ASI-SDH Microwave Link Authentication Bypass

Vendor: Elber S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.elber.it
Affected version: 0.01 Revision 0

Summary: The REBLE610 features an accurate hardware design, absence of
internal cabling and full modularity. The unit is composed by a basic
chassis with 4 extractable boards which makes maintenance and critical
operations, like frequency modification, easy and efficient. The modular
approach has brought to the development of the digital processing module
(containing modulator, demodulator and data interface) and the RF module
(containing Transmitter, Receiver and channel filters). From an RF point
of view, the new transmission circuitry is able to guarantee around 1 Watt
with every modulation scheme, introducing, in addition, wideband precorrection
(up to 1GHz depending on frequency band).

Desc: The device suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability through
a direct and unauthorized access to the password management functionality. The
issue allows attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the set_pwd
endpoint that enables them to overwrite the password of any user within the
system. This grants unauthorized and administrative access to protected areas
of the application compromising the device's system security.
