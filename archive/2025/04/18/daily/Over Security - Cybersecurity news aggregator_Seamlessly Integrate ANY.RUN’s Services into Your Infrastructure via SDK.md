To get maximum value out of our solutions, we provide them with API, a tool enabling users to [integrate](https://any.run/integrations) our services into their security infrastructure. And now, to make this process even smoother, we introduce a [software development kit (SDK)](https://github.com/anyrun/anyrun-sdk).

With it, it’s even easier to make ANY.RUN a part of your security system. Data provided by our solutions will help you establish a safer infrastructure and improve the defense strategy of your company.

An SDK is a tool that helps increase the efficiency of your workflow through integration and automation. It simplifies day-to-day tasks for cybersecurity specialists at companies and organizations. This is especially relevant for small security teams who could benefit from automation.

As a result of making ANY.RUN’s products a part of your security infrastructure via an SDK, you can:

* **Simplify and speed up** malware analysis and threat hunting for your security team.
* **Automate routine tasks** to save resources for manual in-depth investigation.

* **Reduce the cost** of alert triage, incident investigation, and post-attack response.
* **Mitigate financial and reputational risks** by equipping your defense with advanced solutions for threat analysis and detection.

Our SDK simplifies integration of ANY.RUN’s products into your infrastructure. You can use it for enhanced flexibility, accelerated workflow, and automation of daily tasks.
