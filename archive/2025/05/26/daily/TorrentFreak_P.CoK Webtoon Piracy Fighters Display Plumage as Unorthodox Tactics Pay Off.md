# P.CoK Webtoon Piracy Fighters Display Plumage as Unorthodox Tactics Pay Off

The anti-piracy team at Kakao Entertainment likes to stand out and not just when there's good news to report. Like the avian beauty that inspired its name, P.CoK's approach is part eye-catching, part distraction, but it does appear to be working. With help from what it describes as an underground network of volunteer informants, P.CoK claims to have shut down 28 pirate sites. It also posts 'insider' evidence and items of proof to social media, to dispel any lingering doubt.

Yet back in the real world, the insatiable appetite for pirated content owned or protected by the latter, means the war never ends, only the shape changes. Whether South Korean publishing company Kakao Entertainment had always intended to do something different isn’t clear, but when it comes to presentation, no equivalent approach to fighting piracy exists at scale anywhere else.

## The Krew

Launched in 2021 to proactively protect Kakao Entertainment’s ‘webtoon’ comic library, the new ‘P.CoK’ anti-piracy unit’s name was inspired by the ‘eyes’ on a peacock’s feathers.

“We’re always on the lookout for illegal use of Kakao Entertainment’s exclusive content worldwide,” the Kakao ‘Krew’ explained in 2023.

P.CoK conceded that it couldn’t yet put a figure on the scale of the piracy it was addressing or the monetary value of any losses attributable to it. Of course, even the wider industry has to settle for best estimates, so a fairly blunt but honest admission was fundamentally credible, yet also quite rare.

At the time, forming a complete database of pirate sites responsible for sharing Kakao content remained a work in progress. On the prevention side, P.CoK reported working with watermarking, image recognition, and usage pattern analysis, which helped the team “keep an eye on things and nip illegal activity in the bud.”

## Complete the Quest, Level Up

Like much of the corporate world, anti-piracy work and how it’s presented to the outside world may at times undergo a little cosmetic filtering, to send the right message or benefit from being seen in a particular light.

Due to the nature of the work there may be an element of misdirection, especially when the target audience are those the company and often the police are determined to catch.

In P.CoK’s case, some things that are so neat and perfect, you really, *really* want them to be true. Maybe they are.

## Piracy Culture, Videogame Culture? No Problem

As presented, there are three people in the team, all quite young with great names – Xeno, Hani, and Jeno. These people undoubtedly understand Kakao’s audience, especially those who prefer not to pay.

P.CoK also enjoys webtoons and without getting too personal, one spent a number of years as a webtoon producer. Then the icing on the cake – at least two are gamers. One likens shutting down a site to “clearing a stage” in a game and the other focuses on anti-piracy strategic planning and then “leveling up after completing a quest.”

*Update: An earlier version of this article described a team member as a ‘webtoon artist’. P.CoK informs us they actually worked for several years as a webtoon producer. “He was notably involved in producing globally recognized titles such as Itaewon Class and Burning Effect,” P.CoK clarifies.*

## Documenting Progress

The publication of an anti-piracy white paper every six months (Sixth Edition [here](https://newsroom.kakaoent.com/news/6th-anti-piracy-whitepaper-kakao-entertainment-launches-1st-ever-comprehensive-crackdown-system-for-webtoons-and-web-novels-blocks-240-million-illegal-cases/)) provides an overview of progress and challenges in Kakao’s fight against piracy.

As reported in February’s edition, *a total of 240 million illegal content removals worldwide in the second half of 2024* contributed to a *grand total of 740 million removals overall*. This was made possible by Kakao’s Trusted Copyright Removal Program (TCRP) status at Google, and the small matter of *filing 30,000 takedown requests every day*.

Some rightsholders use their takedown notice volumes as a proxy for progress in the fight against piracy; at least in the beginning, the removal of a million links to pirated content tends to speak for itself. Yet when Kakao mentions a 10.9% decrease in takedown notices in its sixth White Paper, compared to the number cited in the fifth, the reduction represents progress instead.

The decline was largely attributed to P.CoK’s long-term monitoring and the subsequent shutdown of a “major domestic” pirate site. Kakao identifies the platform as site “A”, almost certainly a reference to Agitoon and the linked Agitoon Novel sites shut down in a law enforcement operation last August.

“The case underscores the critical role of site shutdowns in reducing overall piracy activity,” Kakao noted in February. “Kakao Entertainment has consistently emphasized that shutting down a site by identifying its operator is at the core of its response to illegal distribution.”

Rare outlier examples aside, when a site operator’s anonymity is compromised, that can forever change the game. Anti-piracy outfits tend to keep unmasking details secret for operational reasons. P.CoK likes to tell those stories on social media.

## Raising Awareness, Recruiting Informants

![p-cok-9a](https://torrentfreak.com/images/p-cok-9a.png)
The theory that raising awareness of piracy discourages illegal consumption, is being tested in several ongoing campaigns. Spreading the message that piracy hurts everyone involved in creating webtoons, is one of P.CoK’s responsibilities.

The day-to-day platform of choice for raising awareness is Twitter. At what point spreading the gospel of Kindness to Creators began its transformation isn’t clear, but today the [P.CoK account on X](https://x.com/kakaoent_pcok) is much more than that.

Acting as a notice board for P.CoK’s anti-piracy activities and the availability of legal content, the channel also encourages webtoon fans to report links to illegal content, wherever they exist online.

For fans and supporters prepared to go further, P.CoK’s channel on X acts as a recruitment office for informants. After obtaining useful information from piracy circles, they head back to base where the information is relayed to P.CoK for enforcement purposes.

Having gathered a number of willing informants over the last couple of years, P.CoK claims to have built an underground network that actively supports its *One Point Response System*.

## Shutting Sites Down Using Any Legal Means

Traditional wisdom suggests that revealing details of an anti-piracy enforcement plan up front may introduce unnecessary risk. Yet having shared the d...
