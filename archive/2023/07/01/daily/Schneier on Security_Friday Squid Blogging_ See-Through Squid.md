## Friday Squid Blogging: See-Through Squid

*Doryteuthis opalescens* is known as the market squid, and was [critical](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/albino-squid-rna-editing/) in the recent squid RNA research.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

I definitely have no verifiable source; there is a dumb meme going around claiming how any Wi-Fi router can be used to image people inside a room (the concept appeared in a Batman movie way back). It is very non-specific, like; “…so what scientists did…”, then of course “…using AI…” (somebody else noted this hook). I do not want to repeat the meme source. Otherwise, we might amplify the noise-to-boredom ratio.

@ Clive, ALL

As I expected would happen months ago, Twiiter broke nitter.

Threadreaderapp compile function is probably broken too now.

You can see two different stack traces but the end result in an unexpected EOF.

“Data in flight” vs. “Data At Rest”:

> New Jersey cops must apply for a wiretap order — not just a warrant — for near-continual snooping on suspects’ Facebook accounts, according to a unanimous ruling by that US state’s Supreme Court.

hXXps://www.theregister.com/2023/06/30/new\_jersey\_cops\_facebook\_wiretap/

Seems this sort of loophole in the law is going to be exploited more and more, since all data is at rest at some point in some timeframe. J.

Not directly related to security.

@Jon
“turn over access to a user’s future posts”

Objection, invokes violation of the timeline.

@lurker

Indeed, and that is one of my major objections.

I don’t have a problem with the fundamental idea that the government, in order to enforce the law, has certain powers. What does furiously piss me off, though, is that there’s no serious consequences for filing bogus warrants and wiretap orders.

So Detective Alice files whatever, and Judge Bob signs it, and off it goes. Maybe it’ll be vacated ten years from now? Who cares? Well, Charlie, who has spent those last ten years in jail because the cops themselves broke the law might care. Yes, getting exonerated is nice – not getting incarcerated the first time is better.

And even if so, Alice doesn’t care. She’s not going to jail for writing a bogus warrant, and neither is Bob.

Only Charlie has to do time, and maybe if he’s lucky he’ll get reimbursed for his time – from the taxpayers, not Alice nor Bob.

Circling back, yes, that does violate the timeline, and it was stomped upon. But there weren’t any meaningful consequences for the people who wrote it in the first place – only the guys who got stuck with it.

@lurker: Objection, invokes violation of the timeline.

You have violated Robot’s Rules of Order and must leave the future immediately.

This scenario is possible, indeed a 50 GW system consisting of three cascaded meter-long units was recently reported by Rukin and colleagues.

If operating the same system with pulsed emission, the average power to generate 10 pulses/s each of 1 microsecond in duration requires only a 1 W generator in principle. This power requirement makes a much smaller transmitting system, perhaps battery operated, more feasible. If the transmitter can produce even shorter pulses, e.g., with 10 picoseconds (ps) rise times, the range might extend from 50 m to 150 m. The Rukin system produces 170 ps pulses.

…At much closer ranges, a defined target area naturally exists in the near field of antenna because nonpropagating fields exist with field strengths that fall off rapidly in proportion to the inverse cube of the distance (1/r 3 ).

The tradeoffs between range and target area suggest that pulsed systems are more feasible than continuous-wave systems because of the number of controllable parameters in pulsed systems. They also have a smaller size, weight, and power for a given biological effect capability at range.

Operating at lower powers or dealing with attenuation by walls does not make the system ineffective. Voltage differences across tissues produce currents and affect cell function.

Voltages of < 10 V/m can stimulate neurons, and even lower amplitudes (tens of mV) combined with low pulse repetition frequencies that are matched to biologically relevant signals may cause interference. There is evidence for this interference, but it needs to be verified.

Some materials, such as metals, will strongly shield the signal, although radiofrequency energy can diffract around the edges and can still expose individuals behind the shielding, albeit at a much lower level. Common building materials provide some attenuation, depending upon thickness and material properties. Materials such as concrete will reduce the signal more than materials ...
