### Understanding the Value of Findings Clients Often Question

In some report readouts, we may encounter situations where a client looks at a web application report and asks, “Why are you even reporting that?” This blog explores why we include certain findings that, from a client’s perspective, may not seem severe or even relevant, but still have value from a security and consulting standpoint.

From a consultant's perspective, when we’re engaged in a web application assessment and we’re not finding critical or high-severity vulnerabilities, we may still report on best practice or low-severity issues. This isn't filler. It’s about delivering value, even when there's little to no obvious threat. No consultant wants to deliver a report that simply says, “We couldn’t find anything.” In most cases, we can identify some best practice gaps or minor vulnerabilities worth noting.

Now, if we do find multiple high-severity issues, those understandably become the focus of the report. But depending on the scope and length of the engagement, we may still include other, less-severe findings when appropriate.

### Why Some Findings Stay in the Report

One reason clients may question certain findings is that we often don't have full visibility into their organization's security culture or threat model. As consultants, our default stance is conservative; we assume you're hiring us to uncover and report on as many valid issues as possible within the scope of the engagement.

It’s common for us to present conservative findings to organizations with a more liberal or risk-tolerant approach. If those findings feel out of place or excessive to you, that’s something we can absolutely adjust, after the fact, or ideally during the engagement planning phase.

### But It’s in Dev/Staging...

Another common objection: “That’s just in the dev or QA environment.” While it’s true that development systems often carry different threat profiles, findings in those environments may still be relevant, especially if the systems are Internet-facing. If your staging or QA instance is publicly accessible, attackers can reach it too.

Once an attacker gains a foothold, they can often pivot internally. From our standpoint, any Internet-exposed system is fair game and should be hardened appropriately.

### Examples of Findings That Get Pushback

One of the most common moments of pushback during readouts comes when clients see findings they don’t consider important. Things like autocomplete being enabled on sensitive fields often get dismissed as minor, but they can actually lead to credential leakage, especially on shared machines or compromised browsers. Imagine someone logging in to an application on a hotel lobby kiosk and accidentally saving their credentials; the next user could stumble right into that account.

Another one is missing security headers, things like ***X-Content-Type-Options***, ***Strict-Transport-Security***, ***X-Frame-Options***, or ***Content-Security-Policy***. Clients will say, “We’re not a bank, do we really need this?” But those headers protect against very real attacks like MIME-type confusion, clickjacking, a...
