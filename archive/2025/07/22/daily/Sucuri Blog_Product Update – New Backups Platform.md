![Product Update - New Backups Platform](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Product-Update-New-Backups-Platform-820x385.png)

Sucuri is pleased to announce the completion of a product upgrade with our new Backups platform. For those already subscribed to our Backups platform, you will begin to see (over the next week or so), a new destination for where to access your new Backups. For those who have never purchased our Backups before, you will automatically be routed to the new experience moving forward.

Some of the exciting new improvements made to the platform include:

* Additional frequency options (now adding 12-hour and 6-hour schedules)
* Ability to select storage region of your Backups
* Easier navigation through your files & database for exclusion purposes

One thing to note is that as we migrate to the new platform, we will retain the previous 90 days worth of existing Backups in the event you or our support team need to refer back to that. If you have questions pertaining to that, feel free to submit a [support ticket](https://support.sucuri.net/support/new-support-ticket/) with our Website Backups team.

## Where To Go?

This change will mark the beginning of a shift to a new dashboard area known as “My Sites”, that you can already access here: <https://sec.sucuri.net/>

If you have moved over to the new Backups experience, you will see the list of sites there and you can select the icon for Backups which will route you to the new experience.

![website list](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/website-list.png)

From there, you should see the Backups profile as shown below that have the features you are already familiar with (Restore Backup, Download Backup, etc.) with the additional Settings found in the ellipsis icon at the top right.

## Things To Be Aware Of:

With every big change, there are a few items to be aware of:

* **E-mail notifications:** These will be paused during this change (until everything has been finalized and we have monitored for no disruptions or errors). Those notifications will resume at a later date.
* **Cron Jobs:** The feature of cron job database backup will no longer be available in the updated backup dashboard. It will be very important to turn these cron jobs off and manage the database backups so the hosting server does not fill up its disk usage.

If you have any other questions or concerns, always feel free to contact us and we’ll be happy to help!
