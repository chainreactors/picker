# AI-powered stuffed animals: A good alternative for screen time?

Posted: August 19, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Are [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) (Artificial Intelligence)-powered stuffed animals really the best alternative to screen time that we want to offer our children?

Some AI startups think so. One of those startups is Curio, a company that describes itself as “a magical workshop where toys come to life.” Curio offers three different AI powered plushies named Grem, Gabbo, and Grok (not related to the xAI).

The concept of AI-powered playmates sounds like a dream (at least to some parents). There’s less screen time, which encourages imaginative play, and children can have cuddly friend that can answer questions, tell stories, and even engage in conversations.

Earlier, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/mattels-going-to-make-ai-powered-toys-kids-rights-advocates-are-worried) about Mattel’s plans to create AI-powered toys, and how advocacy groups responded, quick to denounce the move. Robert Weissman, co-president of public rights advocacy group Public Citizen, commented:

> “Mattel should announce immediately that it will not incorporate [AI technology](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) into children’s toys. Children do not have the cognitive capacity to distinguish fully between reality and play.”

Similarly, when Amanda Hess reported on the oncoming wave of AI-powered toys, including Curio’s “Grem,” she wrote in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/arts/ai-toys-curio-grem.html) (NYT) about how the doll tried to build a connection between itself and her by remarking on one of their similarities—having freckles:

> “‘I have dots that grow on me, and I get more as I get older, too,’ I said.
>
> ‘That’s so cool,’ said Grem. ‘We’re like dot buddies.’
>
> I flushed with self-conscious surprise. The [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot) generated a point of connection between us, then leaped to seal our alliance. Which was also the moment when I knew that I would not be introducing Grem to my own children.”

This event for Hess planted an understanding that the toy was not an upgrade to the lifeless teddy bear. It’s more like a replacement for the caregiver. As one of the founders of Curio explained to the NYT, the plushie should be viewed as a sidekick for the child who could make children’s play more stimulating, so that you, the parent, “don’t feel like you have to be sitting them in front of a TV or something.”

But children lack the cognitive abilities to separate fantasy from reality in the ways adults do, [say researchers at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-69362-5_83). And handing them AI powered toys with human-like voices might only blur that line further, which could interfere with their social development and instead have them form emotional bonds with computer-generated code.

When the unsupervised use of [AI chatbots can drive a 14-year old to suicide](https://apnews.com/article/chatbot-ai-lawsuit-suicide-teen-artificial-intelligence-9d48adc572100822fdbc3c90d1456bd0), do we want to deprive small children of having real-life friends and trust them with AI toys? It’s a question that parents might have to answer quite soon.

## How to stay on the safe side

AI-powered toys are coming, like it or not. But b...
