Let's be honest: if you're one of the first (or *the* first) security hires at a small or midsize business, chances are you're also the unofficial CISO, SOC, IT Help Desk, and whatever additional roles need filling. You're not running a security department. You are THE security department. You're getting pinged about RFPs in one area, and reviewing phishing alerts in another, all while sifting through endless FP alerts across the board. The tools meant to help are often creating more work than they solve. Security teams end up choosing between letting things slip or becoming the "Department of No."

Chances are you inherited your company's Google Workspace. Thankfully, Google handles the infrastructure, the uptime, and the spam filtering. But while Google takes care of a lot, it doesn't cover everything, and it can be difficult for security teams to operationalize all of Google's underlying capabilities without significant engineering work. It's your job to secure the perimeter, even when the perimeter is practically everywhere.

Even with limited time and personnel, you can leverage Google's excellent security foundations to get the most out of the tools at your disposal. So where do you start?

## **Identity is Your First Line of Defense**

The concept of a traditional security perimeter has faded in the era of cloud-native work. Firewalls and physical network boundaries no longer define the edges of your environment. We've been calling identity the "new" perimeter for over a decade: it determines who has access, from where, and under what circumstances. This makes identity protection the most critical layer in your security strategy. When identity controls are weak or misconfigured, an attacker does not need to break into your systems. They simply log in. Every action beyond that point is implicitly trusted.

### **What to do:**

* **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** — MFA is table stakes at this point, but it's worth reinforcing: a strong authentication strategy begins with requiring multi-factor authentication for all users, without exception. This includes executives, administrators, contractors, and part-time staff. MFA adds an essential layer of security that protects against the most common attack vector: stolen credentials.

  Configuration should be enforced through either Google Workspace directly or a third-party identity provider (IdP) that supports conditional access and stronger policy enforcement. Regular reviews of MFA enrollment status across user groups should also be conducted–including GWS Super Admins to ensure they're not bypassing IdP and MFA.
* **Use Context-Aware Access** — Google's context-aware access policies should be implemented to evaluate the trustworthiness of each access request in real-time. These policies allow restrictions based on device type, geographic location, IP address, and user role. For example, access to administrative functions or sensitive documents can be limited to managed devices within trusted regions. Context-aware access enhances the granularity of access control beyond a simple username and password, reducing the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials.
* **Minimize Admin Access** **—** A robust access control model should follow the principle of least privilege. Administrator privileges should be carefully scoped and assigned only when absolutely necessary. It is important to regularly audit administrative roles and permissions to ensure they align with current responsibilities (there comes a time in every startup's maturity curve where you have to decide whether the founders still need Super Admin access). Temporary elevation of privileges should be preferred over permanent admin access. Audit logs can provide visibility into how and when administrative roles are used, helping to identify misuse or overprovisioning.

### **Why it matters:**

Most attacks begin with stolen credentials. If identity is weak, everything else falls apart like a Jenga tower. MFA and device-aware access are your way of adding glue between the pieces.

## **Email Is a Great Asset… and Liability**

Email is the nervous system of your organization, but it's also the front door for attackers. Phishing, social engineering, invoice fraud, and business email compromise remain at the top of threat reports for a reason. It all starts through Gmail.

### **What to do:**

* **Enable Enhanced Gmail Protections** **—** Google's advanced phishing and malware protections should be enabled to reduce exposure to common email-based attacks. These features are located within the Admin console under Gmail > Safety, though they may not be activated by default. Default configurations often require additional review to ensure that all protections are fully utilized. Regular audits of these settings can help confirm that security baselines are consistently applied across the organization.
* **Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** **—** The implementation of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols is essential for preventing domain spoofing and impersonation attacks. These technologies act as authentication checkpoints for incoming and outgoing emails, validating that messages are truly coming from legitimate sources. Google Workspace includes built-in tools for configuration, but careful setup and ongoing monitoring are necessary to ensure proper alignment with your domain settings. Periodic testing of these configurations can identify...
