The Damn Vulnerable Drone is an intentionally vulnerable drone hacking simulator based on the popular ArduPilot/MAVLink architecture, providing a realistic environment for hands-on drone hacking.

## What is the Damn Vulnerable Drone?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone is a virtually simulated environment designed for offensive security professionals to safely learn and practice drone hacking techniques. It simulates real-world [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/ "ArduPilot") & [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/ "MAVLink") drone architectures and [vulnerabilities](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/vulnerabilities "vulnerabilities"), offering a hands-on experience in exploiting drone systems.

## Why was it built?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone aims to enhance offensive security skills within a controlled environment, making it an invaluable tool for intermediate-level security professionals, pentesters, and hacking enthusiasts.

Similar to how pilots utilize flight simulators for training, we can use the Damn Vulnerable Drone simulator to gain in-depth knowledge of real-world drone systems, understand their vulnerabilities, and learn effective methods to exploit them.

The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform is open-source and available at no cost and was specifically designed to address the substantial expenses often linked with drone hardware, hacking tools, and maintenance. Its cost-free nature allows users to immerse themselves in drone hacking without financial concerns. This accessibility makes the Damn Vulnerable Drone a crucial resource for those in the fields of information security and penetration testing, promoting the development of offensive [cybersecurity](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Cybersecurity "cybersecurity") skills in a safe environment.

## How does it work?

The Damn Vulnerable Drone platform operates on the principle of [Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html "Software-in-the-Loop (SITL)"), a simulation technique that allows users to run drone software as if it were executing on an actual drone, thereby replicating authentic drone behaviors and responses.

ArduPilot's SITL allows for the execution of the drone's firmware within a virtual environment, mimicking the behavior of a real drone without the need for physical hardware. This simulation is further enhanced with Gazebo, a dynamic 3D robotics simulator, which provides a realistic environment and physics engine for the drone to interact with. Together, ArduPilot's SITL and Gazebo lay the foundation for a sophisticated and authentic drone simulation experience.

While the current Damn Vulnerable Drone setup doesn't mirror every drone architecture or configuration, the integrated tactics, techniques and scenarios are broadly applicable across various drone systems, models and communication protocols.

## Features

* **Docker-based Environment**: Runs in a completely virtualized docker-based setup, making it accessible and safe for drone hacking experimentation.
* **Simulated Wireless Networking**: Simulated Wifi (802.11) interfaces to practice wireless drone attacks.
* **Onboard Camera Streaming & Gimbal**: Simulated RTSP drone onboard camera stream with gimbal and companion computer integration.
* **Companion Computer Web Interface**: Companion Computer configuration management via web interface and simulated serial connection to Flight Controller.
* **QGroundControl/MAVProxy Integration**: One-click QGroundControl UI launching (only supported on x86 architecture) with MAVProxy GCS integration.
* **MAVLink Router Integration**: Telemetry forwarding via MAVLink Router on the Companion Computer Web Interface.
* **Dynamic Flight Logging**: Fully dynamic Ardupilot flight bin logs stored on a simulated SD Card.
* **Management Web Console**: Simple to use simulator management web console used to trigger scenarios and drone flight states.
* **Comprehensive Hacking Scenarios**: Ideal for practicing a wide range of drone hacking techniques, from basic reconnaissance to advanced exploitation.
* **Detailed Walkthroughs**: If you need help hacking against a particular scenario you can leverage the detailed walkthrough documentation as a spoiler.
