# Facial recognition: Where and how you can opt out

Posted: June 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Our remote team recently took a trip to our Estonian office. When we arrived from our various destinations, we started chatting about how our travel had been. Our senior privacy advocate, David Ruiz, mentioned that he’d opted out of facial recognition while at San Francisco International Airport.

However, not everyone on the team knew this was even A Thing, and that made us think…maybe not all of our readers know either. So we looked into where and how you can opt out of [facial recognition](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/11/what-is-facial-recognition)—a technology that’s becoming increasingly common in many aspects of everyday life.

## Airports and border control

This one is relatively straightforward. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) actively deploys one of the most visible and widespread uses of facial recognition in the US, especially at airports. Over 80 major airports have installed facial recognition cameras at security checkpoints to verify traveler identities quickly and without physical contact. The process involves a camera taking a photo of your face and matching it in real time to the photo on your passport or ID card.

What many people don’t realize is participation in this facial recognition screening is voluntary. If you prefer not to have your face scanned, you can [opt out](https://www.travelandleisure.com/how-to-opt-out-tsa-facial-recognition-at-airport-11726739). The TSA allows travelers to do this by choosing an alternative identity check, such as a manual ID inspection by a TSA officer. David said he simply asked, “Hey, can I opt out?” and there was no significant delay in his screening process.

The TSA officer must honor your request to opt out, and provide an alternative method. Although signage about this choice exists, it’s often subtle or easy to miss, so it’s best to know your rights before you arrive.

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also uses facial recognition at departure gates and border crossings to verify identities. Like at TSA checkpoints, you can opt out. When you reach the gate, ask for manual identity verification instead of having your photo taken. This opt-out option applies to both US citizens and noncitizens.

## Where else can you opt out?

Outside of airports and border control, facial recognition is increasingly found in various public and private settings, including stores, stadiums, and even some workplaces. However, the ability to opt out in these contexts varies widely depending on local laws, company policies, and the technology used.

Facial recognition technology has rapidly expanded across the United States, prompting a patchwork of national and state-level regulations, as well as growing public debate about privacy, civil rights, and the right to opt out. At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive law that expressly regulates the use of facial recognition by government agencies.

However, in September 2024, the US Commission on Civil Rights [highlighted](https://www.usccr.gov/news/2024/us-commission-civil-rights-releases-report-civil-rights-implications-federal-use-facial) the significant risks of unregulated facial recognition, particularly for marginalized communities, and called for rigorous testing, transparency, and prompt action in...
