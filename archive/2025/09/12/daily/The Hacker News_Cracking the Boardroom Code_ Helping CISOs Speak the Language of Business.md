CISOs know their field. They understand the threat landscape. They understand how to build a strong and cost-effective security stack. They understand how to staff out their organization. They understand the intricacies of compliance. They understand what it takes to reduce risk. Yet one question comes up again and again in our conversations with these security leaders: *how do I make the impact of risk clear to business decision-makers?*

Boards want to hear how risk affects revenue, governance, and growth. They have a limited attention span for lists of vulnerabilities or technical details. When the story gets too technical, even urgent initiatives lose traction and fail to get funded.

CISOs need to translate technical issues into terms the board understands. Doing so builds trust, garners support and shows how security decisions connect directly to long-term growth. It was the urgent need to bridge the CISO-Board communication gap that led us to create a new paradigm in CISO continuing education: *Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs*.

## **The Disconnect Between Boards and CISOs**

Boards are increasingly held accountable for cyber risk. [SEC rules](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-139) require public companies to disclose cyber incidents within four business days and to describe board cyber oversight in annual reports. In the EU, [NIS2](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) holds management bodies directly responsible for cybersecurity measures, with penalties up to €10 million or 2% of global turnover.

Boards track governance, liability, and enterprise value. CISOs present threats, vulnerabilities, and controls. Surveys confirm this gap: [Gartner's 2024 Board of Directors Survey](https://www.gartner.com/document-reader/document/5717251?ref=pubsite) reports that 84% of directors classify cybersecurity as a business risk, yet research finds that only about half of boards rate their understanding as strong enough for effective oversight.

CISO-Board alignment has never been more important, but the two sides still speak different languages. This challenge surfaced so often in our conversations with security leaders that it led us to a simple conclusion: if so many experienced professionals need this skill, *it should be taught.*

## **Teaching How to Close the Boardroom Gap**

The goal was clear: boards need insights that connect cyber risk to business outcomes. *Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs* was built from scratch to help security leaders meet that need.

The course teaches CISOs how to reframe their message in ways that resonate with directors. It focuses on practical skills: moving beyond vanity metrics to dashboards that answer the "So what?" question, building concise presentations that boards can act on, anticipating and managing difficult questions, and framing budget requests in financial and strategic terms. The course also introduces Continuous Threat Exposure Management as a model for presenting risk in a structured, forward-looking way.

Each of the five lessons is designed to be practical and easy to apply. Participants leave with methods and templates they can use in their next board meeting. The key areas of focus include:

* **The Board's View of Risk**: What directors focus on and how to frame security as an enabler of safe innovation and competitive advantage.
* **Clear Risk Communication**: Moving past vanity metrics by building dashboards that tell a risk story that ties technical findings to business impact.
* **High-Impact Presentations**: Creating concise, effective board presentations, aligning with key executives in advance, and handling difficult questions with confidence.
* **Stronger Business Cases**: Translating security needs into financial and strategic language. Building requests around risk reduction value, total cost of ownership, and alignment with company objectives.
* **Operationalizing CTEM**: Applying the five stages of Continuous Threat Exposure Management to strengthen security posture and structure reporting in a forward-looking way.

The course is led by Dr. Gerald Auger, whose career spans more than twenty years in both industry and academia. He served as cybersecurity architect for a major medical center and has taught tens of thousands of students through his Simply Cyber platform. His mix of practical and teaching experience makes the course grounded, relevant, and directly useful for CISOs in the boardroom.

## **The Bottom Line**

Cybersecurity is at the center of business oversight. Boards expect insight that is clear and actionable, and CISOs need to present risk in terms that connect directly to governance, finance, and strategy. *Risk Reporting to the Board for Modern CISOs* was designed with these challenges in mind. The course gives security leaders practical tools to translate their expertise into language the board can act on.

When CISOs build these skills, they move from talking about technical metrics to explaining risk in terms that link to business goals and show how security drives long-term growth. That leads to clearer conversations with directors, steadier support for security programs, and a stronger role for cybersecurity in the company's overall strategy.
