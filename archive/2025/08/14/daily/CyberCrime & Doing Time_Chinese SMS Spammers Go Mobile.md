In many countries, notably NOT the United States, government telecom regulations has made a significant impact on scammers by blocking the scam and fraud campaigns being sent via SMS messaging.  The response to these blockages has been the use of mobile base stations.  The technique turns a vehicle into a mobile cell phone tower, allowing it to send SMS messages directly, bypassing cell phone company's ability to block the messages. But the downside is that, depending on the power used, there is a limit to the range from 100 yards to a couple miles.

In this case, the scammers were recruited in a Chinese WeChat channel where they were contracted by the scammer and trained how to install and set up their mobile station, which they installed in a small Mazda.  Their rig was on the low end, with a limited number of SIM cards, but was still able to send 20,000 SMS messages per day.

In November 2024, the Thai Royal Police picked up a much larger rig that was operating from a van being driven by a 35-year old Chinese national, Yang Muyi.  This device sent over a million messages in a three day period before being seized by police, as revealed in a press conference by [Police Lt. General Thatchai Pitaneelabut](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2907107/police-bust-two-chinese-syndicates).

Thai police have been greatly assisted in their investigations by a partnership with AIS (Advanced Info Systems) who have been helping them locate the false base stations. The image below shows the rig seized in a Honda CRV in January 2025 driven by two Chinese men, aged 47 and 49.  Police then went to the apartment where additional mobile phones, SIM cards and other telecom equipment was seized.

One of the UK-based cases above happened in June 2025, with the investigation beginning when a local police officer received an SMS message claiming to be from HMRC - His Majesty's Revenues & Customs - the UK tax office. Their investigation identified Chinese student Ruichen Xiong who had been driving around London with a generator and an SMS blaster in his vehicle.

### "Captured SMS Blasting"

The use of "captured SMS blasting" started in China where local advertisers used the technique to push advertisements for their store or services only to phones that are physically close to their location.  But scammers quickly realized there was a far more lucrative market by using the service to drive calls to fraud call centers!

The "3" over Beijing, China in this map actually goes back as far as 2014.  One of those three is a story from 2014 about [Beijing police making 1,530 arrests](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-arrests-1500-people-sending-spam-text-messages-fake-mobile-base-stations-1442099) and seizing 2,600 SMS Blasting devices! Already then, several of the text messages were imitating financial institutions, claiming a phone was infected with malware, or that their AliPay password had been changed.
