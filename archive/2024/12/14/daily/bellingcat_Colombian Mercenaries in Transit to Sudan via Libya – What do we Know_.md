# Colombian Mercenaries in Transit to Sudan via Libya - What do we Know?

December 13, 2024

A video of some rocky outcrops in the Libyan desert geolocated by Bellingcat may hold clues about the journey of a missing Colombian who is among several reportedly recruited and sent to Sudan’s civil war, where his fate remains unknown.

According to reports by Colombian [media](https://www.lasillavacia.com/silla-nacional/me-quiero-devolver-hay-mas-de-300-exmilitares-colombianos-en-la-guerra-de-sudan/) and the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/africa/sudan-colombian-mercenaries-global-security-services-9ff2a201), more than a hundred Colombian ex-soldiers were recruited to fight with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan.  Colombian President Gustavo Petro has [asked](https://x.com/petrogustavo/status/1861766208040612081) the Foreign Ministry to look for options to return those involved in the scheme to Colombia.

Colombian outlet [La Silla Vacia](https://www.lasillavacia.com/silla-nacional/me-quiero-devolver-hay-mas-de-300-exmilitares-colombianos-en-la-guerra-de-sudan/) spoke to several ex-soldiers who were reportedly recruited by a [Colombian security company with links to the UAE](https://www.lasillavacia.com/silla-nacional/el-engano-del-coronel-quijano-asi-envian-a-exmilitares-colombianos-a-sudan/), a number of whom said they had been misled about their ultimate destination and transported to Sudan via Libya.

In videos circulating on November 21, the passport and other identity documents of Christian Lombana Moncayo were exhibited by Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the aftermath of an alleged ambush against an RSF convoy somewhere in the desert along the border between Libya, Chad and Sudan. So far, we have not been able to geolocate this footage.

It is unclear if Lombana Moncayo was killed, wounded or detained in the alleged ambush. It is also not clear how the SAF got hold of his documentation.

We reviewed his social media posts and found more details about his journey, including his final TikTok post, which we geolocated to Libya.

Sudan is in the midst of an ongoing civil war, which broke out after a peaceful uprising by civilians against dictator Omar al-Bashir. Following his ousting, two rival factions – the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as General Hemedti and [reportedly backed by the UAE](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/15/sudan-war-weapons-uae-iran/) among others– have been fiercely fighting over control of large swathes of the country.

Libya is one of the countries identified as a [source of mercenaries](https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/inside-bbcm/138) moving into Sudan.

## From Colombia to the United Arab Emirates

On November 21, [videos](https://x.com/yasin123ah/status/1859634908836266469) circulated on social media allegedly showing SAF in control of pallets of ammunition after an ambush on an RSF convoy at an unknown desert location.

Soldiers at the scene were filmed sifting through personal documents which included family letters, a passport and ID cards of Colombian nationals.

But how did Lombana Moncayo’s documents end up there?

Bellingcat analysed and cross-referenced the ambush footage with social media posts made by Lombana Moncayo on TikTok.

We were able to match the Christian Lombana Moncayo seen in the ID documents with the social media handles by comparing key biographical details including his name, date of birth and place of origin along with his travel itinerary with details on the TikTok account.

Cross-referencing the series of stamps on Lombana Moncayo’s passport, his TikTok videos with details of his travels and FlightRadar data; it appears that he arrived in Abu Dhabi from Bogotá after a stop in Paris in early October, 2024.

Also, based on these stamps, it seems he stayed in Abu Dhabi only a short time before departing from the UAE on October 11, 2024.

During his time in the UAE, Lombana Moncayo appears to have stayed at the hotel La Quinta by Wyndham Abu Dhabi Al Wahda in the Emirates’ capital.

## The Journey Continues

On November 17, just four days before the alleged SAF ambush videos started to circulate online, Lombana Moncayo posted his last TikTok video on the analysed account.

The footage was filmed from inside a moving vehicle passing by a series of hills, one very close to the road and the others in the background. The low sun position appears to indicate the video was filmed either in the early morning or late afternoon.

Based on the testimonies given to La Silla Vacia, we worked on the assumption that Lombana Moncayo left the UAE to Benghazi, Libya and then was transported by road to Sudan.

There is only one road connecting Benghazi with the southeastern town of Al-Jawf, which is closer to the border with Sudan, as indicated in red below.

*he only road connecting Benghazi with the town of Al Jawf in Libya’s east highlighted in red.*

Using this road and Google Earth, we started our hunt for areas featuring terrain features similar to the ones seen in Lombana Moncayo’s video until we found an area of interest just north of Al-Jawf.
