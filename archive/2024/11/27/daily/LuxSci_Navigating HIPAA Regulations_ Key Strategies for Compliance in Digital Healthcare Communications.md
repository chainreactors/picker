# Navigating HIPAA Regulations: Key Strategies for Compliance in Digital Healthcare Communications

November 26th, 2024

As healthcare organizations shift toward value-based care and patient-centered engagement strategies, HIPAA-compliant communications have never been more critical.

However, the road to secure and compliant healthcare communications is laden with obstacles and unforeseen challenges—especially when it comes to navigating HIPAA regulations. For healthcare providers, payers, and suppliers, successfully harnessing digital communication channels such as email, text (SMS), and online patient portals offers boundless opportunities to engage with patients and customers. More specifically, understanding how to include protected health information (PHI) in communications is key for facilitating deeper, more personalized engagement, not only improving patient’s health outcomes, but also boosting revenue and help achieve growth objectives.

Unfortunately, the difficulties and intricacies of ensuring [HIPAA compliance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html)—and the consequences of non-compliance—deter many healthcare organizations from maximizing the efficiency and impact of their digital communication strategies.

In light of this, this post explores HIPAA regulations and the key challenges that healthcare companies face when implementing HIPAA-compliant digital communication campaigns. The post also incudes actionable strategies that will enable your organization to securely and effectively leverage patient data for personalized engagement.

### **Common Challenges in HIPAA-Compliant Communications**

Here are some of the most significant stumbling blocks that healthcare organizations typically encounter when it comes to HIPAA regulations and implementing HIPAA-compliant communication strategies.

**A Lack of Understanding of What Constitutes PHI**

If you don’t know what *counts* as PHI, how can you *protect* it? Failing to properly identify and categorize patient data can not only *cause* the other challenges detailed below but it can exacerbate them.

**Failure to Encrypt Communications**

Unencrypted patient data exposes sensitive patient and customer data in the event of a security breach. What’s worse, healthcare companies are prime targets for cybercriminals, and their rich arsenals of phishing schemes and malware – such as ransomware—because of their critical function and, consequently, the value and sensitivity of the data they hold. Despite this, far too many organizations gravely undervalue the importance of end-to-end data encryption measures.

**Lack of Secure Infrastructure**

Similarly, healthcare companies mistakenly assume that because a communication platform is popular—and may even have comprehensive security measures – it is suitable for transmitting PHI. Consequently, chosen platforms often lack the level of secure infrastructure required for HIPAA compliance, which can result in financial and reputational repercussions in the event of a subsequent data breach.

**Overlooking Multi-Channel Integration**

Disjointed and siloed communication platforms, with PHI residing in each system’s data stores, create inefficiencies and leave gaps in the patient healthcare journey. Worse, as well as increasing the administrative overhead of digital healthcare communication strategies, it increases the likelihood of human error.

**Human Error**

One of the most common challenges when it comes to HIPAA-compliant  communications is mere human mistakes. Moreover, such errors aren’t necessarily be the result of a lack of competence or care – the individual may simply be tired or distracted. Errors that can lead to HIPAA-compliance violations include mistakes in data entry (e.g., entering the wrong email address), accidental data exposure, or improper access permissions.

### **10 Key Strategies for HIPAA-compliant  Digital Healthcare Communications**

Now that we’ve detailed some of the most frequent and persistent challenges healthcare companies grapple with when implementing HIPAA-compliant communication strategies, let’s cover how to navigate those obstacles.

Here are 10 essential strategies for ensuring your digital healthcare communication campaigns are both compliant and as convincing:

1. 1. **Implement Compliance Training**: ensure anyone who handles patient data in your organization is well-versed in HIPAA’s regulatory guidelines – with particular emphasis on what constitutes PHI and when it can be used in healthcare communications. This will not only drastically reduce instances of human error but also ensure your other security measures aren’t undermined.
   2. **Automation:** similarly, automating as many of your communication workflows and processes as possible further mitigates the risk of human error. Better still, the automation of functions such as message delivery and encryption, saves time while ensuring adherence to HIPAA protocols. Today’s leading solutions like LuxSci feature automated encrytpion where users do not need to take any additional steps to send secure communications.
   3. **Access Control:** managing the access permissions surrounding data and systems is a fundamental tenet of data security – and should especially apply to PHI. Only grant access to personnel that *have to* handle PHI – and only provide the necessary access privileges to perform their job. Additionally, implement robust logging and auditing controls so it is easier to determine who has accessed patient data and when.
   4. **Adopt Flexible Encryption** Encryption is a cornerstone of HIPAA compliance, and tools like LuxSci’s SecureLine technology apply the appropriate level of protection based on the messages’ level of sensitivity and risk. This kind of automated encryption both reduces the risk of human error *and* ensures consistent HIPAA compliance.
   5. **Optimize Personalization Using PHI**: personalized communications increase the rate of engagement and, consequently, help bring about better health outcomes and improved business results. The secure use of PHI allows healthcare companies to hone in on the needs and preferences of their patients and customers, and to customize their communications accordingly.
   6. **Execute HIPAA-Compliant Email Campaigns:** email is an excellent way to send out hundreds of thousands, or even millions of communications over a given period, if you so desire. Whether sending transactional or marketing communications, a HIPAA-compliant email solution is essential for effectively leveraging PHI in your communications**.**
   7. **Secure Text Messaging:** HIPAA-compliant SMS delivery services allow you to reach patients quickly and securely for appointment reminders, test results, and an array of other healthcare communications.
   8. **Leverage Patient Portals:** online patient portals are a great way to increase engagement by giving patients simple and consistent access to their health data while maintaining security. They provide an excellent way for patients to schedule appointments and screenings, obtain healthcare educational materials, manage prescriptions, and handle payments.
   9. **Utilize Preferred Communication Channels:** as well as personalizing communications, it’s best to engage with patients and customers “where they are” and contact them using their preferred communication channel, whether via email, text, or patient portals, as touched on above, or by calling them. Additionally, integrating your HIPAA-compliant communication platforms with your company’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, and Customer Data Platform (CDP) enables you to centralize all your sto...
