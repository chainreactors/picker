## BlackLotus Malware Hijacks Windows Secure Boot Process

Researchers have [discovered](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/unkillable-uefi-malware-bypassing-secure-boot-enabled-by-unpatchable-windows-flaw/) malware that “can hijack a computer’s boot process even when Secure Boot and other advanced protections are enabled and running on fully updated versions of Windows.”

> Dubbed BlackLotus, the malware is what’s known as a UEFI bootkit. These sophisticated pieces of malware target the UEFI—short for [Unified Extensible Firmware Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface)—the low-level and complex chain of firmware responsible for booting up virtually every modern computer. As the mechanism that bridges a PC’s device firmware with its operating system, the UEFI is an OS in its own right. It’s located in an [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)-connected flash storage chip soldered onto the computer motherboard, making it difficult to inspect or patch. Previously discovered bootkits such as [CosmicStrand](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/unkillable-uefi-malware-bypassing-secure-boot-enabled-by-unpatchable-windows-flaw/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps%3A//arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/07/researchers-unpack-unkillable-uefi-rootkit-that-survives-os-reinstalls/), [MosaicRegressor](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/custom-made-uefi-bootkit-found-lurking-in-the-wild/), and [MoonBounce](https://securelist.com/moonbounce-the-dark-side-of-uefi-firmware/105468/) work by targeting the UEFI firmware stored in the flash storage chip. Others, including BlackLotus, target the software stored in the [EFI system partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition).
>
> Because the UEFI is the first thing to run when a computer is turned on, it influences the OS, security apps, and all other software that follows. These traits make the UEFI the perfect place to launch malware. When successful, UEFI bootkits disable OS security mechanisms and ensure that a computer remains infected with stealthy malware that runs at the kernel mode or user mode, even after the operating system is reinstalled or a hard drive is replaced.

ESET has an [analysis](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/03/01/blacklotus-uefi-bootkit-myth-confirmed/):

> The number of UEFI vulnerabilities discovered in recent years and the failures in patching them or revoking vulnerable binaries within a reasonable time window hasn’t gone unnoticed by threat actors. As a result, the first publicly known UEFI bootkit bypassing the essential platform security feature—UEFI Secure Boot—is now a reality. In this blogpost we present the first public analysis of this UEFI bootkit, which is capable of running on even fully-up-to-date Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. Functionality of the bootkit and its individual features leads us to believe that we are dealing with a bootkit known as BlackLotus, [the UEFI bootkit being sold on hacking forums](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-dev-claims-to-sell-new-blacklotus-windows-uefi-bootkit/) for $5,000 since at least October 2022.

> * It’s capable of running on the latest, fully patched Windows 11 systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled.* It exploits a more than one year old vulnerability ([CVE-2022-21894](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-21894)) to bypass UEFI Secure Boot and set up persistence for the bootkit. This is the first publicly known, in-the-wild abuse of this vulnerability.* Although the vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft’s January 2022 update, its exploitation is still possible as the affected, **validly signed** binaries have still not been added to the [UEFI revocation list](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile). BlackLotus takes advantage of this, bringing its own copies of legitimate—but vulnerable—binaries to the system in order to exploit the vulnerability.* It’s capable of disabling OS security mechanisms such as BitLocker, HVCI, and Windows Defender.* Once installed, the bootkit’s main goal is to deploy a kernel driver (which, among other things, protects the bootkit from removal), and an HTTP downloader responsible for communication with the C&C and capable of loading additional user-mode or kernel-mode payloads.

This is impressive stuff.

And the fairytale of trust chain is broken…

Unsupported and thus non-updated drivers are in use in a huge number of computers, also unsupported by their builders, thus Microsoft could not really take the step to block them with the risk of bricking these computers.

And we end-up with this nightmare, were there is a well-known threat and a well-known means to stop it, but it could not be done…

That, UEFI backdoors, sounds impressive until you have your fully air-gapped computer messed up with BadBIOS by the criminals behind Havana Syndrome to prevent your scientific research from progressing.

No computer is safe, period.

Read or watch “The Three Body Problem” series to understand why humanity is under electromagnetic surveillance and sabotage and our science and tech is hindered so we can’t defend ourselves.

Religion is organized fraud to prevent scientific progress, but attacks with radiation are done to scientist also.

Meanwhile, the UEFI CRL page has no public signature on these revocation list files, no release date of the latest version, and no RSS feed to watch for updates. What should I do, download the file weekly and alert my operators whenever it has been changed?

They also state that “Distribution of the data in these files to running systems could cause instability”. Does anybody even know why?

I’ll ignore the content-free legalese nonsense, this form is too short to con...
