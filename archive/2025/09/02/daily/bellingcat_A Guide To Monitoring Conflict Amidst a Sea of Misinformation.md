How does one monitor a conflict zone on the brink of civil war, especially in a region which is difficult to access, experiences frequent internet shutdowns and where misinformation is common? In this guide, we outline the open source tools and methods we can use to evidence what is really happening in many such conflict settings.

Our focus for this guide is on India, which [recorded 84 internet shutdowns](https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/KeepItOn-2024-Internet-Shutdowns-Annual-Report.pdf) in 2024 – the highest number amongst democratic nations. In early June, authorities [imposed a curfew](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4k52q283zo) and suspended internet access in parts of Manipur after protests erupted over the arrest of ethnic leaders. The state, in the north-east of the country, has been [wracked by violence](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-65679616) for years.

The ethnic conflict between the majority, mostly Hindu Meitei population and the indigenous, largely Christian Kuki Zo communities is one of the worst spates of violence Manipur, also known as the “Land of Jewels”, [has experienced](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/06/understanding-indias-manipur-conflict-and-its-geopolitical-implications) in decades.

The Imphal valley in Manipur is surrounded by mountains. It is home to 39 ethnic communities. [Just over half of its nearly three million](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/humanrights/2024/03/14/ethnic-cleansing-and-brewing-civil-war-in-the-case-of-indias-manipur/) residents belong to the Meitei community, followed by the Naga (20 percent) and the Kuki Zo (16 percent) tribes.

The landscape is complex, with ethnic armed groups divided into multiple factions (this list is not complete):

* The ethno-nationalist militia – yet to be designated as a banned group – Arambai Tenggol (AT), the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) – Meitei
* Kuki National Army, Kuki National Front – Kuki
* Zomi Revolutionary Army – Zomi
* National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak Muivah) – Naga

In May 2023, the Manipur High Court [passed an order](https://www.indiatoday.in/law/story/manipur-violence-high-court-order-triggered-massive-unrest-in-the-state-explained-2388615-2023-06-04) recommending a Scheduled Tribe status (a category for indigenous communities in India that guarantees affirmative action and constitutional protection over identity and land) for the dominant Meitei community. Tribal communities rallied against the decision while the Meitei community held counter-rallies and counter-blockades. Clashes broke out between the Kuki and Meitei groups. Since then, the [conflict](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/03/27/india-ethnic-clashes-restart-manipur) has displaced more than 60,000 people and claimed more than 260 lives from both communities.

In this guide, we show you how to use open source methods in any secluded area to:

* Analyse weapon imagery and the groups using them
* Investigate weapons that were looted and where they ended up
* Analyse images of drones potentially used as weapons to deploy munitions

## **Analysing Weapon Imagery**

One effective approach for open source researchers is to trace the digital footprint of  weapons. In the Manipur case, local armed groups, such as the Arambai Tenggol, the UNLF and the Kuki National Front, have been posting weapon imagery mainly in WhatsApp groups and Facebook accounts.

According to [media reports](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2681-weapons-recovered-in-manipur-of-which-only-1200-were-looted-from-police-armouries-security-adviser/article68665551.ece), the war has been fueled by weaponry looted from police armouries or procured on the black market either from Myanmar, across the border, or through surrenders in amnesty drives.

The 6,000 firearms looted included pump-action shotguns, grenade launchers, AK-pattern rifles, INSAS rifles and ammunition. The police [claimed](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shoes-caps-boots-surrendered-for-manipur-s-weapons-amnesty-101741373437728.html) that in February and March alone, more than 1,000 weapons were surrendered, with more than half from the Meitei-dominated valley districts, where a majority of the weapons were looted.

Bellingcat analysed [weapon imagery](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/manipur-insurgent-groups-modifying-looted-weapons-into-snipers-rifles-8868921) from 2023 and 2024, accessed from WhatsApp groups and Facebook accounts linked to non-state actors, including the AT, Kuki Zo militant groups, and various volunteer organisations. While these groups have surrendered some weapons in amnesty drives, many [sophisticated weapons](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/surrender-call-groups-retain-sophisticated-arms-in-manipur-9863629/) were not turned in and were only recovered in search operations by security forces.

A photo posted to Facebook shows members of The Kuki National Front posing with a number of weapons.

For verification, we ran screenshots of images of the weapons without visible serial numbers or other markings first through reverse image searches on Google and Yandex. Then, we cross-referenced the images with resources like the [Small Arms Survey handbook](https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/resource/introductory-guide-identification-small-arms-light-weapons-and-associated-ammunition) and [Open Source Munitions Portal](https://osmp.ngo/) (OSMP).

However, these databases are limited in their documentation from India.

We also looked at the public dashboard of Conflict Armament Research ([iTrace](https://www.conflictarm.com/itrace/)). This is a far larger data source. However, the full dataset, which contains a huge number of images of weapons from around the world, is not publicly available. Only broad statistics, and no images, are visible via the dashboard.

The Small Arms Survey handbook helped match and identify, to an approximate accuracy, some of the older weapon model...
