Meta has partnered with Anduril Industries to build augmented and virtual reality devices for the military, eight years after it fired the defense firm's founder, Palmer Luckey.

Luckey joined Meta when it was still called Facebook following the social media company's 2014 acquisition of Oculus, the virtual reality headset biz he founded.

He [left the then-Facebook branded corp in 2017](https://www.theregister.com/2017/03/31/oculus_drift_vr_gaming_boss_out_at_facebook/), with some [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-did-facebook-fire-a-top-executive-hint-it-had-something-to-do-with-trump-1541965245) stating his $10,000 political donation to an anti-Hillary Clinton group in the runup to the 2016 presidential election had been a factor. Others alleged he'd faced pressure to publicly endorse libertarian candidate Gary Johnson instead of his preferred candidate Donald Trump.
