# New PHP-based Ducktail infostealer is now after crypto wallets

Posted: October 20, 2022
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

A [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) campaign known to specifically target employees with access to their company’s Facebook Business and Ads accounts has significantly widened its net and begun using a first-of-its-kind information-stealing [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) to go after [crypto](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) wallets.

The Ducktail *(Woo-ooh!)* campaign was [first made public](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/linkedin-phishing-target-employees-managing-facebook-ad-accounts/) three months ago in July, but it’s thought to have been active [since 2018](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/ducktail). The cybercriminal behind the campaign is thought to be from Vietnam.

## Ducktail 101

[Social engineering attacks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) and malware form the core of Ducktail’s *modus operandi*. In previous campaigns, it used a .NET Core malware that specifically steals Facebook Business and Ads accounts and saved browser credentials. All stolen data was then exfiltrated to its [command & control (C2)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/streamadblocker-cc) server, a private Telegram channel.

In this latest campaign, the cybercriminals replaced .NET Core with malware written in PHP. Not only does Ducktail continue to steal Facebook credentials and browser data, but it also steals cryptocurrency wallets, too. These are then stored on a [command & control (C2)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/streamadblocker-cc) website in [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) format, wherein texts are easy to understand.

Note that Ducktail also broadened its target to include all Facebook users.

The attacker lures their target into downloading and installing a malicious installer (usually compressed in a ZIP file) by making them believe it’s a video game, subtitle, adult video, or cracked MS application file (among others). This ZIP is hosted on popular file-sharing platforms.

Once the file is opened, the malware shows a fake “Checking Application Compatibility” pop-up to distract users while it installs in the background. The malware then executes two processes: The first is for establishing persistence on the affected system, meaning the malicious script is scheduled to run daily and regularly; The second is for data stealing tasks.

Zscaler researchers [broke down the kinds of data](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/new-php-variant-ducktail-infostealer-targeting-facebook-business-accounts) this PHP malware steals:

* Browser information (machine ID, browser version, user profiles). In particular, this malicious script is after sensitive data stored in Chrome browsers.
* Information stored in browser [cookies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies)
* Crypto account information from the *wallet.dat* file
* Data from various Facebook pages, such as API graph, Ads Manager, and Business, which are not limited to:
  + Accounts and their status
  + Ads payment cycle
  + Currency details
  + Funding source
  + Payment method
  + PayPal payment method (email address tied to PayPal accounts)
  + Verification status
