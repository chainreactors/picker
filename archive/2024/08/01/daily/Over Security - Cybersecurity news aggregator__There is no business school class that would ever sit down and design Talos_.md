As part of the celebrations of Cisco Talos turning 10, we’d like to take you back to where it all began: How we formed our mission of protecting our customers and making the internet suck a bit less, an insight into our culture, and how we came to work with some of the most talented human beings on the planet.

This is the history of Talos, as told through the eyes of some of our senior leaders.

### The Sourcefire years

*Editor's note: Sourcefire was a company that specialized in Firepower network security appliances based on Snort, an open-source intrusion detection system. Sourcefire was acquired by Cisco for $2.7 billion in July 2013.*

**Matt Watchinski, Vice President of Talos:** What I remember most from the early years of Sourcefire was all of us being crowded into a minuscule meeting room. We spent our days discussing huge, complicated s\*\*t. There was so much mutual respect and understanding for what we set out to achieve.

**Chris Marshall, Director of Talos Network Detection and Response Team:** We all collectively believed that we could be the best security team on the planet. We were so passionately driven to achieve things together. And we went out of our way to take care of each other to make sure those two other things happened.

**Watchinksi:** We had a group that could change priorities on a dime, and then actually execute on them — without anybody coming back and saying, “The dumbest decision in the entire world was just made in that tiny room. Now we have to go and do stupid s\*\*t.” Everybody came back from that room and said, “Alright, this is the thing that's going to make Sourcefire the most successful, and so that’s the direction we’re going to march in.”

**Lurene Grenier, Director of Competitive Analysis:** At Sourcefire our goal was to build the best and most open product we could. At the time, all the rules had to be written by hand, without any guidance. We had no contracts with any companies. The biggest thing on the map at that point was Patch Tuesday bugs, and they were all remote root bugs. Every month, 15 - 20 of those bugs would get dropped. It was my job to grab the patches, patch the systems, reverse engineer the patches, and write an exploit for the bug. And then I would pass that exploit to the team who wrote the [Snort] rules. We would write the documentation, package everything up, and send that to QA.

We significantly changed the security posture and behaviour of Fortune 50 companies on the regular, with about 30 people. We were doing things that the industry said was impossible. And my favorite part was we had executives from those Fortune 50 companies coming out to buy us lunch, begging us to stop telling the public the truth.

### The acquisition of Sourcefire

**Marshall:** I came to Sourcefire from the U.S. military. I had no idea what being acquired meant.

**Watchinski:** We had been in negotiations with Cisco for about six months. I couldn’t tell anyone about that though. Those final negotiations went on until 4 a.m. the morning that the deal closed. We didn’t stop until we had reached a deal that was right for our people. At 4:30 a.m., I sent a text to my directs, telling them that something big was happening, and they should come into the office at 7 a.m.

**Marshall:** At the time, I ran the response work. And Watchinski didn't tell me if there was a problem. So, my instincts told me something was very wrong. “Who else do I need to call? How bad is the situation?” And he just replied, “I just need you there first thing in the morning.” So, the next morning Watchinski walked in, and me, [Matt] Olney [Director of Threat Intelligence and Interdiction] and Nigel [Houghton, former director of Talos Operations] are standing around anxiously. And then Watchinski said, “Cisco just bought us. We're not working today.”

### Three teams coming together

**Watchinski:** For the first year after the acquisition, Sourcefire continued as the VRT (Vulnerability Research Team). During that time, we met various people across Cisco and tried to figure out what they all did. One of the people I met was Luci [Lagrimas]. She’s an incredible person, and we started hatching a plan on how we could be successful together.

We proposed bringing together a singular set of services, a singular threat research and intelligence team, a singular understanding of our data, and a singular voice of how we talk about security.

I gave a presentation to what was then three different groups — VRT, Cisco Threat Research, Analysis and Communications (TRAC), and Security Applications (SecApps).

**Luci Lagrimas, Senior Director of Engineering:** That was a day I’ll always remember. We all gave presentations about who we were and who our teams were. I put three pictures on an “About Me” slide, and one of them was me playing field hockey, wearing a T-shirt that definitely showed off my guns. [Matt] Olney leans over to Marshall and says, “Dude, she can kick our ass!”

**Matt Olney, Director of Talos Threat Intelligence & Interdiction**: This remains true to this day.

**Marshall:** My first impression of Luci was that slide. That set the tone for these teams coming together, because here’s this b...
