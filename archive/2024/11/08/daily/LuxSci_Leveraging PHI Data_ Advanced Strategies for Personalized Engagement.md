# Leveraging PHI Data: Advanced Strategies for Personalized Engagement

November 7th, 2024

As the healthcare industry grows increasingly competitive, personalized engagement has become a key differentiator for companies aiming to better connect with their patients and customers.

However, effective personalization requires more than loosely matching a patient to a product or service based on a handful of dubious demographic data points – or a message carefully crafted to assume familiarity. Instead, successful personalized patient engagement requires using data from your Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, and Revenue Collection Platforms (RCPs) in combination with a secure communications solutions to target and tailor your messages like never before.

To help you get there, this post explores core strategies for leveraging PHI in patient engagement, as well as the benefits of integrating secure communications like HIPAA-compliant email with your CDPs, RCPs, and EHR systems. Whether you’re a healthcare provider, payer or supplier, these strategies will help you develop a data-driven approach to patient engagement that sets your brand apart, builds trust, and boosts customer loyalty and satisfaction.

### **Why Personalized Engagement Makes a Difference**

Ultimately, personalized patient or customer engagement is vital because it strengthens relationships, fosters trust, and encourages proactive healthcare behaviors and decision-making*.* By taking the extra time to craft your communications to resonate with the recipient’s particular healthcare needs and pain points – and securely including it in our messages – makes your targets more likely to engage with you, now and in the future.  This results in an individual becoming a more active participant in their healthcare journey: engaging in more self-education, listening to advice (e.g., screening recommendations), adhering to treatments, trying new products, and, ultimately, enjoying better health outcomes overall*.*

However, to reap these benefits, healthcare organizations must navigate the complexities of securely handling PHI and integrating it across communication systems and data platforms to facilitate personalized *and* [HIPAA-compliant](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) interactions.

### **Three Core Strategies for Personalized Engagement Across the Healthcare Journey**

Let’s look at three essential engagement strategies that will help you achieve better results by leveraging PHI in your communications, including:

* **Provider-Centric Strategies:**

* **Payer-Focused Strategies**

* **Supplier Strategies**

### **1. Provider-Centric Strategies: Customized Patient Pathways**

Here are a few examples of how healthcare providers can employ PHI-driven personalization to increase patient engagement, using the email channel:

* **Reminders for Preventive Care**: by segmenting patients by their risk factors and medical history, providers can send customized email reminders for preventative screenings, vaccinations, or check-ups.
* **Post-Treatment Follow-ups**: sending patients customized follow-ups after treatment or surgery improves adherence to prescribed care plans. Providers can automate reminders, follow-up surveys, or educational materials specific to the patient’s condition, increasing engagement, and overall awareness of their health journey, and, subsequently, health outcomes.
* **Mental Health and Chronic Care Management**: the management of both mental health and chronic disease conditions favor a high-touch, personalized approach. PHI-driven engagement enables healthcare providers to send the most appropriate regular check-ins, support resources, and reminders to reach a patient population that can fall through the cracks of outreach efforts.

### **2. Payer-Focused Strategies: Supporting Long-Term Health**

Payers, such as health insurers, can leverage PHI for tailored member engagement that aligns with value-based care objectives, including:

* **Engage Members Via Their Preferred Channels:** sending people information through their preferred channels, such as email, text, or phone, greatly improves the chances that they receive it and act upon it. This better ensures they receive important details, such as policy details and benefits, that will assist them on their healthcare journey, leading to higher levels of satisfaction with their coverage and more business and renewals for your company. You can gain greater insight into this in our article on **How to Improve Patient Engagement with Secure Communications**.
* **Strengthened Member Loyalty:** the more that customer feel that their payer understands their unique health concerns and needs, the greater their sense of loyalty towards them. Personalized interactions increase trust and member or customer satisfaction, resulting in long-term relationships.
* **Proactive Retention Strategies:** by analyzing customer data, payers can identify those at risk of not renewing their healthcare coverage and implement targeted communications to retain them. Personalized outreach, such as email reminders about plan benefits or assistance with the renewal process, can effectively encourage members to continue their coverage.

### **3. Supplier Strategies: Enhancing Customer Support and Education**

Healthcare suppliers, such as medical device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, can harness PHI to educate customers on the benefits of their products and services for upsell and cross-sell, in addition to offering exceptional support, training and aftercare following their purchase.

* **Tailored Customer Education**: with PHI, healthcare suppliers can provide condition-specific educational resources that will help customers better understand how their offerings support their health. In many cases, this will be much-welcomed information, resulting in increased brand awareness, trusted relationships, and, ultimately, better health outcomes.
* **Personalized Adherence Programs**: sending personalized reminders, or an offer of support, boosts the chances of compliance with medication or device usage instructions – both increasing their efficacy and reducing the risks that accompany their misuse. Additionally, automating emails for these follow-ups, as part of a comprehensive customer onboarding process, streamlines this process and ensures the most valuable customer experience.
* **Equipment Renewals or Upgrades**: proactively sending customers emails and messages on new or updated products and services can lead to increased conversions and sales, by simple virtue of the fact you’re *telling* your customer base about them. All customers who have seen improvements in their quality of life from your products or services will be interested to hear about improvements or additions to your offerings – so seize this prime opportunity to engage with them.

### **The Power of Data Integration**

To maximize personalization, healthcare organizations can leverage PHI across the different systems within their IT ecosystems and create unified data profiles that drive better engagement. Integrating data from **Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)**, **Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems**, and **Revenue Collection Platforms (RCPs)**, and securely using it in communications, such as email campaigns, is a critical component of meaningful engagement and increases your ability to reach your targets. Here’s how it helps:

* CDPs aggregate data from multiple channels to provide a comprehensive, centralized view of each patient or customer. By integrating PHI and other behavioral data in a CDP, healthcare organizations can better understand patient ne...
