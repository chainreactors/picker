# How to turn disrespect into raw power

I used to be the **butt** of disrespect. From receiving sarcasm, to condescending comments to even straight insults. Worse, it used to happen in front of many people. One time, it even happened in front of a girl I was dating.

Yeah…

Eventually, I figured out what to say to hold my ground and to make sure the disrespect stopped once and for all.

I called it the ***Nth Pendulum Technique***. Confusing name I know. If you think of a better name or analogy, let me know. But anyways.

I’ve noticed most people tend to respond to disrespect in 1 of 2 ways.

1. They’ll laugh it off or go along with the joke.
2. They’ll get emotional and vividly upset. They might even retaliate.

The problem with 1 is the disrespect won’t stop. You’ll become the butt of the joke and others may even join in on the “*fun*”. Some people may eventually blow up leading to #2.

The problem with 2 is that suddenly you look bad. You didn’t start it. You didn’t start the blows. But now you’ll look like someone who can’t control their emotions and someone who gets angry easily. This leaves a bad taste in people’s mouths.

If you ever catch yourself responding with 1 or 2, it means you’ve swung too far.

If it’s #1, you’ve swung too far left.
If it’s #2, you’ve swung too far right.

The trick is to not swing, the trick is to be so ambiguous that you don’t sway. Like an inactive pendulum.

Let's get a little mathematical, it'll make more sense this way, trust me. Say someone disrespects you to the nth degree.

You want to respond with *degree n-1*. In other words, you want to match what they said, but with 1 degree less.

Here are some examples:

Him: *“Let me break it down for you in simpler terms.”*
You: *“Sorry, can you repeat that.”*

Him: *“He’s not the sharpest tool in the shed.”*
You: Pause for 5 seconds...

This slight push back will feel like pressure for the one making the unnecessary comments. It’ll make them uncomfortable, almost uneasy. That’s why they’ll stop.

To recap:

If you laugh it off, you’ll appear timid. They’ll keep picking on you.
You’ve swung too far left.
**[degree 0]**

If you emotionally retaliate, you’ll look like someone who can’t control their emotions.
You’ve swung too far right.
**[degree n + 100]**

But if you hold your ground, and give slight push back you’ll have the power.
You didn’t swing.
**[degree n - 1]**

I've noticed excellent communicators and confident people do this naturally. I hope this helped and if anyone has any better ways would love to hear about them.
