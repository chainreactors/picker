# ‘Ad Blocking is Not Piracy’ Decision Overturned By Top German Court

German publisher Axel Springer, owner of brands including Bild and Die Welt, has been given another opportunity to have ad blocking outlawed on copyright grounds. After a series of defeats in its years-long legal action against the makers of Adblock Plus, the publisher appealed to the Federal Court of Justice. Germany's top court has now overturned a 2023 ruling by the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg, referring the case back for reconsideration of the core issues.

There’s little doubt that online businesses reliant on advertising revenue are negatively affected by increasing use of ad blocking solutions.

Yet it’s thanks to abusive and invasive ads, and threats to privacy due to incessant online tracking, that ad blockers became so popular.

There’s a good argument today that an effective ad blocking solution is not just a way to keep out an avalanche of mostly unwanted advertising. In many cases ad blockers are seen as an essential tool in the internet user’s security toolbox and as a result, people are reluctant to turn them off.

## Axel Springer Acquires Target, Misses, Switches to New Weapon

For German publisher Axel Springer, ad blocking solutions are mechanisms that fundamentally undermine the company’s ability to generate revenue. Hoping to force change, over a decade ago the company took legal action against Eyeo GmbH, the company behind [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org), arguing that the software interfered with its business model. In April 2018, Adblock Plus and Eyeo came out on top, when Germany’s Supreme Court found no breach of competition law.

Still determined to take ad blocking out of the game, Springer changed tack. In a new lawsuit, the publisher alleged that AdBlock Plus removes ads by interfering with the “programming code of websites” which violates its exclusive rights under copyright law.

Eyeo dismissed the claim as “almost absurd” and in January 2022 the Hamburg Regional Court denied Springer’s request for an injunction, ruling that there was no unauthorized copying or reworking of copyrighted computer programs as defined under local law.

Springer appealed and in 2023 [lost again](https://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&az=IV%20ZR%20131/23&nr=137405), this time at the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg. Refusing to accept defeat, the publisher filed yet another appeal at the [Federal Court of Justice](https://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2024/2024107.html) (BGH).

## Treatment of Software Under German Copyright Law

While competition law may have been a dead end, copyright law can offer novel opportunities for the determined.

Axel Springer’s argument is built on provisions in German copyright law for the protection of software. According to [§ 69a para. 3 UrhG](https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/69a.html), a piece of software (‘computer program’) is afforded protection under copyright law if it “represents an individual work to the extent that it is the result of the author’s own intellectual creation.”

Protection applies to “all forms of expression” in the program but does not extend to “ideas and principles” underlying its elements. This effectively means that people can’t copy or distribute a piece of software verbatim, but they are free to write their own version of the software as long as there’s no direct copying of the original.

In more general terms, computer programs are treated as literary works under the Copyright Act and as such enjoy the same protection. This means that the author of a computer program (or their employer) holds exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute and make the program publicly available, just as an author of a book would.

## Springer Argues Websites Are Computer Programs

Axel Springer argues that the software used to create its online media presence (i.e its website) qualifies for protection as software under [§ 69a (1) and (2)](https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/69a.html) of the Copyright Act.

*§ 69a – Definition of software (German Copyright Act)*![DE Copyright Act s69a](https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69a.png)

Based on the assumption that its software does indeed qualify for protection under § 69a, Axel Springer notes that further protection is afforded under § 69c, with certain exclusive rights granted to the rightsholder.

Under § 69c, third parties must obtain permission for any of the following acts:

*§ 69c – Exclusive rights for qualifying software under § 69a (German Copyright Act)*![DE Copyright Act s69c](https://torrentfreak.com/images/DE-Copyright-Act-s69c.png)

> *§ 69c (2) “the translation, adaptation, arrangement and other modifications of a computer program as well as the reproduction of the results obtained.”*

Axel Springer’s argument is that when Adblock Plus blocks or manipulates its website code (‘computer program’) present in the user’s browser, that amounts to a violation of its exclusive right of modification available under § 69c (2) and its reproduction right under § 69c (1).

## Federal Court of Justice Overturns Decision of Lower Court

The above matters and others focused on the technical issues are detailed in the ruling handed down by the Federal Court of Justice (BGH). The ruling ([Werbeblocker IV / Ad Blocker IV](http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&client=12&pos=0&anz=1&Blank=1.pdf&nr=142511)) is clearly a setback for Eyeo GmbH; the Higher Regional Court of Hamburg previously ruled in favor of the Cologne-based company, a decision the BGH has just overturned.

In a nutshell, the BGH states that the Hamburg court arrived at its decision without first establishing important fundamentals. These details may support the decision of the Hamburg court or undermine it, but that can only be determined once the facts are established.

> *“When examining whether an infringement of a copyrighted right to a protected object (here: a computer program within the meaning of Section 69a (1) of the Copyright Act) has occurred, it is not always necessary to determine whether this protected object meets the requirements of a copyrighted work, computer program, or related right. Rather, this circumstance can be assumed, provided that there is no unlawful infringement of copyright,” the decision reads.*
>
> “It should be noted, however, that the question of an infringement of a property right may depend on a clear definition of the protected object and its features justifying protection. Denying an infringement of a copyright-protected right while simultaneously assuming that the protected object in question is eligible for copyright protection is therefore only possible in such a case if the...
