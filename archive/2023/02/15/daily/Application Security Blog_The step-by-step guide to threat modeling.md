Your organization relies on software to innovate and deliver value to your customers, as well as to work faster and more efficiently. However, if that software is not developed and deployed securely, it can put your business at risk. When software risk is business risk, you must both prioritize it *and* manage it proactively. Threat modeling promotes the idea of thinking like an attacker and enables organizations to build security considerations into software from the start, rather than addressing security as an afterthought.

## What is threat modeling?

Threat modeling is a structured process that

* Identifies security requirements
* Locates security threats and potential vulnerabilities
* Quantifies threat and vulnerability criticality
* Prioritizes remediation methods

Threat modeling analyzes software design by comparing design views against threat agents to identify security weaknesses. Working with the software design means that the analysis can be conducted without having to delve into the code.

By identifying key structural elements and system assets—and documenting their related risk—threat modeling gives you enough detail to allow your business to make informed decisions about risk.

## Securing your architecture

When performed during the architecture design phase, threat modeling enables organizations to avoid or mitigate security issues early by adding security controls or changing to a more secure design. Addressing these issues during architecture design saves the escalating expenses of addressing them later in the development process.

In addition to its use during the architecture design phase, threat modeling is also very useful during other stages of the [software development life cycle (SDLC)](/glossary/what-is-sdlc.html), including secure requirements identification, security test planning, [secure code review](/gl...
