# Meta slurps up EU user data for AI training

Posted: April 14, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

European Facebook users have so far avoided having their public posts used to train parent company Meta’s [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) model. That’s about to change, the company has warned. In a [blog post](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/making-ai-work-harder-for-europeans/) today, it said that EU residents’ data was fair game and it would be slurping up public posts for training soon.

Facebook, which launched its AI service for EU users last month, said that it needs that user data to make its AI service more relevant to Europeans.

“That means everything from dialects and colloquialisms, to hyper-local knowledge and the distinct ways different countries use humor and sarcasm on our products,” the company said. It continued:

> “This is particularly important as AI models become more advanced with multi-modal functionality, which spans text, voice, video, and imagery.”

Meta originally planned to start training its AI on user posts in the EU in June last year, but it pressed pause after pushback from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) and the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). This came after European privacy advocacy group NOYB (which informally stands for “none of your business”) complained about the move to several regulators in the region.

Meta had claimed that the data collection was in its legitimate interest, stating that it would allow users to opt out of the AI training. NOYB responded that the company should ask users before using their data to train its AI models (which would make it an opt-in arrangement).

## The EU handballs the issue back to national regulators

The DPC’s delay was apparently just a speed bump. The Irish DPC asked the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to mull the issue further, specifically asking several questions. When can an AI model be considered anonymous, it asked? And how can a company demonstrate legitimate interest when collecting data to develop and deploy such a model?

On December 17 of last year, the Board issued a ruling, [Opinion 28/2024](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-12/edpb_opinion_202428_ai-models_en.pdf), that answered those questions by passing them back to regulators. They would have to look at anonymity on a per-case basis, the ruling said. It advised them to consider whether it would be possible to extract [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from the model, and to look at what the company did during development to prevent personal data from being used in the training or to make it less identifiable.

To determine whether an interest is legitimate, a regulator should decide whether the company’s interest is lawful and with real-world application, rather than just being speculative. Developing an AI model would likely pass that test, it added. Then, they should evaluate whether the data collected is necessary to fulfill it, and then see whether that collection overrides the users’ fundamental rights.

Finally, the DPC asked the Board what the effect on an AI model’s operation would be if a company was found to have used personal data unlawfully to train it. The Board once again handed that to the regulators on a per-case basis.

## Onward and downward

Meta felt that this opinion was enough.
