Webinar This year's RSA Conference saw [SANS](https://www.sans.org/u/1o3k) security experts gather to identify and discuss five of the most dangerous cyber attack techniques identified in the first half of the year. If you missed [the original debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEwqXJseM8g&t=1s), don't worry, you have another chance to learn what you should be looking out for.

**The Cloud:** Wherever sensitive data and mission critical workloads head to, hackers inevitably follow and the cloud is increasingly in their cross hairs. [Katie Nickels](https://www.sans.org/u/1o0P), SANS Certified Instructor and Director of Intelligence for Red Canary, shares her tips on now best to detect and respond to attacks that hide behind legitimate cloud services to bypass firewalls and proxies.

**The MFA Bypass:** Think your old user account has been deleted? Think again. It might be helping a hacker connect an illegitimate device back into the network so they can bypass multi factor authentication (MFA) defenses. Monitoring unusual user behaviors and login sources and ensuring all inactive accounts are disabled on AD can help, says Katie.
