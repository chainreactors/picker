```
I disclosured a crash in potplayer last year :
https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Mar/76
And I found a new one this year, this time is a mid file. Again I contacted
Korea Internet & Security Agency(first-team () krcert or kr), they shared
report to the onwer of the potplayer, Kakao Corp as they said. But I did
not get any update after about half a year. So this is a 0day.
I cannot debug or get any useful information about the crash bacause the
program was packed. You can get POC in attachment.
