"Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiqP8jOtRRaaMyN6Krsfpqa79yLFCMw2HXkdf9kQ_vJr26RltHtS1MVX4hLQyGwrJ0xIbbXIUzwQ9ZJd1rjhAQT12LQtsPY0zMPfAHAHmvtteOZB9jnTWRlPWe8gvduZLPchboD7sFVogZTX6SqhX_hu5oYmwZK2RGNSN4_H5im5NvISYzH-iTop-xGqM/s790-rw-e365/xm.jpg)

Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) is a strategic framework that helps organizations continuously assess and manage cyber risk. It breaks down the complex task of managing security threats into five distinct stages: Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization. Each of these stages plays a crucial role in identifying, addressing, and mitigating vulnerabilities - before they can be exploited by attackers.

On paper, [CTEM sounds great](https://xmcyber.com/ctem/?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=hackernews_article&utm_content=how-to-get-going-with-ctem). But where the rubber meets the road – especially for CTEM neophytes - implementing CTEM can seem overwhelming. The process of putting CTEM principles into practice can look prohibitively complex at first. However, with the right tools and a clear understanding of each stage, CTEM can be an effective method for strengthening your organization's security posture.

That's why I've put together a step-by-step guide on which tools to use for which stage. Want to learn more? Read on…

## **Stage 1: Scoping**

When you're defining critical assets during scoping, you're taking the first essential step toward understanding your organization's most valuable processes and resources. Your goal here is to identify the assets that are vital to your operations, and this often involves input from a variety of stakeholders - not just your security operations (SecOps) team. Scoping isn't just a technical task, it's a *people* task - it's about truly understanding your business's context and processes.

A helpful way to approach this is through business-critical asset workshops. These sessions bring together decision-makers, including senior leadership, to align your business processes with the technology supporting them. Then, to support your scoping efforts, you can use tools like good old-fashioned spreadsheets, more advanced systems like Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs), or specialized solutions such as Software Asset Management (SAM) and Hardware Asset Management (HAM). Additionally, Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) tools provide valuable insights by analyzing assets and prioritizing those that need the most protection.

## **Stage 2: Discovery**

Discovery focuses on identifying assets and vulnerabilities across your organization's ecosystem – using various tools and methods to compile a comprehensive view of your technological landscape and enable your security teams to assess potential risks.

Vulnerability scanning tools are commonly used to discover assets and identify potential weaknesses. These tools scan for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) within your systems and networks, then deliver detailed reports on which areas need attention. Additionally, Active Directory (AD) plays a crucial role in discovery, especially in environments where identity issues are prevalent.

For cloud environments, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools are used to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. These tools also handle identity management issues specific to cloud environments. (Read more about [Discovery](https://xmcyber.com/blog/discovering-cyber-exposures-across-your-environment/?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=hackernews_article&utm_content=get-going-with-ctem-disovery) here.)

## **Stage 3: Prioritization**

Effective prioritization is crucial because it ensures that your security teams concentrate on the most impactful threats - ultimately reducing the overall risk to your organization.

You may already be using traditional vulnerability management solutions that prioritize based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores. However, keep in mind that these scores often fail to incorporate the business context, making it difficult for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to grasp the urgency of specific threats. In contrast, prioritizing within the context of your business-critical assets makes the process more understandable for business leaders. This alignment enables your security teams to communicate the potential impact of vulnerabilities more effectively across the organization.

Attack path mapping and attack path management are increasingly recognized as essential components of prioritization. These tools analyze how attackers can move laterally within your network, helping you identify choke points where an attack could inflict the most damage. Solutions that incorporate attack path mapping provide you with a fuller picture of exposure risks, allowing for a more strategic approach to prioritization.

Finally, external threat intelligence platforms are key in this stage. These tools provide you with real-time data on actively exploited vulnerabilities, adding critical context beyond CVSS scores. Additionally, AI-based technologies can scale threat detection and streamline prioritization, but it's important to implement them carefully to avoid introducing errors into your process.
