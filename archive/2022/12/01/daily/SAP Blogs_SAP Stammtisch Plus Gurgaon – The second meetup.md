SAP Stammtisch PLUS is a community event where, people with interest in SAP topics can talk, meet, extend their professional network, and learn. After an engaging SAP Stammtisch PLUS held on October 28th at SAP Gurgaon (Read – [SAP Stammtisch Plus Gurgaon – Great networking and learning opportunity | SAP Blogs](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/11/sap-stammtisch-plus-gurgaon-great-networking-and-learning-opportunity/)), the SAP Stammtisch PLUS series saw its second meetup again on November 18th, 2022.

In this meetup, apart from networking, we focused on “RISE with SAP” and how Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged in analysis of logs.

**Session 1: RISE with SAP (Driving Business Innovation together) – SAP Customer Journey to Intelligent Enterprise**

Speaker: abhishek.srivastava

In the session, Abhishek enlightened the community members on RISE with SAP topic. For this, he first touched base on the different challenges (economic, environmental, and technological disruption) that businesses are facing these days. And how SAP through RISE with SAP can assist businesses in their transformation in this challenging era. Further it was elaborated how one can start their journey of RISE with SAP. Finally, the session was ended with few videos of customer success stories.

The whole session was very interactive and if the time limit wouldn’t have been a hinderance, it could have easily extended for few more hours. ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@94401D39447508D148B9179130A10607/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

**Session 2: DILAT - Leveraging AI/ML for Proactive Maintenance**

Speaker: nirjar.gandhi

In this session, Nirjar explained how a machine learning solution assists in dynamic analysis of log files, traces files or application log files thereby, helping users to quickly shortlist possible root causes of the issue. Through visualization of these results users can possibly identify anomalies in a timely manner.

The success of the event was evident from the excitement and eagerness amongst the participants. The same reflected in the number of questions being asked in both the sessions. We really appreciate our speakers Abhishek Srivastava and Nirjar Gandhi for presenting these insightful sessions in such a short notice.

We extend our gratitude to all the members who joined this event and hope to see all of you in the upcoming events too!

Till then keep learning and stay engaged!
