# LaLiga Seeks Google’s Help to Expose ‘Notorious’ Pirate Streaming Service FlujoTV

Spanish football league LaLiga is targeting the operators of popular pirate IPTV service FlujoTV in a U.S. court. In a new filing, the league requests a DMCA subpoena that would compel Google to hand over the personal details of users behind three IP addresses. Assigned to Google, the addresses were allegedly used to illegally stream a recent match between Atlético de Madrid and Villarreal.

Latin America is no exception to this trend, with MagisTV establishing itself as one of the top piracy brands.

Earlier this year, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative added MagisTV to its latest list of [notorious piracy markets](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-trade-representative-lists-the-most-notorious-piracy-threats-250108/). Soon after, MagisTV [rebranded](https://torrentfreak.com/notorious-pirate-iptv-service-magistv-applies-for-us-trademark-and-rebrands-250114/) as FlujoTV and both names remain widely used today.

In response to widespread piracy, rightsholders and local authorities have taken countermeasures. This resulted in several referrals that reportedly resulted in criminal investigations in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.

Top Spanish football league [LaLiga](https://www.laliga.com/en-GB) notably helped to take down numerous operations [linked to MagisTV](https://torrentfreak.com/police-laliga-alianza-target-magistv-with-isp-office-raids-arrests-250725/) during the summer. While this hasn’t resulted in a complete shutdown of the popular brand, more actions appear to be in the pipeline.

## Pirates with Google IP Addresses

This week, LaLiga requested a DMCA subpoena at a federal court in California, through which it aims to compel Google to identify users associated with three IP-addresses: 34.8.45.110, 34.86.157.139, and 35.199.21.67.

The addresses are assigned to unnamed Google services and were allegedly used to stream a football match on FlujoTV without permission. Through its law firm, LaLiga notified Google of this activity on Tuesday.

“Google’s system and network is used to transmit LALIGA’s copyrighted works without authorization on the FlujoTV streaming service, an example being LALIGA’s broadcast of the football match between Atlético de Madrid and Villarreal that aired on September 13, 2025,” the notice explained.

*The Notice (in part)*

Through the DMCA subpoena, LaLiga hopes that Google can disclose sufficient information to identify the alleged infringer. That could possibly serve as evidence for a future enforcement action.

## LaLiga Targets App Operator

If a court clerk signs the legal paperwork, which has yet to happen, Google will be compelled to hand over information linked to the users of these IP addresses. That could include names, physical addresses, access logs, phone numbers, email addresses, payment information, and more.

Information shared by LaLiga’s attorneys suggests that the IP addresses are linked to an Android app (com.android.mgandroid) associated with FlujoTV.

*Proposed Subpoena & Pirate Stream Evidence*

The IP addresses appear to be linked to googleusercontent.com, which is used for user-generated content on various Google services. In this case, it was presumably used to stream copyright-infringing content, which raises an important issue.

## DMCA Subpoenas Have their Limitations

Last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit [confirmed](https://torrentfreak.com/court-of-appeals-dmca-subpoena-shortcut-to-unmask-pirates-remains-closed-250818/) that DMCA subpoenas are not unlimited in scope. They are not intended to compel service providers to identify copyright infringers based on an IP address if the service provider doesn’t store the infringing material.

The appeals court case concerned the identification of alleged BitTorrent pirates. The court concluded that Cox Communications is not required to share the personal details connected to these IP addresses. Instead of using a DMCA subpoena, rightsholders can request a standard subpoena by filing a regular lawsuit in federal court.

Whether Google is a mere conduit provider in the LaLiga case or if it also hosted content is not immediately clear. However, in theory, this nuance could complicate the football league’s enforcement efforts.

At the time of writing, the DMCA subpoena has yet to be signed by the court clerk. A copy of the request can be found [here (pdf)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/lalreq.pdf) and the letter sent to Google, including the evidence, is available [here (pdf)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/lallet.pdf).
