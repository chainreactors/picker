**Alright, so here‚Äôs a weird story from my adventures while doing Bug Bounty‚Ä¶**
Hey guys, I hope you‚Äôre doing well! I‚Äôm back again with another interesting Story. Today, I want to share how I discovered HP printer‚Äôs admin page by Doing basic directory brute-forcing. It Looks like someone decided the printer should be Open for all to access.

Grab your coffee, and let‚Äôs get started! üòâ

## ***The Discovery***

It all started on a regular afternoon. I was watching YouTube, just passing the time, when an email from [CyberBay](https://cyberbay.tech/) showed up in my inbox. It mentioned that some new programs had been launched, so I thought, why not take a look? I started with some basic recon, used WaybackURLs to find some old archived paths, then ran Nuclei to check for any quick wins. Nothing came up. So, I fired up Dirsearch and started brute-forcing directories, hoping to find something interesting. That‚Äôs when things took an unexpected turn one hidden path caught my eye, and it wasn‚Äôt just any path.
*I found myself staring at the unlocked admin page of an HP Printer.*

## **Digging Deeper: Access and Control**

This is the URL that earned me a critical bug within minutes:
<http://n119236249203.example.com/SSI/index.htm>

When I first opened it, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. It looked like a basic, and boring link nothing that much important. But as soon as the page loaded, I realized I was looking at something way more serious , the full admin panel of an HP printer.

No login, no warning, just open access to everything.

* I was able to modify network settings, like DNS and IP configurations, to redirect traffic through a malicious network they control.
