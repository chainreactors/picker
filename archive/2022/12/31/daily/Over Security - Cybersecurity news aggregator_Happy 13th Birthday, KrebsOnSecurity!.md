# Happy 13th Birthday, KrebsOnSecurity!

December 29, 2022

[68 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/happy-13th-birthday-krebsonsecurity/#comments)

KrebsOnSecurity turns 13 years old today. That’s a crazy long time for an independent media outlet these days, but then again I’m bound to keep doing this as long as they keep letting me. Heck, I’ve been doing this so long I briefly forgot which birthday this was!

Thanks to your readership and support, I was able to spend more time in 2022 on some deep, meaty investigative stories — the really satisfying kind with the potential to effect positive change. Some of that work is highlighted in the 2022 Year in Review review below.

Until recently, I was fairly active on **Twitter**, regularly tweeting to more than 350,000 followers about important security news and stories here. For a variety of reasons, I will no longer be sharing these updates on Twitter. I seem to be doing most of that activity now [on Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/%40briankrebs), which appears to have absorbed most of the infosec refugees from Twitter, and in any case is proving to be a far more useful, civil and constructive place to post such things. I will also continue to [post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bkrebs/) about new stories in 2023.

Here’s a look at some of the more notable cybercrime stories from the past year, as covered by KrebsOnSecurity and elsewhere. Several strong themes emerged from 2022’s crop of breaches, including the targeting or impersonating of employees to gain access to internal company tools; multiple intrusions at the same victim company; and less-than-forthcoming statements from victim firms about what actually transpired.

**JANUARY**

You just knew 2022 was going to be *The Year of Crypto Grift* when two of the world’s most popular antivirus makers — [Norton](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/norton-360-now-comes-with-a-cryptominer/) and [Avira](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/500m-avira-antivirus-users-introduced-to-cryptomining/) — kicked things off by installing cryptocurrency mining programs on customer computers. This bold about-face dumbfounded many longtime Norton users because antivirus firms had spent years broadly classifying all cryptomining programs as malware.

Suddenly, hundreds of millions of users — many of them old enough to have bought antivirus from **Peter Norton** himself back in the day — were being encouraged to start caring about and investing in crypto. Big Yellow and Avira weren’t the only established brands cashing in on crypto hype as a way to appeal to a broader audience: The venerable electronics retailer **RadioShack** wasted no time in announcing plans to launch [a cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.radioshack.org/).

By the second week of January, Russia had amassed more than 100,000 troops along its southern border with Ukraine. The Kremlin breaks with all tradition and announces that — at the request of the United States — it has [arrested 14 people suspected of working for REvil](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/at-request-of-u-s-russia-rounds-up-14-revil-ransomware-affiliates/), one of the more ruthless and profitable Russian ransomware groups.

Security and Russia experts dismiss the low-level arrests as a kind of “**ransomware diplomacy**,” a signal to the United States that if it doesn’t enact severe sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine, Russia will continue to cooperate on ransomware investigations.

The Jan. 19th story [IRS Will Soon Require Selfies For Online Access](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/01/irs-will-soon-require-selfies-for-online-access/) goes immediately viral for pointing out something that apparently nobody has noticed on the **U.S. Internal Revenue Service** website for months: Anyone seeking to create an account to view their tax records online would soon be required to provide biometric data to a private company in Virginia — **ID.me**.

Facing a backlash from lawmakers and the public, the IRS soon [reverses course](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/02/irs-selfies-now-optional-biometric-data-to-be-deleted/), saying video selfies will be optional and that any biometric data collected will be destroyed after verification.

**FEBRUARY**

Super Bowl Sunday watchers are treated to no fewer than a half-dozen commercials for cryptocurrency investing. **Matt Damon** sells his soul to **Crypto.com**, telling viewers that “fortune favors the brave” — basically, “[only cowards would fail to buy cryptocurrency at this point](https://theintercept.com/2022/10/26/matt-damon-crypto-commercial/).” Meanwhile, Crypto.com is trying to put space between it and recent headlines that a breach led to $30 million being stolen from hundreds of customer accounts. A single bitcoin is trading at around $45,000.

**Larry David**, the comedian who brought us years of awkward hilarity with hits like **Seinfeld** and **Curb Your Enthusiasm**, plays the part of the “[doofus, crypto skeptic](https://www.inverse.com/input/culture/tom-brady-matt-damon-crypto-ad-spending-down-cryptocom-super-bowl)” in [a lengthy Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWMnbJJpeZc) for **FTX,** a cryptocurrency exchange then valued at over $20 billion that is pitched as a “safe and easy way to get into crypto.” [Last month, FTX imploded and filed for bankruptcy; the company’s founder now faces civil and criminal charges from three different U.S. agencies].

On Feb. 24, Russia invades Ukraine, and fault lines quickly begin to appear in the cybercrime underground. Cybercriminal syndicates that previously straddled Russia and Ukraine with ease are forced to reevaluate many comrades who are suddenly working for The Other Side.

Many cybercriminals who operated with impunity from Russia and Ukraine prior to the war chose to flee those countries following the invasion, presenting international law enforcement agencies with rare opportunities to catch most-wanted cybercrooks. One of those is **Mark Sokolovsky**, a 26-year-old Ukrainian man who operated the popular “**Raccoon**” malware-as-a-service offering; Sokolovsky was [busted in March after fleeing Ukraine’s mandatory military service orders](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/10/accused-raccoon-malware-developer-fled-ukraine-after-russian-invasion/).

Also nabbed on the lam is **Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov**, a senior Ukrainian member of a transnational cybercrime group that [stole tens of millions of dollars over nearly a decade from countless hacked businesses](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/top-zeus-botnet-suspect-tank-arrested-in-geneva/). Penchukov was arrested after leaving Ukraine to meet up with his wife in Switzerland.

Ransomware group **Conti** chimes in shortly after the invasion, vowing to attack anyone who tries to stand in Mother Russia’s way. Within hours of that declaration several years worth of internal chat logs stolen from Conti [wer...
