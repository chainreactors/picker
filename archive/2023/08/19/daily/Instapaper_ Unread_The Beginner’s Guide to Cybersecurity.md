In 2012, ASUS released the RT-N66U, a completely unprotected router. Anyone with an internet connection could access the router and any personal files on it. Despite being aware of the issue, ASUS left over 100,000 people vulnerable to cybercrime for the next three years.

In a separate case in the summer of 2011, an anonymous hacker breached the Certificate Authority *DigiNotar*. At that time, the company held massive power over the web. The hacker took advantage, impersonating Google.com, and using the misplaced powers of certificate authorities to create a fake Gmail at the top of all search results. This tactic allowed them steal the passwords and email addresses of over 300,000 Iranians. What they did with those credentials is unknown, as the hackers’ identity is still in question today. A strong theory claims, however, that the Iranian government hacked *DigiNotar*to censor their citizens’ protests over the 2009 election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Tech has been fated to become a basic need since the internet was born. Considering [one in two Americans were victims of security breaches in 2021](https://aag-it.com/the-latest-cyber-crime-statistics/#:~:text=53.35%20million%20US%20citizens%20were,businesses%20and%20individuals%20is%20phishing), personal cybersecurity is already a crucial form of self-defense.

Being ready to shut and lock your digital doors yourself can give help give peace of mind. That’s why I, the [Leahy Center’s](https://www.champlain.edu/centers-of-experience/the-leahy-center) Tech Writer, bring you this *Beginner’s Guide to Home Cybersecurity*.

Here’s some bite-size advice before we dive into the fifty-course meal of how to build an invisible fortress:

The first thing to note: Just like staying physically healthy can bolster your physical self-defense, cyber-health ties into cyber self-defense. Remember to floss your teeth tonight, and remember to restart your phone before bed.

Second thing: Learning to implement cybersecurity into your life is about making it a habit. Once you know the basics, you can defend yourself. But you must be consistent, as certain practices are unsafe. For instance, you might accept website cookies, but that isn’t a healthy habit. Remember to decline cookies the same way you remember to lock your doors. I’ll admit learning some pieces can be challenging, but most times, it’s a matter of setting it, forgetting it, and resetting it. And investing in your security is always worth it.

Finally, educating yourself about your tech will go a long way. It doesn’t have to be a lot at first. Backing up your files, checking for updates, and getting better passwords will put you above most people.

Let’s begin.

## Cyber Hygiene

Have any scammers called you recently? Is your email clogged with random garbage? Conversely, have you ever clicked on a shady link, even by accident? Posted anything on social media that you regret impulsing into existence?

These missteps are the online equivalent of injuring yourself; the errors hurt the computer, and the computer dies when it becomes unusable. Your computer gets sick when you interact with spam calls, click shady links, act careless on your socials, or take any action that damages your online experience.

Your computer stays healthy when regularly taken care of. Let’s look at some ways to brush your online teeth.

### There’s (hopefully) a lock icon left of your URL.

Do you see it? Click on it.

![Picture of the lock icon. I circled it like five times with red marker.](https://leahycenterblog.champlain.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a1.png)

*Google users should see something like this.*

If you see the lock, you’re in the green. If you see the red ⚠️ symbol, please get off the website. But if you see the circled lowercase ‘i’, there’s a good chance you can make yourself safer in two key presses. The URL (probably) has http at the front. Put an s at the end to make it https, and then press the enter key. Your hypertext transfer protocol is now hypertext transfer protocol secure.

So, [why does this work?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/#:~:text=HTTPS%3A%20What%20are%20the%20differences,far%20more%20secure%20than%20HTTP)

Well, it involves more than just the letter s. HTTPS uses TLS, a protocol that encrypts your HTTP requests. In English, TLS jumbles communications between behind-the-scenes parts of a website. This security protects you by ...
