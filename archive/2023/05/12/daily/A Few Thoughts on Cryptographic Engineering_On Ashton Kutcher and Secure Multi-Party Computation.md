I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “[chat control](https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/chat-control/)“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that *client-side scanning* technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category oftextual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”

I have many thoughts about the safety of the EU proposal, and you can read [some of them here.](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/03/23/remarks-on-chat-control/) (Or you’re interested in the policy itself, you can read this [recent opinion](https://t.co/aYbfLqnKBo) by the EU’s Council’s Legal Service.) But although the EU proposal is the *inspiration* for today’s post, it’s not precisely what I want to talk about. Instead, I’d like to clear up some confusion I’ve noticed around *the specific technologies* that many have proposed to use for building these systems.

Also: I want to talk about Ashton Kutcher.

*Ashton Kutcher visits the EU parliament in March 2023 (photo: [Roberta Metsola](https://www.brusselstimes.com/417985/ashton-kutcher-spotted-in-the-european-parliament-promoting-childrens-rights).)*

It turns out there were a few people visiting Brussels to talk about encryption this March. Only a few days before my own visit, Ashton Kutcher gave a major speech to EU Parliament members in support of the Commission’s content scanning proposal. (And yes, I’m talking about that Ashton Kutcher, the guy who played Steve Jobs and is married to Mila Kunis.)

Kutcher has been very active in the technical debate around client-side scanning. He’s the co-founder of an organization called [Thorn](https://www.thorn.org/about-our-fight-against-sexual-exploitation-of-children/), which aims to develop cryptographic technology to enable content scanning. In March he gave an [impassioned speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aydwlbTh3NE) to the EU Parliament urging the deployment of these technologies, and remarkably he didn’t just talk about the policy side of things. When asked how to balance user privacy against the needs of scanning, he even made a concrete technical proposal: to use *[fully-homomorphic encryption](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/01/02/very-casual-introduction-to-fully/)* (FHE) as a means to evaluate encrypted messages*.*

Now let me take a breath here before my head explodes.

I promise I am not one of those researchers who believes only sub...
