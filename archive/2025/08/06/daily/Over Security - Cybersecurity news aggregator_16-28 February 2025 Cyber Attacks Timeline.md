In the second timeline of February 2025, I collected 116 events (8.92 events/day) with a threat landscape dominated by **malware** with **29%**, a value very close to 30% of the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/07/23/1-15-february-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/), ahead of **ransomware**, back at number two with **21%**, from 8% of the previous fortnight, and **targeted attacks** with **17%**, very close to 16% of H1.

In terms of **initial access** techniques, **phishing** was still the preferred weapon with **15%**, up from 12%, once again ahead of the **exploitation** of vulnerabilities in **public-facing apps**(**10****%** up from 9%) and **social engineering** with **7%**.

**Cyber crime** led the **motivations** chart with **68%** up from 60%, as usual ahead of **cyber espionage** (**19%** down from 16%), and **hacktivism** with **5%**.

**Multiple organizations** led the **sectors** chart with **17%**, down from 22%, ahead of **governments** with**13%**, up from 9% and **individuals** with **10%**.

Besides these trends, as always the timeline is rich of interesting events, such as [mega breaches](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2024/12/18/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-2024/) and attacks against organizations in the fintech space, so my final suggestion does not change: browse the timeline for the details of the events collected in this fortnight.
