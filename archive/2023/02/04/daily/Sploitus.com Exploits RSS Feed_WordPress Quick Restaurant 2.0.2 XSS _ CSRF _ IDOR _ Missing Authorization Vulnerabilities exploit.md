On January 16, 2023, the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team responsibly disclosed several vulnerabilities in Quick Restaurant Menu, a WordPress plugin that allows users to set up restaurant menus on their sites. This plugin is vulnerable to Missing Authorization, Insecure Direct Object Reference, Cross-Site Request Forgery as well as Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 2.0.2.

We found that contact information was not readily available for the vendor, so we reached out to the WordPress Plugin Security Team team directly on January 16, 2023 to report the security issues. The team acknowledged receipt of our email on January 18, 2023. All issues were addressed in version 2.1.0, which was released on January 20, 2023. Unfortunately, the plugin is still closed for downloads at this point, so we recommend manually downloading the patched version, or uninstalling the plugin completely until the plugin has been reinstated.

We released a firewall rule addressing the lack of authorization checks on January 16, 2023. Premium, Care, and Response customers received that protection the same day, while sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection 30 days later on February 15, 2023.

Due to the nature of Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities, which involve tricking administrators into performing actions they are allowed to perform, it is not possible to provide full protection without blocking legitimate requests. As such, we recommend updating as soon as possible to ensure that your site is fully protected against any exploits that may target the Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability.

Vulnerability Summaries

Description: Missing Authorization to Arbitrary Post Deletion

Affected Plugin: Quick Restaurant Menu

Plugin Slug: quick-restaurant-menu

Affected Versions: <= 2.0.2

CVE ID: CVE-2023-0555

CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Researcher/s: Marco Wotschka, Ivan Kuzymchak

Fully Patched Version: 2.1.0

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke those actions intended for administrator use. Actions include menu item creation, update and deletion and other menu management functions. Since the plugin does not verify that a post ID passed to one of its AJAX actions belongs to a menu item, this can lead to arbitrary post deletion/alteration.

Description: Insecure Direct Object Reference

Affected Plugin: Quick Restaurant Menu

Plugin Slug: quick-restaurant-menu

Affected Versions: <= 2.0.2

CVE ID: CVE-2023-0550

CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Researcher/s: Marco Wotschka

Fully Patched Version: 2.1.0

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to the fact that during menu item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.

Description: Cross-Site Request Forgery

Affected Plugin: Quick Restaurant Menu

Plugin Slug: quick-restaurant-menu

Affected Versions: <= 2.0.2

CVE ID: CVE-2023-0554

CVSS Score: 8.1 (High)

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Researcher/s: Marco Wotschka

Fully Patched Version: 2.1.0

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update menu items, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Vulnerability Analysis

Quick Restaurant Menu is a plugin offered by ThingsForRestaurants that provides site owners with the ability to create menus for different occasions such as lunch and dinner along with the option to price items differently per menu.

As part of the plugin’s functionality, menu items can be created, deleted and moved around on menus. Dividers can be added to menus to visually separate different menu sections from one another. Menu items are stored as posts with type erm_menu_item.

More specifically, the plugin allows users to arrange menu items for menus via a drag-and-drop method and utilizes AJAX actions to accomplish this. Below is one of those functions in more detail:

Code Before Fix

We can see that this short function checks for the existence of a post_id parameter in the POST request, casts this provided parameter to an integer and then deletes the menu item with this id. This function can be invoked by sending a POST request to /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php that contains the action name as well as a post id.

POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1

Host: 127.0.0.1

action=erm_delete_menu_item&post_id=49

A Teaching Moment: Important Safety Measures

We are going to use this function and vulnerability above to discuss several safety measures that need to be taken to secure AJAX actions.

Authorization Checks – Verify the User’s Capabilities

AJAX actions are by default made available to authenticated users. That means the action above can be utilized by subscribers. However, it is not typical for subscribers to alter restaurant menus. It is therefore important that such functionality be protected against misuse by making sure the user performing the action is permitted to do so. One way to accomplish this is a capability check via the current_user_can function, i.e. current_user_can(‘manage_options’).

Other capabilities may be deemed sufficient, but the capability to manage options provides a user with access to general settings of a WordPress site and is often used as a proxy. Another, more appropriate, and narrowed in check would be current_user_can(‘edit_posts’, post_id), which would ensure that the user performing the requested action has the capability to edit the post with the ID provided.

This capability check is missing from this and other AJAX actions.

Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection – Verification of Intent

In addition to ensuring that a user has permission to perform an action, one also needs to ensure they intended to perform the action in the first place. We have previously written about the importance of properly implementing nonce checks to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities. As a general rule, the nonce is set when an action such as dragging, adding or deleting a menu item is initiated in the administrator dashboard or the plugin’s corresponding page. The AJAX action processing the request needs to verify that the nonce provided to it is correct, thus verifying that the request was initiated with intent.

Nonces can be added to a URL directly via the wp_nonce_url() function or via wp_create_nonce(). For verification of the nonce, WordPress offers several options. One of them is the function check_admin_referer() which accepts the name of the protected action as well as the name of the nonce intended to protect it. It checks the nonce as well as the referrer ensuring that the request ...
