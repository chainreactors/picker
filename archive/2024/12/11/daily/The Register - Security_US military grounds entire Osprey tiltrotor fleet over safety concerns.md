The US Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps have grounded their fleet of Boeing-Bell-made Osprey V-22s on safety grounds.

A spokesperson for the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) told *The Register* that the decision had been made following an incident where one of the aircraft made an emergency landing.

"Out of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants December 6. This decision comes following a recent precautionary landing of a CV-22. There were no injuries to the crew," he explained.
