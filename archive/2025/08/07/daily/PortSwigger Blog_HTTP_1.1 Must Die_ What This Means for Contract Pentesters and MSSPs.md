# HTTP/1.1 Must Die: What This Means for Contract Pentesters and MSSPs

At Black Hat USA and DEFCON 2025, PortSwigger's Director of Research, James Kettle, issued a stark warning: request smuggling isn't dying out, it's evolving and thriving.

Despite years of defensive efforts, new research unveiled by Kettle proves that [HTTP request smuggling](/web-security/request-smuggling) (or "desync" attacks) remain not only rampant but dangerously underestimated, compromising tens of millions of supposedly well-secured websites worldwide.

In his groundbreaking new research, [HTTP/1.1 Must Die: The Desync Endgame](https://portswigger.net/research/http1-must-die), Kettle challenges the security community to completely rethink its approach to request smuggling. He argues that, in practical terms, it's nigh on impossible to consistently and reliably determine the boundaries between HTTP/1.1 requests, especially when implemented across the chains of interconnected systems that comprise modern web architectures. Mistakes such as parsing discrepancies are inevitable, and when using upstream HTTP/1.1, even the tiniest of bugs often have critical security impact, including complete site takeover.

This research demonstrates unequivocally that patching individual implementations will never be enough to eliminate the threat of request smuggling. Using upstream HTTP/2 offers a robust solution. If we are serious about securing the modern web, it's time to retire HTTP/1.1 for good.

For MSSPs and contract pentesters, this represents both a critical service gap and a unique opportunity to deliver high-value findings that your competition miss.

## Buried Risk in Client Environments

Request smuggling lives in the cracks between systems, whether that be proxies, CDNs, or distributed backends. HTTP/1.1 is full of ways for those systems to disagree about request boundaries.

[PortSwigger's latest research](https://portswigger.net/research/http1-must-die) has confirmed an uncomfortable truth: not only are request smuggling vulnerabilities still extremely prevalent, attempts to mitigate them have in fact just made them harder to spot. In many cases, these mitigations have in fact just compounded the problem by adding yet more complexity to how systems are supposed to determine where each request starts and ends.

Several major CDNs were found to be vulnerable to new desync vectors and subtle variations on well-known exploits, exposing over 24 million of their customers' websites.

This isn't an academic risk; after bypassing supposedly battle-hardened mitigations entirely, the researchers were awarded over $200,000 in bug bounties from these techniques, highlighting both the prevalence and severity of the problem. If you're operating in a results-driven MSSP model, this should signal opportunity as well as urgency.

As a result, these bugs aren't just hard to find; they're actively obscured by current defence mechanisms. This allows you, as an external tester, to demonstrate real value by surfacing issues missed by internal teams, scanners, and other third-party contractors.

## What This Means for Your Engagements

Your clients rely on you to deliver meaningful, deep, and impactful results under pressure. Desync issues are perfect territory for that as they're only detectable through protocol-level inspection, have potentially remained hidden for years in your clients' stacks, and have a tangible, high-severity impact.

Here's how you can use this research to your advantage:

* **Break shallow assumptions:** HTTP downgrading is especially risky. Systems claiming HTTP/2 support often rely on HTTP/1.1 internally, reintroducing all the ambiguities that desync attacks rely on and, in fact, making the problem far worse.
* **Evade brittle defenses:** Current defences rely on regex-based filters and header normalization, which can be easily bypassed. In fact, many vendors just fingerprint known payloads, giving your clients the illusion of security without protecting them against the underlying issue.
* **Go where other testers can't:** Supposedly mature setups can exhibit parsing mismatches that quietly open the door to desync exploitation, even in cases where the established testing methodology doesn't flag any obvious issues. You can no longer rely on default test cases or shallow scans; desync attacks demand protocol-level thinking. These bugs arise from infrastructure-level mismatches, so your tooling and methodology need to reflect that.

## What You Can Do Right Now

If you're focused purely on the usual application logic, input validation, or authenticati...
