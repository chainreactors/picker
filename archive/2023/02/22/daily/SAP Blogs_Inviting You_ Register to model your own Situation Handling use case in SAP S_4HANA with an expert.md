You may be familiar with issues that repeatedly impact your business, such as delayed deliveries, expiring contracts, or pending confirmations and approvals. You can improve your business processes significantly by automatically alerting the right users about them in time and by proposing follow-up actions.

Situation Handling in SAP S/4HANA offers you a wide range of predefined use cases with the standard framework.

If you have further business requirements, you can create your own Situation Handling use cases with the extended framework. For example, you can help project managers avoid project delays by notifying them about pending resource requests. [Check out this blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/13/custom-situation-handling-use-case-for-professional-services-unstaffed-resource-requests/) for more details.
