Introducing [Dastardly](https://portswigger.net/burp/dastardly) - a free, lightweight [web application security](/burp/application-security-testing) scanner for your [CI/CD](/developers/ci-cd-security) pipeline, from the makers of [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

## Secure web development ain't easy

Ensuring your code is written securely can be a bit of a headache. Most of us know about the risks of [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) by now, but what about vulnerabilities like [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) or [CORS misconfigurations](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors)?

There are hundreds of static (SAST) code analysis tools around, but many are prone to noise - distracting you with a seemingly endless stream of false positives. In short, these tools often get ignored at best.

## Dastardly is different

Dastardly's scanner produces very little noise, thanks to its [dynamic (DAST) methodology](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/dast). It looks at your application from the outside in - just like a real attacker. So if it sees a vulnerability, you can be pretty sure it's real. And to do this, it uses a stripped-down version of the scanner used by Burp Suite - the world's leading toolkit for web security testing.

In the past, dynamic analysis has been difficult to fit into CI/CD - being slower than static analysis. But Dastardly scans complete in ten minutes or less - giving you fast feedback on [seven security issues you should be aware of](https://portswigger.net/burp/dastardly/scan-checks). This gives you the ability to fix actual security issues there and then, without any painful context-switching or false positives.

## Get scanning!

That's really all there is to it - [Dastardly](https://portswigger.net/burp/dastardly) is fast, accurate, and completely free of charge.

And we've made it easy to get it running in your CI/CD pipeline. Check out the [Dastardly documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/dastardly) for more details.
