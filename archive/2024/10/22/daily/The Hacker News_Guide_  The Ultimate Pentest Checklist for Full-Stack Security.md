## **Pentest Checklists Are More Important Than Ever**

Given the expanding attack surface coupled with the increasing sophistication of attacker tactics and techniques, penetration testing checklists have become essential for ensuring thorough assessments across an organization's attack surface, both internal and external. By providing a structured approach, these checklists help testers systematically uncover vulnerabilities in various assets like networks, applications, APIs, and systems. They ensure no critical area is overlooked and guide the testing process, making it more efficient and effective at identifying security weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. A pentest checklist essentially leaves no stone unturned and is a detailed and comprehensive list of every type of vulnerability in which to simulate an attack against.

Each asset being tested, however, requires a different [pentest checklist](https://www.breachlock.com/resources/reports/the-ultimate-pentest-checklist-for-full-stack-security/) tailored to its specific characteristics and risks. For example, a checklist for pentesting web applications – which remains one of the top targets by malicious actors - will be quite lengthy but encompasses vulnerabilities that are unique to external-facing apps. These specialized checklists are a litmus test to ensure that security measures are evaluated, assesses for effectiveness, depending on the asset, and make overall testing more targeted and relevant to each environment.

BreachLock recently introduced a comprehensive guide that includes detailed pentest checklists of the primary stages involved in pentesting using various frameworks such as OWASP Top 10 and OWAS ASVS across every asset and all respective associated vulnerabilities for the following:

* **Network –** A pentest checklist for a Black Box external network testing including information gather, vulnerability scanning and enumeration, generic security findings, and service-based testing.
* **Web Applications**. A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including user authentication, authorization testing, input testing, file-based attacks, error handling, business logic testing, and discovery and recon.
* **APIs –** A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including user authentication, authorization testing, input testing, file-based attacks, error handling, business logic testing, and discovery and recon.
* **Mobile -** A pentest checklist for Gray Box testing including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and network analysis.
* **Wireless** – An abbreviated pentest checklist including identification of wireless network (SSID), unauthorized access to wireless networks, access security controls, and rogue access point detection
* **Social Engineering**- Aa abbreviated pentest checklist including phishing attacks, pretexting and impersonation, USB drops, and physical penetration.

This is a summary of why pentest checklists are important including an overview of a general pentest checklist. A complete guide for full-stack security, including BreachLock's compendium of comprehensive pentest checklists across all assets, can be accessed [here](https://www.breachlock.com/resources/reports/the-ultimate-pentest-checklist-for-full-stack-security/).

## **Overview of Pentesting Delivery Models**

Penetration testing has become one of the most effective offensive security measures to identify and assess vulnerabilities across both internal and external attack surfaces. Traditional pentesting methods have certainly evolved and penetration testing services are now widely used to help fortify an organization's security posture.

Pentesting is carried out by certified security experts who simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities for assessment and mitigation within a specific scope. These tests are based on detailed pentest checklists that are tailored by asset (e.g., web applications, network, APIs, etc.) and act as a guide for the pentest checklist process, ensuring standardized frameworks are used and testing adheres to applicable compliance requirements.

To better understanding pentesting, below are the varied methods used for penetration testing that lie in the delivery model, scalability, and frequency of testing, followed by pentest checklists by asset type.

### **Delivery Models**

1. **Traditional Penetration Testing:** Typically performed manually by a team of certified pentesting experts over a fixed period (often a few days or weeks). The engagement is project-based with a final report delivered upon completion of testing.
   * **Frequency:** Usually performed on a periodic basis, such as annually or semi-annually, as part of compliance requirements or security audits.
   * **Scalability:** Limited in scalability due to the manual effort required by human testers and the one-off nature of the engagement.
   * **Advantage:** Deep analysis, thorough testing tailored to specific security requirements, and direct engagement with pentest experts.
   * **Challenges:** Fixed time frame and limited scope of assessment, which can leave gaps between tests.
2. **Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS):** PTaaS is a cloud-based model that offers ongoing penetration testing services, often integrated with platforms that provide real-time reporting and collaboration. ...
