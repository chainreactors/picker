Miami, USA, June 1, 2022 — SAP Latin America, together with CSTI Corp (official partner of SAP) and the Peruvian University of Applied Sciences (UPC) organized ULatinHack, a hackathon aimed at students from universities in Latin America and the Caribbean.

This is the first edition of this virtual hackathon: ULatinHack, an initiative whose mission is to train the talent of the future of Latin America in tools, programming methodologies, Design Thinking and more so that they can work with real cases during their university classes.

Through this program we want to train young university talent with technology and making use of challenge-based learning (ABR), which is also known in English as Challenge Based Learning (CBL). This learning consists of students looking for a real solution to a problem posed, being themselves the protagonists of their learning, developing a critical, reflective attitude and analyzing their environment.

"We had more than 250 applicants from 19 universities in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru and we had a jury that also included SAP customers to define the winner," said Maria Calzada de Neumann, director of SAP University Alliances in Latin America, Spain and Portugal. "Through initiatives like this, we give students the excellent opportunity to train in the latest SAP solutions, while putting into practice many soft skills needed to thrive in this digital age."

As part of the program there were 2 weeks of tech talks and hands-on live sessions with experts from SAP, CSTI Corp, among others, on Design Thinking, Mural, Elevator Pitch, Business Skills, SAP AppGyver, SAP CAI, iRPA, SAP Analytics Cloud, Sustainability, SAP UI5, Cloud Application Programming model and Cloud Foundry Runtime.

As a result, the proposal of the Daebak team, made up of students from the Peruvian University of Applied Sciences (UPC), won first place with a solution to give a creative and innovative response to a challenge on femicide, which was selected by a prominent panel, with representatives of the industry.

"As a house of studies we are proud that our students have obtained the first place in this first edition of ULatinHack 2022. Our participating students have been able to know the realities of other countries and learn about SAP technology, which is required by large organizations. We will continue with the commitment to provide an education of excellence that allows us to train young innovators with skills, knowledge and competencies that allow them to exceed their expectations and obtain high-level recognitions such as this international event," said Jimmy Armas, director of the careers of Information Systems Engineering, Software Engineering and EPE Systems Engineering of the UPC.
