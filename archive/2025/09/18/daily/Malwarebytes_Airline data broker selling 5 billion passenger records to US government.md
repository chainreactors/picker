# Airline data broker selling 5 billion passenger records to US government

Posted: September 17, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

We already knew that the US airline industry gave the government access to passenger records. However, this week it emerged that at least five billion passenger records are being sold to government agencies via a searchable database—far more than was initially believed.

A few weeks ago, investigative research team 404 Media reported on a secretive [relationship](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/us-airline-industry-quietly-selling-flight-data-to-dhs) between many US airlines and the US government. That story showed that the airlines had sold US agencies access to around a billion records.

Now, researchers have found the data broker that collects flight data from the airline industry has made at least five billion records available to federal agencies.

The organization selling the data is the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), which is owned and operated by at least eight US airlines. It sells the government this data under the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), which was started after the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.

ARC provides access to a searchable database of at least five billion records, updated daily with new ticketing information. At least one agency, the US Secret Service, has a contract to access this data, paying $885,000 for data through 2028, according to documents obtained by [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/airlines-sell-5-billion-plane-ticket-records-to-the-government-for-warrantless-searching/).

## Known clients

In June, 404 Media found that ARC had been making names, flight itineraries, and financial details available to US agencies, which were forbidden from revealing it as the source, under contract. The data included flights booked via 12,800 travel agencies, which submit ticket sales from over 270 carriers globally to ARC.

Originally developed as a financial clearing house, ARC provides payment settlement services for federal agencies and airlines. Known clients include Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Travel dates and credit card numbers are available to federal customers, which also include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Marshals Service.

## A long history of sharing data

The US airline industry has a long history of interacting with the US government. In 1996, Al Gore’s White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security [recommended](https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/1996/09/aviation-safety-steps/893/) automated screening for better flight security. A year later, most North American airlines voluntarily [implemented](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001092) what became known as the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). After the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) took over CAPPS, it built a system called CAPPS II, which used security color-coding for flight passengers. That system ran into trouble after several airlines admitted to giving the US government access to passenger data.

American Airlines [reportedly](https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/2004/05/01/fbi-got-records-on-air-travelers/30548377007/) confessed to making passengers’ records available in the early 2000s, as did United, while Northwest a...
