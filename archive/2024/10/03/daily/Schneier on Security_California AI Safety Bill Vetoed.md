## California AI Safety Bill Vetoed

Governor Newsom has [vetoed](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/california-governor-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill/) the state’s AI safety bill.

I have mixed feelings about the [bill](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/). There’s a lot to like about it, and I want governments to regulate in this space. But, for now, it’s all [EU](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/).

(Related, the Council of Europe [treaty on AI](https://rm.coe.int/1680afae3c) is [ready for signature](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/council-of-europe-opens-first-ever-global-treaty-on-ai-for-signature). It’ll be legally binding when signed, and it’s a big deal.)

*He needs to do what others want.*

With regards,

> “I have mixed feelings about the bill. There’s a lot to like about it…”

And there is quite a lot not to like.

Which gave Gov Newsom room to,

1, Kill the bill for the big money valley corps.

The problem is that now California politicos are not going to go near such legislation again in this political cycle or several after.

But also California has been seen as a “litmus test” for certain type of legislation to happen in other states. Which probably means similar legislation will get “back burnnered” in other places.

From what I read, it was not really strong legislation at all, so perhaps it was right for it to swan dive in smoke and flames…

AI is just a tool, and nothing more. It is not good, or bad, by itself. It is something than, as other tools, can be used for good or evil purposes. All it depends on who uses it, and how it is used.

The only goal of these AI-doomers driven bills is restricting the use and research on this field to those blessed by the government. The reason is simple to understand: AI is a powerful tool and they do not want people having full access to it on an uncontrolled way, as it can provide too much freedom to its users. It is better for them restricting access to AI developments to corporations and governments. They fear losing control over a technology that may provide undesiderable freedom to citizens, as other powerful tools did in the past.

With AI on the hands of citizens, most Internet services will become irrelevant.
