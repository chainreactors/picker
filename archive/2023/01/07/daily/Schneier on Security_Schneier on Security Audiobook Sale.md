@ Bruce,

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure why, but ‚Ä¶ at 50% off‚Äù

Hopefully that is not comming out of your pocket‚Ä¶

A friend who writes technical books for people doing crafts, discovered that their book had been ‚Äúput on sale‚Äù and the company used it as an excuse to not pay the author their dues. In fact the company ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to even register the re-print run and sales‚Ä¶

From the audiobooks.com website, ‚ÄúWe only offer listening via our website, and/or within our app for iOS or Android.‚Äù I believe this means there is no sanctioned way to download a purchased book in ogg, mp3, or a similar format so that you can listen unencumbered and un-instrumented. Having said that, at least on Android, you can probably figure out where the audiobook is stored and scrape it.

There is a lot of hate for Audible/Amazon but FWIW ‚ÄúSchneier on Security‚Äù is available on Audible for one credit which costs me $9.56. This is less expensive than $12.50 on audiobooks.com even at 50% off. OpenAudible offers a very user-friendly way to retrieve the content you bought on Audible as an mp3 or aac file.

I love audiobooks!

I had not heard of this site before. It‚Äôs a good one to bookmark. Lots of ideas for future computer-related (or other genre) reads.

There are certainly fascinating works people may not want to miss out on üôÇ

SoS was a book I remember finding at my library. I don‚Äôt know what I enjoyed more, the writing style or the ideas. It was definitely a stand out.

The local supermarkets offered a similar discount of my produce. I took it to the markets, increased the price and sold it to fancy chefs.

I notice at the end of the URL:

‚Äú?refId=52755‚Äù

Making a little bit of coin from the sale(s), maybe?
