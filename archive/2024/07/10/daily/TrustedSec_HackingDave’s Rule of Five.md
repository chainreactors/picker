Buckle up! This is a different type of blog that isn’t our normally scheduled technical prowess or superhuman talents we have here at TrustedSec. Each month, I have the privilege of hosting a meeting with new employees and interns at both TrustedSec and Binary Defense. This session serves as an introduction to the company, a warm welcome to the team, and an open forum to answer any questions they might have. It's a chance for me to motivate them about their careers and explore what's possible in the cybersecurity field. These sessions are a cornerstone of our onboarding process, providing a platform for new team members to voice their aspirations and concerns, and fostering a sense of community and shared purpose right from the start.

During these meetings, I often encourage new hires to pursue their dreams, even if that means eventually leaving the company. It's crucial to chase your passion, whether it's with us or elsewhere. This might seem counterintuitive, but I firmly believe that when individuals are passionate about what they do, they bring more value to their current roles, even if their long-term path leads them elsewhere. Recently, I was asked a question that particularly resonated with me: "You have accomplished so much in your career. How does someone starting off make progress or even feel accomplished when the hill is so large to climb? It feels like at the end of the day, I've accomplished nothing towards my larger goals."

This question struck a chord because it's a challenge nearly everyone faces, me included. Reflecting on my journey, I responded with how vastly different my days are now compared to when I first started in cybersecurity. Back then, cybersecurity was my hobby and passion, not a career. I spent countless nights coding until 3 or 4 AM, sometimes not sleeping at all because I was so engrossed in developing new tools or uncovering zero-day vulnerabilities. I remember the intense struggle of trying to bypass Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in Microsoft. After two weeks of frustration, working late into the night in my basement, and living inside of a debugger, I finally succeeded. That small victory taught me the importance of perseverance and passion in learning new things and pushing beyond perceived limits.

This leads to an essential piece of advice: Make your career your hobby. Focus on what excites you and turn that into your job. If you don't enjoy what you're doing, quit and find something you love. Passion breeds excellence. This approach not only fosters personal satisfaction but also significantly enhances productivity and innovation.

## Building a Sense of Accomplishment: HackingDave’s Rule of Five

Feeling accomplished can be particularly challenging, especially in the early days of a career. I struggled with this during the formative years of TrustedSec and Binary Defense. My days were consumed by back-to-back conference calls, leaving me exhausted and wondering what I had achieved. I realized that this was not the best use of my time and was not aligning with my long-term goals. This constant state of busyness without clear accomplishments c...
