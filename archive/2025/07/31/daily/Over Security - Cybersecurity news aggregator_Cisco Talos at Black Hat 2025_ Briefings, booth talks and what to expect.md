[The Need to Know](/category/the-need-to-know/)

Cisco Talos is back at Black Hat with new research, threat detection overviews and opportunities to connect with our team. Whether you're interested in what we’re seeing in the threat landscape, detection engineering or real-world incident response, here's where and how to find us:

## Visit us at the Cisco booth: 2726

We’ll have short, 15-minute booth talks throughout Wednesday and Thursday of Black Hat, with topics including:

* Talos Vulnerability Discovery Year in Review
* How to: Threat Intel
* Full Metal SnortML: Accelerating Machine Learning based Firewalls with FPGAs
* From CVE to Detection: A Rule Writer's Journey Through Modern Threats

We also have these sessions as part of the wider conference agenda:

## Lunch & Learn: Backdoors & Breaches

**Lagoon KL, Level 2 | Wednesday, Aug 6, 12:05–1:30 PM**
**Speaker: Joe Marshall**

Join Joe and members of Talos as we discuss and develop incident response plans in real-time. We’ll use real scenarios over a game of Backdoors & Breaches, an incident response card game developed by Black Hills Information Security. Members from Talos Threat Intelligence will lead tables through the game over lunch and discuss recent threat trends.

[**Reserve your spot here**](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/features/schedule/index.html?_mc=em_bhus_bhus_x_tsmatt_Pre-Reg_2025_EM43&elq_mid=4512&elq_cid=3926942#engage-with-cisco-talos-over-backdoors--breaches-44721)

## From Telemetry to Actionable Security: Cisco Talos and Splunk's Threat Detection Collaboration

**Mandalay Bay L | Wednesday, August 6 | 10:50am-11:10am**

**Speakers: Jose Hernandez, Nick Biasini**

Join this session to learn how Cisco Talos and the Splunk Threat Research Team are combining the power of Cisco telemetry and Splunk security analytics to deliver more integrated security monitoring experiences. Threat research experts from the Talos and Splunk teams will review:

How these teams are uniquely collaborating to develop targeted security detections for joint Cisco and Splunk customers

An overview of the currently available security detections developed through this collaboration

A sneak peek of what the Talos and Splunk teams have on their detection roadmap

## Sponsored Session: Generative AI as a Lure, Tool and Weapon

**Mandalay Bay I | Wednesday, Aug 6, 11:20–12:10 PM**
**Speaker: Nick Biasini**

Nick will explore how generative AI is shaping today’s threat landscape, from attackers using AI to enhance operations, to malware posing as AI tools, to efforts targeting the models themselves. The session will also cover how organizations can safely adopt GAI while defending against its misuse.

## Threat Briefing:ReVault! Compromised by Your Secure SoC

**Oceanside C, Level 2 |  Wednesday, Aug 6, 10:20–11:00 AM**
**Speaker: Philippe Laulheret**

This talk introduces ReVault, a vulnerability affecting a widely used embedded security chip. Philippe will demonstrate how a low-privilege user can exploit the flaw to extract sensitive data, gain persistence at the firmware level, and compromise the host system.

## Visit the Splunk Booth: Threat Hunters Cookbook Launch

**Splunk Booth 3046**

Our colleagues at Splunk will be launching their brand new *Threat Hunters Cookbook* in hard copy. We’ve had a sneak preview, and trust us, this is a brilliant resource for those who want to use modelling and machine learning to conduct threat hunts that really get the best out of your efforts.

If you're at the show, we’d love to hear what you’re working on, so stop by the Cisco booth (and grab yourself a Snorty while you’re at it). See you in Vegas!
