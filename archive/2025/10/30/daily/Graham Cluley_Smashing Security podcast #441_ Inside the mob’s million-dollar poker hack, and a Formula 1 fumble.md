Basketball stars have allegedly joined forces with the mafia to fleece high-rollers in a poker scam involving hacked shufflers, covert cameras, and an X-ray card table.

Meanwhile, researchers have found they could poke around an FIA driver portal to pull up the personal details of Formula 1 megastars.

Plus: Graham‚Äôs ‚ÄúPick of the Week‚Äù turns CAPTCHA hell into a delightfully deranged browser game that will make you question vegetables, geometry, and your life choices, while Danny takes a trip to ancient Africa.

All this and more is discussed in episode 441 of ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and special guest Danny Palmer.
