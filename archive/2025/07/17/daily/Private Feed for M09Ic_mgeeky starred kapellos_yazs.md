# 💣 Yet Another Zip Smuggler

This tool creates a **malicious ZIP archive** containing a `.lnk` (Windows shortcut) file and **injects a hidden base64-encoded payload** (tar-archived files) into the middle of the ZIP file before the Central Directory. The `.lnk` can be configured to **execute a decoy URL and extract+run the payload**, or **persist across reboots** by writing to the Windows Startup folder.

> **⚠️ DISCLAIMER**
> This tool is intended **strictly for educational purposes** and **authorized red team engagements**. Misuse of this code may be illegal. The author takes no responsibility for any damage caused.

---

## 📆 Features

* Creates a `.tar` archive of files and base64-encodes it.
* Embeds the payload into a ZIP file without breaking its structure.
* Generates a `.lnk` file pointing to `cmd.exe`, executing extraction and payload logic.
* Supports **persistence mode**: writes to Startup and reboots the system.
* Mimics a PDF icon using Microsoft Edge executable for deception.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Windows OS (for `.lnk` creation)
* `pywin32` (`pip install pywin32`)

---

## 🚀 Usage

```
python3 yazs.py <lnk_name.lnk> <decoy_url> <file1> [file2 ...] [--persist]
```

### Arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lnk_name` ...
