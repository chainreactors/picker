# From Fitbit to financial despair: How one woman lost her life savings and more to a scammer

Posted: September 12, 2025

We hear so often about people falling for scams and losing money. But we often don’t find out the real details of what happened, and how one “like” can turn into a nightmare that controls someone’s life for many years. This is that story.

Not too long ago, a scam victim named Karen reached out to me, asking for help. It’s a story that may seem unbelievable to some, but it [happens more often](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/romance-scammers-in-ghana-arrested-charged-with-more-than-100-million-in-theft) than you think.

Karen tells us about the initial hook:

> “My story started on January 1, 2020, when a man called Charles Hillary ‘liked’ something that I shared on the exercise app Fitbit. He kept on reaching out instead of just liking and moving on like most people do.“

It wasn’t long until “Charles” asked Karen if she wanted to move their chats to Google Hangouts. Karen used Google Hangouts at work so it didn’t seem like a strange request.

But moving a conversation to a more secure environment is not something scammers do for convenience. They do it to reduce the chance of anyone listening in on their conversation or finding out their identity.

Karen was slightly suspicious about when she would get messages from Charles, given that he had told her he was from Atlanta, Georgia.

> “Every time he messaged me, I would receive it around 2am, so I asked him where he was. He responded and said he was on a contract job with Diamond Offshore Drilling in Ireland. I later found that not to be true.”

As it happens, Ireland is in the same time zone as West Africa Time (WAT), which is used in countries like Gabon, Congo, and [Nigeria](https://www.actionfraud.org.uk/romance-scams/nigerian-romance-scams/).

In late January, after Karen and Charles had been talking for almost a month, he asked her for some help.

Charles said he had lent his friend, also in the oil drilling business, a lot of money. His friend had paid him back, he said, but had left it in a box with a security company, Damag Security.

> “He said the security company was closing and needed him to get his ‘box.’ He asked me to be the recipient and I asked him lots of questions but ultimately agreed since it would not cost me anything and I could place it in his bank at my local branch of Bank of America.”

Charles showed Karen the documentation:

Once a scammer has found an angle and the victim is invested, the costs will typically grow in number and in size.

> “This is when the nightmare began. The box immediately cost me $3900 for shipping.”

After that, Karen was asked by the security for money for various forms. Charles told her all forms should have been secured when the money was placed with the security company.

> “He played innocent through it all.”

The forms were expensive and ranged from $25,000 to around $60,000. Karen asked them to reduce the price and they did, so she paid.

Charles gave Karen several separate reasons as to why he wasn’t able to get the money himself:

* His bank account had been frozen due to money laundering.
* His ex-wife had taken a lot of his money so he froze his account until he could return in person.
* He had illegally done oil drilling in Russian waters and made a l...
