Partner Content For people who haven't personally experienced them, terms like data leak or data breach may seem unfamiliar and foreign - much like visiting a new destination abroad.

Having some prior knowledge is great, but it's just scratching the surface! The truth is that people don't always understand the significance of leaks and breaches, or their potential impact on a person or company.

So, buckle up: this article explains (in simple terms) what data leaks and data breaches are, their differences, how to prevent them, and more.
