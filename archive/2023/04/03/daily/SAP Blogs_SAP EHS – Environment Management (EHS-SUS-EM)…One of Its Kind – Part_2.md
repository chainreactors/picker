We have been sensing that the warmer temperatures changing weather pattern and disrupting the stability of an ecosystem. GHG(Greenhouse Gases), & SOx, NOx, etc., emissions have become more problematical, affecting our daily lives and damaging natural environment, and due to which, throughout industrial supply chains, every organization has had regulatory pressures and those are getting escalated.

So, Hadn`t we better compile GHG(Green House Gases) inventory? and let policy makers to compare emissions reduction opportunities across the supply chains?.

**Many says, software is a part of the solution to stay compliant with environmental regulations, but, when organization has bad tools and has no transparency regarding their operations, then It all really boils down to a sophisticated/integrated application component to meet regulatory complexities, which is SAP EHS Environment Management.**

The environment management application helps organizations to stay compliant with emissions related environmental regulations. With this SAP EHS-SUS-EM application component , organizations can ensure complete environmental record keeping , which even includes analysis of environmental aspects and impacts and tracking of environmental targets and objectives. This component covers processes to manage compliance scenario activities and incorporates a strategy to manage environmental regulation related data from data collection, sampling, calculation, and aggregation of emissions.

Let us have a high-level view of SAP EHS solution portfolio-Value Drivers:

Now, let us understand Environment Management value drivers and capabilities:

**Value Drivers:**

The Environment Management value drivers are to ensure the organization`s compliance with environmental regulations and minimize emissions as well.

**Capabilities:**

* Central repository for all compliance requirements from enterprise level down to specific equipment including regulatory , permit driven , and internal policies.

* Ability to detect and track compliance deviations through a lifecycle of investigation, casual analysis, and corrective actions.

* Task Calendar and Task Monitor applications.

* Calculation of GHG(Greenhouse Gases) as well as other air and water emissions to fulfill legal and reporting requirements.

* Interface for specific providers of regulatory content.

Why wait?...let us dive into Environment Management process...

The high-level process contains of three main steps - prepare, execute, and manage, each step can be repeated as many times as required depending on the need.

The main components of Environment Management are illustrated below.

In this blog, I would like to outline the SAP EHSM - EM(Environment Management) application feature - Compliance Requirement.

Now, for instance, I start with "Identifying Compliance Requirement" , and as part of this step, I will be performing below listed activities.

* Creating compliance requirement based on regulation/permit/policy

* Specifying environmental limits

* Adding regulatory list to the compliance requirement

* Preparing regulatory equations

* Activating the compliance requirement.

**Compliance Requirement:**

To be environmentally compliant, a given location or a piece of equipment must adhere to certain regulations/permits/policies issued by governing body or policies that are issued by the organization.

The compliance requirement is a main instrument for the environmental manager to ensure and control environmental compliance at a location or a piece of equipment in accordance with the corresponding regulations, permits, or policies.

Access App. "Manage Compliance Requirement, Regulations, Permits" to create.

I have chosen option "Create Regulation" for GHG(Green House Gases) reporting for Schenectady Plant.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Picture3-50.png)assign the validity area and "Save" the regulation.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Picture4-39.png)As part of the compliance requirement, do assign the location classifiers to GHG reporting![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Picture5-44.png)

**Environmental Limits:**

Environmental limits are used to define compliance checks on environmental data (collected, calculated, sampled, or aggregated) within the organizations compliance requirement paragraph.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Picture6-38.png)

Multiple environmental limits can be defined depending on the business case. The type of environmental limits that can be created as follows:

* Upper Limit

* Lower Limit

* Range

The subject of environmental limit can be a listed substance or a chemical/physical property that the environmental limit applies for and the corresponding unit of measurement.

For instance, I have chosen upper and lower limits for yearly and monthly CO2e targets for Schenectady plant.
