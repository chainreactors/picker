## Criminals Are Blowing up ATMs in Germany

It‚Äôs [low tech](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/27/europe/criminals-atm-robberies-europe-intl/index.html), but effective.

Why Germany? It has more ATMs than other European countries, and‚Äîif I read the article right‚Äîthey have more money in them.

EDITED TO ADD (11/14): Blog readers commented that countries like the Netherlands have laws requiring ATMs to have better security features. One that I thought particularly clever is a small ‚Äúglue explosion‚Äù inside the safe that‚Äôs triggered when the ATM safe is breached. The glue renders the currency worthless.

the amount of money or the number of ATMs certainly isn‚Äôt the reason Germany is the main target. the Criminals targeted the Netherlands before, but laws forced the banks to implement security measures(one example: when an explosion is detected all bills are glued together with a small ‚Äúglue explosion‚Äù inside the safe rendering them useless), so the Criminals chose the next best thing and it‚Äôs simply a question of the weakest link

Yeah, Germany is the hard-physical-cash hold-out in Europe.

Would cash staining put an end to this?

Cash is king when the lights go out.

As some in the South East of the US will appreciate, whilst credit cards are convenient, they don‚Äôt work when there is no power for the machines etc. At which point people if they‚Äôve got it go to cash or they go without the necessities of life.

It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve been to Germany but they and Austria had a

‚ÄúCash is normal cards are not view point.‚Äù

Which brings us to, cause and effect. The cause is cash is popular, the effect,

> ‚ÄúWhy Germany? It has more ATMs than other European countries, and‚Äîif I read the article right‚Äîthey have more money in them.‚Äù

Kind of ‚Äúsupply and demand‚Äù the demand for cash is high therefore the supply has to be consequently higher.

Harder to read,

But roughly ten times as many cards per head of population as Germany.

And German ATMs usually do not have devices that stain (and invalidates) the banknotes in case of a violent event. In other countries, these are much more common.

One solution would possibly be for the cash to self distruct when the ATM is being subjected to certain levels of shockwave pressure :).

Joking aside, it‚Äôs a complex issue: probably it could be partially solved by raising the bank‚Äôs inssurance premiums against these type of heists and the damage caused to the nearby buildings, changing the related legislation(penal and banking) and lastly, the citizems themselves could start thinking a bit different about their finances.

In a nutshell, risk analysis üòÅ

This isn‚Äôt really new. Buildings with ATMs have been closed during the night for the last 2-3 years now so that they can‚Äôt be blown up.

There is another reason. Most ATM robbers in Germany (and now as well in France and Belgium) are originating from the Netherlands, where they were a real plaque with a lot of completely damaged ATM‚Äôs. However the ATM‚Äôs in the Netherlands are now much better protected. After an explosion the money is left worthless, due to glue and paint. So the robbers are now taking their chance in Germany. They drive expensive (mostly stolen or ‚Äòhired‚Äô) and extreme fast Audi cars, trying to outrun the police.
But now the German ATM‚ÄôS get the same protection as the Dutch ones and the robbers move to France and other countries to do their tricks.

Well, there‚Äôs one more reason: for a long time, most German banks didn‚Äôt want to invest in deterrent measures (like dye staining the bills on intrusion attempts), until things *really* got out of hand.
Combined with all the facts the article states, that made (and partially still makes) their ATMs extremely attractive targets for anyone wanting to get rich quick and not minding possible casualties ‚Äì amongst themselves, and innocent people living upstairs of the ATM.

Germany is by far the least digitalized country in Europe, and the only country where you cannot expect to pay by card.
It makes sense that they have more ATMs, and that they need to have more cash in each ATM.

They just rip ‚Äôem out with a tow truck in Australia. Saves them from catching themselves on fire when they use too much gas. Then they take it to a bent cop to help them launder it.

More enterprising criminals open them up to see how they work. Like a Narus box, or which ever DPI system you purchase through a front company for your authoritarian state.
