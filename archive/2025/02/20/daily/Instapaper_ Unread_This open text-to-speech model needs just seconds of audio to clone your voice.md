Hands on Palo Alto-based AI startup Zyphra unveiled a pair of open text-to-speech (TTS) models this week said to be capable of cloning your voice with as little as five seconds of sample audio. In our testing, we generated realistic results with less than half a minute of recorded speech.

Founded in 2021 by Danny Martinelli and Krithik Puthalath, the startup aims to build a multimodal agent system called MaiaOS. To date, these efforts have seen the release of its Zamba family of small language models, optimizations such as tree attention, and now the release of its Zonos TTS models.

Measuring at 1.6 billion parameters in size each, the models were trained on more than 200,000 hours of speech data, which includes both neutral-toned speech such as audiobook narration, and "highly expressive" speech. According to the upstart's [release notes](https://www.zyphra.com/post/beta-release-of-zonos-v0-1) for Zonos, the majority of its data was in English but there were "substantial" quantities of Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, and German. Zyphra tells *El Reg* this data was acquired from the web and was not obtained from data brokers.
