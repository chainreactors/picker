# Who Are 'We?' Power Centers in Threat Modeling

![A screencapture of the paper title](/images/blog/img/2025/who-are-we-power-centers-in-threat-modeling-1000w.png)

I had planned to start 2025 with a more positive note, but the loss
of Amit Yoran, who was only a few years older than me, has hit me
hard. I first met Amit at a Computers, Freedom and Privacy
conference in the early 90s. He was in his West Point uniform,
which was not typical for attendees of the conference. So I went
over and struck up a conversation, and we continued over probably
30 years. I miss him. His [memorial service](https://www.adamsgreen.com/obituaries/Amit-Yoran?obId=34292392) will be on Jan
8, in Fairfax, VA. [Link, date updated.]

Which is relevant because last year, we lost another great
one, and this post was planned to share my draft paper for the
Festschrift [in honor of Ross Anderson](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/rossfest/).

The paper is [Who Are “We”? Power Centers in
Threat Modeling](/files/papers/rossfest/shostack-rossfest.pdf), and the abstract reads: “I examine
threat modeling techniques and questions of power dynamics in the
systems in which they’re used. I compare techniques that can be
used by system creators to those used by those who are not
involved in creating the system. That second set of analysts might
be scientists doing research, consumers comparing products, or
those trying to analyze a new system being deployed by a
government. Their access to information, skills and choices are
different. I examine the impact of those difference on threat
modeling methods.”

The paper is inspired not only by Ross and his work on power in
security, but also by conversations, most importantly with Julia
Slupska and Lorie Tanczer, who graciously spent an afternoon
educating me about the challenges of threat modeling for intimate
partner violence. Work by Becky Kazinsky was also very influential
to my thinking around these power centers.

I’m open to comments and feedback through Jan 10th, when I’ll need
to finalize and submit.

[Jan 7, update: Changed the link to Amit's memorial to a more credible one.]
