After patching iOS and iPadOS a few days ago, Apple patched the rest of its lineup today, most notably macOS. These updates include the two 0-days patched for iOS. Interestingly, we also see three vulnerabilities addressed specifically for VisionOS, Apple's latest operating system. One of the VisionOS vulnerabilities affects Personas, a feature only available in VisionOS.

NOTE: Apple amended its list of vulnerabilities for iOS/iPadOS. Many of the vulnerabilities below also affect iOS. The initial release only noted four different vulnerabilities.
