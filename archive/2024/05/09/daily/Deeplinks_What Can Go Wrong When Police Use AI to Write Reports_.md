Axon—the makers of widely-used police [body cameras](https://sls.eff.org/technologies/body-worn-cameras) and [tasers](https://abc11.com/taser-stun-gun-deaths-nc-nationwide-raleigh-police/12719372/) (and that also keeps [trying to arm drones)](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/axon-must-not-arm-drones-tasers)—has a new product: AI that will write police reports for officers.

Axon bills this product as the ultimate time-saver for police departments hoping to get officers out from behind their desks. But this technology could present new issues for those who encounter police, and especially those marginalized communities already subject to a disproportionate share of police interactions in the United States.
