## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload/lab-file-upload-remote-code-execution-via-web-shell-upload

The already authenticated attacker can upload HTML files on the

In this file, the attacker can be codding a malicious web-socket

depends on the scenario, the attacker can steal every day very
sensitive information, for a very long period of time, until the other
users will know that something is not ok with this system, and they
decide to stop using her, but maybe they will be too late for this
decision.
