## Monetizing personal data: the new form of prostitution

[![Post cover](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-revenue.webp)](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-revenue.webp)

I would like to open this article with a quote from the Italian Data Protection Authority, which is also the title of a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLr5qFP68iQ "La protezione dei dati è un diritto di libertà")
:

> Data protection is a fundamental right of freedom.

Let us now reflect on the concept of **personal data**. Personal means something that belongs to us, and whose ownership cannot be transferred. In fact, under the GDPR, we can grant third parties the right to use our personal data, but at any time we retain the right to request its deletion from those to whom we have granted such usage.

It is often said that:

> The vast amount of personal data that users pour onto the Internet every day is the new oil. {Andrew Keen}

Some services even suggest that we could directly profit from our personal data instead of leaving all the gains to multinational corporations.

Let us analyze why “renting” out our personal data does not work, why it *must not* work, and why we should be more cautious.

## Why It Doesn’t Work

Consider Facebook—not to single it out, but simply to make the example concrete.

Facebook’s revenue in 2019 was $16,886,000,000:

[![Facebook revenue in 2019](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-revenue.webp)](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-revenue.webp)

This is an enormous figure, and clearly driven by the monetization of user data. The idea that users should share in this profit is appealing. However, there is a problem: Facebook’s active user base is also enormous.

[![Monthly active Facebook users in 2019](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-monthly-users.webp)](/blog/2021/01/28/monetizing-personal-data-the-new-form-of-prostitution/facebook-monthly-users.webp)

Dividing revenue by the number of active users reveals that **the value of each individual user is less than $10 per year**. Certainly not life-changing.

We might assume that providing *higher-quality data* would increase this value. For example, we could supply Facebook with our geolocation, smartwatch data, link all our accounts, export browsing history, participate in every survey—and perhaps we would earn slightly more.

But it still wouldn’t change our lives.

And, truthfully, Facebook would not be affected if we deleted our account, updated our profile, or not. **We are just a drop in an ocean of 2 billion monthly active users.**

## Why It Must Not Work

Facebook states that it profiles users to improve their experience by:

* showing news more aligned with their interests,
* promoting products more relevant to their needs.

In reality, Facebook monetizes the ability to precisely target audiences with news and advertisements.

Now, suppose users began sharing more in Facebook’s profits. To pay us more, Facebook would need to generate greater value by offering new services. For example, if I were an influencer, I might promote a fashion brand suggested to me by Facebook. Facebook could then sell this influence to major fashion companies.

The more unconsciously I adopt Facebook’s suggestions, the more effective they are. The more people I manage to influence, the more profitable I become. In short, Facebook could begin shaping my behavior—and that of my network—reselling this capacity as a new form of advertising. The more complete and high-quality my data, the more powerful this influence becomes.

To increase user payouts, platforms must also increase their own revenue. Clearly, they could not pay all users equally, but would instead trigger a competition where users are incentivized to provide higher-quality data than others. This would allow platforms to reward a small subset of loyal users while gaining **greater power to manipulate the majority.**

## “I Can Quit Anytime”

Joining a social network is like smoking: many smokers claim they can quit anytime, yet they rarely do. And smoking leaves lasting traces in the body, which may resurface years later.

For many, social media use is the same: a release valve into a parallel reality, curated with tailored content. We believe we are in control, exercising free will, yet day by day we are subjected to increasingly powerful manipulation.

True free will can only be exercised when one is capable of resisting the emotions triggered by posts specifica...
