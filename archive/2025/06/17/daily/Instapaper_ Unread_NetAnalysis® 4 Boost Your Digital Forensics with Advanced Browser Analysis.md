We are delighted to announce the release of **NetAnalysis® v4.0**, a major update that brings powerful new features, enhanced performance, and a refined user interface, all designed to help forensic examiners work faster and more efficiently. This release marks a significant step forward in browser forensic analysis, with a suite of advanced tools to support the evolving landscape of browser-based evidence.

Whether you’re examining thousands of cached images, deep-diving into client-side storage, or unravelling the structure of complex URLs, NetAnalysis® v4.0 gives you the tools you need to uncover the truth with clarity and precision.

## Record View

The new Record View is a dockable panel integrated into the main form, providing a concise summary of key columns for the selected row. This feature enhances your ability to quickly assess and interpret data, streamlining your analysis process. As shown below, the panel displays critical information at a glance, allowing you to focus on the most relevant details without navigating through multiple windows.

NetAnalysis® now includes an **Image Gallery Viewer**, a new thumbnail-based image viewer that makes it easy to browse, review, and manage cached images, preview thumbnails, FavIcons and more. With support for JPEG, PNG, SVG, WebP, GIF, BMP, and ICO formats, this grid-style viewer allows you to:

* View all recovered images in one place
* Tag, bookmark, and filter relevant images
* Export selected images for further investigation

Ideal for quickly assessing visual content and identifying key artefacts.

* Search and filter JSON key-value pairs
* Decode and examine deeply nested data structures
* Export selected data to XLSX, CSV, PDF or text formats

This is a significant enhancement for anyone investigating modern web applications and single-page apps.
