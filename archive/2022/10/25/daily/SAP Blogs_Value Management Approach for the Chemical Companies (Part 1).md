Ola, boa tarde!

**Introduction**

In this blog article I would like to describe the Value Management Approach for Chemical companies.

This could be relevant and useful (at least I hope so) to those Chemical companies who think about to perform their digital transformation program based on SAP solutions and innovations and want to be sure the “promised” or “expected” value be really achieved as the actual result.

Let me introduce myself. Name´s Sergey Nozhenko. I work as the Solution Specialist in SAP Chemical Business Unit (Chemical IBU) and have several years of the practical experience in the Value Advisory practices – both working in SAP (more than 8 years) and working in the business transformation division of BearingPoint before SAP.

Of course, many of colleagues who are currently reading this article already know about the subject matter. Value management is not something new or innovative. Most of SAP (and even non-SAP) based digital transformation programs include the value subject as mandatory working stream by default. Value drivers, expected business effects, percentage of improvements, NPV & ROI calculations, KPIs, many other things …  – all this staff is well-known to most of experts working in the industry in past 10 or more years.

So, why I believe this topic is will provide to my colleagues something new and interesting about value? That’s what I want to talk about in the upcoming articles. This first article is about the common overview of the value management approach, next ones will contain more of details about the specific subjects.

**The common problem of most value advisory activities**

During last 12 years I participated into several value advisory and business transformation projects and activities. I was involved in different roles – as the business transformation consultant, project lead, industry value advisor. I also was in contact with my colleagues executed the similar projects and programs for many other customers in different industries. Based on my experience, most of value management streams have been performed with the following common way:

1. Presales and architecture team defines the transformation program scope:

   * Functional (what business domains and processes be covered),

   * Organizational (what business units be touched),

   * Architectural (what SAP and other IT solutions be used, and how to-be landscape be looks like),

   * Time (the high-level schedule for the different program phases and milestones).

2. Sales and presales team estimates future costs related to the expected program calendar:

   * Licences or cloud subscription,

   * Maintenance,

   * Data Centre and other IT hardware,

   * External services (vendor and / or partner),

   * Internal resources costs.

3. Value advisory team defines and approves with the customer the value based on 1:

   * Value drivers for functions, processes, and solution capabilities,

   * KPIs for the improvements,

   * Expected improvement values for each KPI (example: “DII” be improved on 15 days),

   * Estimated monetized effects of each improvement.

4. Value advisory team calculates theexpected return on investments based on 2 & 3:

   * Net present value (NPV),

   * Return on investments (ROI),

   * Internal Return Rate (IRR).

5. If NPV and IRR are acceptable, for example if investments be returned faster than 5 years, the company executives could make a positive decision about the investments into transformation program.

Here is the picture of common approach I described above.

Picture 1. The high-level overview of the traditional value estimation approach.

Everything looks fine on the first sight… what could be wrong?

The most common question asked by customers’ executives after the period of 6…12 month after the program go-live: “OK then, we´ve spend lots of money and resources. Now we have the new system and corrected processes. But where is our actual value? How can we be sure that we achieved business outcomes and our investments have been returned?”

I have heard the similar questions several times. Sad bad true – usually it´s quite difficult to answer on it after 3…4 years of the definition of the program scope and expected value. Why?

According to my experience there are some reasons to this after go-live:

1. Architecture team, value team and customers’ executive members might change their priorities, roles or even jobs,

2. The value documents and definition, expertise and approval story might lose,

3. It comes to understood that the value achieved is the difference (delta) between some digits “before” (before the program start) and “after” (after go-live),

4. To calculate “after” all the data for calculations should be collected again and it requires huge workloads because should be collected via lots of excel files, etc

   * If you want to re-calculate the value again – you should collect data again, and again, and again…

5. “Before” data might either be lost or be unstructured or structured in another way, without required analytics, and because of this – is impossible to compare with “to-be”,

6. After all, “after” data collections and calculations be done and aligned with “before” data structure (with lots of assumptions and approximations) suddenly it turns out that some actual KPIs are not better than before, and some are even worse.

Some of customers stop the actual value calculations when the understand the bullets 1, 2, 3 above.

Some of customers have enough a...
