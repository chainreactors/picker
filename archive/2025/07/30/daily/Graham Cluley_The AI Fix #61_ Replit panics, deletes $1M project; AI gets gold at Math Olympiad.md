In episode 61 of The AI Fix, a robot called DeREK goes bananas, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic warn we may lose the ability to see what AI is thinking, a dextrous robot changes its own batteries, the USA unveils its AI action plan, and a human beats AI to win the World Coding Championship.

Also in this week‚Äôs episode, Graham reveals why you should never ask a vibe coding app to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù your project, and Mark explains why it was handbags at dawn at the International Mathematical Olympiad.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
