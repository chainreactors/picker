> First, let’s address the question of why it is necessary to write a clear report. A clear report is essential for effective communication, ensures that the appropriate steps are taken to fix the vulnerability, and can also help a company or security professional prioritize their workload and allocate resources effectively.

I’m writing a blog after a very long time, hope you have a great read!

So, what are the advantages of having a clear report?

* A clear report allows the person reading it to quickly understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability.
* It helps the reader to understand the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability, allowing them to verify its existence and assess the impact.
* A clear report also provides detailed information on how to mitigate the vulnerability, which is crucial for addressing the issue and preventing future attacks.

Now that we have established the advantages of a clear report, let’s discuss some things to keep in mind while writing one.

1. You don’t know who the person is going to review your report is, so it is essential to keep the language professional and avoid using jargon or technical terms that may not be familiar to all readers unless it is highly required.
2. It is important to make the person reading the report understand the impact of the vulnerability.
3. Keep the report concise and to the point. Avoid including unnecessary details that may distract from the main points.

So, what are the key components of a clear vulnerability report?

1. Summary/brief description of the vulnerability: This section should provide a brief overview of the vulnerability, including the affected system and any relevant details.
2. Vulnerable endpoint and CVSS score: The vulnerable endpoint is the specific location within the system where the vulnerability exists. The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score is a standard for evaluating the severity of vulnerabilities. [You can try using CVSS calculators for calculating the severity.](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)
3. Technical details: This section should provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including any relevant technical information such as error messages, code snippets, and configuration files.
4. Steps to reproduce: This section should provide clear and concise steps that can be followed to reproduce the vulnerability.
5. Explaining impact: In this section, you should explain how the vulnerability can be exploited and the potential consequences of such exploitation.
6. Mitigation details: Finally, this section should provide detailed information on how to mitigate the vulnerability, including any relevant patches or updates.
7. Attaching the Proof of Concept (POC): There are different ways of submitting POCs. Prefer the one that shows the highest impact and is easy to verify.

By including these key components, you can write a clear and effective vulnerability report that will help ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to fix the vulnerability and protect against future attacks.
