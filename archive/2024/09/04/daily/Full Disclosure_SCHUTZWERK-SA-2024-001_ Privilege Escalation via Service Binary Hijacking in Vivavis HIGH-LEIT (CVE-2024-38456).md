Text-only version:
https://www.schutzwerk.com/advisories/SCHUTZWERK-SA-2024-001.txt

Affected products/vendor
========================
```

HIGH-LEIT by VIVAVIS AG[0]. Version 4 and 5 are different product lines,
both are affected:

```
HIGH-LEIT 4 Version 4.25.00.00 to 4.25.01.01 (patch available)
```

HIGH-LEIT 5 Version = 5.08.01.03 (no patch available, planned for
31.10.2024)

```
Summary
=======
```

HIGH-LEIT is a scalable SCADA network control system designed for
infrastructure applications in the energy, water supply, wastewater, and
environmental sectors, as well as associated utilities and industrial
applications. HIGH-LEIT is used for operational networks in critical
infrastructure.
The Windows services "HL-InstallService-hlnt" for HIGH-LEIT Version 4
and "HL-InstallService-hlxw" for Version 5 allow for an authenticated
attackers in the Active Directory group "HL-TS-Gruppe" to escalate their
privileges to local system.

```
Risk
====
```

The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code as local
system on systems where the "HL-InstallService-hlxw" or
"HL-InstallService-hlnt" Windows service is running. Authentication is
necessary for successful exploitation. The execution of the exploit is
trivial and might affect other systems if the applications folder is
shared between multiple systems in which case the vulnerability can be
used for lateral movement.

```
Description
===========
```

During a penetration test, SCHUTZWERK tested a terminal server part of
an internal OT Network. The software HIGH-LEIT 5 was found to be
installed on this terminal server.

```

```

HIGH-LEIT 5 has a windows service named "HL-InstallService-hlxw", that
runs as local system with start mode "autostart". By default, for
affected versions, the executable "D:\hlxw\update\bin\prunsrv.exe" is
modifiable by the Active Directory group "HL-TS-Gruppe". The granted
modify permission on "D:\hlxw\update\bin\prunsrv.exe" is inherited from
the modify permission on the folder "D:\hlxw". The Active Directory
group "HL-TS-Gruppe" is needed for every user interacting with the
HIGH-LEIT software. This means this exploit is available from any
HIGH-LEIT user with low privileges (e.g. auditors with read-only
permissions). The user can modify the executable "prunsrv.exe" and wait
for or force a system reboot. Afterwards the modified "prunsrv.exe" is
executed as local system on the server.

```
Solution/Mitigation
===================

For HIGH-LEIT Version 4:
- - Update to version 4.25.01.02 or newer, or
- - apply the vendors workaround via GPO to mitigate the vulnerability, or
```

- - manually remove the modify permission of the Active Directory group
"HL-TS-Gruppe" on the folder "D:\hlnt".

```
For HIGH-LEIT Version 5:
- - Update to version 5.8.01.04 (release planned for 31.10.24), or
- - apply the vendors workaround via GPO to mitigate the vulnerability, or
```

- - manually remove the modify permission of the Active Directory group
"HL-TS-Gruppe" on the folder "D:\hlxw".
