# CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, US Marshalls are latest ransomware targets

Posted: August 28, 2024

The Qilin ransomware group listed CODAC Behavioral Healthcare, a nonprofit health care treatment organization, as one of their latest victims.

Qilin seems to have a preference for healthcare and support organizations. One of their most well-known victims was the pathology lab services provider Synnovis in June 2024, causing chaos across the [NHS in London](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593892/NHS-Trusts-cancelled-over-6000-appointments-after-Qilin-cyber-attack).

CODAC Behavioral Healthcare is Rhode Island’s oldest and largest nonprofit, outpatient provider of treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and runs seven community-based locations. CODAC works with individuals, families, and communities and provides comprehensive resources to those living and struggling with the challenges of substance use disorder and behavioral healthcare issues.

Within the stolen data, Malwarebytes Labs noticed financial information, pictures of ID cards, a list of staff members—including their [Social Security Numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web) (SSNs)—and healthcare cards.

Ransomware attacks are evolving around the world, as cybercriminals have steadily advanced their tactics to not only encrypt and lock up systems once inside an organization, but to also steal sensitive data and then threaten to publish it as a way to add extra pressure to their demands. [Attacks are at an all-time high in 2024](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/global-ransomware-attacks-at-an-all-time-high-2024-state-of-ransomware-report/), and attacks specifically targeting healthcare and [support organizations](https://cybernews.com/security/al-anon-data-breach/) represent a large portion of all attacks in the US.

As ThreatDown [reported](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/ransomwares-appetite-for-us-healthcare-sees-known-attacks-double-in-a-year/) earlier in 2024, 70% of all known attacks on healthcare happen in the US. This makes healthcare the second most attacked sector in the US, where it accounts for 9% of known attacks.

[Sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) like the data kept by healthcare organizations obviously increases the amount of leverage for the ransomware group, and despite some gangs promising not to attack healthcare, most of them show no such conscience.

A separate [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) carried out by a ransomware group that Malwarebytes Labs [learned about](https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1828005309945696458) this week was on the US Marshalls Service. Hunters International ransomware group posted 386 GB of data that appears to include files on gangs, documents from the FBI, specific case information, operational data, and more.

The US Marshalls Service said the data comes from a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) they acknowledged in February of 2023, but which had never been claimed before. Maybe ...
