A cryptocurrency hack leads us down a maze of twisty little passages, Joe Biden‚Äôs commercial spyware bill, and Utah gets tough on social media sites.

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by The Register‚Äôs Iain Thomson.
