A **Foreign-trade zone (FTZ) of the United States** is a geographical area in or around a United States Port of Entry where domestic and foreign commercial merchandise receives the same customs treatment it would if it were outside the commerce of the United States.

Operating in an FTZ can provide your business with several tangible benefits:

**Customs Clearance - Simpler and Faster**

* Customs Clearance can be performed inland instead of at the gateway port (goods can move directly to FTZ).

* Consignment can stay without time limitations in the FTZ.

* Quotas can be managed through postponement.

* Consignee gets further advance notice that the shipment is ready.

**Exemptions and Deferrals of Duties and Fees**

* Duties and fees are not paid until the consignment is released and moved out of the FTZ storage.

* Duties are not paid if the merchandise is exported, re-exported or scrapped.

* Duties are deferred if goods move to another FTZ.

**Value Added Services and Tariff Inversion**

* If products are transformed in the FTZ, HS Classification may change in a favourable direction, so-called tariff inversion.

* Added value activities executed in the FTZ are not subject to customs duties.

**Improved Security**

* FTZs are areas with higher security standards, potentially leading to lower insurance premiums.
