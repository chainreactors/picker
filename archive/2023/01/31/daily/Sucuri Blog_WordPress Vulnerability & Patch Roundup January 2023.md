![December 2023 Vulnerability Patch Roundup](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23-BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_January-Vulnerability-Round-Up-820x385.jpg)

Vulnerability reports and responsible disclosures are essential for website security awareness and education. Automated attacks targeting known software vulnerabilities are one of the leading causes of website compromises.

To help educate website owners on emerging threats to their environments, we’ve compiled a list of important security updates and vulnerability patches for the WordPress ecosystem this past month.

The vulnerabilities listed below are virtually patched by the Sucuri Firewall and existing clients are protected. If you don’t have it installed yet, you can use our [web application firewall](https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/) to protect against known vulnerabilities.
