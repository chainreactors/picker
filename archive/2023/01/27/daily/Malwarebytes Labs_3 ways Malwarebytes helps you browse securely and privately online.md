## 3 ways Malwarebytes helps you browse securely and privately online

January 26, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Malicious links. Third-party ad trackers. Information-gobbling data brokers.

Let’s face it, the Internet is kind of like the Wild West when it comes to threats to our privacy and security. And unfortunately, it takes a little more than a cowboy hat and a pistol to defend yourself out there.

That’s where [Malwarebytes Premium + Privacy VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/pricing) comes in.

Whether it’s blocking unwanted trackers, securing your personal information, or booting malware off your devices, here are three ways Malwarebytes can help you become the sheriff of your own digital frontier.

## 1. Let’s you browse anonymously

It’s no secret that some companies are big fans of your personal information.

Your name, your address, location data, and more, are all being collected, packaged up, and sold to advertisers at any given moment. Even [menstrual cycle data](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2021/01/health-app-broke-its-privacy-promises-disclosing-intimate-details-about-users) is fair game.

But one of the most valuable pieces of information is your browsing history, because it says a lot about what you like and where you spend your time. When it comes to getting a good look at your browsing your ISP has a window seat, and in the USA ISPs have been allowed to sell your browsing data since 2017.

The easiest and most effective ways to put a stop to that? Using a [Virtual Private Network, or VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/01/how-a-vpn-can-protect-your-online-privacy).

VPNs create a secure, encrypted “tunnel” between your device and the VPN server, through which all of your internet traffic is routed—so if your ISP is collecting your data, it won’t be able to read it.

But not all VPNs are equal.

Some VPN providers log your data and browsing history, which means they’re just another ISP that can potentially share your data with third parties. Other VPNs can slow down your Internet to a significant degree, using older encryption methods or having fewer options for servers located nearer to you.

Needless to say, choosing the wrong VPN vendor can feel like trading one poison for another. So if you’re tired of dealing with both data-hungry companies and lackluster VPNs, then look no further than [Malwarebytes Privacy](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn).

* We don’t log anything. **Ever**.
* **Best-in-class encryption** secures your personal information.
* **Less lag**. Browse the Internet faster with VPNs powered by [WireGuard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/06/what-is-the-wireguard-vpn-protocol)®.
* Over 380 servers **in more than 30 countries**.
* [7-day free trial. All the premium features, no data limits!](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn)

## 2. Crushes ads, third-party trackers, and blocks malicious websites

We ignore the many threats to web browsers at our own peril.

Legitimate sites are following us with third-party tracking code, and criminal hackers are busy making friendly sites unfriendly by injecting [credit card skimmers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/11/how-to-defend-your-website-against-card-skimmers), and trying to steal our passwords with phishing sites. One way or another, wherever you go, your personal, sensitive data is being stolen or shared with somebody using it for financial gain.

And your browser? It lets this happen without complaint.

If you think your browser comes with native abilities to block tracking scripts and other threats like phishing websites, though, you’d be half right.

Chrome has [the infamously useles](https://allaboutdnt.com/)s ‘Do...
