In episode 62 of The AI Fix, your hosts learn how AI models smash through CAPTCHA roadblocks like they‚Äôre made of wet tissue paper ‚Äì so much for humanity‚Äôs last line of defence.

Meanwhile, we meet a bottle-flipping robot and call BS on a cartwheeling cyborg, Graham has a full-blown breakdown over traffic light puzzles, and Anthropic hires an AI psychiatry team to figure out why its bots are unhinged.

Also: Microsoft helpfully tells us which jobs are toast, Vogue replaces models with AI-generated glam-bots, and a tiny homebrew neural net humiliates the big boys at Sudoku.

Plus, Mark explores GEPA ‚Äî the AI prompt optimiser that politely mutates your questions until they‚Äôre 35 times more effective than reinforcement learning.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
