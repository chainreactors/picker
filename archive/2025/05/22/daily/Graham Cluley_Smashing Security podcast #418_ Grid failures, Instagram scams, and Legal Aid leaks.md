In this week’s episode, Graham investigates the mysterious Iberian Peninsula blackout (aliens? toaster? cyberattack?), Carole dives in the UK legal aid hack that exposed deeply personal data of society’s most vulnerable, and Dinah Davis recounts how Instagram scammers hijacked her daughter’s account – and how a parental control accidentally saved the day.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the “Smashing Security” podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by special guest Dinah Davis.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
