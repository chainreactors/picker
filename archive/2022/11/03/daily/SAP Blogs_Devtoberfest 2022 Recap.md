Well, did you blink?  Cause just like that, it's over!  **Devtoberfest 2022** is in the books.  We had so many amazing sessions, speakers and tutorials there is no way I can wrap it all up here in one blog post, but wait. I don't have to, our team has already done that.  I linked below to all 4 weeks of content recaps that they published so you can relive some of this amazing event if you missed any.

As Tom highlighted in week 1 we used the idea of **educational content that repeated weekly**.  We hope you liked this new format, but if you wanted a topic per week, or something else, please let us know.

I do want to highlight a few sessions that were really cool from each week before I show some fun metrics.

In **week 1** on Wednesday for Data and Analytics we had "Build Machine Learning Scenario for your SAP HANA Cloud application for Python.  A lot of viewers and watches on replay.

In **week 2** there was [Petoberfest](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest-discussions/petoberfest-share-your-pet-pics/td-p/10509) which is always a great event and earned a cool badge:

**Week 3** was great and we had so many attendees for all the amazing Low Code/ No Code sessions like this one on Learning to Build Processes with SAP Process Automation:

Coming out of **week 3 and into week 4** I wanted to highlight a great event to earn points in our contest, the [Scavenger Hunt](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest-blog-posts/devtoberfest-2022-contest-activities-and-points/ba-p/119178).  A collection of 20 tutorials worth 175 points each and you got a 3000 point bonus if you completed all 20.  If you need a refreshers on the contest and rules click here:  [**Devtoberfest 2022 Contest Official Rules**](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest-blog-posts/devtoberfest-2022-contest-official-rules/ba-p/9344)

More on the contest winners will be coming at **SAP TechEd** during our [Developer Advocates Download Session GS100](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/hybrid/2022/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/sapteched2022catalog/page/catalog/session/1662126221190001q2Tu) at the end of day 1 on November 15th.  If you haven't [registered](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/hybrid/2022/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/registration/page/welcome?url_id=ctabutton-sap-overview-rf), please do, it's free and will of course have lots of great sessions to watch remotely, or if you are in Las Vegas you can join us in person.
