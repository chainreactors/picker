A US federal appeals court has rejected a challenge to the law that prevents popular apps that collect data on Americans from being controlled by a foreign adversary.

The decision puts the ongoing operation of social media network TikTok, a subsidiary of China-based ByteDance, at risk.

Unless the ruling is reversed on appeal, ByteDance divests, or the White House intervenes, TikTok will be forced to stop operating in the US as soon as January 19, 2025. The President – Biden until January 20, 2025 – has the option to grant a one-time 90-day extension to this deadline.
