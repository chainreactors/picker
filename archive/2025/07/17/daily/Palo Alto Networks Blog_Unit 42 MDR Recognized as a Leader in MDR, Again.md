## **Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 MDR Recognized as a Leader Once Again in the Frost Radar™: Global Managed Detection and Response (MDR), 2025**

![Frost Radar: Managed Detection and Response growth index and innovation index by Frost & Sullivan.](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/word-image-341778-2.png)

We are excited to announce that Palo Alto Networks Unit 42® Managed Detection and Response (MDR) has been recognized again as a leading provider in the Frost Radar™: Global Managed Detection and Response (MDR), 2025, earning distinction in both the Innovation and Growth indices.

According to the Frost Radar, “Companies plotted on the Frost Radar are the leaders in the industry for growth, innovation or both. They are instrumental in advancing the industry into the future.” Highlighting Palo Alto Networks, Frost & Sullivan adds the company “has expanded its presence and coverage in recent years and carved out significant MDR mindshare, presenting many future growth opportunities.”

Vendors were evaluated across two core dimensions:

* **Innovation Index –** Measures the ability to develop globally relevant solutions aligned with disruptive megatrends and evolving customer needs.
* **Growth Index –** Assesses market performance, strategic vision and execution across sales, marketing and market expansion efforts.

## **Why Unit 42 MDR Stands Out**

Palo Alto Networks was recognized in the report for its advanced AI capabilities, global security coverage and rapidly expanding MDR footprint, enabling it to serve customers across all industries and geographies.

According to the Frost and Sullivan Radar report:

> Palo Alto Networks continues to help shape the MDR industry, evolving the Unit 42 MDR service inline with the most important mega trends.

The report highlights key strengths that contributed to Unit 42 MDR’s ranking:

**Deep Expertise and Broad Visibility –** We provide comprehensive visibility across complex ecosystems, coupled with the expert human insight of our threat hunters and analysts, enabling organizations to see and act on what matters.

**AI-Powered and Seamlessly Integrated –** Powered by Cortex XDR and XSIAM, Unit 42 delivers AI-driven threat defense enriched with proprietary Unit 42 Threat Intelligence, integrating with over 1,000 third-party tools to enhance detection and response.

**Proactive and Actionable Security –** Beyond detection, we deliver proactive security measures and executive-level reporting that empower your team with actionable insights to stay ahead of adversaries.

## **Advancing MDR with AI, Automation and Expert-Led Defense**

The Frost and Sullivan Radar report further noted that Unit 42 MDR augments SOC teams with 24/7 AI-driven defense across endpoints, cloud, network, identity, IoT, OT and third-party data. The service combines advanced AI with human expertise (including proactive threat hunters, analysts, responders) to accelerate detection, investigation and response.

A key innovation is the launch of [Unit 42 Managed XSIAM](/cortex/managed-xsiam), which brings advanced SOC engineering expertise – supporting data mapping, correlation rule creation, custom playbook development, and the creation of high-fidelity detectors tailored to the organization’s unique data sources.

## **Real-World Results with Faster Detection and Faster Response**

Unit 42 MDR is helping organizations around the world significantly improve their security operations. Customers of Palo Alto Networks have reported up to [90%](/customers/mercan-properties-tackles-cyberthreats-faster-using-unit42-mdr) reduction in Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR). Tom Osteen, Chief Information Officer at [Enloe Medical Center](https://stage.paloaltonetworks.com/customers/enloe-medical-center-strengthens-its-security-posture-and-improves-efficiency-with-unit-42-mdr), shared:

> Our experience with Unit 42 has been absolutely phenomenal. One of the things that surprised us about it was the Unit 42 Managed Threat Hunting that is part of the MDR service. Not only did we get detection and response services, which are reactive, we got Managed Threat Hunting, which is proactive.

## **Driving the Future of MDR**

We’re proud to be recognized once again as an industry leader. As we continue to evolve Unit 42 MDR, our mission remains the same: deliver 24/7 world-class protection, powered by AI and human expertise, empowering security teams with faster, more accurate defense and complete visibility across the attack surface.
