# Proton launches Lumo, a privacy-focused AI chatbot

Posted: July 23, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Proton, known for its privacy focused set of services, [announced](https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai) the introduction of Lumo, a privacy-first [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) chatbot.

It is good to know before you dive in that Proton’s chatbot has two user options that offer a very different experience. If you want Lumo to access the internet you will have to use the “Web search” button before you submit your prompt. If you don’t, it will tell you it doesn’t have the capability to browse the web or access real-time information.

While this somewhat limits the usefulness of Lumo when you’re looking at recent developments, it is reassuring that the model was trained on selected sources. This also reduces the risk of hallucinating. Lumo is set up to recognize when it doesn’t know the answer and in such cases, it will make you aware of that and suggest alternative sources of information, or other ways to find the answer you’re looking for.

Private, Safeguarded, and Treated with respect

Proton believes that a privacy-first AI is essential because hundreds of millions of ordinary people currently interact with AI tools, unknowingly sharing [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii). This information is far more sensitive than what they would reveal in a typical Google search query.

Not only does this constant interaction with AI tools put personal information at risk, but we also witnessed several instances where [company secrets](http://Proton believes that a privacy-first AI is essential because hundreds of millions of ordinary people currently interact with AI tools, unknowingly sharing sensitive information.

Similarly, we recently reported on how [Meta AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/your-meta-ai-chats-might-be-public-and-its-not-a-bug) chats might be public without the user’s awareness, and many AI bots have spilled sensitive information for separate reasons, like someone [guessing a default password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/mcdonalds-ai-bot-spills-data-on-job-applicants).

Lumo offers a different approach to AI chatbots. Other AI companies keep a record of all the conversations on their servers, leaving this information vulnerable to [data leaks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) or exploitation for profit. Lumo does not store any logs of your conversations on its server, and only your device can decrypt any chats you choose to save.

Most people recognize a significant privacy risk here: the possibility that their conversations could help train t...
