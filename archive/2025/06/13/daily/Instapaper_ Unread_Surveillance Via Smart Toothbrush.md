## Surveillance Via Smart Toothbrush

The only links are from [*The Daily Mail*](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14742573/Private-investigator-reveals-TOOTHBRUSH-prove-partner-cheating.html) and [*The Mirror*](https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/sex-relationships/relationships/im-private-investigator-unlikely-household-35256619), but a marital affair was discovered because the cheater was recorded using his smart toothbrush at home when he was supposed to be at work.

@ Bruce, ALL,

This time it’s a “Smart Device”, or as previously mentioned on this blog an internet connected “adult only toy”.

But also it could just as easily have been via the house “Smart Meter”…

Any electrical device usage in your home gets reported via the “smart grid”. And can be in sufficiently near “real time” detail that anyone monitoring the communications –even if they are encrypted– can see devices are being used and how.

Think of it as “Traffic analysis” on steroids.

But… further all usage of grid power has “a signature” that can identify the device type/model and quite often environmental factors like the temperature in the room. Think how your fridge compressor comes on and goes off likewise air con. So a change in “Delta” for the fridge but not in the aircon is indicative of someone using the contents of the fridge, and potentially the mass of what was taken out or put in.

This is because energy “Star Ratings” became a selling point, thus the “drive for efficiency” brings out those signatures significantly. So much so it’s possible to work out what you are watching on TV not just the channel but actual movie or stream.

The UK has “TV Licencing” which basically means you have to pay a lot of money each year to watch Broadcast Television from anywhere (not just broadcast from the UK). It’s known that people have been investigating using the power signatures that smart meters broadcast “back to base” to see if this can be used as a method of catching the increasing numbers who now “don’t pay” but still sometimes watch “broadcasts” on a TV or Computer.

So unless you take precautions having anything “smart” that communicates will “tell on you” for all the world to hear if they want to…

And if people think that’s not legal, info from a “fitness band” has been used in successful prosecutions of murder…

A story from years ago: A married couple shared access to their Fitbit accounts. A marital affair was discovered when the husband’s heart rate spiked at 2am while away on a business trip.

@ Bruce, ALL,

There are rather more than two copies of the story as a duckduck on “ARF Investigators toothbrush” now shows,

This one is interesting,

<https://usmail24.com/private-researcher-reveals-how-a-toothbrush-can-prove-whether-your-partner-cheats/>

For a couple of reasons,

1, It sort of credits the Mirror

Other links also kind of credit the Mirror by a “told the Mirror” or similar, which suggests the Mirror was probably the source for this blatant “service advertising” for ARF.

But they use the same image as the Mail which is a stock from Getty. Which is odd because Getty have thousands of similar “two in a bed cheating” images that could have been used (duckduck the phrase and hit the image tab to see that).

So the question of,

“Cut-n-Paste Writing?”

Does spring to mind with a minor effort to hide the plagiarism that is now the staple of “MSM News” (especially in the Rupert “the bear faced liar” Murdoch stable of overly paywalled nonsense.)

I am of the generation who got to read George Orwell’s *1984* in 1984. So it was 41 years ago that my 8th grade English teacher pointed out that supermarket scanners and credit cards would someday make it impossible to, say, hide members of a persecuted minority group in your attic because the authorities could easily detect that your grocery consumption had risen (we also read *The Diary of Anne Frank* that year).

I still maintain the Huxley’s *Brave New World* is the dystopia we’re slouching toward because no one is forcing us to buy Internet connected toothbrushes and the benefit we get from such gizmos seems to go almost entirely to their vendors. As one of the epitaphs on my daylight-readable, LCD, “Smart” headstone may one day cycle through, “Just Because You *Can* Connect Something to the Internet Doesn’t mean You  *Should*.

Clive, a couple of questions. Are water meters currently a similar threat? Can you use UPS’s as a buffer to hide electrity use well enough to prevent detailed descriptions of what you are doing from being emitted?

Water meters aren’t read all that often–IIRC most are still read by radio from a van driving down the street. So they’re probably not a threat yet, but expect water companies to make their metering infrastructure smarter in the next decade or three.

A UPS probably won’t make any difference for occupancy detection. They only come on when upstream power is lost, and only last a few minutes, not long enough to realistically shift load substantially in time. If you have an appliance that has a very distinctive usage pattern, and deliberately unplug the UPS while using it, it could help a little to hide the fact that you used that device, but the meter will see increased usage a few minutes later.

Devices like Tesla PowerWalls might make a bigger difference, esp if they’re programmed to charge at night and discharge during the day, but I don’t think they respond directly to demand, so your fluctuations could still be visible to the meter.

For water meters, part of the concern ...
