Budget season is upon us, and everyone in your organization is vying for their slice of the pie. Every year, every department has a pet project that they present as absolutely essential to profitability, business continuity, and quite possibly the future of humanity itself. And no doubt that some of these actually *may be* mission critical. But as cybersecurity professionals, we understand that the rollout of a viable CTEM ([Continuous Threat Exposure Management](https://xmcyber.com/ctem/?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=hackernews_article&utm_content=glossary-ctem)) program actually *is*.

In any year, cybersecurity investments are tough budgetary sells – they're hard to quantify and don't always clearly drive revenues or cut costs. In today's belt-tightening climate, all the more so. Even though cybersecurity budgets [will likely grow this year](https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Forrester-Budget-Planning-Guide-2025-Security-And-Risk.pdf) according to Forrester, it's still important to make sure *today* that CTEM doesn't slip down the budget priority list.

In this article, we'll discuss how to keep CTEM on the budgetary radar.

## **But First – Here are Some Reasons Why CTEM is Objectively Crucial**

The CTEM approach [marks a major shift in cybersecurity](https://info.xmcyber.com/operationalizing-ctem-with-xm-cyber?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=hackernews_article&utm_content=operationalizing-ctem) because it helps organizations go from simply reacting to threats to actively staying ahead of them. Instead of just responding after an attack hits, CTEM emphasizes constant monitoring. This empowers cyber teams to spot and resolve potential weaknesses before they're exploited.

As we know, cyberattacks are not only getting smarter and more frequent - they're also happening faster than ever. The time between discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities is almost nonexistent. CTEM equips organizations to keep up with this fast-paced cycle. It basically pressure-tests security defenses in real-time and helps them adapt as new threats emerge.

What makes CTEM especially effective is its baked-in understanding that every organization has a unique risk profile. CTEM helps security teams customize their approach to target the specific threats that matter most to their organization. This is why CTEM isn't just a helpful addition to cybersecurity - it's essential. Organizations that leverage CTEM are better positioned to stay ahead of risks, proactively guard against cyber threats, and avoid costly breaches.

Moreover, it provides continuous visibility into an organization's attack surface, allowing for real-time identification of new vulnerabilities and exposures. This proactive approach enables organizations to address threats before they can be exploited. You get the opposition's playbook, which allows for more effective risk prioritization and mitigation. It goes beyond simple vulnerability scores to provide context-aware prioritization, considering factors such as asset criticality, threat intelligence, and exploitability. This ensures that resources are focused on the most critical risks. It also enables organizations to proactively approach risk mitigation, addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This reduces the likelihood of successful attacks and minimizes their impact.

CTEM also helps security and IT teams collaborate and communicate more effectively, to break down silos and take a more unified approach to risk management. And it taps into current threat data to understand the latest attack trends and tactics and adapts its testing process. This leads to more effective risk mitigation and helps you anticipate where threat actors are likely to attack next.

And finally, and very important in the context of this argument, CTEM drives down costs associated with security breaches by proactively identifying and remediating them. This means you get the most value from your limited security budgets.

## **The CTEM Elevator Pitch**

Okay, great. Now you know why CTEM is so crucial – but how would you explain CTEM if you found yourself in an elevator (preferably a pretty long ride, from say, the ground floor to the 100th floor) with your CFO? Here's how the argument could go:

*We all agree that simply reacting to cyber threats or ongoing cyberattacks is not an option. This is why CTEM fundamentally changes the cybersecurity game. It helps us preemptively identify and fix vulnerabilities before they turn into costly disasters. And this proactive approach doesn't just strengthen our defenses - it saves serious money over time.*

*Consider this: with CTEM, we're slashing the financial risks tied to data breaches, regulatory fines, and potential lawsuits. Plus, we're eliminating the staggering costs of post-attack recovery - like forensic investigations, public crisis management, and system restoration. Each of these items alone can easily cost more than implementing CTEM in the first place.*

*But CTEM doesn't stop there. With a more resilient cybersecurity posture, we keep essential sys...
