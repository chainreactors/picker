## AI and the 2024 Elections

It’s been the [biggest year](https://www.undp.org/super-year-elections) for elections in human history: 2024 is a “[super-cycle](https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/global-state-democracy-2024-strengthening-legitimacy-elections)” year in which 3.7 billion eligible voters in 72 countries had the chance to go the polls. These are also the [first AI elections](https://www.aspenideas.org/sessions/the-first-ai-elections), where many feared that deepfakes and artificial intelligence-generated misinformation would overwhelm the democratic processes. As 2024 draws to a close, it’s instructive to take stock of how democracy did.

In a Pew survey of Americans from earlier this fall, nearly eight times as many respondents [expected AI to be used for mostly bad purposes](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/19/concern-over-the-impact-of-ai-on-2024-presidential-campaign/) in the 2024 election as those who thought it would be used mostly for good. There are real concerns and risks in using AI in electoral politics, but it definitely has not been all bad.

The dreaded “[death of truth](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/623364/the-death-of-truth-by-steven-brill/)” has not materialized—at least, not due to AI. And candidates are eagerly adopting AI in many places where it can be constructive, if used responsibly. But because this all happens inside a campaign, and largely in secret, the public often doesn’t see all the details.

### Connecting with voters

One of the most impressive and beneficial uses of AI is language translation, and campaigns have started [using it widely](https://restofworld.org/2024/aapi-victory-alliance-ai-voter-outreach/). Local governments in [Japan](https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japanese-mayor-suddenly-speaks-fluent-english-with-ai-video-that-surprises-even-him) and [California](https://www.sfpublicpress.org/as-bay-area-cities-adopt-real-time-ai-translation-for-public-meetings-sf-abstains/) and prominent politicians, including India Prime Minister [Narenda Modi](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bjp-to-use-ai-to-translate-pms-speeches/articleshow/108318912.cms) and New York City Mayor [Eric Adams](https://fortune.com/2023/10/17/new-york-city-mnayor-eric-adams-uses-ai-to-speak-mandarin/), used AI to translate meetings and speeches to their diverse constituents.

Even when politicians themselves aren’t speaking through AI, their constituents might be using it to listen to them. Google rolled out free translation services for an additional [110 languages](https://blog.google/products/translate/google-translate-new-languages-2024/) this summer, available to billions of people in real time through their smartphones.

Other candidates used AI’s conversational capabilities to connect with voters. U.S. politicians [Asa Hutchinson](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/366560453/Presidential-candidates-AI-chatbot-fields-policy-questions), [Dean Phillips](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/20/openai-dean-phillips-ban-chatgpt/) and [Francis Suarez](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/mayor-suarez-launches-an-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-for-his-presidential-campaign-3/) deployed chatbots of themselves in their presidential primary campaigns. The fringe candidate [Jason Palmer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/underdog-who-beat-biden-in-american-samoa-used-ai-in-election-campaign-b0ce62d6) beat Joe Biden in the American Samoan primary, at least partly thanks to using AI-generated emails, texts, audio and video. Pakistan’s former prime minister, [Imran Khan](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/world/asia/imran-khan-artificial-intelligence-pakistan.html), used an AI clone of his voice to deliver speeches from prison.

Perhaps the most effective use of this technology was in Japan, where an obscure and independent Tokyo gubernatorial candidate, [Takahiro Anno](https://note.com/nishiohirokazu/n/n0c7805faabca), used an AI avatar to [respond to 8,600 questions](https://futurepolis.substack.com/p/meet-your-ai-politician-of-the-future) from voters and managed to come in fifth among a highly competitive field of 56 candidates.

### Nuts and bolts

AIs have been used in political fundraising as well. Companies like [Quiller](https://quiller.ai) and [Tech for Campaigns](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/30/ai-campaign-fundraising-democrats-chatgpt) market AIs to help draft fundraising emails. Other AI systems help candidates [target particular donors](https://www.donoratlas.com) with [personalized messages](https://www.newpaltz.edu/schoolofbusiness/hvventurehub/newsletter/article/august-2024/daisychains-innovation-in-campaign-organizing/). It’s notoriously difficult to measure the impact of these kinds of tools, and political consultants are cagey about what really works, but there’s clearly interest in continuing to use these technologies in campaign fundraising.

Polling has been highly mathematical for decades, and pollsters are constantly incorporating new technologies into their processes. Techniques range from using AI to distill voter sentiment from social networking platforms—something known as “[social listening](https://doi.org/10.1080/10904018.2017.1330656)“—to creating [synthetic voters](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.1d3cf75d) that can answer tens of thousands of questions. Whether these AI applications will result in more accurate polls and strategic insights for campaigns remains to be seen, but [there is](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.1d3cf75d) [promising](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.10109) [research](https://hal.science/hal-04688498/document) motivated by the ever-increasing challenge of reaching real humans with surveys.

On the political organizing side, AI assistants are being used for such diverse purposes as [helping craft political messages and strategy](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/how-ai-is-transforming-the-way-political-campaigns-work/), [generating ads](https://www.wired.com/story/battelgroundai-ai-progressive-political-ads/), [drafting speeches](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/06/14/trump-says-he-had-a-speech-rewritten-by-ai-and-decided-im-going-to-use-this/) and helping [coordinate canvassing](https://www.robeisenbach.com/cases/comm-voice) and get-out-the-vote efforts. In Argentina in 2023, both major presidential candidates [used AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/world/americas/argentina-election-ai-milei-massa.html) to develop campaign posters, videos and other materials.

In 2024, similar capabilities were almost certainly used in a variety of elections around the world. In the U.S., for example, a Georgia politician [used AI](https://www.gpb.org/news/2024/04/25/georgia-political-campaigns-start-deploy-ai-humans-still-needed-press-the-flesh) to produce blog posts, campaign images and podcasts. Even standard productivity software sui...
