Dear SAP Community,

during the last years, me and my colleagues at Technical University of Munich extensively studied how large software companies such as SAP can generate information benefits from their online communities.

Relying on data from the SAP Community, we recently published a paper, in which we show how machine learning models can be used to automatically detect feature requests of third-party developers. Based on manually labeled data set of 1,500 questions, our classifier reached a high  accuracy of 82%. This means that our classifier was able to predict 82% of all feature requests correctly. To us, this is big steps towards data-driven requirements engineering.

With this post, I would like to thank all contributors of the SAP Community. Without you, this piece of research would not exist.

The full article is available for free at ResearchGate: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364165571\_Detecting\_Feature\_Requests\_of\_Third-Party\_Develop...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/364165571_Detecting_Feature_Requests_of_Third-Party_Developers_through_Machine_Learning_A_Case_Study_of_the_SAP_Community)

If you have any questions about our study, feel free to reach out to me. I am happy to discuss.

Best regards

Martin
