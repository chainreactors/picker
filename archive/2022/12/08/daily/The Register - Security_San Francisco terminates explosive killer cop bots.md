San Francisco legislators this week changed course on their killer robot policy, banning the police from using remote-control bots fitted with explosives. For now.

On Tuesday, the city's Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to explicitly prohibit lethal force by police robots following a public backlash and worldwide media attention. Under a previously approved policy, SF police robots under human control could have used explosives to kill suspects. The droids were not allowed to use guns.

The board [approved](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/30/san_francisco_killer_robots_ordinance/) this approach in an 8-3 vote on November 29. It would have allowed the cops to use detonating robots "as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD."
