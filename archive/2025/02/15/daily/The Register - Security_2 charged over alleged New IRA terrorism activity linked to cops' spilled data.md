Two suspected New IRA members were arrested on Tuesday and charged under the Terrorism Act 2000 after they were found in possession of spreadsheets containing details of staff that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) mistakenly published online.

Brian Francis Cavlan, 49, and Rory Martin Logan, 43, appeared in Strabane Magistrates' Court on February 13, where the court heard that Cavlan had two spreadsheets containing the particulars of police officers and civilian staff.

The spreadsheet data would have orginally come from the August 2023 [FoI own goal](https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/12/psni_data_breach_forces_officers/) when personal information – including real names and ranks – of nearly 10,000 PSNI staff members were published in a document that was publically accessible online for several hours.
