For many years, [data brokers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/why-are-hundreds-data-brokers-not-registering-states) have existed in the shadows, exploiting gaps in privacy laws to harvest our information—all for their own profit. They sell our [precise movements](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/what-fog-data-science-why-surveillance-company-so-dangerous) without our knowledge or meaningful consent to a variety of private and state actors, including law enforcement agencies. And they show no sign of stopping.

This incentivizes other bad actors. If companies collect any kind of personal data and want to make a quick buck, there’s a data broker willing to buy it and sell it to the highest bidder–often law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

One [recent investigation by 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/airlines-dont-want-you-to-know-they-sold-your-flight-data-to-dhs/) revealed that the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), a data broker [owned and operated](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25964404-ice-documents-on-arc/) by at least eight major U.S. airlines, including United Airlines and American Airlines, collected travelers’ domestic flight records and [secretly sold access](https://www.wired.com/story/airlines-dont-want-you-to-know...
