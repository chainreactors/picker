In episode 15 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, Graham learns there‚Äôs one W in Mississippi, ChatGPT finds Mark‚Äôs G-spot, nobody watches Megalopolis, Alexa is unmasked as a ‚Äúcommie operative‚Äù, and our hosts learn that AI will soon need dedicated nuclear reactors.

Graham introduces Mark to a forlorn robot butler folding a shirt, and Mark explains why AI is like a highway of exploding bananas.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
