Today, Microsoft released its expected update for the May patch on Tuesday. This update fixes 78Â vulnerabilities. 11 are rated as critical, and 66 as important. Five of the vulnerabilities have already been exploited and two were publicly known but not yet exploited. 70 of the vulnerabilities were patched today, 8 had patches delivered earlier this month.

### Notable Vulnerabilities:

[CVE-2025-30397](/vuln.html?cve=2025-30397): This vulnerability is already exploited. It could lead to remote code execution if a user visits a malicious web page, but only if Edge is running in Internet Explorer mode.

The other four already exploited vulnerabilities are all privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The two already known vulnerabilities include a remote code execution vulnerability in Visual Studio and a spoofing vulnerability in Microsoft Defender.

Most of the critical vulnerabilities affect Microsoft Office and the Remote Desktop Client.

[CVE-2025-29831](/vuln.html?cve=2025-29831) could be interesting: It is only rated "important", but it is described as a remote code execution issue in Windows Remote Desktop. No authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability. Exploitation relies on a race collation which is often not reliably exploitable (but exploitable). The attack has to be triggered while the server is being restarted. This may be exploitable if a denial of service vulnerability can be used to restart the system.
