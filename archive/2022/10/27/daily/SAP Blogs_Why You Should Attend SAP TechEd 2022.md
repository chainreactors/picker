Taking stage November 15-16, SAP TechEd is back with its first in-person event in years!

Now is a pivotal time in the SAP partner ecosystem. Our joint customers are looking to leverage their technology to enable sustainable operations, drive resiliency, and enable business transformation. Our customers not only need SAP software, but a new approach to put their systems in place. To achieve the outcomes these customers are looking for, SAP and its partners need the knowledge to drive successful, clean core implementations. This includes understanding the latest innovations in platform, the right approaches to architectural design, and how our line of business applications reinforce our core.

**SAP TechEd Hands-On Lab** will help you, our valued partners, stay ahead of the curve and your competition with the skills that are most needed to deliver customer success with new critical technologies. Get the latest updates on our platform capabilities and applications with 120 sessions by over 200 SAP experts, customers, and partners. We encourage every partner to send representatives (developers, IT managers, innovators, and tech leaders) to participate in the hands-on workshops in Vegas this November. We also encourage everyone to tune in digitally and understand just how SAP is innovating to further simplify and speed delivery atop SAP Business Technology Platform.

We’re looking forward to an amazing experience at The Mirage, with immersive hands-on workshops and the live engagement and networking we’ve all been missing.
