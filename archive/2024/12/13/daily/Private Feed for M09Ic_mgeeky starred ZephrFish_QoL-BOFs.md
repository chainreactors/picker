# QoL-BOFs: Quality of Life Beacon Object Files

Welcome to **QoL-BOFs**, a collection of **Beacon Object Files (BOFs)** designed to improve productivity and enhance operational efficiency during red team engagements. This repository aggregates BOFs from various sources into a single, easy-to-navigate repository.

I took the contents [curated here](https://github.com/wsummerhill) and added a few extras in that I find useful and have added them all in as submodules to this repo to build a public repo with easy-to-use/clone sources.
