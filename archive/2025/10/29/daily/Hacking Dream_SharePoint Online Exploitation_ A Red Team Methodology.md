As a senior penetration tester specializing in purple team operations and AI-enhanced security assessments, I've spent considerable time analyzing how SharePoint Online has transformed from a simple collaboration platform into one of the most exploitable attack surfaces in modern enterprises.

What makes SharePoint particularly valuable from a red team perspective isn't a single vulnerability. Instead, it's the combination of deep Graph API integration, automated workflows, and the implicit trust organizations place in Microsoft's ecosystem.

This guide provides a complete methodology for **SharePoint Online exploitation**. It documents my approach to identifying, exploiting, and maintaining persistence in SharePoint Online environments during red team engagements. Unlike traditional vulnerability assessments that focus on individual CVEs, my approach treats SharePoint as an interconnected platform where legitimate features become attack vectors when properly weaponized.

## Phase 1: External Reconnaissance — Mapping the Attack Surface

Before attempting any direct exploitation, I invest significant effort in passive and semi-passive reconnaissance to understand the target's SharePoint footprint without triggering defensive sensors. Modern enterprises leave substantial metadata trails that informed attackers can leverage.

### Subdomain Enumeration and URL Discovery

My initial reconnaissance begins with discovering SharePoint Online instances through systematic enumeration. I use wordlists containing common organizational patterns (`/sites/hr`, `/sites/finance`, `/teams/devops`, `/sites/legal`) combined with brute-force techniques against the tenant's `sharepoint.com` namespace. This approach consistently reveals internal naming conventions that organizations assume are protected by obscurity.

```
# Pseudocode for SharePoint site enumeration
tenant_name = "targetcorp"
common_sites = ["hr", "finance", "legal", "devops", "admin", "executive"]

for site in common_sites:
    url = f"https://{tenant_name}.sharepoint.com/sites/{site}"
    response = verify_site_exists(url)
    if response.accessible:
        log_discovered_site(url, response.metadata)
```

### OSINT and Google Dorking

Public-facing SharePoint documents indexed by search engines represent low-hanging fruit. I leverage Google Dorks specifically crafted for SharePoint environments:

```
site:sharepoint.com filetype:xlsx "confidential"
site:sharepoint.com filetype:docx inurl:/sites/ "password"
site:*.sharepoint.com "Anyone with the link"
```

These queries frequently expose sensitive documents that were shared with "Anyone with the link" permissions but never properly secured. During a recent engagement, I discovered an HR department's salary spreadsheet indexed by Google simply because an employee shared it externally without understanding the visibility implications.

### Anonymous Sharing Link Discovery

One of my most effective reconnaissance techniques involves searching for anonymous sharing links using the Graph API's search capabilities. Even with limited delegated permissions, an attacker can query `/search/query?querytext='*'` to enumerate site collections and documents they shouldn't know exist. Learn more about [securing Graph API permissions](INSERT\_INTERNAL\_URL) in our full guide.

### Metadata Analysis and Internal Naming Patterns

SharePoint's metadata leaks valuable intelligence. By analyzing `SPWeb.Title`, URL fragments, and document properties from publicly accessible resources, I map internal organizational structures. This information proves invaluable during later exploitation phases when selecting high-value targets.

```
# Using GraphRunner to enumerate sites post-authentication
Invoke-GraphRunner -Tokens $tokens -DisableRecon -DisableUsers -DisableGroups
Get-SharePointSites -SearchQuery "*"
```

### Custom Reconnaissance Script

For systematic external reconnaissance, I maintain a PowerShell script that automates SharePoint exposure discovery:

```
# External SharePoint reconnaissance
$tenant = "targetcorp"
$commonPaths = @("/sites/hr", "/sites/finance", "/teams/executive")

foreach ($path in $commonPaths) {
    $url = "https://$tenant.sharepoint.com$path"
    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method Head -UseBasicParsing
        if ($response.StatusCode -eq 200) {
            Write-Output "[+] Discovered: $url"
            # Enumerate further
        }
    } catch {
        # Site not accessible or doesn't exi...
