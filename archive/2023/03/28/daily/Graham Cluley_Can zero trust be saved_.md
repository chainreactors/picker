*Graham Cluley Security News is sponsored this week by the folks at **Kolide**. Thanks to the great team there for their support!*

Right now, ‚ÄúZero Trust‚Äù is in serious danger of becoming an empty buzzword. The problem isn‚Äôt just that marketers have slapped the Zero Trust label on everything short of breakfast cereal‚Äìit‚Äôs that for all the hype, [we don‚Äôt seem to be getting any safer](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/articles/the-biggest-data-breaches-and-leaks-of-2022 "Link to CS Hub article").

At the heart of Zero Trust is a good idea, but the way most companies execute that idea is incomplete. Specifically, most security practitioners forget that device compliance is a crucial element of Zero Trust.

Think about it: your identity provider can ensure that only known devices access your company‚Äôs apps, but just because you recognize a device, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs in a secure state. A malware-infected laptop running an outdated OS can‚Äôt exactly be ‚Äútrusted.‚Äù And you can‚Äôt count on MDMs to achieve total compliance. Things like [unencrypted access credentials](https://l.kolide.co/3RGphyR) are out of their reach, not to mention [Linux devices writ large](https://l.kolide.co/3DNvXFB).

Kolide solves the device compliance element of Zero Trust for companies that use Okta.

**Our premise is simple: if an employee‚Äôs device is out of compliance, it can‚Äôt access your apps.**

Kolide‚Äôs unique approach works with Okta to make device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn‚Äôt compliant, users can‚Äôt log in to their cloud apps until they‚Äôve fixed the problem. And instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.

Kolide works across your Mac, Windows, and even Linux devices, with mobile support coming soon. Our lightweight agent complements your existing tools, brings a lot of compliance issues into scope and under control, and can complete your Zero Trust picture.
