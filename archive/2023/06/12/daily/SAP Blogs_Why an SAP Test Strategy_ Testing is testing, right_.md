This is the second blog in a series of blogs about **Quality Engineering for SAP.** The first blog was about [the importance of key and business user involvement in SAP Quality Engineering](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/14/why-are-key-users-essential-in-sap-testing/). This second blog triggers the question if a SAP Test Strategy is needed when implementing/ upgrading SAP.

To bring all the different elements of SAP testing together, an *SAP test strategy* is a valuable document. The SAP test strategy is a structured approach used to proof to the organization how to test, what to test, when to test and, importantly, *who will test*. The SAP test strategy is crucial for any SAP implementation or business transformation as it helps to ensure the success and reliability of the system and testing process. As many stakeholders are involved in an SAP project, it is important to communicate and be transparent of the quality levels to be achieved. The SAP test strategy is a crucial deliverable to achieve this. Key benefits of an SAP test strategy are:

* **Reduce risks**: *Know-how about the desired functionality makes it possible to foresee what might go wrong.*

A comprehensive SAP test strategy can help to reduce the risks associated with an SAP implementation or business transformation. It ensures that potential business risks are identified and addressed early in the process, minimizing the chances of failures or delays. To identify risks, it is recommended to conduct an *SAP Quality Risks Analysis*. Identified risks can be mitigated and validated with test cases to pursue business value.

* **Ensure compliance**: *Users know which rules already need to be followed and to which the new solution also need to adhere.*

The SAP test strategy ensures that the system meets all necessary regulatory and compliance requirements which are part of the scope. It is important to test every aspect of the system scope, including the functionalities, data, integrations and authorizations.

* **Improve quality**: *Involve users before GO-live to not let faulty software slip to production (and cause negative impact there).*

A comprehensive SAP test strategy can help to improve the overall quality of the SAP system. Testing helps to identify any anomalies in the system and processes, enabling them to be fixed before the system goes live. This, in turn, leads to a more reliable and efficient system. Furthermore, alignments are made regarding quality gates, test governance, follow ups, naming conventions, *indicators* and report deliverables. These elements support a more effective and fluent software development process.

* **Reduce costs**: *Early involvement improves sight on what needs to be build (build the right thing) and avoids rework afterwards.*

An SAP test strategy helps to reduce the costs associated with SAP implementation or business transformation. Reason for this is that testing helps to identify and fix anomalies before they become bigger problems, saving time and resources in the long run. Without having insight in quality, it is hard to determine if the implemented SAP solution is meeting the business needs and requirements and when the solution is acceptable for usage.

* **Alignment for all** **sta****k****eholders**: *In an average SAP project and environment, many stakeholders are involved, it is important they all understand the level of quality and what is expected from them from the early start (Built-in quality).*

An SAP test strategy gives a transparent insight in the quality level needed to have confidence in the SAP solution, during all phases of a project and for all stakeholders involved, to accept it for Go-live. And in an SAP environment, many stakeholders need to be aligned for the proper quality. The SAP test strategy is risk based and for all risks, quality

An SAP test strategy is essential for any SAP implementation project or business transformation.
