With more businesses relying on [cloud computing](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-computing-is-not-new-why-secure-it-now/) to streamline operations and improve scalability, enterprise leaders are adopting a [cloud-first approach](https://www.cio.com/article/307489/the-many-advantages-of-a-cloud-first-approach.html), combining network, performance, security, endpoint management, and support all through cloud operations, or CloudOps. CloudOps combines both IT processes and [DevOps](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-devops-a-comprehensive-guide-for-the-modern-enterprise/) principles to ensure the smooth operation, maintenance, and optimization of a cloud-based infrastructure and its applications.

As news headlines are increasingly occupied by [data breaches](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/7-practical-solutions-for-modern-businesses-combating-cloud-based-attacks/) and new security [vulnerabilities](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/surviving-the-storm-defending-against-cloud-misconfigurations-vulnerabilities-and-insider-threats/) pose significant risks to businesses, CloudOps has emerged as a crucial component for ensuring the safety and integrity of cloud-based systems. In this post, learn to build and automate a strong [cloud-first](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/securing-cloud-in-modern-times-how-businesses-can-build-cohesive-cloud-native-security-strategies/) strategy that can help keep organizations of all sizes safe from potential cloud security risks.

## Emerging CloudOps | The Next Phase of Digital Business

According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023), global end user spending on public cloud services is being forecasted to grow nearly 22% totalling $597.3 billion this year. Given its prevalence, security experts are viewing cloud as the driving force behind the next phase of digital business as its role as a highly strategic platform for digital transformation and services.

While cloud usage is near universal in the modern business landscape, many deployments remain poorly architected or are assembled ad hoc. Digital trends for 2023 [indicate](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-05-16-gartner-says-4-trends-are-shaping-the-future-of-cloud-data-center-and-edge-infrastructure) that cloud infrastructure optimization is one of the top priorities to pay attention to. The rise of cloud is clear and enterprise leaders are working to evolve their IT, engineering and development teams to build the right [cloud security](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/evolution-of-cloud-security/) management and operating strategies for their business. This is where CloudOps comes into play.

CloudOps focuses on managing and optimizing cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and services. It takes into account the unique characteristics and capabilities of cloud computing, such as elasticity, scalability, and resource virtualization.

Many businesses have relied on traditional IT operations (ITOps) practices to manage their cloud deployments. However, as the complexity of cloud infrastructure has grown, forward-thinking enterprises have moved towards specialized expertise and dedicated processes to better handle their cloud-first systems.

CloudOps combines principles from other operational models such as ITOps and DevOps and makes them applicable to a cloud-based architecture. These principles, processes, and best practices help security teams across cloud architecture, security, compliance, and IT operations to manage the overarching infrastructure. Below are some key differences that make CloudOps unique.

* Managing & Optimizing Cloud – CloudOps focuses specifically on managing and optimizing cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and services. It takes into account the unique characteristics and capabilities of cloud computing, such as elasticity, scalability, and resource virtualization.
* Underlying Infrastructure – While IT operations primarily deal with physical hardware and data centers, CloudOps is centered around virtualized resources and cloud service providers.
* Security – Since cloud environments have unique security considerations, CloudOps focuses on implementing robust security measures, such as [identity](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/identity-security-what-it-is-why-its-so-important/) and access management, data encryption, and proactive threat monitoring; all specific to cloud-based systems.
* Scalability – CloudOps offers greater flexibility compared to traditional IT operations. Cloud environments allow businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand, whereas scaling in traditional IT operations often requires additional hardware procurement and deployment.
* Automation – CloudOps leverages automation tools and frameworks to streamline resource provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment in the cloud. This level of automation is typically more advanced and efficient compared to traditional IT operations.

## Seizing Value Through CloudOps Services

As cloud technology continues to meet changing business needs, migrating from on-prem to the cloud is no longer enough to revolutionize business infrastructure. The rise of hybrid and multi-cloud structures has also multiplied the complexities and criticalities associated with the cloud.

To leverage more value from the cloud, enterprises have focused on driving cost efficiencies through shared services and flexible commercial models. Cloud-based [Infrastructure-as-a-Service](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-security-understanding-the-difference-between-iaas-and-paas/) (IaaS), for example, plays a pivotal role in maintaining superior functionality and operational agility through automation, enabling businesses to optimize their operations.

In this context, CloudOps services have gained significant momentum. By managing software in a cloud computing environment, CloudOps ensures that enterprises are effectively harnessing the benefits of cloud-based systems. Since cloud operations services focus on optimizing performance and capacity, it validates best practices and processes that enable cloud platforms, applications, and internal data to perform optimally.

### Increase Efficiency & Scalability

CloudOps optimizes resource utilization and reduces manual intervention, resulting in enhanced operational efficiency. With proactive monitoring and performance optimization, CloudOps teams can identify and resolve issues promptly, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.

CloudOps also enables scalability. When businesses scale their resources up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary resource allocation is key. By centralizing management and leveraging standardized practices, CloudOps streamlines operations, reduces complexity, and empowers organizations to focus on core business activities.
