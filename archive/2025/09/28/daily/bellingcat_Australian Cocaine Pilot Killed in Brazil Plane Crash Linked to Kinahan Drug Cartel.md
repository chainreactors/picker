An Australian pilot who recently died when his [small plane crashed](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOmGQ3cEVhp/) in South America during a failed drug run has links to an alleged Kinahan cartel associate who is facing charges over the importation of a multimillion dollar cocaine shipment to Western Australia.

The body of former Melbourne stockbroker Timothy James Clark was [reportedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPJhthUa55Q&t=55s) found at the wreckage of his single-engine Sling 4 in Brazil’s north-east on September 14, along with about 200kg of cocaine.

Local media [said](https://g1.globo.com/al/alagoas/noticia/2025/09/14/aviao-que-transportava-cocaina-cai-em-canavial-em-coruripe-piloto-morreu.ghtml) Clark was the sole occupant of the aircraft, which had been fitted with additional fuel tanks and appeared to have its transponder turned off.

Melbourne newspaper *The Age* [reported](https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/the-stockbroker-the-underworld-and-a-plane-full-of-cocaine-the-colourful-life-of-timothy-clark-20250925-p5mxt0.html) on Thursday that Clark’s failed mission in South America was not his “first rodeo” and quoted a confidential source who alleged that the 46-year-old had been involved in a drug smuggling operation in Western Australia last year.

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) [charged](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-centre/media-release/two-men-arrested-perth-following-seizure-200kg-cocaine) German businessman Oliver Andreas Herrmann and Melbourne man Hamish Falconer with trafficking a commercial quantity of a controlled drug in December after a search of their hotel rooms uncovered 200kg of cocaine, packed in suitcases in single one-kilogram blocks, along with night vision goggles, aviation equipment and a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.

Herrmann had allegedly met a “small aircraft” at the remote Overlander Airstrip the day before his arrest. The AFP has not disclosed the make and model of the aircraft but said it had not seized an aircraft as part of its investigation.

Investigators estimated the street value of the drugs to be AUD $65 million and said an “organised crime syndicate” was likely responsible for the scheme.

In March, Bellingcat [published](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/03/22/nowhere-to-run-the-online-footprint-of-an-alleged-kinahan-cartel-associate/) an open source analysis of Herrmann’s online footprint and traced the champion marathon runner and international businessman to locations associated with the [US-sanctioned Kinahan Organised Crime Group](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20220411_33).

It followed reporting by our publishing partner *The Sunday Times*, [which revealed](https://www.thetimes.com/world/ireland-world/article/marathon-man-linked-to-kinahan-runs-into-trouble-with-drug-bust-3v6bg8jbc) that Herrmann had “close financial ties” to Christy Kinahan, the 68-year-old founder of the eponymous international drug cartel. Herrmann had no previously known links to organised crime.

Bellingcat has now uncovered evidence linking alleged Kinahan cartel associate Herrmann to Timothy Clark, the Australian who was killed when his plane crashed in Brazil two weeks ago.

Using online tools that consolidate publicly available information and reverse image searches, Bellingcat found more than a dozen accounts registered to Clark across social media platforms, travel websites and review platforms.

This open source review shows that the Australian pilot – who used the moniker “The Broker” on X and Instagram – documented his travels to more than 20 countries across Africa, South America, Europe and Asia over the past decade.

Clark frequently used Tripadvisor to post reviews, including about chartering a catamaran in Bali and the VIP service at a Saint-Tropez bar where he spent €5,500 on “ultra topshelf” drinks.
