Today, we are releasing the newest edition of our flagship product: Binary Ninja Ultimate.

The Ultimate edition includes all of the same features you know and love from Binary Ninja Commercial, but also includes the architectures weâve been selling separately over our past few releases. This lets us simplify our release pipeline *and* our pricing at the same time without raising prices for any existing customers. For the next few months, weâll be selling this edition at a [reduced, introductory price](/purchase) as we continue to build out additional features.

Under-the-hood, Binary Ninja Ultimate is a re-brand of our existing Binary Ninja Enterprise client builds, but now with named (instead of just floating) licenses. This means all current Enterprise customers will get Ultimate features at no extra cost and all future Ultimate customers will have the ability to add an Enterprise server at any time.

Some additional clarifications up-front for our existing customers:

* If youâre a Non-Commercial customer, nothing is changing.
* If youâre a Commercial customer happy with our existing architecture support, nothing is changing.
* If youâre an Enterprise customer, you will receive many new architectures for free with your existing licenses!
* If you had previously purchased a license to nanoMIPS or TriCore (speaking of which, make sure to catch up on our other [blog post](/2024/09/12/tricore.html) today with much more detail about our TriCore support), you will receive a free upgrade to Binary Ninja Ultimate.

If youâre interested in more details on whatâs included in each edition of Binary Ninja, head on over to our revamped purchase page for a comparison chart:

[Purchase](/purchase)

**TL;DR: We are renaming the Binary Ninja Enterprise client to âUltimateâ. Commercial customers may upgrade at a reduced price. Enterprise customers will be getting more features at no extra cost. Many of these features are already available in Enterprise client builds starting with `4.2.6025-dev`.**

## What is Binary Ninja Ultimate?

Ultimate is a new edition of Binary Ninja that will include some of our most advanced features to date. At launch, this means built-in support for niche embedded architectures like nanoMIPS, TriCore, and C-SKY along with extra support for platforms like VxWorks. Post-launch, we have support for more architectures and platforms planned, along with new features aimed specifically at firmware reverse engineering and (longer-term) official support for binary diffing.

Going forward, some of our newest features *may* make their way into Ultimate first, just like weâve done with the Commercial edition in the past. But, as always, weâll have plenty of additional features for every edition in each release. As an example, our initial release of Binary Ninja Ultimate *also* includes a brand-new MSP430 architecture plugin (the result of sponsored work from [Joe Rozner](https://github.com/jrozner)) that will be shipping to both Non-Commercial and Commercial customers in our next stable release (and is available now for all editions in development channel builds starting with `4.2.6025-dev`).

## What is happening to Binary Ninja Enterprise?

As of Binary Ninja `4.2.6025-dev`, all of the âat launchâ features above have shipped to the Enterprise client. These features are being provided at no additional cost to all Enterprise customers. Thanks for supporting us!

The Binary Ninja Enterprise client has been renamed to Binary Ninja Ultimate in builds starting with `4.2.6057-dev`. Going forward, we will refer to the Enterprise client as âUltimateâ, âUltimate editionâ, or just âthe clientâ in our documentation. This is a cosmetic change and reflects the fact that you will not be charged any extra for (but will still receive!) Ultimate-only features we add in the future.

The server itself will still be the âEnterprise serverâ and âEnterpriseâ will refer specifically to the extra features it enables (collaboration, floating licensing, centralized storage, and so on). Enterprise customers will also still be receiving their higher tier of support, which will continue to be referred to as âEnterprise supportâ.

## What is changing in the Binary Ninja Ultimate EULA for Enterprise customers?

We can provide a full diff of the changes on request, but: starting with version 4.2 of Binary Ninja, Binary Ninja Ultimate will fall under a new âBinary Ninja Ultimateâ EULA. This will be a direct copy of the existing Enterprise client EULA with some words changed to clarify that Ultimate edition is an Enterprise client. We are not intending to change any other terms/conditions associated with Enterprise apart from the name of the client product itself and clarifying the difference between Named and Floating editions.

## How can I upgrade to Binary Ninja Ultimate?

While new purchases can be made through our [purchase page](/purchase), we still need to process upgrades via email. If you would like to upgrade your Non-Commercial or Commercial edition of Binary Ninja to the Ultimate edition, please email us at `[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` and weâll get you a payment link. This can be paid the same way as any new purchase would, it just has to be a custom link for your specific order.

Enterprise users do not need to do anything other than update their client as usual. As mentioned above, starting with `4.2.6057-dev`, existing Enterprise clients will be re-badged as the Ultimate edition and your existing license will work as-is.
