## Allowed access to 150K cameras, some in sensitive spots, but has been done for spamming

Physical security biz Verkada has agreed to cough up $2.95 million following an investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – but the payment won’t make good its past security failings, including a blunder that led to CCTV footage being snooped on by miscreants. Instead, the fine is about spam.

You may remember the California outfit from a 2021 [security incident](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/10/150k_cctv_cameras_verkada_breach/) that flowed from an admin-level username and password combo for its systems being left online. Hacktivists found those credentials and used them to access CCTV cameras, potentially as many as 150,000, installed in Tesla factories, Cloudflare offices, hospitals, and a prison, among other facilities.

One of the hacktivists involved was [arrested](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/15/in_brief_security/) by Swiss police, reportedly for unrelated past crimes.
