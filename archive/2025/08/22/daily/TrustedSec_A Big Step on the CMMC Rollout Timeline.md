A major step on the CMMC rollout timeline was completed recently as the regulatory change that will create the CMMC contract clause made its way to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). This post covers what that means for contractors that want to know when to expect CMMC clauses in their contracts.

**September 10, 2025 update: This post has been updated to reflect the publication of the finalized CMMC contract clause with a start date of November 10, 2025.**

There are three pieces of information that a contractor needs in order to determine when they can expect to see CMMC requirements in their contracts:

1. The CMMC level and assessment requirements the contractor expects to be subject to
2. The start date of the CMMC rollout
3. The phases of the CMMC rollout

Contractors that are unsure of their future CMMC level and assessment requirements should take a detour to our previous blog post on [CMMC Level and Assessment Requirements for Defense Contractors](https://trustedsec.com/blog/cmmc-level-and-assessment-requirements-for-defense-contractors), as the phased rollout information below will be more useful with this knowledge.

A specific start date for the CMMC rollout to begin has not been released. However, based on the submission to OIRA we can estimate that it will be no earlier than October 2025 and likely no later than January 2026. This post will be updated once we have a definitive start date. Additional information on how this range was estimated is provided below.

Some contractors may encounter supposed CMMC clauses even though the CMMC rollout had not yet begun or, if you’re reading this in the future, CMMC clauses that don’t align with the phased rollout schedule. These clauses are suspicious, and contractors should refer to our previous blog post on [The Proliferation of “Fake” CMMC Contract Clauses](https://trustedsec.com/blog/the-proliferation-of-fake-cmmc-contract-clauses) for more information on this topic.

## CMMC Rollout Start Date Estimate

The regulation that defines the CMMC program and its requirements, known as [32 CFR 170](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/15/2024-22905/cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-program), was finalized on October 15, 2024. This regulation lays out a phased rollout for CMMC that will take place over three years (explained below); however, it does not set the start date for that rollout, nor does it define the contracting procedures that would impose CMMC obligations on contractors.

Another regulation that creates the CMMC contracting procedures, including the CMMC contract clause and start date for the CMMC phased rollout, was [finalized and published](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/10/2025-17359/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplement-assessing-contractor-implementation-of "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/09/10/2025-17359/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplement-assessing-contractor-implementation-of") on September 10, 20...
