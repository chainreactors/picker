The problem with regular SMS is that it does not provide any means of privacy. In the GSM, only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is optionally encrypted with a weak and broken stream cipher (A5/1 or A5/2). There are many vulnerabilities and shortcomings; third parties and cellular providers can intercept messages. End-to-End-encryption is unavailable as the SMS (Short Message Service) is not secure by design.

The following illustration shows the simple process of sending an SMS from one subscriber to another.

## SMS Delivery — BlindCell Powered+

To protect the SMS message content, we can use the [BlindCell](https://blind-cell.com/) app. Its core feature is to encrypt the message before it leaves the mobile device. The following illustration shows SMS message delivery using the BlindCell app:

**Image-2 SMS delivery process through the BlindCell app**

As we can see from the illustration, the SMS is sent encrypted to the Base station and delivered encrypted to the intended recipient. The application is available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iis.BlindCell). At the time of writing, the license cost for one device is a $79 one-time payment.

## Inside BlindCell

The application is easy to use, does not require an internet connection, and can be used as an alternative to the default messages app installed on the smartphone.

**Image-3 BlindCell main screen**

BlindCell can be used as an alternative to the default mobile SMS application. Image 3 lists all SMS messages from the device, whether they originated from BlindCell or the default SMS app. In Image-4, the application shows a green sign which means the message is encrypted; BlindCell automatically decrypts and displays the original message content behind the scenes.

## How does BlindCell protect the message?

The BlindCell app encrypts the messages using military grade encryption AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard). It does not involve any key-exchange process neither uses a hard-coded cryptographic keys.

The sender and the recipient locally determine the cryptographic keys. It has its key calculation algorithm and uses different parameters, including sender and recipient mobile numbers. Only the intended user can decrypt and read the message.

The following screenshot shows what an encrypted message looks like. If the recipient’s smartphone uses the BlindCell app, it will be automatically decrypted if the message was intended for that specific recipient. This is also a good example of what cellular providers or other unauthorized parties would see if they intercepted an SMS originating using BlindCell.

## Who can benefit from BlindCell?

* Government Officials
* Security Forces
* Businesses
* Entrepreneurs
* Journalists
* Professional individuals

## Summary

Regular SMS messaging is not secure by design. It does not offer End-to-End-Encryption making it possible for Cellular providers and third parties to intercept and read SMS message content. BlindCell is a unique app that offers encrypted SMS messaging without an internet connection.
