# ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ Piracy Skyrockets After Oscar Win

Last weekend, 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' dominated the Oscars by winning seven awards, including one for Best Picture. The independent film had already enjoyed a great run at the box office but the renewed exposure is a game changer. Success at the Oscars elevated awareness to new heights and according to data collected by TorrentFreak, piracy skyrocketed.

This year’s [Academy Awards ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95th_Academy_Awards) received plenty of attention as well, with one film standing out from all the rest.

With seven awards overall, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress, ‘[Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/)‘ was the star of the night. The independent film impressed the voters, despite having a relatively tiny budget compared to competitors including ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ and ‘Avatar: The Way of Water.’

The success didn’t come as a complete surprise. The film had already scooped up [dozens of accolades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accolades_received_by_Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once), including two Golden Globes, but winning seven Oscars was an entirely different level.

## Oscar Boost

Renewed attention from the press and film fanatics boosted interest among the broader public. This typically increases legal sales and views on streaming platforms, especially for relatively small releases.

‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ is no longer running in theaters, so there is no bump there. That said, there is another area where we observed a massive spike in interest, although that’s unlikely to please the filmmakers.

The Oscars typically have a direct impact on piracy activity, and the big Oscars winner is no exception. Based on a sample of torrent activity tracked by [IKnow](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/contacts/), we can report that pirated downloads of ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ skyrocketed this week.

## Oscar Piracy

Before discussing the numbers, it’s important to highlight that pirated copies of the Oscars winner have already been circulating for months. The first high-quality copy leaked last May and it was in the top ten [most pirated films](https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-torrented-pirated-movies/) for several weeks [in a row](https://torrentfreak.com/most-pirated-movies-of-2022/).

Since its release, the film has been illegally downloaded and streamed millions of times. In January of this year, we observed two modest [spikes in downloads](https://torrentfreak.com/oscar-nominees-see-interest-spike-on-pirate-sites-230219/), once after the Golden Globes win and again when the Oscar nominations were announced. After that, downloads leveled off again.

These earlier piracy boosts are notable, but they pale in comparison with the download boost observed in our sample this week. On Monday, pirated downloads of ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ increased by 761% compared to the week before.

This isn’t just a relative increase either; serious demand from pirates made the Oscar winner the most pirated film worldwide on Monday, beating many newer releases and blockbusters.

Interest dropped off on Tuesday, but there was still a five-fold increase in downloads compared to a week earlier. By then, however, Cocaine Bear had taken over the spot for the most pirated film.

## More Oscar Effects

Oscar-related surges are nothing new. Last year [we spotted a similar effect](https://torrentfreak.com/coda-piracy-skyrockets-after-best-picture-oscar-win-220401/) for Best Picture winner ‘CODA’ with a tenfold increase in downloads. In absolute numbers, it didn’t come close to this year’s winner, even when correcting for sample size.

The Oscar boost isn’t limited to the Best Picture winner either. Runner-up ‘All Quiet on the Western Front’ won four Academy Awards and a 268% boost in pirate downloads. Meanwhile, Best Picture nominee ‘The Triangle of Sadness’, which didn’t win an award, failed to see a massive download boost.

The chart above shows the estimated number of pirated downloads for each of the three films over the past weeks, with ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ standing out with the most pronounced download surge.

In closing, we should stress that all data reported here are estimated based on a large sample of millions of global daily torrent connections. These numbers are not exact nor do they include other forms of piracy, such as pirate streaming sites and direct downloads.

It’s clear, however, that the Oscars continue to be a defining event for film enthusiasts, including those who can’t or don’t want to pay.
