The Markup revealed in its [reporting](https://themarkup.org/investigations/2025/05/20/the-nyc-algorithm-deciding-which-families-are-under-watch-for-child-abuse) last month that New York City’s Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) has been quietly deploying an algorithmic tool to categorize families as “high risk". Using a grab-bag of factors like neighborhood and mother’s age, this AI tool can put families under intensified scrutiny without proper justification and oversight.

ACS knocking on your door is a nightmare for any parent, with the risk that any mistakes can break up your family and have your children sent to the foster care system.

 This “AI” tool, developed internally by ACS’s Office of Research Analytics, scores families for “risk” using 279 variables and subjects those deemed highest-risk to intensified scrutiny. The lack of transparency, accountability, or due process protections demonstrates that ACS has learned nothing from the failures of similar products in the realm of child services.

The algorithm operates in complete secrecy and the harms from this opaque “AI theater” are not theoretical. The 279 variables are derived only from cases back in 2013 and 2014 where children were seriously harmed.
