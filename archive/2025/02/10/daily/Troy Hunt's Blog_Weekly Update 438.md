# Weekly Update 438

09 February 2025

I think what's really scratching an itch for me with the home theatre thing is that it's this whole geeky world of stuff that I always knew was out there, but I'd just never really understood. For example, I mentioned [waveforming](https://thedigitalpicture.com.au/waveforming/?ref=troyhunt.com) in the video, and I'd never even heard of that let alone understood that there may be science where sound waves are smashed into each other in opposing directions in order to cancel each other out. And I'm sure I've got that completely wrong, but that's what's so fun about this! Anyway, that's all just part of the next adventure, and I hope you enjoy hearing about it and sending over your thoughts because I'm pretty sure there's a gazillion things I don't know yet ðŸ™‚
