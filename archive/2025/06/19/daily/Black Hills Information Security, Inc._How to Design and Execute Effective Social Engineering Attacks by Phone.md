When most people think of a hacker, they probably imagine someone in a hoodie on a computer, basking in the light of a green-on-black terminal. While (somewhat) true, many people don’t directly associate phone-based attacks as something that hackers typically do. But say that a hacker picks up their phone, calls a victim, and convinces them to run a malicious binary or click a link. What is this called? I’ll tell you. It’s known as social engineering, and it is a very reliable way of compromising systems when used by a competent attacker.

Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals into divulging confidential information, granting unauthorized access, or performing actions that benefit the attacker, all without the victim realizing they are being tricked. Unlike traditional hacking, which focuses on exploiting technical vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. And believe me: there is no blanket patch for the human populace.

In this blog, we’ll explore the different phases of a social engineering penetration test. We will examine how to craft and deliver a successful social engineering attack. Involved in this effort will be a focus on how to perform reconnaissance, design an effective ruse, and then deliver it to your target. Whether you’re a penetration tester or someone seeking to understand how attackers think, mastering social engineering can provide you with a valuable means of attack and defense.

One other bit here that I’d like to share… I am not joking when I say **CONFIDENCE IS KING**. With a strong enough delivery, appeal to certain emotions, and solid foundational knowledge about your target, you will be able to convince people of just about anything. Having confidence during the entirety of the social engineering process is what will help channel a great test.

Without further ado, let’s dive into my personal social engineering playbook.

## Pre-Engagement: Laying the Foundation

Before you even think about picking up the phone to call targets, you’ll hold a Rules of Engagement call with your client to make sure that you’re covered and given adequate permission. A successful social engineering campaign starts with clear boundaries and solid intel. As an ethical hacker, you will need to thoroughly understand and respect those boundaries while performing your assessment. However, I also believe that it is worth challenging your clients when they present a scope that is overly restrictive.

For example, if I am ever told to only call the help desk, I will generally pivot into a discussion about the other employees and how calling them should be considered to make the test as real as possible.

With that said, I’ve included a brief description of how this part of the engagement tends to unfold below.

### **Business Capture**

You’ve captured a new client, perhaps through networking, a cold call, or even a warm lead that arrived in your inbox. Congrats. This is a good time to discuss pricing and arrange to have relevant engagement paperwork signed. Now that you’ve got someone interested in your services, you need to set up some time for the ROE call.

### **Rules of Engagement (ROE) Call**

Kick things off with a call to your client. Define the scope, targets, and what’s off-limits. This isn’t just a formality—it’s your legal and ethical guardrail.

**Pro tip:** Consider taking notes during this call and passing them out after the call to avoid any “he said, she said” later.

Here is a simpl...
