[![GhostCall and GhostHire](data:image/png;base64... "GhostCall and GhostHire")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMbkAsrs6YvT6hgAJ1VD5h6DLPGjqLKZoVnv-Y9DUffXGlUHJ13omcv_O1rJJDQB7y_c8akQmP99DzBy1VAWYpxqTqY2fzxZUW0j3ON2wOQGzWt1QCyvCQGg_1R_tpZaeBadjWqFsiGPaY-zLKsWtXMEJfTpWEO2kkv_lvyl_q6Hk2Lx9EcJGCxGcsFLOK/s2800/gjost-hacker.jpg)

Threat actors tied to North Korea have been observed targeting the Web3 and blockchain sectors as part of twin campaigns tracked as **GhostCall** and **GhostHire**.

According to Kaspersky, the campaigns are part of a broader operation called [SnatchCrypto](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/north-korean-hackers-stole-millions.html) that has been underway since at least 2017. The activity is attributed to a Lazarus Group sub-cluster called [BlueNoroff](https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/bluenoroff-apt-hackers-using-new-ways.html), which is also known as APT38, CageyChameleon, CryptoCore, Genie Spider, Nickel Gladstone, Sapphire Sleet (formerly Copernicium), and Stardust Chollima.

Victims of the GhostCall campaign span several infected macOS hosts located in Japan, Italy, France, Singapore, Turkey, Spain, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong, whereas Japan and Australia have been identified as the major hunting grounds for the GhostHire campaign.

"GhostCall heavily targets the macOS devices of executives at tech companies and in the venture capital sector by directly approaching targets via platforms like Telegram, and inviting potential victims to investment-related meetings linked to Zoom-like phishing websites," Kaspersky researchers Sojun Ryu and Omar Amin [said](https://securelist.com/bluenoroff-apt-campaigns-ghostcall-and-ghosthire/117842/).

"The victim would join a fake call with genuine recordings of this threat's other actual victims rather than deepfakes. The call proceeds smoothly to then encourages the user to update the Zoom client with a script. Eventually, the script downloads ZIP files that result in infection chains deployed on an infected host."

On the other hand, GhostHire involves approaching prospective targets, such as Web3 developers, on Telegram and luring them into downloading and executing a booby-trapped GitHub repository under the pretext of completing a skill assessment within 30 minutes of sharing the link, so as to ensure a higher success rate of infection.

Once installed, the project is designed to download a malicious payload onto the developer's system based on the operating system used. The Russian cybersecurity company said it has been keeping tabs on the two campaigns since April 2025, although it's assessed that GhostCall has been active since mid-2023, likely following the [RustBucket](https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/beware-new-rustbucket-malware-variant.html) campaign.

RustBucket marked the adversarial collective's major pivot to targeting macOS systems, following which other campaigns have leveraged malware families like [KANDYKORN](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/north-korean-hackers-tageting-crypto.html), [ObjCShellz](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/n-korean-bluenoroff-blamed-for-hacking.html), and [TodoSwift](https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/new-macos-malware-todoswift-linked-to.html).

It's worth noting that various aspects of the activity have been documented extensively over the past year by multiple security vendors, including [Microsoft](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-hackers-steal-10m-with-ai.html), [Huntress, Field Effect](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/bluenoroff-deepfake-zoom-scam-hits.html), [Huntabil.IT, Validin, and SentinelOne](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/north-korean-hackers-target-web3-with.html).

### The GhostCall Campaign

Targets who land on the fake Zoom pages as part of the GhostCall campaign are initially served a bogus page that gives the illusion of a live call, only to display an error message three to five seconds later, urging them to download a Zoom software development kit (SDK) to address a purported issue with continuing the call.

Should the victims fall for the trap and attempt to update the SDK by clicking on the "Update Now" option, it leads to the download of a malicious AppleScript file onto their system. In the event the victim is using a Windows machine, the attack leverages the [ClickFix technique](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/north-korean-hackers-combine-beavertail.html) to copy and run a PowerShell command.

| GhostCall campaign attack flow |

At each stage, every interaction with the fake site is recorded and beaconed to the attackers to track the victim's actions. As recently as last month, the threat actor has been observed transitioning from Zoom to Microsoft Teams, using the same tactic of tricking users into downloading a TeamsFx SDK this time to trigger the infection chain.

Regardless of the lure used, the AppleScript is designed to install a phony application disguised as Zoom or Microsoft Teams. It also downloads another AppleScript dubbed DownTroy that checks stored passwords associated with password management applications and installs additional malware with root privileges.

DownTroy, for its part, is engineered to drop several payloads as part of eight distinct attack chains, while also bypassing Apple's Transparency, Consent, and Control ([TCC](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/researchers-uncover-symlink-exploit.html)) framewor...
