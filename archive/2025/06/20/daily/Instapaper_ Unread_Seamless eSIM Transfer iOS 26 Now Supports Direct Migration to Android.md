Earlier disassemblies of Android 16’s SIM Manager revealed that Google has been laying the groundwork for enabling eSIM transfers from iOS to Android. Currently, transferring eSIMs between Android devices is a seamless process that requires no contact with the carrier.

However, due to differences in manufacturers and operating systems, migrating an eSIM between Android and iOS has traditionally been a cumbersome task. Users are often required to contact their carrier to unbind the eSIM from the old device before reactivating it on the new one—a process that can be both time-consuming and tedious.

In iOS 26, some users have discovered that Apple has indeed added an option to transfer an eSIM to Android. According to a Reddit user, a new “Transfer to Android” feature has appeared under the eSIM migration section of carrier settings.

Currently, Apple offers the following methods for eSIM migration:

* Transfer from another iPhone: Simply place the two iPhones close together and tap to migrate on the new device.
* Transfer via QR code: A QR code is generated, which can be scanned by an Android device to initiate the migration process—effectively transferring the eSIM from iPhone to Android.
* Transfer from Android: Interestingly, Apple refers to this feature as “Transfer from Android to iPhone,” but avoids directly referencing transfers in the opposite direction.

This collaboration between Apple and Google marks a significant step toward simplifying cross-platform eSIM migration, eliminating the need for carrier intervention. Once fully supported by both carriers and device ecosystems, users will be able to perform self-service migrations more conveniently when switching devices.

To migrate an iPhone eSIM to an Android device, users will need at least iOS version 26. The minimum Android version requirement remains unclear, though it’s likely that older versions may not support self-service eSIM migration.
