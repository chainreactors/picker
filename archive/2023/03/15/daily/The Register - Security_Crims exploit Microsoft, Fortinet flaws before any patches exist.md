Patch Tuesday Microsoft's March Patch Tuesday includes new fixes for 74 bugs, two of which are already being actively exploited, and nine that are rated critical. Let's start with the two that miscreants found before Redmond issued a fix.

First up: prioritize patching [CVE-2023-23397](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-23397), a privilege elevation bug in Microsoft Outlook that received a 9.8 out of 10 CVSS rating. While details of the hole haven't been publicly disclosed, it has already been exploited in the wild by miscreants in Russia against government, energy, and military sectors in Europe, we're told. Microsoft lists the attack complexity as "low."

Redmond is sufficiently worried about this one to have [published](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/microsoft-mitigates-outlook-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability/) a guide to the bug, and provided documentation and a script to determine if your business has been targeted by criminals trying to exploit this vulnerability. In other words: it's serious.
