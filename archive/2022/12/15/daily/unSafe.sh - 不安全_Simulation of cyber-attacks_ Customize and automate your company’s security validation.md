[![Simulation of yber-attacks is a value-added cybersecurity service](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Simulacion-de-ciberataques-1.webp)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Simulacion-de-ciberataques-1.webp)

Cybersecurity is a strategic issue for companies and public administrations. In October, three public medical centers in Catalonia suffered a cyber-attack that paralyzed their activity. The malicious agents used ransomware to hijack patient data and demand an economic ransom from the Administration. These kinds of incidents demonstrate the relevance of having **advanced [cybersecurity services](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-services/)**, such as the **simulation of cyber-attacks**, to **analyze an organization’s security strategy**, identify new attack vectors and take remediation measures.

The security crisis experienced by Catalan medical centers evidences of how successful cyber-attacks can compromise something as important as the health of people… and businesses. What’s more, a security incident can trigger major economic, legal and reputational consequences. How does an organization prevent this from happening?

The **simulation of cyber-attacks** can be a key ally in **validating the security of a company** or institution. Why? This high-value service, provided by cybersecurity specialists, is based on two fundamental characteristics. On the one hand, it is customizable, i.e., professionals adapt its design and execution to the needs and characteristics of the organization. On the other hand, the **techniques used in the simulation of cyber-attacks can be automated**, which facilitates the task of generating a very large number of tests in a short time. At the same time, **security can be continuously monitored**.

In the following, we will analyze **Tarlogic’s cyber-attack simulation service** and its benefits for companies wishing to improve their detection and response capabilities to potential cyber threats.

## 1. BAS technology, an ally to automate security validation

The automation of the techniques implemented in the **simulation of cyber-attacks** is possible thanks to the use of Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) technology. These cutting-edge solutions, as the name of the technology itself indicates, are used to simulate cyber-attacks.

These tools make it possible to perform **simulations of breaches and attacks**. The objective of such a **cyber-attack simulation** is to identify and mitigate existing security holes in web applications, email, and endpoints of organizations.

Likewise, the wealth of information obtained by using BAS technology allows the **generation of reports and risk assessment**, using reference methodologies in the sector such as [MITRE-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/).

One of the great advantages of using this type of technology is that these tools **continuously update the threat repository**, which facilitates the detection and anticipation of innovative and disruptive attacks.

### 1.1. MITRE-ATT&CK, a framework that systematizes malicious tactics and techniques

What tactics and techniques can be used to **simulate cyber-attacks**? For example, those contained in the ATT&CK framework developed by MITRE, a non-profit organization that researches and develops technology for various U.S. government agencies in such important areas as defense and cybersecurity.

As part of its innovative work in the field of Internet security, MITRE designed ATT&CK, a framework that systematizes the main tactics and techniques used by criminals to attack organizations.

In its latest version, published in April 2022, the framework lists up to 14 tactics. These range from reconnaissance, i.e. actions taken by attackers to o...
