## Comprehensive Threat Intelligence Report: The Rise of Nation-State Cyber Attacks and Their Convergence with Cybercrime

### **TLP: WHITE**

*This threat intelligence report was written in tandem between Krypt3ia and the ICEBREAKER Threat Intelligence Analyst created by Krypt3ia.*

#### Executive Summary

Over the past year, nation-state cyber activity has escalated significantly, with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups leading attacks on critical infrastructure, financial systems, and geopolitical rivals. State-backed actors have increasingly collaborated with criminal groups, leveraging their techniques to obscure attribution while funding their operations through extortion, theft, and ransomware. This strategy blurs the lines between traditional cybercrime and state-sponsored attacks, making attribution and defense more complex and creating a form of **low-intensity warfare** in the digital domain.

## Rise in Nation-State Cyber Attacks

#### Escalating Nation-State Operations

From mid-2021 to 2022, nation-state attacks surged, with critical infrastructure becoming a primary target. **Microsoft’s 2022 Digital Defense Report** highlights that **40%** of state-backed cyber operations now focus on disrupting essential services, especially amid the Russia-Ukraine war. APT groups linked to **Russia**, **China**, **Iran**, and **North Korea** have ramped up their efforts in sabotage, espionage, and data exfiltration. For example, **Russian APTs** aggressively targeted Ukraine’s power grid, financial systems, and military networks, reflecting their broader strategy of cyber-enabled hybrid warfare.

#### Low-Intensity Warfare in Cyberspace

These cyber operations are being recognized as a form of **low-intensity warfare**—persistent, high-impact attacks that fall short of outright military conflict but have substantial geopolitical consequences. Unlike traditional warfare, cyberattacks can continuously disrupt economic and military targets while avoiding clear attribution, which limits direct diplomatic or military retaliation. **Russia’s** operations in Ukraine are prime examples, with continuous strikes on critical infrastructure paired with disinformation campaigns designed to weaken Ukrainian resistance.

## The Role of APT Groups in the Past Year

**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups** have played a pivotal role in these cyber campaigns. APTs are often tied to specific nation-states and are known for their long-term, sophisticated attacks. Key APT groups active in the past year include:

* In 2024, **APT28 (Fancy Bear)**, the Russian state-sponsored group, has continued its aggressive cyber campaigns targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure and NATO allies. One notable attack involved phishing emails sent to Ukrainian government and military personnel in December 2023, with the intent to compromise systems by delivering malware through fake CERT-UA email addresses. These emails contained malicious files that initiated data theft operations and remote command execution, leveraging tools like **PowerShell** and **MASEPIE** malware for deeper infiltration​ [Anvilogic](https://www.anvilogic.com/threat-reports/apt28-cyber-attack-ua-pl)​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/targeting-ukrainian-organizations-phishing-campaign).
* **APT28** also exploited vulnerabilities in **Microsoft Outlook**, using a known flaw (CVE-2023-23397) to gain access to high-value NATO-related targets and European defense ministries​ [The Record from Recorded Future](https://therecord.media/microsoft-outlook-vulnerability-apt28-hackers-russia-nato).
* The **Lazarus Group**, linked to North Korea, remains focused on financially motivated attacks, primarily through cryptocurrency theft. In 2024, Lazarus executed several large-scale heists, targeting global crypto platforms and exchanges. The proceeds from these operations are funneled into North Korea’s government and military programs. This group uses sophisticated phishing techniques and custom malware to steal millions in digital assets, exacerbating tensions in cyberspace​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/targeting-ukrainian-organizations-phishing-campaign).
* **APT41 (Winnti)**, associated with China, has continued its cyber espionage campaigns in 2024, focusing on intellectual property theft in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors. This group targets entities in Southeast Asia and the U.S., often using advanced supply chain attacks to compromise their targets. The group’s operations align with China’s broader geopolitical goals of gathering intelligence and exerting regional influence through cyber means​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/targeting-ukrainian-organizations-phishing-campaign).
* **OilRig (APT34)**, tied to Iran, has been involved in espionage campaigns targeting oil, gas, and government institutions in the Middle East. In 2024, this group escalated its activities, employing spear-phishing techniques to compromise key sectors in adversarial Gulf countries. Iranian state-backed actors are increasingly using ransomware as a disruptive tool without financial motives, a tactic observed in attacks on critical infrastructure in Israel and other Middle Eastern states​ [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/targeting-ukrainian-organizations-phishing-campaign).

These groups have significantly increased their operations, furthering their nation’s geopolitical goals while often operating in a grey zone between espionage and sabotage. Their rise exemplifies the convergence of **low-intensity warfare** in cyberspace with strategic geopolitical objectives.

## Nation-State Use of Cybercrime for Financial Gain

An emerging trend is the **leveraging of cybercriminal techniques** by nation-states to fund their operations. For instance, **North Korea’s Lazarus Group** has been instrumental in stealing billions of dollars through cryptocurrency attacks. This stolen wealth is funneled directly into North Korea’s state programs, financing both cyber and nuclear initiatives. Similarly, **Iran** has been implicated in using ransomware attacks not for extortion but to cause operational disruption, with these efforts masking state objectives.

Nation-states are increasingly working with cybercriminal groups to carry out these financially motivated operations. **Ransomware groups** with loose or direct ties to state actors, such as **REvil** and **Conti**, have been linked to nation-states like **Russia**, which benefits from these groups’ activities while maintaining plausible deniability. **Initial Access Brokers (IABs)**—who sell access to compromised systems—are often exploited by state actors to penetrate target networks undetected before deploying destructive malware or espionage tools.

In 2024, nation-state actors like North Korea and Iran have increasingly utilized cybercriminal techniques for financial gain to support state activities, a trend that is exacerbating global cybersecurity challenges.

North Korea’s **Lazarus Group** has been one of the most prominent examples of this strategy. They have been responsible for large-scale cryptocurrency thefts, totaling over $3 billion, which directly funds North Korea’s missile and weapons programs. Some of their high-profile heists in 2024 include breaches of platforms like **Atomic Wallet**, **CoinEx**, and **Stake.com**, stealing significant sums of cryptocurrency. North Korea has developed a sophisticated money-laundering network involving cryptocurrency mixers, such as **Tornado Cash** and **Sinbad**, ...
