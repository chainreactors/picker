Explore MITRE ATT&CK Techniques in Real-World Samples with TI Lookup

We’re excited to announce the latest update to [Threat Intelligence (TI) Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/). The enhanced home screen now integrates all techniques and tactics of the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-attack/), along with relevant malware samples and signatures.

Let’s dive into how these updates can transform your workflow and help you tackle threats with greater confidence.

## Redesigned Threat Intelligence Dashboard

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-5-1024x608.png)

The centerpiece of the updated [Threat Intelligence home screen](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=mitre_ttps_in_ti_lookup&utm_term=211124&utm_content=linktolookup/) is the **MITRE ATT&CK matrix**, neatly organizing tactics and techniques into a clear, actionable layout.

But here’s where it gets really exciting: The matrix is interactive and lets you explore **[actual malware samples](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-analysis-report/)** tied to each technique. This bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge of attack patterns and practical insights into how those patterns are used in real-world attacks.

The new home screen is designed to be super functional for anyone working with malware, whether you’re a malware analyst, an incident responder, a threat researcher, or just someone curious about how malware operates.

## Making the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix Actionable

One of the core goals of this redesign was to turn the MITRE ATT&CK classification into a working tool for analysts. Instead of just showcasing popular techniques, the matrix now:

* Covers all techniques we detect—not just a subset
* Links techniques to detection data and real-world examples
* Helps analysts identify patterns and connections across incidents

This update takes analysts beyond just understanding the techniques and tactics. It helps them put that knowledge into action.

They can see how specific techniques have been used in real attacks, spot the malware families tied to certain behaviors, and fine-tune their detection rules to better defend against similar threats in the future.

## How to Use the Interactive MITRE ATT&CK Matrix

With the new home screen, all techniques and tactics are displayed clearly. Clicking on any technique opens up a wealth of information and analysis samples related to it, including its sub-techniques.

The updated TI Lookup now includes filtering options for MITRE ATT&CK matrix techniques to help users prioritize threats:

* **Red (danger):** High-risk techniques requiring immediate action
* **Yellow (warning):** Moderate-risk techniques for ongoing analysis
* **Blue (other):** Low-risk or less urgent techniques

Users can refine their view by choosing to hide or display specific categories using the button next to the labels.

Here’s an example of how the redesigned TI Lookup can be used to explore real-world malware scenarios. Let’s take a closer look at the samples related to spearphishing links.

In the **Initial Access** section of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix, you’ll find **Phishing (T1566)**, which includes sub-techniques like spearphishing.

Clicking on **Phishing** brings up a new tab with detailed information, including:

* An overview of **Phishing** and its popular sub-techniques, such as spearphishing links, spearphishing attachments, and more
* Insights into related processes and threats
