What’s Inside ANY.RUN’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds?

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=inside_ti_feeds&utm_term=161224&utm_content=linktolanding)’s [Threat Intelligence](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=inside_ti_feeds&utm_term=161224&utm_content=tifeeds) (TI) feeds provide an invaluable solution for organizations seeking to detect and mitigate the latest malware and phishing campaigns, attacks, and cybercriminal tactics.

But what exactly is inside these feeds, and how can they help companies strengthen their cybersecurity?

Let’s dive into the details.

## What Are ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds?

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence (TI) Feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-feeds-integration/) are a comprehensive collection of [Indicators of Compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs) that can expand security systems’ threat detection capabilities. These feeds don’t just give you the basics, they go deep, providing malicious IPs, URLs, domains, file hashes, and even links to actual analysis sessions, showing you how threats behave.

Where does this data come from? An international community of over 500,000 researchers and cybersecurity pros who upload and analyze real-world malware and phishing samples every day to ANY.RUN’s [Public submissions repository](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=inside_ti_feeds&utm_term=161224&utm_content=linktoservice).

With TI Feeds from ANY.RUN, [organizations can](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-feeds-for-organizational-performance/):

* **Expand Threat Coverage:** Extend your security systems’ ability to detect emerging malware and phishing attacks.
* **Improve Incident Response**: Enrich incident response processes with contextual data from the feeds, providing deeper insights into threats and their behaviors.
* **Strengthen Security Posture:** Ensure proactive defense against new and evolving threats.
* **Optimize Threat Hunting:** Streamlinethreat hunting activities, identifying and investigating potential threats more efficiently.
