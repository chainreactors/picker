In today’s digital world, passwords have become a necessary part of life. But even though you use them for almost everything you do online, you probably don’t give them the thought they truly deserve. May 1, 2025, is [World Password Day](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/password-day/), a reminder that passwords are the unsung heroes of cybersecurity, the first line of defense for all your sensitive personal data. This annual event encourages you to level up your password game and strengthen your online defenses. World Password Day is more relevant than ever in today’s evolving threat landscape.

Data breaches are on the rise, and according to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, a staggering [81% of them](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Te3/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf)are linked to weak or compromised passwords. The bottom line? If you’re still relying on “Fluffy123”, you could be putting your personal information at risk. Let’s explore password-based attacks, and some steps you can take to lock down your logins, once and for all.

## Threats to your passwords

Managing all your passwords can be a hassle. They’re easy to forget and hard to keep track of, so people tend to use and reuse simple passwords they can remember. But here’s the issue – cybercriminals are getting smarter and their attacks are only getting more sophisticated. If a scammer gains access to your personal details, they can create havoc with your finances and cause you stress for years to come. In the past, brute force attacks were the go-to method, which involved simply using trial and error to crack passwords. Today, hackers use much more complex methods – here are a few examples.

* **Password phishing:** In a [phishing](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-phishing.html) attack, scammers will use emails, phone calls, or texts to pose as trusted businesses and service providers. They may send you a fake invoice to pay. They might offer you an amazing deal on an upgraded service. Sometimes they threaten to cut off a service if you don’t respond immediately. The goal is to trick you into giving up your username and password so they can access your data and steal your money.
* **Credential stuffing:** Once hackers have your login details, they often try what’s called [credential stuffing](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/1719167/cybersecurity-what-is-credential-stuffing/) – using your stolen credentials (username and password combinations) to try and break into your other accounts. Why does this work so often? Because more than [two in three people](https://www.security.org/resources/online-password-strategies/)admit they reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
* **Malware**: [Infostealer malware](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/10/31/nastiest-malware-2024/) can be used by hackers in the background to steal your personal information including your passwords. Once the malware is on your device it can search your web browsers, email clients, digital wallets, files, applications, etc. looking for sensitive information. They can even look for old forms you filled out with passwords, record your keyboard strokes, and take screenshots of your computer dashboard.  The malware then sends this information back to hackers’ servers, sometimes within seconds.  Hackers can use this type of malware for large attacks as seen by the targeted attack on [Snowflake customers](https://www.wired.com/story/infostealer-malware-password-theft/).

## Password security checklist

* **Create strong passwords**

  **Longer is stronger**: Aim for passwords that are at least [16 characters](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/require-strong-passwords)long. Research shows this number of characters takes exponentially longer to crack.

  **Difficulty matters: “**12345” may be an easy password to remember, but it isn’t going to keep the cybercriminals away. Create a unique mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols for each password.

  **Be unpredictable:** Avoid using obvious patterns and personal details that will be easy for hackers to figure out. This means no street addresses or phone numbers, and especially no personal details you might be sharing on social media.

  ***Did you know?*** More than [50% of people](https://www.security.org/resources/online-password-strategies/) admit to using familiar names for their passwords, such as their kid’s name or their pet’s name. 15% said they use their own first name in their passwords!
* **Change reused passwords**
  If you’re reusing the same password across accounts, it’s time for a refresh. All it takes is one compromised account for a hacker to potentially unlock dozens more. Start with your most sensitive accounts, such as banking, email, and healthcare and update those first.

  ***Did you know?*** According to a study by Forbes Advisor, on average, people reuse the same password for at least [four accounts](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/american-password-habits/).
* **Use multi-factor authentication**
  Even if a hacker obtains your password, you can still stop them in their tracks by adding a second layer of security to your login process. [Multi-factor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-multifactor-authentication-e5e39437-121c-be60-d123-eda06bddf661) (MFA) includes things like one-time codes sent to your phone or scans of biometric ...
