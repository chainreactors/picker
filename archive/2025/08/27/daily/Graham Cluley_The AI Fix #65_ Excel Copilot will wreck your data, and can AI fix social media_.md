In episode 65 of The AI Fix, a pigeon gives a PowerPoint presentation, Mark plays Graham a song about the Transformer architecture, a robot dog delivers parcels, some robots fall over at the World Humanoid Robot Games, and Graham takes credit for one of computing‚Äôs greatest insights.

Plus, Graham explains why Microsoft doesn‚Äôt want you to use Excel‚Äôs new Copilot feature in any spreadsheet calculations that are meant to be useful, accurate, reproducible, or relied on for anything important, and Mark discovers what happened when researchers gave 500 AIs their own social network.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
