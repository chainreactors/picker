## SAP for Me while using SAP Activate Methodology

In SAP Activate, you will find tasks, procedures, and accelerators to guide you during the systems/tenants provisioning process.

### SAP for Me in an SAP Activate task

In SAP Activate Methodology, a task is defined as work to be performed. One or several tasks comprise a deliverable. You will find the first task [Initial Access to SAP for Me](https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/#/group//roadmap/82b2db84548d41209cda972f0fac428b/node/FA163ED752201EEBB2BE508DA74548C2), in the SAP Activate Roadmap **SAP Activate Methodology for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-system landscape)**, during the Prepare phase as you start the journey of implementing your SAP solution using SAP Activate Methodology.

### SAP for Me in an SAP Activate procedure step

Within each task, you find procedure steps to break down the individual step needed to complete the task. It is very important to read each procedure step to know how to execute each task and which platform to use. Below is an example of a procedure step to request access to the SAP Central Business Configuration tenant. Review the prerequisite task, the procedure notes, and the accelerator section before requesting the tenant.
