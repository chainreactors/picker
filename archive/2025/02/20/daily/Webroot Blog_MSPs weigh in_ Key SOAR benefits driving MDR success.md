OpenText recently surveyed 255 MSPs to uncover key trends shaping the future of Managed Detection and Response (MDR). One technology area it explored was security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)—the workhorse behind automating security workflows. The survey revealed several key benefits of SOAR in MDR, highlighting how it can help MSPs and SMBs improve incident response, reduce alert fatigue, and deliver round-the-clock security.

SOAR is a technology that enables security teams to automate and streamline their workflows—from threat detection to response. It integrates and coordinates security tools and processes, helping analysts handle and respond to incidents. By automating repetitive tasks, such as triaging alerts and executing response actions, SOAR reduces manual effort and speeds up incident resolution. This improves the overall effectiveness of security operations, making it a critical component of modern MDR solutions.

## Real-world benefits of SOAR for MDR solutions

**Automation of common tasks**
In the survey, 30% of MSPs pointed to automation of common tasks as the most valuable benefit of SOAR within an MDR service—and it’s easy to see why. Automation allows MSPs to streamline repetitive tasks like alert triage and standard response workflows. By speeding up incident resolution and ensuring consistent, accurate responses, SOAR helps MSPs address threats swiftly and effectively. This not only reduces the burden on security teams but also enables them to outpace adversaries and deliver stronger protection for their customers.

**Improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response**
Cybercriminals know that timing is everything. They often strike outside of business hours—late at night, on weekends, or during holidays—because they count on reduced staffing and slower response times to give them the upper hand. However, with MDR services leveraging SOAR, cybercriminals lose their “after hours advantage.”

According to the survey, 27% of MSPs identified improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response as a top SOAR benefit as part of an MDR solution. By automating detection and response using customizable workflows, SOAR ensures security measures are always on, regardless of the time or day.

**Reduced alert fatigue**
Alert fatigue is one of the most pressing challenges for security teams today. When bombarded with an overwhelming number of alerts, it’s easy for critical threats to get lost in the noise. SOAR directly tackles this issue, helping MSPs streamline their processes and focus on what really matters. In fact, 24% of MSPs in the survey noted that SOAR’s ability to reduce alert fatigue thereby improving accuracy and confidence was a key benefit for an MDR solution.

SOAR works by automatically analyzing security alerts against predefined rules and context, escalating the most critical threats to the surface. This not only sharpens the accuracy of responses but also enables security teams to act quickly and decisively. Security teams can use SOAR to create workflows to remediate the high-priority incidents that truly need attention, ensuring that any financial and reputational damage is minimized

**Centralized incident management with enriched alerts**
When it comes to incident management, having a disjointed view can slow down response times and make it harder to pinpoint the right course of action. That’s why 19% of MSPs in the survey highlighted centralized incident management and enriched alerts as one of the top benefits of SOAR for an MDR solution.

Alerts are enriched with the latest threat intelligence, which provides security teams with vital context. This deeper layer of information helps analysts understand the full scope and severity of an alert, allowing them to make quicker, more informed decisions. With SOAR, all relevant data is centralized in one platform, giving security teams a unified view that enhances their ability to respond effectively and prioritize the most critical threats without missing crucial details.

## MDR with SOAR helps MSPs differentiate their offering

For MSPs, leveraging SOAR capabilities in their MDR offerings is a strategic move that can significantly enhance their service delivery. By focusing on the key benefits of automation using workflows, 24/7 protection, reduced alert fatigue, and centralized incident management, MSPs can provide a superior level of security that meets the evolving needs of their SMB clients. This differentiation not only improves client outcomes but also positions MSPs as leaders in the competitive security services market.

Incorporating SOAR into MDR services enables MSPs to offer a more efficient, reliable, and comprehensive security solution. With SOAR automating routine tasks, improving after-hours response, reducing alert fatigue, and centralizing incident management, MSPs can ensure that their clients receive the best possible defense against cyber threats. This approach not only enhances the overall security posture of SMBs but also builds trust and confidence in the MSPs’ ability to safeguard their clients’ digital assets.

## Final thoughts

When MSPs choose to partner with a vendor for MDR, it’s important to select one that integrates SOAR into their offering. By doing so, MSPs can deliver a modern, proactive MDR service that improves security posture and provides the best experience for their SMB customers. SOAR accelerates response actions to stop adversaries in their tracks at every turn, ensuring th...
