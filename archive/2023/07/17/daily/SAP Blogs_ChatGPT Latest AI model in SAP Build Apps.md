ChatGPT Turbo-3.5 can assist developers in generating code snippets for common SAP development tasks. Whether it's creating custom modules, implementing UI elements, or integrating with backend systems, the language model can provide accurate and context-aware code suggestions, reducing development time and effort.

#### b) Technical Documentation Exploration:

Finding the right information in vast technical documentation can be time-consuming. ChatGPT Turbo-3.5 can parse through extensive SAP documentation and provide developers with relevant answers to their queries, saving them valuable research time. From understanding API integrations to troubleshooting issues, the virtual assistant offers real-time assistance, empowering developers to make informed decisions.
