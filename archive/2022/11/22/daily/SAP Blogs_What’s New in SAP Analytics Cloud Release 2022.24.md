[SAP Analytics Cloud](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.html) brings together analytics and planning with unique integration to SAP applications and seamless access to heterogenous data sources. It helps everyone in your organization make decisions without doubt with trusted insights and integrated plans.

This blog post introduces the features of the SAP Analytics Cloud 2022.24 release available for SAP Analytics Cloud FastTrack customers. For SAP Analytics Cloud Quarterly Release Cycle (QRC) customers, this release and its features will be available as part of the QRC Q1 2023 release.

## **System Administration and Technical Requirements**

Although not required, you may upgrade to the latest SAP Analytics Cloud agent version **1.0.365** to take advantage of all data acquisition types.

The agent’s minimum version remains at 1.0.75, with the following exceptions:

Version **1.0.99** for SAP ERP/SQL Database
Version **1.0.355** for SAP Universe (UNX)
Version **1.0.353** for SAP Business Warehouse (BW)

For more information, see [System Requirements and Technical Prerequisites](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/11b4e5ff76eb4747bc255d7037be1f01.html).

## **Release Highlights**

* **Dashboard and Story Design**

  + Optimized Story Experience Update

    - [Support Template and Layout in Optimized Design Experience](#1)

  + **Data Modeling**

    - [Add Missing Currency Rates](#2)

  + **Enterprise Planning**

    - [Calendar Administration Mode](#3)

    - [Multi Actions: External API Step Integration-Synchronous Execution](#4)

## **Dashboard and Story Design**

##### **Optimized Story Experience Update**

##### **Support Template and Layout in Optimized Design Experience Models**

The new feature supports templates and layouts in the Optimized Design Experience to ensure feature parity with the classic experience:

* With an optimized story, users can apply either a classic template or an optimized template

* Users also have the ability to save an optimized story into an optimized template

* There are new placeholder widgets that reflect UX enhancements

* Story preferences in ODE can also be used with templates/layouts

* Templates created in the classic experience will automatically migrate to the optimized experience to create a seamless transition for users

Note that when applying a classic template to an optimized story and there is an unsupported widget in the optimized experience, users will not be able to add the unsupported widget using the placeholder.

## **Data Modeling**

##### **Add Missing Currency Rates**

Modelers can now open the Currency Rates Table from the model. Modelers no longer need to search for their rates table as they are brought from the model to the currency rates table and automatically see missing rates relating to a specific measure. Missing Rates relating to specific measures can be added, using either a fixed target currency or currency from a dimension. Populating missing rates is now targeted to the rates that modelers need, and the requirement to populate ALL missing currencies is now removed.
