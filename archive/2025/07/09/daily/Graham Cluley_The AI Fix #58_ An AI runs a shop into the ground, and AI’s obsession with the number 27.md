In episode 58 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast, our hosts discover a pair of AI headphones that don‚Äôt electrocute you, Microsoft invents ‚Äúmedical superintelligence‚Äù, Chucky opens a hotel, some robot footballers fall over, Jony Ive invents a $6 billion pen, and Malcolm Gladwell fears a dystopian future full of children playing joyfully in the street.

Graham discovers that the number 27 holds a special place in the heart of every AI, and Mark investigates Anthropic‚Äôs terrible AI shopkeeper.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
