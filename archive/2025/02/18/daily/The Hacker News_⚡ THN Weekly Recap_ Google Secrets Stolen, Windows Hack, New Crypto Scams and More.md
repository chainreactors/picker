Welcome to this week's Cybersecurity News Recap. Discover how cyber attackers are using clever tricks like fake codes and sneaky emails to gain access to sensitive data. We cover everything from device code phishing to cloud exploits, breaking down the technical details into simple, easy-to-follow insights.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Russian Threat Actors Leverage Device Code Phishing to Hack Microsoft Accounts** ‚Äî Microsoft and Volexity have [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/microsoft-russian-linked-hackers-using.html) that threat actors with ties to Russia are leveraging a technique known as device code phishing to gain unauthorized access to victim accounts, and use that access to get hold of sensitive data and enable persistent access to the victim environment. At least three different Russia-linked clusters have been identified abusing the technique to date. The attacks entail sending phishing emails that masquerade as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations, which, when clicked, urge the message recipients to authenticate using a threat actor-generated device code, thereby allowing the adversary to hijack the authenticated session using the valid access token.

## Stop Playing The Hackers' Game Their Way

It's time for a new security approach. Replace traditional security technology that exposes your attack surface and allows lateral movement to access your data.](https://thehackernews.uk/2025-ai-cloud-report-a)[Upgrade Security Now ‚ûù](https://thehackernews.uk/zscaler-secure-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **whoAMI Attack Exploits AWS AMI Name Confusion for Remote Code Execution** ‚Äî A new type of name confusion attack called [whoAMI](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/new-whoami-attack-exploits-aws-ami-name.html) allows anyone who publishes an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with a specific name to gain code execution within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Datadog, which detailed the attack, said roughly 1% of organizations monitored by the company were affected by the whoAMI, and that it found public examples of code written in Python, Go, Java, Terraform, Pulumi, and Bash shell using the vulnerable criteria. AWS told The Hacker News that there is no evidence of malicious exploitation of the security weakness.
* **RansomHub Targets Over 600 Orgs Globally** ‚Äî The RansomHub ransomware operation has [targeted over 600 organizations across the world](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/ransomhub-becomes-2024s-top-ransomware.html), spanning sectors such as healthcare, finance, government, and critical infrastructure, making it one of the most active cybercrime groups in 2024. One such attack has been found to weaponize now-patched security flaws in Microsoft Active Directory and the Netlogon protocol to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to a victim network's domain controller as part of their post-compromise strategy.
* **REF7707 Uses Outlook Drafts for Command-and-Control** ‚Äî A previously undocumented threat activity cluster dubbed [REF7707](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/finaldraft-malware-exploits-microsoft.html) has been observed using a remote administration tool named FINALDRAFT that parses commands stored in the mailbox's drafts folder and writes the results of the execution into new draft emails for each command. It makes use of the Outlook email service via the Microsoft Graph API for command-and-control (C2) purposes. The group has been observed targeting the foreign ministry of an unnamed South American nation, as well as a telecommunications entity and a university, both located in Southeast Asia.
* **Kimsuky Embraces ClickFix-Style Attack Strategy** ‚Äî The North Korean threat actor known as [Kimsuky](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-hackers-exploit-powershell.html) (aka Black Banshee) is using a new tactic that involves deceiving targets into running PowerShell as an administrator and then instructing them to paste and run malicious code provided by them. "To execute this tactic, the threat actor masquerades as a South Korean government official and over time builds rapport with a target before sending a spear-phishing email with an [sic] PDF attachment," Microsoft said. Users are then convinced to click on a URL, urging them to register their device in order to read the PDF attachment. The end goal of the attack is to establish a data communication mechanism that allows the adversary to exfiltrate data.
* **Law Enforcement Op Takes Down 8Base** ‚Äî A consortium of law enforcement agencies has [arrested](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/8base-ransomware-data-leak-sites-seized.html) four Russian nationals and seized over 100 servers linked to the 8Base ransomware gang. The arrests were made in Thailand. Two of the suspects are accused of operating a cybercrime group that used Phobos ransomware to victimize more than 1,000 public and private entities in the country and across the world. The development comes in the aftermath of a series of high-profile ransomware disruptions associated with Hive, LockBit, and BlackCat in recent years. Late last year, Evgenii Ptitsyn, a 42-year-old Russian national believed to be the administrator of the Phobos ransomware, was extradited to the U.S.
