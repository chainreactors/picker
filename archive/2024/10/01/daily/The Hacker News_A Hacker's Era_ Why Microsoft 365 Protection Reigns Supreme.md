Imagine a sophisticated cyberattack cripples your organization's most critical productivity and collaboration tool — the platform you rely on for daily operations. In the blink of an eye, hackers encrypt your emails, files, and crucial business data stored in Microsoft 365, holding it hostage using ransomware. Productivity grinds to a halt and your IT team races to assess the damage as the clock ticks down on a ransom demand that threatens to destroy your data forever. How did this happen, and more importantly, how can you prevent it from happening?

Microsoft 365 (M365) is the lifeblood of countless organizations worldwide, offering a seamless, cloud-based platform for communication, collaboration and data management. Over 400 million users rely on Microsoft 365 for everything from document creation and management to video conferencing1. While M365 has empowered businesses to undergo digital transformation and remain competitive with its support for distributed, hybrid and remote working environments, its ubiquity and integration have made it a prime target for cybercriminals.

In this article, we examine the vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365 and discuss how proactive data protection strategies, which leverage **[dedicated third-party backup solutions like Backupify](https://www.backupify.com/request-demo/?utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=701Rp00000EJ1oU)**, allow businesses to strengthen their defenses against the growing threat of ransomware and other cyber risks.

## Why is M365 an attractive target?

Understanding why Microsoft 365 is so attractive to attackers is crucial to fortifying your defenses. Here's what makes Microsoft 365 a focal point for cybercriminals:

### **Mass adoption**

Microsoft 365 is one of the most widely used cloud-based productivity platforms today. Its widespread usage also means that a successful attack can potentially impact millions of organizations, making it a lucrative target for malicious actors. Cybercriminals can use various methods, such as phishing, brute force attacks and credential stuffing, to exploit weak points and gain unauthorized access.

### **Integrated services**

Microsoft 365 integrates various services, such as Outlook, SharePoint, Teams and OneDrive, creating a complete ecosystem for users. While this enhances productivity and collaboration, it also broadens the attack surface for cybercriminals with multiple entry points. If threat actors compromise one service, such as a user's email account, they could gain access to the entire suite.

### **User-centered attacks**

Cybercriminals often focus on users, who are frequently the weakest link in any cybersecurity strategy. Phishing attacks are designed to deceive users into revealing their login credentials or installing malicious software. Once a single user's account is compromised — especially an administrator account — the attacker can gain elevated permissions, potentially allowing them to access the organization's entire data repository, leading to data theft, unauthorized data manipulation and even full-scale ransomware attacks. In 2023, over 68 million messages were linked to Microsoft products and branding, positioning it as the most exploited brand by threat actors that year2.

### **Valuable data in the cloud**

On average, a terabyte of cloud storage contains over 6,000 files with sensitive information3. Microsoft 365 stores large volumes of sensitive business data, including financial records, intellectual property and personal information, making it an ideal target for ransomware attacks.

### **Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs)**

Like any software, Microsoft 365 is susceptible to CVEs, including zero-day exploits, where attackers can exploit unknown or unpatched security gaps. Cybercriminals actively look for such weaknesses to infiltrate systems before organizations have a chance to protect themselves.

Microsoft 365's large and complex environment makes it more susceptible to these kinds of threats since managing and patching vulnerabilities across such an extensive platform can be challenging for organizations. A successful zero-day exploit can provide cybercriminals with unauthorized access, enabling them to launch further attacks or exfiltrate data.

Microsoft has had over 1,200 software vulnerabilities over the past four years4. Elevation of privilege has consistently been the top vulnerability category each year.

## Critical errors weakening Microsoft 365 security

Although Microsoft 365 is a robust platform, certain end-user shortcomings can make it vulnerable to security risks.

1. **Weak or reused passwords:** Many users rely on weak or reused passwords across multiple accounts, making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts through brute-force attacks and credential stuffing. Once a weak password is cracked, attackers can gain access to sensitive information, impersonate users or even escalate their privileges within the organization.
2. **Lack of multifactor authentication (MFA):** In addition to a user's password, MFA requires a one-time verification code or biometric data for authentication. While MFA provides an effective defense against unauthorized access, many organizations do not enforce MFA for their Microsoft 365 accounts. This leaves user accounts vulnerable to compromise, especially in cases where passwords are stolen or guessed. As per the Great SaaS Data Exposure report, 55% of super admin accounts and 44% of privile...
