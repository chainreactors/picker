## IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we proposed and verified various aspects of an HDR subjective testing workflow. This includes the evaluation of various factors such as brightness, colour, display, signal, viewing conditions, and HDR intermediate file conversions for encoding. We conducted experiments to investigate the behaviour of different display technologies in terms of sustained brightness and its variability across window sizes. We observed substantial differences in HDR performance among consumer-level TV models that can affect the presentation and perception of HDR content. However, accounting for all these factors in an experimental environment is accompanied by high costs and is a non-trivial process.
