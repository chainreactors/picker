* README

This is a writeup of my `.nupkg` golfing process for BGGP 5.

## Abstract

This year, BGGP 5's theme is "Download".
The goal is fetching the file over at `https://binary.golf/5/5` and showing its content on the screen.
I wanted to do something .NET related but C# is only valid as a PE executable (and the C/assembly gang is going to win that one).
I vaugely recalled the cool research of [IAmRoot by C. Augusto Proiete](https://github.com/augustoproiete/i-am-root-nuget-package), which lets you run code once a 'malicious' nuget package is installed.
So we're targeting Visual Studio's nuget client :)

## Submitted Artifact

The submitted `.nupkg` file consists of 3 'formats', each needed to be golf'd:

1. A C# expression (This is the actual code to download + show the `5` file)
2. Two XML files. One of them contains the C# expr.
3. A Zip file containing both XML files.
