API attacks are on the rise. One of their major targets is eCommerce firms like yours.

APIs are a vital part of how eCommerce businesses are accelerating their growth in the digital world.

ECommerce platforms use APIs at all customer touchpoints, from displaying products to handling shipping. Owing to their increased use, APIs are attractive targets for hackers, as the following numbers expose:

* API attack traffic increased by [681% in 2021](https://venturebeat.com/business/report-681-increase-in-api-attacks-for-customers-in-2021/)
* 77% of retail respondents experienced API security incidents in 2021– according to [Noname security](https://nonamesecurity.com/api-security-disconnect-ecommerce-sector)

If left unaddressed, API abuse can damage your reputation, harm consumers, and affect the bottom line. Hence [**API security**](https://www.indusface.com/blog/introduction-to-apptranas-enhanced-api-protection/?utm_source=thehackernews-sponsored-article&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thehackernews-ecommerce-api) is worthy of consideration for eCommerce stakeholders.

## **Why do eCommerce companies need APIs?**

API makes it easy for retailers and eCommerce platforms to handle product listings and orders. It transformed the static website into a completely customizable headless store. Retailers use APIs for various functions, including login, product catalog, shipping, and subscription.

It empowers businesses to enhance customer experience. While making purchases, one service handles orders; another calculates tax; another enables shipping, and so on.

But customers have no idea what is happening behind the screen. API connects these decoupled elements and helps to share data seamlessly.

#### **Key benefits of APIs in eCommerce**

* It streamlines operations and ensures seamless customer engagements
* It is effective for data monitoring and analytics, a vibrant factor for retailers
* It enables communication with chatbots
* Connects eCommerce platform with 3rd party marketplaces

## **Why Is API Security Crucial for Ecommerce?**

APIs are easy to use and integrate for businesses. Even though most APIs are not intended for public use, they often have full access to all sensitive assets and information.

Customers enter PII while purchasing on online sites like emails, passwords, credit card details, and phone numbers. They also share transaction details like bonuses, balances, and rewards. This increases the opportunity for attackers to steal the data.

They are easy to expose if not designed and tuned for robust, ongoing security. Inadequate security testing and a lack of business logic have resulted in an overall rise in API security risks.

Important factors that drive API security concerns are

#### **Authentication Flaw**

Many APIs not properly checking if the request comes from a legitimate user. Hackers find coding errors in authentication and escalate privileges. They further use enumerated technologies to compromise users' accounts.

For instance, some eCommerce platforms integrate with external logistics systems to pass on shipping details. In this situation, if there is an insufficient authentication chain, API can leak PII via replay attacks.

#### **Automated Attacks**

Automated attacks on insecure APIs are increasing with the widespread adoption of APIs. Rather than exploiting vulnerabilities in APIs code, hackers exploit business logic flaws within APIs.

They may feed malicious scripts into bots to access your product details at scale.

With bad bots overwhelming your site, your genuine user cannot shop on your site. For example, they can snatch the complete inventory of high-demand products within seconds.

Volumetric attacks against eCommerce API without rate limiting (#4 in [**OWASP API Security Top 10**](https://www.indusface.com/blog/critical-owasp-top-10-api-security-threats/?utm_source=thehackernews-sponsored-article&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thehackernews-ecommerce-api)) can cause shopping apps non-responsive, resulting in user dissatisfaction.

#### **Shadow and Zombie APIs**

Still, many businesses struggle to separate real transactions from fake. They are also blindsided by unprotected shadow APIs.

Equally, Zombie APIs are the most common method of attack. Zombie APIs may longer be unmonitored. They can contain malicious codes or may expose sensitive data or functionality.

#### **Third-party APIs**

E-commerce businesses integrate with 3rd parties like shipping and payment systems. Third-party APIs are challenging to manage. These are the ones that attackers typically target.

For example, shopping cart API is a prime target as it offers entry points into the business. A leading UK retailer experienced attacks more than 1000 times a day on this API. The attack increased 10-fold times when special offers were running.

#### **Traditional Security Tools**

Most businesses lack adequate defense capabilities to protect against the ever-evolving API risks. API threats are highly sophisticated and persistent, and traditional methods are ineffective against them.

Legacy WAF or API gateways need more real-time ability to understand bad from good API activity.

Hackers can manipulate the discount and promotion APIs during peak times. These tools find it hard to protect against such attacks.
