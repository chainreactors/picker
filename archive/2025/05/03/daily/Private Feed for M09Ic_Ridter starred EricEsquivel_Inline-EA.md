# Inline-EA

Inline-EA is a Beacon Object File (BOF) to execute .NET assemblies in your current Beacon process.
This tool was built to bypass the latest Elastic at the time of making, version 8.17.4. This tool also works against CrowdStrike Falcon and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).

## Features

* Load necessary CLR DLLs using LoadLibraryShim to evade ICLRRuntimeInfo::GetInterface callstack detections
* Load a console from backed memory by using APCs
* Bypass AMSI by patching clr.dll instead of amsi.dll to avoid common detections
* Bypass ETW by EAT Hooking advapi32.dll!EventWrite to point to a function that returns right away
* Patches System.Environment.Exit to prevent Beacon process from exiting

## Usage

You can compile by going into the `src/` directory and running `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c main.cpp -o inline-ea.x64.o`.
