# Best Practices for Implementing HIPAA-Compliant Marketing in Healthcare

November 27th, 2024

Marketing in the healthcare industry is entering a transformative era, spearheaded by advancements in secure communications and personalization. Leveraging PHI (Protected Health Information) within HIPAA-compliant communications opens new doors for healthcare companies looking to improve the results of their marketing campaigns: enabling highly targeted, engaging, and, consequently, more effective communication strategies.

Following best practices for implementing HIPAA-compliant marketing campaigns not only safeguards secure patients’ data, and their right to privacy, but it also drives better results by addressing an individual’s individual needs and particular condition.

Let’s take a look at the role personalization plays in implementing successful HIPAA-compliant marketing campaigns, as well as other key strategies for both securing PHI and fully harnessing its use for deeper patient engagement—and better results.

### **The Power of Personalization in Healthcare Marketing**

In healthcare, unlike most other industries, personalization isn’t just about getting products and services in front of those most likely to purchase them—it’s about driving better health outcomes for patients. Ultimately, a patient engaging with a communication from a healthcare company could improve their well-being, enhance their quality of life, or even prolong or *save* their life.

Personalization is so effective because people, particularly when it comes to their healthcare provision, *need* to feel heard and understood, and they need to communicate on their own terms, on the channel of their choice. In support of this, research has shown that personalized emails can result in *six* times higher transaction rates than generic messages. Subsequently, a report by McKinsey revealed that [personalization can reduce customer acquisition costs by as much as 50 percent, lift revenues by 5 to 15 percent, and increase marketing ROI by 10 to 30 percent](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/mckinsey%20explainers/what%20is%20personalization/what-is-personalization.pdf). In other words, in committing to helping their patients and customers maintain and improve their health, providers, suppliers, and payers will also attain their revenue and growth objectives.

For healthcare organizations, HIPAA-compliant marketing best practices are the foundation for achieving these results. By securely and effectively incorporating PHI into your marketing efforts, you can create campaigns that are deeply personal to each patient and consistently encourage engagement.

### **Key Factors for HIPAA-Compliant Marketing Campaigns**

Implementing impactful marketing campaigns in healthcare requires meticulous attention to HIPAA compliance regulations. Here are the key factors to consider before including PHI in your communications:

* **Understand HIPAA’s Compliance Rules**: first and foremost, you *must* ensure anyone who handles patient data in your organization is well-versed in HIPAA’s [privacy](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html) and [security](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html) rules. Most importantly of all, this includes understanding what constitutes PHI (or electronic PHI (ePHI) and when it can be used or disclosed.
* **Obtain Proper Authorization**: before using a patient’s data in communication it’s crucial to get their consent in writing.
* **Implement** **Access** **Control**: you can’t overlook the core cybersecurity concept of controlling *who* has access to PHI in your organization. Only grant access to PHI to personnel who need to handle it as part of their job role—and only provide access to the data they need, i.e., data minimization, and only for as long as they need it.
* **Audit Trails and Reporting**: a key requirement for achieving HIPAA compliance is maintaining detailed logs to document PHI movement and usage. Such reporting is indispensable in the case of a data breach—particularly when it comes to insider threats, i.e., the intentional (e.g., corporate espionage) or unintentional (human error) exposure of sensitive data.
* **Encryption Standards**: PHI must be encrypted during storage, i.e., at rest,  and when being sent, i.e., in transit to mitigate risks of unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
* **Third-Party Vendor Compliance**: Ensure that all vendors involved in your marketing process are HIPAA-compliant by having them sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).
* **Secure Platforms**: HIPAA-compliant solutions, such as LuxSci Secure Healthcare Communications Suite, take care of a lot of the aforementioned factors for you—saving you significant time and, subsequently, expense in implementing marketing campaigns that effectively harness PHI.

### **Best Practices for Success in HIPAA-Compliant Marketing in Healthcare**

Now that we’ve covered the compliance-related aspects of implementing HIPAA-compliant marketing in healthcare, let’s move on to the more practical aspects of crafting effective engagement campaigns.

#### **1. Leverage Segmentation and Automation**

Use PHI to segment your audience based on criteria such as their demographic characteristics, medical history, appointment behaviour, current conditions, etc. This ensures that patients with similar profiles receive the most relevant communications. Better yet, combine your segmentation with automation to streamline the engagement process. This includes sending timely appointment reminders, health advice, new product offers, and follow-up messages as part of an ongoing healthcare journey. LuxSci Secure Marketing supports hyper-segmentation and automated workflows, enabling efficient and personalized patient outreach with integrated workflows to drive efficiency and speed.

#### **2. Focus on Value-Based Messaging**

Your content should *always* seek to provide tangible value: the recipient should always gain something from your communications. This could be educational materials, appointment reminders, preventive care, event information, new services, etc. Patients are more likely to engage with communications that benefit them and directly improve their individual health outcomes. At best, you want your patients and customers to *look forward* to receiving your emails

#### **3. Use Advanced Analytics**

Analyze the performance of your campaign through metrics like click-through rates (CTRs), conversion rates, deliverability, and engagement levels. LuxSci customers, for instance, often exceed industry averages, with some achieving CTRs more than double the norm and best-in-class deliverability of 97 percent or more. The insights gained from advanced analytics and reporting will allow you to refine your strategies and improve the rate of engagement in your campaigns.

#### **4. Integrate with Existing Systems**

Leverage the PHI that resides in your other applications by integrating your marketing communication with your organisation’s Customer Engagement Platforms (CEPs), Customer Data Platforms (CDPs), and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems. This ensures that your campaigns align with patient records and a fill view of data, to optimize their accuracy and relevance. LuxSci’s solutions integrate with platforms like Redpoint Global and Snowflake for streamlined data management and workflows.

#### **5. Maintain a Patient-Centric Approach**

Above all, always prioritize the patient and customer experience—keeping them at the forefront of your strategies and campaign objectives. This includes ensuring content quality and clarity, respecting communica...
