Ever been to a magic show, or even watched one on TV? There is this one trick that works every time – when the magician pulls million things out of a hat – handkerchiefs in many colors, pigeon, bunny, flowers… where could all those things be stored? The stage is empty and the hat is obviously too small… while a magic show is based on entertaining deceptions, running successful business is based (amongst other things) on retrieving the essential data, analyzing it and process it correctly. In that sense, the Open Items List report is a bit like the magician's hat – although it looks plain it holds many different reports in it that are enhanced by newly added columns:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/02_10_2022_1.png)

The newly available columns are not displayed in the report by default – you need to make the relevant columns visible in the 'Form Settings' window. Different document types may have different new columns available. In the above example, you can see the columns that can be added when generating the repot for A/R Invoices; When creating the report for sales order, purchase order, return request, and goods return request – the column 'Approved' is available as well, but none of them are available when running the report for 'Missing Items'.

For the complete list of newly added columns for the various report options check the [What's New](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESS_ONE_VERSION_FOR_SAP_HANA/9b8695612d1e4844a664caa781111833/a1df3a53a856824de10000000a423f68.html?locale=en-US) document.

Available in SAP Business One 10.0, and SAP Business One 10.0, version for SAP HANA. This tip and all the other tips are available in the [SAP Community](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/tipoftheweek/) You can also visit the [Implementation Arena](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/04/01/sap-business-one-implementation-arena/) for useful implementation tips.
