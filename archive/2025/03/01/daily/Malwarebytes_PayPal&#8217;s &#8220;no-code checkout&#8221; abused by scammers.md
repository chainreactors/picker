# PayPal’s “no-code checkout” abused by scammers

Posted: February 27, 2025
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

We recently identified a new scam targeting PayPal customers with very convincing ads and pages. Crooks are abusing both Google and PayPal’s infrastructure in order to trick victims calling for assistance to speak with fraudsters instead.

Combining official-looking Google search ads with specially-crafted PayPal pay links, makes this scheme particularly dangerous on mobile devices due to their screen size limitation and likelihood of not having [security software](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus).

## Overview

Scammers are creating ads impersonating PayPal from various advertiser accounts that may have been hacked. The ad displays the official website for PayPal, yet is completely fraudulent.

A weakness within Google’s policies for [landing pages](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/14086?sjid=15226630576880578071-NC) (also known as [final URLs](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6080568?sjid=8934865850450445437-NA)), allows anyone to impersonate popular websites so long as the landing page and display URL (the webpage shown in an ad) share the same domain.

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/image_f4799b.png)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/image_f4799b.png)

The page victims are directed to has the following format:

```
paypal.com/ncp/payment/[unique ID]
```

This is PayPal’s “no-code checkout”, a [feature](https://developer.paypal.com/studio/checkout/no-code) for merchants to have a simple and yet secure option to take payments:

> Small businesses that want to accept payments online or in person can set up pay links, buttons, and [QR codes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code) to accept payments on the website. You don’t need a developer, coding knowledge, or a website to accept payments

Essentially, crooks are abusing this feature to create a bogus pay link. They can customize the page by creating various fields with text designed to trick users, such as promoting a fraudulent phone number as “PayPal Assistance”.

## Mobile experience

Phones are the best medium for this type of scams due to the device’s constraints, but more than anything because that’s how victims will get in touch with bogus tech support agents.

In the screenshot below taken on an iPhone, we can see the top sponsored result from a Google search is impersonating PayPal. During our investigation, we often encountered more than one malicious ad, although they redirected to different kinds of pages, not abusing the same scheme.

Due to the reduced screen size, it would require scrolling past the ads and the [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) Overview to see organic search results. This is not a coincidence of course, and is why search advertising is worth [billions of dollars](https://www.seroundtable.com/alphabet-google-ad-revenue-72-38856.html).

Screen size plays a factor again when users click on the ad and look at the browser’s address bar correctly identifying that the site is “**paypal.com**“. As we saw above, pay links are on the same domain as *paypal.com*, from whi...
