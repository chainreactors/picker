![Locking Down Your WordPress Login Page](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Locking-Down-Your-WordPress-Login-Page-820x385.png)

Due to its flexibility, ease of use, and massive plugin ecosystem, WordPress is a favorite among bloggers, developers, and businesses alike. Given its popularity, attackers do not waste time guessing where sensitive assets live. By default, on every WordPress site the front door is conveniently labeled `/wp‐login.php` or `/wp‐admin/`. On even a modest site, server logs can often reveal hundreds of failed logins coming from residential proxies and botnets that rotate addresses. Once a single credential is cracked an attacker could install a malicious plugin, add a backdoor, inject SEO spam, or turn the site into a drive-by malware host, damaging reputation, search rankings, and revenue in one hit.

## How secure is the WordPress login page?

WordPress ships with essential security features right out of the box. Still, those built-in defenses often aren’t sufficient to stop persistent attackers. The default login page can be exposed to several threats, including:

* [Brute force attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-brute-force-attack/)
* [Credential stuffing](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/06/3-password-attacks-101.html#:~:text=spraying%20will%20work.-,Credential%20Stuffing,-To%20summarize%20credential)
* [Phishing attempts](https://sucuri.net/guides/phishing-attacks/)
* [Man-in-the-middle attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-broken-access-control/)

For stronger protection, you’ll need to move past the defaults and add extra security layers.

## 10 defensive layers for WordPress login security

Below we’ll go over how attackers target the login page, then walk through some configurations that help close the most common gaps like strong credentials, two-factor authentication, rate limiting, and real-time monitoring.

1. [Use high-entropy passwords everywhere](#step-1)
2. [Move the login URL to a non-default path](#step-2)
3. [Enforce strict limits on failed logins](#step-3)
4. [Require 2FA for all privileged users](#step-4)
5. [Challenge suspicious sessions with CAPTCHA](#step-5)
6. [Harden wp-config.php against post-exploitation tampering](#step-6)
7. [Obscure author usernames from public view](#step-7)
8. [Remove dormant or unknown user accounts](#step-8)
9. [Purge unused plugins and themes](#step-9)
10. [Patch WordPress core, plugins, and themes immediately](#step-10)

### 1. Use high-entropy passwords everywhere

#### Threat context

Credential stuffing campaigns rely on the fact that users reuse passwords across services. Phishing kits and info-stealers dump millions of credentials daily. Attackers feed those lists into scripts that target `/wp-login.php` looking for credential matches.

#### Protective actions

* Generate passwords of at least 16 random characters. Passphrases are fine if the total entropy is comparable (for example, six random dictionary words separated by symbols).
* Store them in a reputable password manager. Browser autofill alone is insufficient because malware routinely extracts saved credentials.
* For service accounts, create unique API keys where possible instead of shared passwords.
* Audit the server for configuration files containing plaintext passwords and remove them.

#### Verification

Run the following on Linux to identify hard-coded passwords:

```
sudo grep -Eai 'pass(word)?\s*=\s*["'\''][^"'\'']{0,11}' -R /var/www/html
```

If anything shows up, change it immediately and replace the hard-coded password in the source file/config with an environment variable or pull from a secrets manager.

#### Common pitfalls

* Do not rely on simple substitutions (P@ssw0rd! is not safer than Password1!).
* Avoid baseline policies that cap passwords at twelve characters. Instead, *raise* the limit.

### 2. Move the login URL to a non-default path

#### Threat context

Commodity scanners are designed to check the default login paths, so use a non‑default path to reduce exposure to scanners that only look for defaults. It doesn’t stop a targeted attacker, but it filters out a massive wave of commoditized scanners.
