Security questionnaires aren't just an inconvenience — they're a recurring problem for security and sales teams.

They bleed time from organizations, filling the schedules of professionals with monotonous, automatable work. But what if there were a way to reduce or even altogether eliminate security questionnaires? The root problem isn't a lack of great questionnaire products — it's the questionnaires themselves.

At SafeBase, we don't just talk about transparency — it's core to everything we do, from how we build our products to how we communicate about them. In the spirit of transparency, in this piece we're going to talk about our [Trust Center platform](https://safebase.io/products/trust-center?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organicarticle&utm_content=Trust+Center+platform) at length:

* Why we're believers in Trust Centers > security questionnaires
* How a Trust Center reduces and eliminates questionnaires
* How to demonstrate the ROI of investing in a Trust Center

Let's dive in.

## Why a trust center first approach helps

Solving the questionnaire problem means going beyond the questionnaire with a [Trust Center](https://safebase.io/resources/what-is-a-trust-center?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organicarticle&utm_content=What+is+a+trust+center%3F).

Trust Centers are built to replace questionnaires. While Trust Centers may work with and support questionnaire functions — like ours do at SafeBase — the purpose of a Trust Center is to offer a long-term solution for security questionnaires.

The labor and budget costs spent on security questionnaires alone can cost as much as a full-time employee (and in many cases more). For any enterprise or scaling organization, security assessments are a tremendous cost center and increase deal lead times for business.

Most organizations believe the solution for all of the redundancy and investment in questionnaires is making questionnaires easier. What does this mean? Creating workaround fixes for less painful questionnaires which, even with AI, present a bounty of problems:

* Need for human intervention or oversight
* Difficult to scale and expensive to outsource
* Lack of trust in AI solutions with sensitive information

Trust Centers suggest an alternative to the security questionnaire process i.e. solve the real problem. Yes, it's important to have capabilities to handle security questionnaires as a "last mile" support option. However, the long-term problem reduction begins with a comprehensive Trust Center platform.

## How SafeBase reduces the security questionnaire burden

Cut friction. If there were two words to describe how trust centers (built by SafeBase) reduce the burden of security questionnaires, these would be them. Thankfully, we have more than two words.

SafeBase takes traditionally repetitive steps in the security review process — documentation requests, access and approval of sharing said communication, responses to questionnaires — then either simplifies or automates them. No more unnecessary back and forth. No more redundancy. No more compromising security integrity under the guise of obscurity.

So how do we achieve this in our platform?

### 1. Move beyond questionnaires with Trust Centers

Security questionnaires get the Band-Aid treatment. Organizations have traditionally pursued cures for the symptoms: *"How can we make questionnaires more manageable/less intrusive/less dreadful?"* This status quo approach can remedy some of the short-term issues — time spent per questionnaire, management and organization, etc. — but fails to ask the question, *"Why are we having to do this in the first place?"*

Rather than accept security questionnaires as a necessary evil, SafeBase aims to make security questionnaires a pain of the past. Our Trust Center-first approach reduces inbound questionnaires by 74% or more. Some customers, like [Crossbeam](https://safebase.io/case-studies/crossbeam?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organicarticle&utm_content=crossbeam+case+study), experience up to a 98% reduction.

Trust centers operate as a source of truth for both sales and security teams, plus external customers and partners. Shifting the security review process from request-driven to self-serve-driven, Trust Centers help buyers understand an organization's security posture and enable quick, yet secure information sharing.

The right trust center takes the guesswork out of security reviews while providing the flexibility you need to appropriately manage access to security information/documentation. Look for functionality like:

* Automated NDA signing
* Magic links for credential-free/passwordless access
* Automated access workflows like auto and bulk invites, and expiration dates with auto-alerts
* Permission profiles for granular governance
* Automated document watermarking
* Change logs for visibility (and audit season!)
* Support for SCIM and SAML protocols

Organizations that don't address the security questionnaire problem at its foundation will continue to play a short-term, highly reactive, labor-intensive game. Trust Centers are the step toward trans...
