# Why it's time for AppSec to embrace AI: How PortSwigger is leading the charge

![AI logo header](/cms/images/0a/a5/2670-article-appsec_embrace_ai_header.png)

AI is rapidly gaining traction in virtually every industry. But in AppSec, it's often met with a healthy skepticism, viewed by some as a useless gimmick at best or, at the other end of the scale, a major security concern.

This skepticism is understandable. We’ve all been subjected to an onslaught of AI-powered features over the past year that offer little value beyond providing clickbait fodder for marketing departments. Security testing also inherently relies on interacting with potentially destructive functionality and highly sensitive data. As a result, some organizations are hesitant to allow the use of AI tools in [pentesting](/solutions/penetration-testing) engagements, fearing a loss of control or accidental exposure of this sensitive information.

But avoiding AI altogether isn’t the answer. In fact, it’s a risk in itself.

At PortSwigger, we believe AI has the power to transform penetration testing—not by replacing human testers, but by augmenting them. That’s why [we’ve recently released Burp AI, the first AI-enhanced functionality for Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/blog/welcome-to-the-next-generation-of-burp-suite-elevate-your-testing-with-burp-ai), not as a gimmick or a response to hype, but to pave the way for creating the power tools that will make pentesters even better at what they do.

## A familiar pattern of innovation

We’ve seen this story play out countless times before.

A hundred years ago, for example, carpenters relied on hand tools. The introduction of power tools didn’t make carpenters obsolete—it made them faster, more accurate, and more efficient. Today, no one questions whether a carpenter should use a drill instead of a hand auger; power tools are simply part of the job.

That’s the future we envision for AI in AppSec. AI assistance will become an ordinary, everyday part of the pentester’s toolkit. It won’t replace human expertise, but it will amplify it, helping you work smarter, faster, and with greater precision.

## Evolution, not revolution

This isn’t a revolution that eliminates pentesters, it’s an evolution that empowers them.

For decades, pentesters have automated parts of their workflow to improve efficiency. When I first created Burp Suite, it was because I was a lazy pentester. Just like everyone else, I found doing things manually was tedious, repetitive, and inherently error prone.

Burp Intruder was the first tool I built to augment my own workflow, allowing me to scale my testing exponentially, without spending hours scripting each test case I wanted to run. Today, it remains the ultimate power tool for custom, automated attacks and is relied on daily by over 80,000 web app pentesters in 17,000+ organizations across the globe.

I see AI as the next evolution of this idea.

## Invest your time and expertise where it matters most

Historically, the received wisdom in the industry was that around 50% of pentesting tasks could eventually be automated, while the other 50% required human intuition.

![Offload the most monotonous work](/cms/images/cb/4a/3f76-article-offload-monotonous-work.png)

With the almost unprecedented advances in AI technology in recent years, we believe that number can climb much higher—potentially up to 80%, allowing you to offload the most monotonous work, while keeping expert, human testers in control.

Burp AI will help pentesters:

* **Find vulnerabilities faster** thanks to the efficiency and accuracy provided by AI assistance.
* **Improve their accuracy** by reducing human error in complex, repetitive tasks.
* **Spend more time on creative problem-solving**, applying their time and expertise where it matters most—on the elements of a pentest that AI can’t reliably reproduce.

## We're not into gimmicks

We’ve made a conscious effort to try and avoid the mistakes we’ve seen in AI adoption elsewhere.

* **We’re not cashing in on the hype.** If we'd wanted to, we could have released superficial AI features a year ago, but they wouldn’t have delivered real value.
* **We’re not here to automate pentesting entirely.** Today's technology doesn't enable a fully autonomous hacking machine running on autopilot. It’s a human-AI partnership that enhances, rather than replaces, human intuition.
* **We’re not building an AI black box.** Instead of a disconnected engine that does "magic AI stuff” in the background, we’re integrating AI seamlessly into the workflows that testers already use.

We see this much like the introduction of driver assistance in modern vehicles—incre...
