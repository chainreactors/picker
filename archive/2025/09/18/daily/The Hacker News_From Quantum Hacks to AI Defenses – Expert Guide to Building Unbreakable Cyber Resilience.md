Quantum computing and AI working together will bring incredible opportunities. Together, the technologies will help us extend innovation further and faster than ever before. But, imagine the flip side, waking up to news that hackers have used a quantum computer to crack your company's encryption overnight, exposing your most sensitive data, rendering much of it untrustworthy.

And with your sensitive data exposed, where does that leave trust from your customers? And the cost to mitigate - if that is even possible with your outdated pre-quantum systems? According to IBM, cyber breaches are already hitting businesses with an average of $4.44 million per incident, and as high as $10.22 million in the US, but with quantum and AI working simultaneously, experts warn it could go much higher.

In 2025, nearly two-thirds of organizations see quantum computing as the biggest cybersecurity threat looming in the next 3-5 years, while 93% of security leaders are prepping for daily AI-driven attacks. If you're in tech, finance, healthcare, or any field handling big data, this isn't sci-fi—it's the storm brewing right now.

But what if you could get ahead of it? Build reliable systems with multiple layers of protection that keep your operations rock-solid? That's what our upcoming webinar, "[Building Trust and Resilience for the AI and Quantum 2.0 Era](https://thehacker.news/ai-quantum-resilience?source=article)," is all about.

It's a panel of top experts diving into the world where quantum meets AI, and how to make your infrastructure unbreakable. Happening soon—don't miss out. [Sign up for the Webinar now](https://thehacker.news/ai-quantum-resilience?source=article) and secure your spot today!

## The Risk Hiding in Quantum and AI Advances

Let's keep it real: Quantum 2.0 is exploding with cool stuff like super-fast computing, entanglement for instant communication, and sensors that see the unseen. Throw AI into the mix, and it's optimizing and analyzing everything from quantum systems to drug discovery to evolving everyday tech. Sounds awesome, right? But here's the flip side—these technology breakthroughs are also widening the door for cyber bad guys.

Quantum computers could render much of today's encryption useless, while AI makes attacks smarter and faster. Experts warn that AI-powered attacks are already growing in sophistication, and many security leaders believe quantum computing will dramatically increase future risks.

I've heard from pros in the field sharing nightmare stories: AI-driven phishing fools 60% of folks, just like old-school tricks, but now it's GenAI making fakes that look too real. And quantum? It's not decades away—threats like "harvest now, decrypt later" mean attackers are grabbing encrypted data today, waiting for quantum tech to unlock it. Without the right defenses, sectors like finance and healthcare could face chaos, losing data integrity and facing massive fines.

The good news? Solutions are available now that can protect you for Q-day and today.
