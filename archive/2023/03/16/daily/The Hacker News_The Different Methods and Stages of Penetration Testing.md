The stakes could not be higher for cyber defenders. With the vast amounts of sensitive information, intellectual property, and financial data at risk, the consequences of a data breach can be devastating. According to a report released by [Ponemon institute](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach), the cost of data breaches has reached an all-time high, averaging $4.35 million in 2022.

Vulnerabilities in web applications are often the primary gateway for attackers. According to [a World Economic Forum report](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf), just one week after discovering a critical security flaw in a widely used software library (Log4j), more than 100 attempts at exploiting the vulnerability were detected every minute. This illustrates how quickly malicious actors can take advantage of vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgency of regularly assessing and monitoring your system for any vulnerabilities or weak points.

The complexity of addressing security challenges in today's digital world is further compounded by the rising use of open-source components, accelerating software delivery cycles, and rapidly expanding attack surface.

One key way organizations can protect themselves from cyber threats is by conducting penetration tests. Pen testing is a proactive security measure that involves simulating real-life cyber-attacks on networks, servers, applications, and other systems to discover and address any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

## Which type of pen testing does my organization need?

Penetration testing is an essential tool for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security risks. It enables cyber defense teams to assess their environment's susceptibility to attack and determine the effectiveness of existing security measures.

Pen tests range from simple assessments to more complex, multi-stage engagements. Here are some of the more common types of pen testing:

* Network penetration testing: examines the organization's external and internal networks, as well as its software infrastructure, and wireless networks to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
* Web application and API penetration testing: focuses on web applications and looks for technical and business logic flaws in their design, code, or implementation against OWASP Top 10 that could be exploited by malicious attackers.
* Social engineering penetration testing: simulates a cyber-attack using social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails or phone calls, to gain access to an organization's confidential information.
* Physical penetration testing: evaluates physical security measures, such as access controls and CCTV systems, to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by attackers.
* Cloud penetration testing: evaluates the security of an organization's cloud infrastructure and applications.
* Mobile app penetration testing: analyzes the security of an organization's mobile applications, looking for mobile-specific security issues that could be used by attackers.

## Stages of the Pen Testing process

No matter the type of pen testing conducted, there are typically several stages to go through:

* Planning and scoping: involves defining the test objectives, determining the scope, and setting a timeline.
* Reconnaissance and foot printing: gathering information about the target systems and networks, such as open ports and services.
* Scanning and enumeration: gaining a better understanding of the target system, such as user accounts and services running.
* Exploiting any identified weaknesses: attempting to exploit any identified vulnerabilities.
* Post-testing analysis and reporting: analyzing the results, documenting any findings, and creating a report about the engagement.

Pen testing is an essential part of any organization's security strategy, and by understanding the different types of testing available as well as the stages of the process, organizations can ensure their systems are adequately protected against cyber threats.

## Why organizations should use PTaaS to prevent cyber-attacks

Traditional pen testing is a lengthy and labor-intensive process. It requires specialized and often laser-focused expertise to identify and exploit security flaws. Hiring, training, and retaining security professionals is costly, time-consuming, and challenging.

Moreover, point-in-time remediation does not ensure protection against future threats, leaving organizations exposed to risks.

The key lies in combining the power of automation with the hands-on involvement of expert security professionals.
