A new report from XM Cyber has found – among other insights - a *dramatic* gap between where most organizations focus their security efforts, and where the most serious threats actually reside.

The new report, Navigating the Paths of Risk: The State of Exposure Management in 2024, is based on hundreds of thousands of attack path assessments conducted by the [XM Cyber platform](https://xmcyber.com/platform/?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=xm-cyber-research) during 2023. These assessments uncovered over 40 million exposures that affected millions of business-critical assets. Anonymized data regarding these exposures was then provided to the Cyentia Institute for independent analysis. To read the full report, [check it out here](https://info.xmcyber.com/research-report-2024-state-of-exposure-management?utm_medium=sponsorarticle&utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=xm-cyber-research).

* Key findings on the types of exposures putting organizations at greatest risk of breach.
* The state of attack paths between on-prem and cloud networks.
* Top attack techniques seen in 2023.
* How to focus on what matters most, and remediate high-impact exposure risks to your critical assets.

The findings shine a critical light on the continuing over-emphasis on remediating CVEs in cybersecurity programs. In fact, XM Cyber found that *CVE-based vulnerabilities account for less than 1% of the average organizations' On-prem exposure landscape*. Even when factoring in high-impact exposures that present a risk of compromise to business-critical assets, these CVEs still represent only a small percentage (11%) of the exposure risk profile.

Where does the lion's share of risk actually lie? Let's dig deeper into the results:

## **CVEs: Not Necessarily Exposures**

When analyzing the On-premises infrastructure, of the vast majority of organizations (86%) the XM Cyber report found, not surprisingly, that remote code executable vulnerabilities accounted (as mentioned above) for less than 1% of all exposures and only 11% of critical exposures.

The research found that identity and credential misconfigurations represent a staggering 80% of security exposures across organizations, with a third of these exposures putting critical assets at direct risk of breach - a gaping attack vector actively being exploited by adversaries.

Thus, the report makes it clear that while patching vulnerabilities is important, it's not enough. More prevalent threats like attackers poisoning shared folders with malicious code (taint shared content) and using common local credentials on multiple devices expose a much larger share of critical assets (24%) compared to CVEs.

Thus, security programs need to extend far beyond patching CVEs. Good cyber hygiene practices and a focus on mitigating choke points and exposures like weak credential management are crucial.

## **Don't Sweat Dead Ends, Hunt High-Impact Choke Points**

Traditional security tries to fix every vulnerability, but XM Cyber's report shows that 74% of exposures are actually dead ends for attackers - offering them minimal onward or lateral movement. This makes these vulnerabilities, exposures, and misconfiguration less critical to your remediation efforts, allowing more time to focus on the real issues that present a validated threat to critical assets.

The remaining 26% of exposure discovered in the report would allow adversaries to propagate their attacks onward toward critical assets. The XM Cyber Attack Graph Analysis(™) identifies the key intersections where multiple attack paths toward critical assets converge as "choke points". The report highlights that only 2% of exposures reside on "choke points". Giving security teams a far smaller subset of high-impact exposures to focus their remediation efforts on. These "choke points" - are highlighted in yellow & red on the graph below. They are especially dangerous because compromising just one can expose a significant portion of critical assets. In fact, the report found that 20% of choke points expose 10% or more of critical assets. Thus, identifying attack paths and homing in on high-risk choke points can give defenders a bigger bang for their buck - reducing risk much more efficiently.
