# 8 security tips for small businesses

Posted: November 6, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Small businesses and startups are known to face some extra challenges when it comes to cybersecurity. Because they don’t have the size or budget to have a fully-fledged dedicated security team, it often comes down to one person that doesn’t have the time to do everything that is recommended or even required. Often security issues are just dealt with when the need arises.

There is the first issue right there. When the need arises, it’s often already too late. An infection has been found, a breach was discovered, or [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) has disabled systems or made files unretrievable.

Small businesses also often do not consider themselves to be a target, but you don’t have to be explicitly targeted to get breached or infected. Depending on how small your business is, the tips below may be more or less important in your circumstances and for your [threat model](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/101/2016/10/threat-modeling-what-are-you-so-afraid-of/), which will depend on the line of business that you are in.

## 1. Enable your staff

Your staff need to know what is expected of them, and what not to do.

* Make cybersecurity a company-wide issue, but also appoint a go-to person that has a responsibility, along with the time and the tools to perform that task.
* Train your employees in security awareness, so they can recognize [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts and know what they can and can’t do on company-issued hardware.
* Consider outsourcing time-consuming and specialized tasks. In the end this may turn out to be more cost-effective than trying to do it with your own staff.

## 2. Know your equipment

It’s important to be aware of your networking equipment, endpoints, and devices. Not only to know what needs to be protected, but also to know where weaknesses may lie.

* Pay special attention to devices that are used to [work from home (WFH)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/malwarebytes-news/2021/12/5-security-lessons-from-18-months-of-working-from-home/) or included in a [BYOD](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/101/2017/10/byod-why-dont-you/) program. Make it clear that mixing work and pleasure on the same device comes with security risks.
* Audit your environment on a regular basis, especially if you are a fast growing small business. That way you’ll know what you are using and what may need to be upgraded, replaced, or updated.

## 3. Get your patches and updates asap

Once you have established the hardware and software in your environment you need to perform effective patch and vulnerability management.

If having specialized software for this task or outsourcing it is not an option, it might be a good idea to keep an eye on the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/reports/2021/11/cisa-sets-two-week-window-for-patching-serious-vulnerabilities/) which is maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This catalog provides Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies with a list of vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited in the wild and gives the agencies a due date by when the vulnerability needs to be patched in their organization. Even if your organization isn’t a FCEB agency that needs to follow the Binding Operation Directive 22-01, the CISA list acts as a g...
