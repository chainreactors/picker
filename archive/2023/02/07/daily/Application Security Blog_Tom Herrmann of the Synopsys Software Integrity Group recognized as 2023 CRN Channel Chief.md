Tom Herrmann, vice president of global channels and alliances at the Synopsys Software Integrity Group, has been named one of the [2023 Channel Chiefs](https://www.crn.com/channel-chiefs/cc2023.htm) by CRN, a brand of The Channel Company. CRN’s annual Channel Chiefs project recognizes the top IT channel vendor executives who continually demonstrate expertise, influence, and innovation in the channel.

Tom Herrmann is an accomplished executive who has successfully developed and led channel sales domestically and internationally over the last 21 years. Herrmann joined the Synopsys Software Integrity Group in February 2021 and established the global partner program. In 2022, CRN recognized Herrmann as a Channel Chief, and following that year, CRN also awarded the Synopsys Partner Program with a 5-star rating in the [Partner Program Guide](https://www.crn.com/partner-program-guide/ppg2022.htm).

“Earning the top industry accolade in back-to-back campaigns is incredibly special, and I am once again honored to be named a CRN Channel Chief,” said Herrmann. “In 2022, my focus shifted from building out the Synopsys Partner Program to expanding our ecosystem across the globe and deepening our relationships with individual partners. Looking ahead, there is a lot for our partners to be excited about, and I am eager to see the potential impact the strategic investments we’re making could have on their businesses.”

The 2023 CRN Channel Chief recognition comes after a year of exponential growth that helped solidify the Synopsys Partner Program as a critical centerpiece of the company’s global growth strategy. Over the last year, Herrmann expanded the partner organizations three-fold, made improvements to the program’s lead qualification process, and created tighter alignment with field teams. These improvements doubled partner-generated revenue year-over-year and drove an 80% win rate in customer deals involving a partner.
