## Another Supply Chain Vulnerability

ProPublica is [reporting](https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-digital-escorts-pentagon-defense-department-china-hackers):

> Microsoft is using engineers in China to help maintain the Defense Department’s computer systems—with minimal supervision by U.S. personnel—leaving some of the nation’s most sensitive data vulnerable to hacking from its leading cyber adversary, a ProPublica investigation has found.
>
> The arrangement, which was critical to Microsoft winning the federal government’s cloud computing business a decade ago, relies on U.S. citizens with security clearances to oversee the work and serve as a barrier against espionage and sabotage.
>
> But these workers, known as “digital escorts,” often lack the technical expertise to police foreign engineers with far more advanced skills, ProPublica found. Some are former military personnel with little coding experience who are paid barely more than minimum wage for the work.

This sounds bad, but it’s the way the digital world works. Everything we do is international, deeply international. Making anything US-only is hard, and often infeasible.

EDITED TO ADD: Microsoft has [stopped](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/microsoft-stop-using-engineers-china-tech-support-us-military-hegseth-orders-2025-07-18/) the practice.

Not infeasible, expensive. Underlying the deeply international nature of the digital world is a focus on profit margin maximisation and on commercial competition. This pressure then influences IT methodologies, processes and system designs toward lower cost and lower skill approaches that are simply not thought through.

About 8 years ago Microsoft realized that AWS had run away with all the cloud stuff on the classified side so they decided to port Azure to the high side, and they had a government customer up near Baltimore who wanted that, so they started the process. The first problem they ran into was that Azure was designed, from the beginning, to be run from Redmond. All of it reported back constantly on what it was doing. This was, of course, completely unacceptable to the government customer. But Microsoft didn’t want to fork Azure. So the first problem was adapting Azure so it could work air gapped. The next, and where I came in, was how to monitor Azure and deal with any issues. They certainly didn’t want to have to throw a team of cleared software devs on an airplane every time something happened, and the customer didn’t want to wait 2 days for the team to get there. Also, there weren’t any scifs in Redmond…

So I, and a couple other people were hired to learn the innards of Azure and act as the local support team. Worst case, we would figure out how to cleanse logs of any classified information to send to the engineers in Redmond.

I remember the first time I walked in to a meeting with the overall team in Redmond. I turned to my manager and asked “Can I ask how many of them are citizens?” “No.” “How many on H1s?” “Don’t know.”

Anyway I lasted about 3 months before every other week in Redmond got to be too much and we went our separate ways.

I will say that the Azure code I saw was extremely well documented, especially the clever bits.

Saw this coming 15 years ago when the US lost the ability to make PGA’s and other microcircuits for its *spy satellites!* The approach was hardware state “validation” versus hidden circuits… So, ya. This makes sense.

That this is international is only part of the problem. The second part is that these “escorts” were sold as actually accomplishing something, when they do not and cannot. I also have no doubt that Microsoft was fully aware of that and just wanted the money.

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Another serious Microsoft Vulnerability Hacked**

Just up in the news yesterday,

<https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/microsoft-sharepoint-hack-government-agencies-b2792934.html>

Is that US State agencies and thousands of servers running Microsoft Sharepoint have been attacked successfully via a Zero Day that MS has just issued a patch for only one version so far,

> *“By obtaining access to internal servers, the hackers may have been able to steal sensitive data from connected Outlook and Teams accounts, including passwords, as well as cryptographic keys to allow them back in. Cloud-based services are not thought to have been compromised.*
>
> Microsoft has already issued one patch to address the vulnerability but, **at the time of writing, two more versions of SharePoint were still awaiting custom patches of their own**.”

It appears that the vulnerability has been there for quite some time, as the attackers were clued up by a Microsoft patch,

> *“According to Marci McCarthy, spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the hack came after Microsoft fixed a security flaw in SharePoint earlier this month, which inadvertently alerted the hackers that they might be able to exploit a similar vulnerability.”*

To say the old quote,

“Once you have erred, no matter what you do, ‘you are damned if you do, and damned if you don’t’.”

Might seem to be ‘rubbing salt in’ but consider even Bill Gates once got upset because of the way Microsoft Software was full of vulnerabilities. So he changed the way things were done…

Maybe he should ‘pop back into the office to do the same again’.
