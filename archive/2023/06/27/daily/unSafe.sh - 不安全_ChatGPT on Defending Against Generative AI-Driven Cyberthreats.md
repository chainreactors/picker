We already know hackers are [using artificial intelligence](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/zero-day-exfiltration-using-chatgpt-prompts). Many companies are [banning the use of](https://fortune.com/2023/05/19/chatgpt-banned-workplace-apple-goldman-risk-privacy/) ChatGPT (for now). We think generative AI can unlock your employees’ efficiency and creativity beyond the ways tools like the personal computer, the Internet and mobile devices already have. Forcepoint has the [tools that will empower](https://www.forcepoint.com/) your employees to harness the power of tools like ChatGPT while keeping your organization’s critical data safe and secure.

In this five-part ChatGPT series, we asked ChatGPT about generative AI and its potential impact to cybersecurity. This fourth post dives into types of generative AI-based attacks and how to defend against them.

### Embracing ChatGPT While Protecting Your Data

**How can businesses mitigate each of these attacks/threats?**

To mitigate the threats posed by generative AI, businesses can adopt various strategies and best practices for each type of attack. Here are some recommendations for each attack/threat mentioned previously:

**1. Advanced phishing and spear-phishing (Text-based generative AI):**

* **​​​​​​​**Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
* ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Educate employees on how to recognize phishing emails and the importance of verifying the source before taking any action.
* Use email filtering and spam detection tools to block suspicious emails.
* Establish clear communication protocols for sensitive information sharing or financial transactions.​​​​​​​

**2.**​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​**Disinformation and reputational damage (Video-based generative AI):**

* Monitor social media, forums, and news sources for any potentially harmful or misleading content related to the business.
* Use AI-driven video analysis tools to detect deepfake videos.
* Develop a rapid response strategy to address disinformation and communicate the facts to stakeholders proactively.
* Foster transparency and trust with customers, employees, and the public to minimize the impact of disinformation campaigns.

**3. Voice phishing (vishing) and impersonation (Audio-based generative AI):**

* Educate employees on the potential risks of voice phishing and how to verify the caller's identity.
* Implement call authentication technologies and secure communication channels.
* Establish clear protocols for sharing sensitive information or conducting financial transactions over the phone.​​​​​​​

**4. Fake identities for social engineering (Graphical-based generative AI):**

* Train employees to recognize and report suspicious social media profiles and interactions.
* Monitor social media for fake profiles impersonating company employees or executives.
* Limit the information publicly available about employees, as this information can be exploited by attackers to create fake identities.

**For combined or multi-modal attacks:**

1. Develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that addresses the risks associated with various types of generative AI attacks.
2. Invest in AI-driven security solutions that can detect and counter AI-generated threats, such as deepfake detection or advanced phishing email analysis.
3. Encourage a strong security culture within the organization, emphasizing the importance of vigilance, communication, and reporting of any suspicious activity.
4. Regularly review and update security policies, procedures, and employee training to address emerging threats and evolving technologies.

​​​​​​​

By implementing these measures, businesses can better protect themselves against the risks associated with generative AI and ensure the responsible and secure use of AI technologies within their organization.
