DEF CON While AI was on everyone's lips in Las Vegas this week at the trio of security conferences in Sin City – BSides, Black Hat, AND DEF CON – there were a lot of people using the F-word too: fraud.

The plummeting cost of using AI, coupled with the increasing sophistication of deepfakes and electronic communications becoming the norm, means that we're likely facing a massive amount of machine-learning mayhem. Deloitte [estimates](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html) deepfake fraud will cost the US up to $40 billion by 2027, but everyone we've spoken to thinks that's an underestimation.

Sam Altman's [comment](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-fraud-crisis) last month that "AI has fully defeated most of the ways that people authenticate currently, other than passwords," has ruffled some feathers in the security industry, with various vendors selling software that they claim does just that. But others are more cautious about its capabilities.
