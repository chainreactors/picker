[![Sandworm Subgroup](data:image/png;base64... "Sandworm Subgroup")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZsI-LyZ3xvgG46FsmwlkEPJpeh8LHZqrOmmeog3VvVHjfPSeek3L0GCkyt0qJDFEleyAmaQ6intzgKrR3Jab46EbX64nDyBFOmyp4zQjj9ErFSrIhwqWJ67kKh5juB7JMGZOPHbmkDgA0c0WjNQLp4k04Z2yoJX1LfZ5AWFdA8e-iYEdFd6IunplnOzlH/s790-rw-e365/seashell.png)

A subgroup within the infamous Russian state-sponsored hacking group known as **Sandworm** has been attributed to a multi-year initial access operation dubbed BadPilot that stretched across the globe.

"This subgroup has conducted globally diverse compromises of Internet-facing infrastructure to enable Seashell Blizzard to persist on high-value targets and support tailored network operations," the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team [said](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/12/the-badpilot-campaign-seashell-blizzard-subgroup-conducts-multiyear-global-access-operation/) in a new report shared with The Hacker News ahead of publication.

The geographical spread of the initial access subgroup's targets include the whole of North America, several countries in Europe, as well as others, including Angola, Argentina, Australia, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.

The development marks a significant expansion of the hacking group's victimology footprint over the past three years, which is otherwise known to be concentrated around Eastern Europe -

* 2022: Energy, retail, education, consulting, and agriculture sectors in Ukraine
* 2023: Sectors in the United States, Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East that provided material support to the war in Ukraine or were geopolitically significant
* 2024: Entities in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom

Sandworm is tracked by Microsoft under the moniker Seashell Blizzard (formerly Iridium), and by the broader cybersecurity community under the names APT44, Blue Echidna, FROZENBARENTS, Grey Tornado, Iron Viking, Razing Ursa, Telebots, UAC-0002, and Voodoo Bear. Active since at least 2013, the group is assessed to be affiliated with Unit 74455 within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU).

The adversarial collective has been [described](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/ukraine-targeted-in-cyberattack.html) by Google-owned Mandiant as a "highly adaptive" and "operationally mature" threat actor that engages in espionage, attack, and influence operations. It also has a track record of mounting [disruptive and destructive attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/russian-hackers-sandworm-cause-power.html) against Ukraine over the past decade.

Campaigns mounted by Sandworm in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian war have leveraged data wipers ([KillDisk](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-wiper-malware-targeting-ukraine.html) aka HermeticWiper), pseudo-ransomware ([Prestige](https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/microsoft-blames-russian-hackers-for.html) aka PRESSTEA), and backdoors ([Kapeka](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/russian-apt-deploys-new-kapeka-backdoor.html)), in addition to off-the-shelf malware families like [DarkCrystal RAT](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/russian-sandworm-hackers-impersonate.html) (aka DCRat) that allow the threat actors to maintain [persistent remote access](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/uac-0125-abuses-cloudflare-workers-to.html) to infected hosts.

It has also been observed relying on a variety of Russian companies and criminal marketplaces to source and sustain its offensive capabilities, highlighting a [growing trend](https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/blurring-the-lines-how-nation-states-and-cybercriminals-are-becoming-alike/) of cybercrime facilitating state-backed hacking.

"The group has used criminally sourced tools and infrastructure as a source of disposable capabilities that can be operationalized on short notice without immediate links to its past operations," the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) [said](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/cybercrime-multifaceted-national-security-threat) in an analysis.

"Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, APT44 has increased its use of such tooling, including malware such as DarkCrystal RAT (DCRat), [Warzone](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/ukraine-says-russia-planning-massive.html), and [RADTHIEF](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/ai-powered-rhadamanthys-stealer-targets.html) ('Rhadamanthys Stealer'), and bulletproof hosting infrastructure such as that provided by the Russian-speaking actor 'yalishanda,' who advertises in cybercriminal underground communities."

Microsoft said the Sandworm subgroup has been operational since at least late 2021, exploiting various known security flaws to obtain initial access, followed by a series of post-exploitation actions aimed at collecting credentials, achieving command execution, and supporting lateral movement.

"Observed operations following initial access indicate that this campaign enabled Seashell Blizzard to obtain access to global targets across sensitive sectors including energy, oil and gas, telecommunications, shipping, arms manufacturing, in addition to international governments," the tech giant noted.

"This subgroup has been enabled by a horizontally scalable capability bolstered by published exploits that allowed Seashell Blizzard to discover and compromise numerous Internet-facing systems across a wide range of geographical regions and sectors."

Since early last year, the sub-cluster is said to have weaponized vulnerabilities in ConnectWise ScreenConnect ([CVE-2024-1709](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/hac...
