## *A Hacker’s Mind* News

My [latest book](https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/) continues to sell well. Its ranking hovers between 1,500 and 2,000 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Mind-Powerful-Societys-Rules/dp/0393866661/). It’s been spied in airports.

Reviews are consistently good. I have been enjoying giving podcast interviews. It all feels pretty good right now.

You can order a signed book from me [here](https://www.schneier.com/product/a-hackers-mind-hardcover/).

For those of you in New York, I’m giving at book talk at the Ford Foundation on Thursday, April 6. Admission is free, but you have to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bruce-schneier-and-ford-foundation-present-a-hackers-mind-tickets-585619883837).

I just finished “A Hacker’s Mind” on audiobook. Bravo. This book is a masterpiece. The first half of the book in particular is tightly written and loaded with insights. I hope it provokes a lot of thoughtful discussions.

@Bruce:

> It’s been spied in airports.

Better than being spied *on* in airports.

I hope it gets the frequent flyer miles and uses them to go somewhere nice on vacation.
