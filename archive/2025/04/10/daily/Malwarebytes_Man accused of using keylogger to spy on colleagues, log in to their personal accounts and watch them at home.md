# Man accused of using keylogger to spy on colleagues, log in to their personal accounts and watch them at home

Posted: April 9, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

When you next type something sensitive on your computer keyboard, be sure that no-one else is watching. A recent case of alleged cyber-voyeurism shows how important it is to secure your computer against unwanted eavesdroppers using malwareware.

In a class action [lawsuit](https://www.gelaw.com/ge/press-release/UMMC-First_Amended_Class_Action_Complaint_and_Demand_For_Jury_Trial.pdf), six women have accused pharmacist Matthew Bathula of invading their privacy by spying on them at work and at home.

According to the lawsuit, Bathula is alleged to have planted [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) on at least 400 computers in clinics, treatment rooms, and labs at the University of Maryland Medical Center where he worked. Bathula is said to have installed a [keylogger](https://www.malwarebytes.com/keylogger). This software monitors what a user types on a keyboard without their knowledge, relaying it back to the keylogger’s owner.

The lawsuit claims that this gave Bathula login credentials for the victims’ personal accounts and systems, including bank accounts, emails, home surveillance systems, Dropbox accounts, Google Drives, dating applications, Google Nests, and iCloud accounts.

This access enabled Bathula to download the victims’ [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), including their private photographs and videos, the class action asserts, adding that he also used his access to systems both at home and at work to spy on the victims in real time.

He used webcams installed on work computers for telehealth sessions to spy on new mothers pumping milk at work, and did the same through their home webcams.

Bathula allegedly spied on victims with their children at home, and also watched them undressing and being intimate with partners. He is said to have disabled the cameras’ operating lights so that victims could not see they were being viewed.

## How to protect yourself

Bathula has not thus far been charged with a crime. The anonymous women, who first became aware of the issue when the FBI contacted them, are suing their employer, University of Maryland Medical Systems, for “failure to take reasonable, readily available measures to protect its employees.”

But spyware is a threat for people outside the workplace too. What should you do to protect yourself from someone logging your keystrokes? Here are some tips.

**Keep your software up to date.** Some spies manually install keyloggers on target computers, but others use [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) to install it remotely. Malware droppers frequently take advantage of known vulnerabilities in older versions of operating system and application software. They [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) these security holes to install their malware. You can minimize these loopholes by constantly keeping your software up to date.

**Install anti-malware protection.** [Anti-malware protection](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium) works at the lowest level of the operating system to check on the software applications that it’s running and watch for suspicious or known malicious activity.

**Watch where you download from.** Software downloaded from unofficial sites – especially pirated software – often comes with unwelcome additions including keyloggers...
