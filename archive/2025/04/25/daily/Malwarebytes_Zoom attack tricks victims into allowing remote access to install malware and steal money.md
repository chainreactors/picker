# Zoom attack tricks victims into allowing remote access to install malware and steal money

Posted: April 24, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

Be careful when talking to people you’ve not met with before over the Zoom video conferencing system; you might get more than you bargained for. Two CEOs were recently targeted by a Zoom-based attack. One spotted it in time – and sadly, one did not.

The attack is by a crime group that the Security Alliance call ELUSIVE COMET in a [warning](https://www.securityalliance.org/news/2025-03-elusive-comet) about the threat last month. ELUSIVE COMET targets its victims by luring them into a Zoom video call and then taking over their PC to install [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), infiltrate their accounts, and steal their assets.

The group typically approaches victims with a supposed media opportunity to get them interested, and then sets up an introductory Zoom call. During that video meeting, the attacker keeps their screen switched off, but sends a remote control request to the victim.

Remote control is a feature in the Zoom app that allows someone else to take control of your PC. It’s great if, for example, you’re not very tech-savvy and you want your grandchild to fix your computer from the other side of the country. It’s less good if you agree to a remote control request from someone you don’t know – especially if you don’t know you’re doing so.

That’s what happens to victims during their fraudulent call from ELUSIVE COMET. When the remote control request comes through to the victim, the notification says “<Participant> is requesting remote control of your system” where <Participant> is the participant’s screen name. In this takeover attempt, the attacker changes their screen name to ‘Zoom’ before sending the remote control request so it appears as though the app itself is requesting control.

Some rushed or distracted people might assume that’s a valid request from the app, perhaps as a precursor to recording a call or displaying new content. If the victim accepts, it’s game over, and the attacker can take full control of the victim’s system.

## Zoom takeovers in action

ELUSIVE COMET [tried this trick](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/04/17/mitigating-elusive-comet-zoom-remote-control-attacks/) on the CEO of cybersecurity consulting company Trail of Bits, but it didn’t work on him. After receiving an invitation to appear on “Bloomberg [Crypto](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency),” he suspected something was amiss.

The attackers approached him via the X social media network and refused to switch to email when asked. Then they used a third-party booking system called Calendly to arrange the call. While Calendly is a legitimate service, the attackers hadn’t branded their Calendly pages with Bloomberg’s logo, which the CEO felt was suspicious. After checking into some of the data gathered on the group in the Security Alliance advisory, the CEO realized what was happening.

Sadly, that wasn’t the case for Jake Gallen, who owns a cryptocurrency company called Emblem Vault. As he describes in a [postmortem thread](https://x.com/jakegallen_/status/1911834004690751955) on X earler this month, he also got a media invitation from an X account, this time called @tacticalinvest\_, to appear on a podcast. He took the bait.

“While the interview was ongoing @tacticalinvest\_ was downloading malware on my computer known as goopdate,” he reports, “which was powerful enough to steal >...
