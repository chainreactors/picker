In the SAP Commerce Quote business use case with C4C (SAP Cloud for Customer) integration, the quote request process is streamlined and made more efficient by utilizing the capabilities of C4C. C4C allows sales representatives to access customer information and data, as well as manage quotes, sales orders, and other processes in one centralized location
When a customer requests a quote, the sales representative can quickly access the customer's information and previous interactions, which can be used to generate a personalized quote. C4C also allows the sales representative to easily check the availability and pricing of products and services, as well as delivery times. The quote can then be sent to the customer through C4C, who can review it and accept or reject it.

#### **Benefits**

A SAP Commerce Quote business case with C4C integration can provide several benefits for a company.
Increased efficiency: By utilizing C4C's capabilities, sales representatives can access customer information and data, as well as manage quotes, sales orders, and other processes in one centralized location. This can help to streamline the quote request process and reduce the time it takes to generate and send personalized quotes to customers.
Improved customer experience: C4C allows sales representatives to quickly access customer information and previous interactions, which can be used to generate a more personalized quote. This can improve the customer experience, as they will feel understood and valued.
Better inventory management: C4C can be integrated with other systems such as ERP and inventory management, which can help to ensure accurate and efficient order fulfillment. This can help to reduce stock-outs and improve customer satisfaction.
