![What Motivates Website Malware Attacks](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/What-Motivates-Website-Malware-Attacks-820x385.png)

The depiction in the media of hackers tends to be that of balaclava-wearing villains who type furiously in a dark basement, motivated by nothing but evil intentions. However, while this may be true in some instances, by and large the determining factors that result in malware attacks are largely motivated not by ideology or malice but by material interests.

In writing this post I couldn’t help but think of the self-parody TV series [CSI: Cyber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzMwku95lRE), specifically the episode where the basement-dwelling, greasy-haired, evil hacker hacks a roller coaster ride, killing everyone on board, simply because he is a bad evil guy who wants to do bad evil things to unsuspecting good people.

Rule number one of cybersecurity is to “*think like an attacker*“. For this reason it behooves us to understand what makes them tick. In this post we will try to demystify the reasons behind website malware attacks, why they happen, and review some of the most common online threats in order to try to understand them more thoroughly.

## Where Malware Attacks Begin

It goes without saying that to engage in cyber crime requires some, let’s say, “*flexible morals*“. By and large, though, attacks tend to target victims in Western countries and attackers tend to reside elsewhere, far removed from legal frameworks which could provide consequences to their actions.

Top attack countries tend to have poor employment prospects for young people, have decent network infrastructure, and decent public technical colleges where would-be attackers can learn the ropes.

Money, ultimately, is the common denominator to almost all website attacks. After all, malware is a business. In many ways the black market [mirrors](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/conti-ransomware-leak-shows-group-operates-like-normal-tech-company.html) the legitimate economy with some criminal enterprises reportedly having HR departments and Employee of the Month programs. Other threat actors do exist, such as low-level “*hacktivists*” and indeed even nation states who act as “*Advanced Persistent Threats*“, but the type of threat actors which pose the biggest problem to most website owners would fall somewhere in the middle of these different groups.

Let’s go ahead and break down some of the most common website malware attacks and review the financial motivations behind them.

## SEO Spam

SEO (search engine optimisation) spam is without a doubt one of the biggest nuisances that website owners face. Backlinks and advertisements for knockoff pharmaceuticals, bootleg brand name products, fake designer watches, torrents, essay writing services, dodgy online casinos, and so on. But what exactly motivates these spammers to infect websites and pump them full of (usually hidden) links to these low-quality, bottom-of-the-barrel spam websites?

The answer is to pump their own SEO with the eventual goal of increasing traffic to their own spammy websites.

All of the less-than-reputable content that I described above all live on websites somewhere – and there is *a lot of them*. But, how do the owners of these spammy websites convince people to visit *theirs*? After all, there are many thousands of sites selling spammy goods or services, and many spam-website-operators trying to get in on the game. Not unlike the “*regular economy*” where websites in the same industry try to out-compete each other with SEO so that they can appear higher up in search results than their competitors, so too does the black market economy selling knockoff viagra and promoting questionable online casinos.

This chart helps illustrate how SEO in general works, both regular and “blackhat”:

The key to understanding SEO spam is how Google’s search algorithm works. With over one billion websites present on the web, search engines need a way to rank them in order to show people relevant results when they search for ...
