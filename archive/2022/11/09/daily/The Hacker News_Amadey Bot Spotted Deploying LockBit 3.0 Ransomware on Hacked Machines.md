The Amadey malware is being used to deploy [LockBit 3.0 ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/lockbit-ransomware-abuses-windows.html) on compromised systems, researchers have warned.

"Amadey bot, the malware that is used to install LockBit, is being distributed through two methods: one using a malicious Word document file, and the other using an executable that takes the disguise of the Word file icon," AhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) [said](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/41450/) in a new report published today.

Amadey, first discovered in 2018, is a "criminal-to-criminal (C2C) botnet infostealer project," as [described](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2022/07/smokeloader-malware-used-to-augment-amadey-infostealer) by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team, and is offered for purchase on the criminal underground for as much as $600.

While its primary function is to harvest sensitive information from the infected hosts, it further doubles up as a channel to deliver next-stage artifacts. Earlier this July, it was [spread using SmokeLoader](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/smokeloader-infecting-targeted-systems.html), a malware with not-so-different features like itself.

Just last month, ASEC also [found](https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/40483/) the malware distributed under the disguise of KakaoTalk, an instant messaging service popular in South Korea, as part of a phishing campaign.

[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpL1IyEdZiANJl-vv13uAfs4IE-F9oFKz_LtzPXM4OM8J8_7IgFpD3QNyN9kcarGtj6Mxkr5bTSoWnfBJGx125jLalspuTrB3q6B-BTcqHa7Z_VbCYsUujjLsGxFffarCOZZ8h1iqgSCjqji05LTS0Zbv2bHCtJtF31GOy-tnyEKMtBTfvAyqkaWQS/s790-rw-e365/data.jpg)

The cybersecurity firm's latest analysis is based on a Microsoft Word file ("[심시아.docx](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/142cbad8b9d400380c78935e60db104ec080812b1a298f9753a41b2811c856be)") that was uploaded to VirusTotal on October 28, 2022. The document contains a malicious VBA macro that, when enabled by the victim, runs a PowerShell command to download and run Amadey.

In an alternative attack chain, Amadey is disguised as a seemingly harmless file bearing a Word icon but is actually an executable ("Resume.exe") that's propagated via a phishing message. ASEC said it was not able to identify the email used as a lure.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

Succeeding in the execution of Amadey, the malware fetches and launches additional commands from a remote server, which includes the LockBit ransomware either in PowerShell (.ps1) or binary (.exe) formats.

[LockBit 3.0](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/19/back-in-black-unlocking-a-lockbit-3-0-ransomware-attack/), also known as [LockBit Black](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/09/lockbit-builder-leaked-by-disgruntled-developer), launched in June 2022, alongside a new dark web portal and the very first [bug bounty program](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2022/10/lockbit-3-0-also-known-as-lockbit-black.html) for a ransomware operation, promising rewards of up to $1 million for finding bugs in its website and software.

"As LockBit ransomware is being distributed through various methods, user caution is advised," the researchers concluded.
