It is time for another State of the Onion! This is our annual virtual event where we share updates from Tor Project芒聙聶s different teams, highlighting their work during the year and what we are excited for the upcoming year. We also have a part of the stream that is dedicated to our community for them to present their amazing work. You can check out our previous State of the Onion streams ([2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyWyTypRGWQ) and [2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNhIjtXuVzk)) at our YouTube channel.

This year we will be doing things a bit differently than we have in the past. Instead of having all the presentations happening on the same day, we are organizing two streams on two different days, one for Tor Project芒聙聶s teams and another for our community. So please make sure to save the date for both events!

* **Wednesday, Nov 9, 17:00 - 19:00 UTC => [State of the Onion with the Tor Project芒聙聶s teams presenting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSyBZ7GIzJY).**
* **Wednesday Nov 16, 17:00 - 19:00 UTC => [State of the Onion with Tor芒聙聶s Community presenting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-7k0PjnBbk).**

The State of the Onion will be streamed over our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TorProjectInc) account.

Join the conversation on social media using the hashtag: #StateOfTheOnion2022 or post your questions and comments in the YouTube chat.
