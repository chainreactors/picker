MapTool v1.11.5 - Denial of Service Vulnerability

References (Source):
====================

Release Date:
=============
2022-10-10

Vulnerability Laboratory ID (VL-ID):
====================================
2318

Common Vulnerability Scoring System:
====================================
5.7

Vulnerability Class:
====================
Denial of Service

Current Estimated Price:
========================

Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
MapTool is a fully featured, flexible virtual tabletop. Not only does MapTool come with powerful tools for creating
detailed maps
but also a chat function, an initiative tracker, and a detailed token management system to create characters, monsters,
objects,
and anything you can imagine. MapTool's user interface is highly configurable, and features not being used can be
hidden out of sight.
The latest version of MapTool can be found on GitHub. MapTool attempts to use Semantic Versioning to help groups know
whether a change
may break their game or not so they can decide when to upgrade. Exciting new features can be tested in development
(alpha or beta) builds,
but for your game where stability matters sticking to the major releases is recommended. MapTool campaigns saved in
newer versions may not
work on older versions, so be careful with your campaign files when trying out development builds.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
The remote denial of service software vulnerability is located in the chat function of the official MapTool v1.11.5
windows software.
Attackers with chat access can transmit a malformed special crafted payload that returns a null pointer in
javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet
(javax.swing.text.View) and javax.swing.text.html.BlockView.layoutMinorAxis. Attacker are able to inject payloads to
crash the application
immediatly and permanently. The compromised communication and project can be saved as cmpgn file and crashs the
application on each import
with the unhandled null pointer exception.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Chat (Werkzeuge / Tools)

Vulnerable Function(s):
[+] javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet$BoxPainter
[+] javax.swing.text.html.BlockView.layoutMinorAxis

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The remote denial of service vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker or without interaction or local users.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to
continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability locally:
1. Install the maptool newst version
2. Start the tool and open a own host
3. Open the message chat box
4. Include the payload and push the send button
5. The software crashs locally by null pointer
Note: open the client again and copy the chat with a cmpgn file
6. Now you can locally import it to crash the host via null pointer

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability remotely:
1. Install the maptool newst version
2. Start the tool and join an exisiting party
3. Open the chat
4. Inject the payload with a local js or base64 encoded link and submit it
5. The host receives the chat message and clicks the link the host session crashs via null pointer

Payload:
<FRAMESET></FRAMESET>
