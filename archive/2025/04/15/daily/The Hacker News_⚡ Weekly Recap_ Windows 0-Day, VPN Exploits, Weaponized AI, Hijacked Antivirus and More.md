Attackers aren't waiting for patches anymore ‚Äî they are breaking in before defenses are ready. Trusted security tools are being hijacked to deliver malware. Even after a breach is detected and patched, some attackers stay hidden.

This week's events show a hard truth: it's not enough to react after an attack. You have to assume that any system you trust today could fail tomorrow. In a world where AI tools can be used against you and ransomware hits faster than ever, real protection means planning for things to go wrong ‚Äî and still staying in control.

Check out this week's update to find important threat news, helpful webinars, useful tools, and tips you can start using right away.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Windows 0-Day Exploited for Ransomware Attacks** ‚Äî A security affecting the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) was [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/pipemagic-trojan-exploits-windows-clfs.html) as a zero-day in ransomware attacks aimed at a small number of targets, Microsoft revealed. The flaw, CVE-2025-29824, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain SYSTEM privileges. An exploit for the vulnerability has been found to be delivered via a trojan called PipeMagic, with the unknown threat actors, tracked by Microsoft as Storm-2460, conducting credential harvesting and dropping a ransomware payload as part of post-compromise exploitation activities. The exact nature of the payload is unclear, however, the ransom note dropped after encryption included a TOR domain tied to the RansomEXX ransomware family. CVE-2025-29824 was [addressed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/microsoft-patches-126-flaws-including.html) by Microsoft as part of its Patch Tuesday update for April 2025.

## 2025 State of Code Security: Key Trends and Threats

In cloud-native environments, the security of your code repositories and development pipelines is critical. Do you know the most pressing risks facing your organization today? By analyzing hundreds of thousands of repositories, the Wiz Threat Research team uncovered key vulnerabilities and attacker strategies in the new **2025 State of Code Security Report**.

Key stats include:

* 35% of GitHub repositories are public, providing malicious actors with easy access to exploits if developers make critical mistakes
* 61% of organizations have cloud secrets, like API keys and access tokens, exposed in public repositories

## **üîî Top News**

* **ESET Flaw Exploited to Deliver New TCESB Malware** ‚Äî The China-aligned [ToddyCat](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/new-tcesb-malware-found-in-active.html) advanced persistent threat (APT) group exploited a vulnerability in ESET's antivirus software to silently execute a malicious payload called TCESB on infected devices. The dynamic link library (DLL) search order hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2024-11859) was patched in January after responsible disclosure. DLL search order hijacking is a kind of vulnerability that occurs when an application searches and loads a required DLL in an insecure order, such as starting with the current directory rather than a trusted system directory. In such instances, an attacker can try to trick the application into loading a malicious DLL as opposed to its legitimate counterpart. Once executed, TCESB reads the running kernel version and disables notification routines, installs a vulnerable driver for defense evasion, and launches an unspecified payload.
* **Fortinet Warns of Hackers Retaining Access to Patched FortiGate VPNs Using Symlinks** ‚Äî Fortinet revealed that threat actors have found a way to maintain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the initial access vector used to breach the devices was patched. "This was achieved via creating a symbolic link (aka [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)) connecting the user file system and the root file system in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN," the company [said](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/fortinet-warns-attackers-retain.html). Fortinet has released patches to eliminate the behavior.
* **AkiraBot Leans on OpenAI Models to Flood Sites with SEO Spam** ‚Äî An artificial intelligence (AI) powered platform called [AkiraBot](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/akirabot-targets-420000-sites-with.html) is being used to spam website chats, comment sections, and contact forms to promote dubious search engine optimization (SEO) services such as Akira and ServicewrapGO. The platform relies on OpenAI API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. As many as 80,000 websites have been successfully spammed by the tool since September 2024. In response to the findings, OpenAI has disabled the API key used by the threat actors.
* **Gamaredon Uses Removable Drives to Distribute GammaSteel Malware** ‚Äî The Russia-linked threat actor known as [Gamaredon](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/gamaredon-uses-infected-removable.html) targeted a foreign military mission based in Ukraine to deliver an updated version of a known malware called GammaSteel using what appears to be an already infected rem...
