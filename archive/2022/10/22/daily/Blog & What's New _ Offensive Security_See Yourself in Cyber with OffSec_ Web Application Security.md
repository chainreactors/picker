## What is Web Application Security?

The world runs on web applications, from online banking and remote work applications to streaming services and e-commerce. Developers tirelessly create new apps, iterate existing ones and quickly deliver updates to meet user expectations. Emphasis on the speed of this process makes it challenging for developers to adhere to security principles strictly, and security weaknesses can slip through the cracks.Â

These weaknesses, paired with the fact that many web apps by design need to be externally exposed, make them a prime target for malicious actors to try and breach.

And new application exploits emerge every day. Attackers exploit APIs, open-source code, third-party widgets, and access control weaknesses. With the growing dependence of organizations on web apps, the demand for professionals to secure their apps continues to soar.Â

If you see yourself working in one of the most in-demand roles in information security and securing web apps that enable todayâs global interconnectedness, specializing in web application security can be a perfect career path.Â

## Web Application Security Engineer Tasks and Responsibilities

As the threat landscape changes and apps are increasingly targeted, web application security engineers are responsible for addressing security requirements during all aspects of the application development process. Theyâre tasked with finding, validating, and fixing security vulnerabilities by performing [white box](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/white-box-web-application-pentesting/) and black box testing, code review, threat modeling, and pentesting of web applications.

Web app security engineers are usually part of the information security team at an organization or are brought in as consultants to perform web app security assessments.Â

Some of the main tasks and responsibilities of web app security engineers include:

* + Evaluating the security of web applications to identify vulnerabilities and security flaws through code testing and manual inspection
  + Performing design reviews to ensure adherence to information security best practices, policies, and standards
  + Conducting web app security assessments, pentesting, and vulnerability scanning for web applications, and provide supporting documentation that includes the methodology and findings
  + Working with developers to integrate security best practices in the code development process
  + Finding and remediating application vulnerabilities by reviewing source code
  + Proactively working with team members to address security and compliance issues promptly
  + Developing and implementing technical solutions and security tools to help mitigate security vulnerabilities and automate repeatable tasks
  + Reviewing findings from scanning tools to address issues pinpointed.

## Why Choose a Job in Web Application Security?

Data breaches caused by attacks on web apps have [increased from 31.5% in 2020 to 53.6% in 2021](https://securelist.com/the-nature-of-cyber-incidents/107119/) and will continue to grow. Equally so, the expansion of web apps won’t slow down any time soon. This makes web application security a career with an excellent future outlook.

Look at any of the worldâs top software vendors; many of them will have dedicated application security teams you could join. Cybersecurity services providers are also a great option to join as a web app security consultant. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for web app security engineers in the public sector, with government agencies increasing their digital transformation efforts.

And the employment of application security engineers is expected to grow over the next decade. As of October 2022, LinkedIn shows 3,600+ jobs for web app security engineers in the US alone. With this boom, now might be the best time to start working towards your career in this field.

A career in web application security can be financially rewarding as well. Web application security engineers are among the top earners in information security, with an average salary range going up to [**$153,000 per year** in the US](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/web-applications-security-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0%2C34.htm), with an excellent opportunity to advance to more senior and higher-paying positions.Â

Web application security is an attractive and high-stakes career option; your role is crucial in securing an organization and its sensitive data. Your skills can significantly impact an organization’s security by directly preventing significant data breaches and application-relation attacks.

## Key Skills and Requirements for a Career in Web Application Security

Web application security is a specialized career path and requires a highly hands-on skillset. To become a web app security engineer, you will need to develop expertise in many critical skills and not only focus on the technical ones. An unrelenting curiosity and passion for lifelong learning are mandatory for anyone seeking to specialize in web application security.

Key skills required for a successful career in web application security include:Â

**Web App Security Fundamentals**

Before starting your journey to any infosec role, a strong knowledge of the fundamentals of basic IT concepts and some specialized skills are crucial. For web application security, these include fundamentals of web secure coding, web attacker methodology, input validation, understanding the role of assessments, vulnerability discovery, enumeration, and other vital processes in web application security.Â

Our fundamental content covered in [WEB-100](https://www.offsec.com/fundamentals/) will provide you with the prerequisite knowledge you will need to begin your training in web application security. Gain the basic skills and confidence needed to advance towards your goals and get comfortable with the tools and technology necessary to begin learning.Â

**Web app penetration testing**

Penetration testing, aka pentesting, is the most commonly used testing technique in web app security. Pentesting is performed by simulating unauthorized attacks, assessing the source code, and manually discovering common vulnerabilities in web apps. Taking the approach of an outside attacker, you work proactively and uncover any possible entryways before they do. A solid understanding of the most common web app risks is crucial for this role. Those most common risks and attack paths you will be emulating in a pentest are:Â

* + Broken access control
  + Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  + Insecure design
  + XML external entities (XXE)Â
  + Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
  + Identification and authentication failuresÂ
  + Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

Throughout your career, you will build your methodologies, leveraging industry-wide ones, and work out the best methods and approaches to uncover most vulnerabilities.Â

**Coding skills**

To specialize in web application security, you will need coding experience. Coding is used to create applications, so a working knowledg...
