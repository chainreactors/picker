# Prudential Financial data breach impacts 2.5 million people, not 36,000 as first thought

Posted: July 2, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In February 2024, Prudential Financial reported it had fallen victim to a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware). The attack was discovered one day after it started, but not before some 2.5 million people had been impacted by the resulting [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach).

As one of the largest insurance companies in the US, Prudential employs 40,000 people worldwide and reported revenues of over $50 billion in 2023.

At first, Prudential said it believed only 36,000 people had had their data stolen, but that number has now been revised to 2.5 million in a [new breach notification](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/cc7a25d8-bb55-485b-b3bc-060aa12004dd.html). The company has also adjusted what information has stolen. In the original [notification](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/bcc5d2ac-a40f-4204-89ca-4b665f43c362.shtml) the company stated:

> “On the basis of the investigation to date, we do not have any evidence that the threat actor has taken customer or client data.”

However, Prudential is now saying the stolen data also impacted many customers and included:

* Full names
* Driving license numbers
* Non-driving license identification cards

The data breach notification states that the company will be giving affected customers 24 months of [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft) and credit monitoring services through Kroll.

Below are some general tips on what to do after you’ve fallen victim to a data breach.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.
* **Watch out for fake vendors.** The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the vendor website to see if they are contacting victims, and verify the identity of anyone who contacts you using a different communication channel.
* **Take your time.** [Phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent a...
