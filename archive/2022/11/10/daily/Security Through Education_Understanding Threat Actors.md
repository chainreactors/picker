3. Understanding Threat Actors

A [threat actor](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/threat_actor) or “malicious actor” is defined as either a person or a group of people that take part in an action that is intended to cause harm in the cyber realm. They engage in cyber related offenses to exploit open vulnerabilities in many different manners. Their targets can be individuals, or even large corporations.

![Understanding threat actors](https://www.social-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/November-2022-Newsletter-Image-1.jpg-1-1024x595.png)

According to the [2022 DBI Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/), 82% of data breaches involved the Human Element, with 62% of incidents involving threat actors compromising their targets. Bad actors can use different methods of attack such as [Phishing,](https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/attack-vectors/phishing-attacks-2/) [Vishing](https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/attack-vectors/vishing/) and [SMiShing](https://www.social-engineer.org/framework/attack-vectors/smishing/) to exploit their victims.

Their approach however has varied over the years. Attackers continuously alter and tailor their malicious techniques as they adapt to new technology and an ever-changing world scene. In this article we will review different types of malicious actors, their motives, and recent exploits they have found in society today.

## A Lineup of Threat Actors

So, we know what a threat actor is.  However, we can further examine different types of bad actors and categorize them into different groups mentioned below. Each type of threat actor will have their own distinct motives, techniques, targets, and uses for stolen data.

### Cyber Criminals

Cyber criminals’ main objectives are to infiltrate a system to access valuable data while ensuring they avoid legal consequences after doing so. Most seek financial rewards or notoriety in their peer groups and use various methods to infect their target’s computer systems. They may seek to gain financial compensation in exchange for the data from the victim themselves, or in some cases, the highest bidder on the dark web. Cyber criminals are the types of threat actors we run into most often in our day-to-day life, such as with phishing attacks or malware laden files and links.

### Nation-State Threat Actors

These types of threat actors typically work for a government entity. Their goal is to gain intelligence of national interest including nuclear, financial and technology information. These actors are usually operatives funded by government intelligence agencies that are highly trained and very stealthy. Occasionally, nation-state threat actors may also be part of a separate organization contracted privately by a government. In both cases, their aim is to bolster their nation-state’s counterintelligence strategy and may attempt to sabotage critical infrastructure.

### Insiders

Insider threats come from within a company itself. It may be [an employee that feels they have been treated unfairly and acts out in retaliation.](https://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/insider-threats-recognize-respond-risk-within/) They may sell network information to other malicious parties, sabotage their company directly, or even knowingly provide an opportunity for an outsider to gain access. Insiders are especially dangerous to an organization considering how much access they have at their disposal. They can also be hard to detect. However, keeping strict logging procedures in place can help catch these threats if they pop up.

## Exploits in a Changing World

In the world around us, threat actors’ methods of attack take many different shapes. Some threats remain timeless, such as attackers leveraging remote access and web applications to gain access to an organization. The use of ransomware has also seen a surge in recent years, accounting for a [13% increase](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:wls:dpr:8888855284&utm_term=ransom%20cyber%20attack&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=GGL_NB_Security_Phrase&utm_content=DBIR2022&ds_cid=71700000082350639&ds_cid=71700000082350639&ds_cid=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwnP-ZBhDiARIsAH3FSRdtiT7taRam_1ubD9fnho75O5D-zPu2Pvfgsl3IYSEjji1mdQMNQeQaAsCYEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) this year alone, which is more than in the last 5 years combined.

With ever shifting world conditions and news headlines comes a wave of new techniques for threat actors to use. Adapting to their “surroundings,” attackers have been able to find new ways to take advantage of unsuspecting victims. They utilize current information along with emotional triggers. Here are a few:

### Ukraine Relief Scams

With the war in Ukraine, many threat actors have preyed on people’s kindness and tricked many into [donating to fake causes and relief funds.](https://www.social-engineer.org/podcasts/ep-168-security-awareness-series-lessons-learned-from-the-attacks-on-ukraine-with-patrick-laverty/) The most common method of this type of scam was found in donation-seeking phishing emails. Some would pose as refugees asking for money to send back home to their relatives. While others would impersonate real banks or relief causes. Most of these scams required victims to provide “support” by using cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, making it harder to trace.

### Student Loan Scams

These types of scams have been around for a long time. However, they surged with the announcement from President Biden of [student loan forgiveness in the US](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/20/student-loan-forgiveness-application-scams). Scammers sprung at the opportunity to scam students wishing to apply for such student aid. Threat actors would call or email pretending to be from different agencies helping individuals...
