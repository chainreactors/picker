## The US Has a Shortage of Bomb-Sniffing Dogs

Nothing beats a dog’s nose for detecting explosives. Unfortunately, there [aren’t enough dogs](https://www.wired.com/story/us-bomb-dog-shortage/):

> Last month, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a nearly 100-page [report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-104489.pdf) about working dogs and the need for federal agencies to better safeguard their health and wellness. The GOA says that as of February the US federal government had approximately 5,100 working dogs, including detection dogs, across three federal agencies. Another 420 dogs “served the federal government in 24 contractor-managed programs within eight departments and two independent agencies,” the GAO report says.
>
> The report also underscores the demands placed on detection dogs and the potential for overwork if there aren’t enough dogs available. “Working dogs might need the strength to suddenly run fast, or to leap over a tall barrier, as well as the physical stamina to stand or walk all day,” the report says. “They might need to search over rubble or in difficult environmental conditions, such as extreme heat or cold, often wearing heavy body armor. They also might spend the day detecting specific scents among thousands of others, requiring intense mental concentration. Each function requires dogs to undergo specialized training.”

A decade and a half ago I was [optimistic](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/12/bombsniffing_wa.html) about bomb-sniffing bees and wasps, but nothing seems to have come of that.

…and a surplus of fart-sniffing CEOs.

The US Has a Shortage of *cheap and pre-trained* Bomb-Sniffing Dogs.

FTFY.

re: *Sniffer dogs*

Sniffer dogs are a much bigger question mark than agencies would like you to know. It isn’t untrue that dogs can sniff things humans cannot and they can track long distances. Hunting dogs can sniff, track and kill what they catch.

Humans harness these traits but how they do it leaves much in question.

Like Clever Hans, it’s not always what it seems and not always as advertised. Price is no guarantee either way. Once the dog shifts handlers, it’s not the same dog and not the same result.

Bomb sniffing rats are more economical but not as photogenic or ego-boosting.

…perhaps the perceived Need for so many dogs is erroneous.

and the actual reliability/value of dog-sniffers is very controversial.

a famous 2010 scientific test of bomb/drug sniffing dogs by the University of California found an 85% False-Positive detection rate by certified police dogs.

@Brice

Very interesting point: did you have any link?

I recall witnessing an electronic explosive material detector on an airport, this was a try, and I chatted with the Officer using it as it could be an incredible tool to have to enforce rules and security for everyone.

Since then, I never saw it again being used or tried on any other airport (or this one).

@ Bruce,

> “A decade and a half ago I was optimistic about bomb-sniffing bees and wasps, but nothing seems to have come of that.”

Or more recently dogs that could sniff out people with C-19.

Unlike a box you leave on a shelf untill the battery wires corrode the terminals, dogs have a high up keep and maintenance cost.

One part of which is the “dedicated handler” which applies not just to dogs but other creatures.

The handler should spend more time with their creature than just the actual “on the job time”, and more time than most pet owners do with their creatures. Worse the promotion chances for a handler are close to zero for a decade or so and any training they have is effectively “non transferable”. So it’s in effect a dead end job where the handler needs a certain personality type as they are in effect “wedded to the creature” 24×7. Especially where the crearure is a “pack animal”.

Then there is the cost of “retiring” working dogs or similar. After all you realy can not “give them the bullet” and get the “dog meat man” in to turn the corpse into “pet food” or similar that used to be the fate of “working horses”. These days such behaviours are very very bad publicity and to be avoided where ever possible. Worse most working dogs are “pedigree” or more correctly “closed stud book breeds” where close blood-line breading gives “genetic defects” such as “scored hips” that significantly reduce the working life of a creature.

Then there is the handler-creature bonding phase where six months may be required for a new dog and handler to be “trained” towards each other to become an effective unit.

All of which is why in reality each dog costs considerably more to have on the books than an individual officer.

Mostly they are not “cost effective” as there is actually very little specific work for the dogs to do. So some idiot always suggests they are “dual rolled” or worse.

There are reports around about how making “drug sniffing dogs” also do general “K9” dog work destroys their ability to do either duty. Thus makes them effectively usless, as well as raising other issues[1]… Before the costly law suit issues the use of potentially dangerous animals always attracs.

The simple fact is that those further up the managment hierarchy see “working dogs” as, a liability with little or no upside and many downsides. So much so there is a...
