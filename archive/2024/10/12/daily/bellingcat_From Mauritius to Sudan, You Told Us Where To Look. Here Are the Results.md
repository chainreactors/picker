# From Mauritius to Sudan, You Told Us Where To Look. Here Are the Results

October 11, 2024

* [Geolocation](/tag/geolocation)
* [Satellite imagery](/tag/satellite-imagery)

Satellite imagery is increasingly used by open source researchers to analyse conflict,natural disasters, mining activities and even construction work.

With the help of Planet Labs PBC and Umbra Space, Bellingcat can take a snapshot of anywhere in the world by “tasking” their satellites to take an image at up to 25-centimetre resolution.

Bellingcat asked you, our community, about the locations where you wanted to see high-resolution satellite imagery.

## A Growing Airbase in Mauritius

On LinkedIn, Bellingcat follower Muhammad Mamoom suggested imaging the Indian Air Force base on Agaléga, an island of Mauritius.

Agaléga is a small island of only 330 residents in the Indian Ocean. A dependency of Mauritius, it is more than 1,100 km away from the main island. Although only 25 square kilometres, Agaléga is in a strategic geopolitical position to [control choke points](https://lexpress.mu/node/411768) of the Indian Ocean.

A [2015 memorandum of understanding](https://web.archive.org/web/20150311205408/http%3A//indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/india-seychelles-sign-four-pacts-to-boost-security-cooperation/) between Mauritius and the Indian Armed Forces set the stage for the development of an Indian Air Force base on the island. In response to a [2021 Al Jazeera investigation](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2021/island-of-secrets/index.html), the government of Mauritius claimed that there is “no agreement between Mauritius and India to set up a military base in Agaléga,” despite evidence of Indian ships ferrying construction supplies to the small island, and the large new runway clearly visible on satellite imagery.

There is [local opposition](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/indias-battle-over-disinformation-in-the-indian-ocean/) to the construction, and many Mauritians see it as a legacy of colonialism.  Between 1968 and 1973 hundreds of local residents were deported from the island of Diego Garcia to make way for a joint British-American military base.

Over the past four years, the development of the airbase on Agaléga has been highly visible on satellite imagery. The timelapse below, courtesy of Planet Labs PBC, shows this expansion. Particularly notable is the large runway that stretches almost half the length of the island.

In the high-resolution image captured on August 30, 2024 by Planet Labs PBC, we can also see recently completed buildings and newly paved roads, as well as continued clearance of the vegetation surrounding the airbase.

Mauritius is a global biodiversity hotspot, home to many endemic plants and animals. The Agaléga island day gecko is found nowhere else. The island is also known for being the site of the last sighting of a [dodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo), perhaps the world’s most famous extinct animal.

## Demolition and Construction in Nagorno-Karabakh

Bellingcat recently [published an investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2024/09/27/nagorno-karabakh-satellite-imagery-shows-city-wide-ransacking/) detailing the demolition of buildings and hundreds of incidents of what appears to be ransacking across the city of Khankendi, known as Stepanakert to Armenians.

The regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh — internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan — was also a top requested location by the Bellingcat community. In addition to the investigation, we are publishing more recent satellite imagery of Khankendi/Stepanakert and the second largest town in Nagorno-Karabakh, Aghdere, known in Armenian as Martakert.

In Khankendi/Stepanakert, the [demolition](https://eurasianet.org/azerbaijan-baku-is-bulldozing-armenian-legacy-in-karabakh) of buildings surrounding Qarabag University, the former Artsakh State University, is clearly visible, as is the demolition of the former [National Assembly building](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/azerbaijan-demolishes-former-karabakh-armenian-parliament-building-2024-03-05/). Additionally, the image shows the [construction of a new highway](https://news.az/news/another-major-highway-under-construction-in-liberated-azerbaijani-territories-video) between Khankendi and Lachin via Shusha, a historic mountain town to the south of Khankendi.

*SkySat imagery captured on August 24, 2024, by Planet Labs PBC.*

Fewer changes to the city of Aghdere/Martarkert are visible. To the southwest of the city, the [construction of a pipeline](https://ensol.az/en/projects/construction-of-aghdam-kelbajar-gas-pipeline-and-kelbajar-gds-gas-pipeline-branch-with-installation-of-gds-on-it/) built to “support the reconstruction works in the area by strengthening the gas supply of the region” is visible. There appears to be cleared land adjacent to the highway going south towards the city of Aghdam, where Azerbaijan is building a [new highway](https://abc.az/en/news/144426/construction-of-aghdere-aghdam-road-starts). These projects underscore the intensity with which Azerbaijan is integrating newly controlled areas into its national infrastructure.

The [Demirli Copper-Molybdenum mine](https://hetq.am/en/article/151351) can also be seen in the bottom left of the image. In recent years, this mine has been environmentally and politically controversial.

## Sennar and Al Fashir in Sudan

In recent months, fighting between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has [intensified in Sennar State](https://acleddata.com/2024/07/12/sudan-situation-update-july-2024-the-rsf-marches-on-sennar-and-west-kordofan/) in Sudan’s southeast. Initially a paramilitary force controlled by a faction of the Sudanese government, the Sudanese Armed Forces designated the RSF a rebel group after RSF attacks on government sites in April last year. Since then, the two forces have battled for control of the country.
