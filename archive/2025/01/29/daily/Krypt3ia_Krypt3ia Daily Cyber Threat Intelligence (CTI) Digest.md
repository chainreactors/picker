### **Risk Matters: Cyber Risk and AI ‚Äì The Changing Landscape**

**Summary:** In today‚Äôs world of interconnected computer-based information systems, cyber risk has become one of the critical risk factors impacting organizations. Indeed, several studies have shown that cyber risk (i.e., the probability of being the victim of a successful cyber-attack) is one of the, if not the, top risk concerns to senior executives in private, as well as public, sector organizations. Auditors have also recognized the critical nature of cyber risk to organizations, as evidenced by the American Institute of Public Accountants‚Äô development of its cybersecurity risk management reporting framework. Cybersecurity risk is also a key concern to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as evidenced by its 2023 disclosure rules requiring registrants to include Item 1C (Cybersecurity) in Form 10-K and to disclose material cyber incidents in Form 8-K.

### **Malware Campaigns**

### **PureCrypter Deploys Agent Tesla and New TorNet Backdoor in Ongoing Cyberattacks**

**Summary:** A financially motivated threat actor has been linked to an ongoing phishing email campaign that has been ongoing since at least July 2024 specifically targeting users in Poland and Germany.

The attacks have led to the deployment of various payloads, such as [Agent Tesla](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/cybercriminals-target-polish-businesses.html), [Snake Keylogger](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/hackers-hide-malware-in-images-to.html), and a previously undocumented backdoor dubbed TorNet that‚Äôs delivered by means of [PureCrypter](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/new-malware-campaign-uses-purecrypter.html). TorNet is so named owing to the fact that it allows the threat actor to communicate with the victim machine over the TOR anonymity network.

### **Hackers are using a new AI chatbot to wage cyber attacks: GhostGPT lets users write malicious code, create malware, and curate phishing emails ‚Äì and it costs just $50 to use**

**Summary:** Hackers are using an uncensored chatbot dubbed GhostGPT to help write malware, highlighting how AI can be twisted to ‚Äúillegal activities‚Äù. That‚Äôs according to Abnormal Security, which laid out details of GhostGPT in a [blog post](https://abnormalsecurity.com/blog/ghostgpt-uncensored-ai-chatbot), saying the chatbot lacks the guardrails of standard AI tools such as ChatGPT, making it a helpful tool for cyber criminals.

### **Phishing Campaigns**

### **Hidden text ‚Äúsalting‚Äù is letting hackers craft devious email attacks to evade detection**

**Summary:** Hackers are increasingly using ‚Äúhidden text salting‚Äù, or ‚Äúpoisoning‚Äù techniques, to work around email security measures and get phishing messages to land in people‚Äôs inboxes.

A new in-depth [guide](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/seasoning-email-threats-with-hidden-text-salting/) published by cybersecurity researchers from Cisco Talos outlines how cybercriminals are abusing HTML and CSS properties in email messages, setting the width of some elements to 0, and using the ‚Äúdisplay: hidden‚Äù feature to hide some content from the victims. They are also inserting zero-width space (ZWSP) and zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ) characters, and ultimately hiding the true email content, by embedding irrelevant language.
