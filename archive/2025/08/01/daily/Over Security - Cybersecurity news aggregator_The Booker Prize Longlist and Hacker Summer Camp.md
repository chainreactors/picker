[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

This week the Booker Prize Longlist was released and it featured several books I’ve read this year a couple that are on my TBR (To Be Read), a couple that I had not heard of, and a couple that make me scratch my head and question why they would be included at all. It’s always exciting for me to see the Booker Longlist as it gives me an idea of how I’ve tapped into the literary fiction zeitgeist in first half of the year and what I may be tapping into in the back half of the year. That got me thinking about the cycle of staying up to date with the current threat landscape and the evolution of the threat actor behaviors and techniques and how Black Hat and DEF CON reside in a similar space for all of us in the cyber security space. Some of the new or interesting things that will come out will provide actionable insights, others will be a heaping serving of more of the same and while not trivial they will be super interesting and important, and finally some information will simply be all name and sizzle, but in the end full of sound and fury and signifying nothing.

As a reader I’ve to understand that these lists, and the authors and books included in them, are there for various reasons and not all of them are on the merit of the narrative and the craft of writing. Early in my career it was hard to separate the things that came out of Summer Camp because I was so desperate to learn and so excited that I often couldn’t leverage my own experiences and separate the actionable from the detritus. Now I find that I don’t even have to expend much energy to move the firehose of information into the proper channels in my mind and then dive in and take what I’ve learned and apply it. Also trusting that if something that seems like empty sizzle is important – that I have team members that will keep me clued in and finding the needles in the never-ending field of haystacks.

I hope you all have a tremendous time at Summer Camp, see a lot of old friends and make new ones and most importantly that you shower and use deodorant. Conference season is a marathon, it’s long, it’s arduous, it’s sweaty – be the hygienic change you want to see in the world.

## The one big thing

The [Cisco Talos Incident Response Trends Q2 2025](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ir-trends-q2-2025) report is out today, and as always it is packed with in-depth insights into recent attacker behavior. Phishing remains the top initial access vector, but interestingly, the objective of the majority of observed phishing attacks appeared to be credential harvesting, suggesting cybercriminals may consider brokering compromised credentials as simpler and more reliably profitable than other post-exploitation activities. Ransomware and pre-ransomware incidents made up half of all engagements this quarter, similar to [last quarter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ir-trends-q1-2025/). Talos IR observed Qilin and Medusa ransomware for the first time, while also responding to previously seen Chaos ransomware. Education was the most targeted industry vertical this quarter.

### Why do I care?

The report contains details of how attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities and circumventing security tools. Examples include MFA installations with self-service options that allow attackers to register their own devices. We also saw stealthy tactics in ransomware attacks such as the use of PowerShell 1.0 (yes the original version from 2006) in what we’re calling “bring your own binary”.

### So now what?

The report outlines actionable advice based on observed incidents,
such as:

* Proper configuration and monitoring of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
* Importance of centralized logging
* Steps to harden endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.

These insights help prioritize mitigations that directly address real-world attack techniques. [Download the report today.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ir-trends-q2-2025)

## Top security headlines of the week

### Journalist Discovers Google Vulnerability That Allowed People to Disappear Specific Pages From Search

By accident, journalist Jack Poulson discovered Google had completely de-listed two of his articles from its search results. “We only found it by complete coincidence,” Poulson told 404 Media. “I happened to be Googling for one of the articles, and even when I typed in the exact title in quotes it wouldn’t show up in search results anymore.” ([404 media](https://www.404media.co/journalist-discovers-google-vulnerability-that-allowed-people-to-disappear-specific-pages-from-search/))

### ChatGPT, GenAI Tools Open to 'Man in the Prompt' Browser Attack

A brand-new cyberattack vector allows threat actors to use a poisoned browser extension to inject malicious prompts into all of the top generative AI tools on the market, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and others. ([DarkReading](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/attackers-use-browser-extensions-inject-ai-prompts))

### Phishers Target Aviation Execs to Scam Customers

KrebsOnSecurity recently heard from a reader whose boss’s email account got phished and was used to trick one of the company’s customers into sending a large payment to scammers. An investigation into the attacker’s infrastructure points to a long-running Nigerian cybercrime ring that is actively targeting established companies in the transportation and aviation industries ([Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/phishers-target-aviation-execs-to-scam-customers/))
