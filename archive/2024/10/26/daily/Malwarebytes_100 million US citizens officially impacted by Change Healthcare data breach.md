# 100 million US citizens officially impacted by Change Healthcare data breach

Posted: October 25, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In April, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/substantial-proportion-of-americans-may-have-had-health-and-personal-data-stolen-in-change-healthcare-breach) that a “substantial proportion” of Americans may have had their health and personal data stolen in the Change Healthcare breach. That was based on a [report](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2024/2024-04-22-uhg-updates-on-change-healthcare-cyberattack.html) provided by the UnitedHealth Group after the February cyberattack on its subsidiary Change Healthcare.

The attack on Change Healthcare, which processes about 50% of US medical claims, was one of the worst [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) attacks against American healthcare and caused widespread disruption in payments to doctors and health facilities.

UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty estimated the attack compromised the data of a [third of US individuals](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/change-healthcare-cyberattack-congress-unitedhealth-andrew-witty/714954/) when he testified before the Senate Finance Committee on Capitol Hill on May 1, 2024 in Washington, DC.

He wasn’t exaggerating. Yesterday, Change Healthcare reported a number of 100,000,000 affected individuals on the [breach portal of the US Department of Health and Human Services](https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf) (HHS).

![Change HelathCare, Inc. entry in data breach portal HHS showing 100000000 Individuals Affected by Hacking/IT Incident](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Data_entry.png)

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the HHS confirmed that it prioritized and opened investigations of Change Healthcare and UnitedHealth Group, focused on whether a breach of protected health information (PHI) occurred and on the entities’ compliance with the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Rules](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html). OCR did this because of the cyberattack’s unprecedented impact on patient care and privacy.

On July 19, 2024, Change Healthcare filed a breach report with OCR that identified 500 individuals as the “approximate number of individuals affected.” This is the minimum number of individuals affected that results in a posting of a breach on the HHS Breach Portal, and it was perhaps cited because Change Healthcare still needed to determine the actual number of impacted users.

Acting Director of the Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Health & Human Services Melanie Fontes Rainer said about 140 million people were affected by large breaches in 2023, up from 51 million in 2022. And 2024 looks even worse, she added:

> “And this year, with both the Change breach and Ascension breach, we expect that number to potentially double or go higher.”

Affected people can visit a dedicated website at [changecybersupport.com](https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/ns/health-data-breach.html) to get more information or call 1-866-262-5342 to set up free credit monitoring and [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft) protection.
