## Google’s Advanced Protection Now on Android

Google has [extended](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/advanced-protection-mobile-devices.html) its Advanced Protection features to Android devices. It’s not for everybody, but something to be considered by high-risk users.

Wired [article](https://www.wired.com/story/google-advanced-protection-vulnerable-users-lockdown-android-16/), behind a paywall.

They are adopting features that already exist in GrapheneOS, such as USB security, automatic reboot, etc. GOS supports additional security and privacy features.

@ ALL,

With regards,

> “Google has extended its Advanced Protection features…”

Just remember how Google makes it’s money…

So the question you should ask is,

“How will they continue to make money, if these features offer real security?”

Oh and as current AI LLM and ML systems are not very popular with many people…

They have a lot of wasted investment to turn into some kind of money earning venture.

And traditionally that was “selling their users down the river” and even “throwing some under the bus”.

Don’t say you were not warned…

Grumpy old man quibbles at weasel words

> This monitoring and detection capability, known as Intrusion Logging, uses end-to-end encryption to indelibly store logs from your device in the cloud such that they can’t be accessed by Google or any party aside from you, but also in a form that can’t be deleted or modified, even if your device and Google account are compromised. [from the Wired article]

As @Clive notes, I remember how Google makes it’s money …

@Clive
So, this update ensures that no one else but Google gets the user’s data

@ Steve67

Not to mention GrapheneOS is free of the worst privacy issue known: Google itself. For a mobile device or, in general, any Android device, I would certainly choose GrapheneOS if the device is supported, in other case I would certainly not use the device itself.

@ Clive Robinson, lurker, and SimpleAsThat

Well, Google is very happy with users having privacy on a NOBUS-style (i.e., nobody but us will have access to users’ data).

Google is a data-hungry company, and data value depends on it not being widely available.

@Who, all,

Well, Google is very happy with users having privacy on a NOBUS-style (i.e., nobody but us will have access to users’ data).

We have a word for that: Secrecy.

According to [1]: “Privacy refers to the **control over one’s personal information** and the choice of when to share it with others, emphasizing respect for individual autonomy. Secrecy, in contrast, implies a deliberate concealment of information, often to protect personal interests or **to prevent others from knowing** the truth.”

Google, in their quest to know everything about you don’t offer sufficient control, they are violating your privacy wholesale. The best they offer is not to let others know. That’s Secrecy.

For them to offer privacy is to let me choose what to ‘share’ with them and then delete anything I desire without hesitation. Let alone ‘dark patterns’.

Whether they keep up on their offer is a different question…
