## SIGINT During World War II

The NSA and GCHQ have jointly published a history of World War II SIGINT: “[Secret Messengers: Disseminating SIGINT in the Second World War](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/25/2003761271/-1/-1/0/SECRET_MESSENGERS.PDF).” This is the story of the British SLUs (Special Liaison Units) and the American SSOs (Special Security Officers).

@ Bruce, All,

With regards,

> “This is the story of the British SLUs (Special Liaison Units)”

In many ways it’s likely to be wrong 😉 Such was the need for security those involved were given “cover stories, whilst others invented their own ideas.

One official cover was as part of the “Paymasters” one invented was that their job was to distribute “The senior officers whisky ration”.

What is known is that lowly “Other Ranks”(OR’s) in effect “out ranked” even the most senior of officers.

Sadly the real “boots on the ground” stories are now in effect “nolonger known”. Because even with the publishing of the 1970’s F W Winterbotham book “The Utra Secret” those who had been in the SLU’s remained “The geese that delivered the golden eggs and never cackled”.

Not obtaining useful information follows a familiar pattern. Police are required to undergo somewhere between 18 to 28 weeks training, but many begin working with *significantly* less time spent training (to meet recruitment goals), even after failing to pass important assessments. Significant criminal complaints and behavior are often not an obstacle.

Police do not record **the quality** of their work.

If credible intelligence is obtained, then getting it to where it needs to go and having anyone actually read the stuff faces significant hurdles. There are plenty of myths, but there has always been gatekeepers and reluctance to hear things that are inconvenient.

Today, many more things are inconvenient. The impediments – significantly greater.
Fortunately it is classified, shrouding societal experiences in a vacuum chamber.

Fox News-style segments can ensure that no-one actually reads what they need to see/sign.

‘What is truth’ Pontius Pilate asked 2000 years ago. I don’t know but you certainly won’t get it from any country’s intelligence agencies – and probably shouldn’t in order to protect national security. Techniques may change but I doubt the overall methods have changed at all and these would probably not be made public.

The strategy of Russian intelligence is pretty simple. Feed people in The West rubbish.

To outwit an opponent there are a few simple rules. Read the intelligence and get to know the opponent. Make the target wait and want to come to you. Make them continue to wait. Ensure that everything is in place well before any meeting in order to maintain control.

Russia has an enormous problem of unregulated waste. There is no recycling system (apart from reusing bulls–t) and waste disposal is claimed to be controlled by Kremlin-linked mafia organizations. Russia’s waterways and water supplies are heavily contaminated.

Feces is literally exploding for sewers and shooting into the air.

@Ian Stewart

The weather patterns of the Northern and Southern hemispheres are largely separate.

I wouldn’t worry too much. If Australia was taken by a foreign power, you could still mine it as most of the population centers are far from mining operations. The radiation would clear by the time management teams and security were organized. The United States even uploaded (accidentally) a plan for Australia in such a scenario, then quickly took it down.

Such weapons can be used when forces are overrun by those of a major power. Most of the super powers have similar strategies. Kind of a last resort option, if others are exhausted. Not very helpful for the ...
