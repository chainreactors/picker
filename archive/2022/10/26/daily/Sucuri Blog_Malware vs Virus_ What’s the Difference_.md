![Malware vs Virus what's the difference?](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_Differences-Between-Malware-Viruses-820x386.jpg)

There appears to be a general misunderstanding among internet users about the difference between malware and viruses. The two terms are often used interchangeably — and to an extent, this is perfectly fine.

But in today’s article, we’ll be clarifying the difference between viruses and malware while helping to identify the most common types of malware. We’ll also offer some pointers on how to check if you have malware or virus on your mobile device, website, or computer.

## Are malware and viruses the same thing?

We spend a lot of time discussing website malware specifically, but today we are going to examine how computer viruses and website malware work. We’ll also explore how they vary by type.

To start with, malware is a combination of the words “malicious” and “software”. It refers to a [malicious software](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/how-to-fix-google-ads-disapproved-due-to-malicious-software.html) present on exploited systems.

There is computer malware (or viruses) and website malware. Website malware is malicious code that infiltrates a website’s file system, server, or database. While computer malware is specifically designed to interfere with an end-user’s computer. Both computer malware and website malware seek to disrupt your productivity for malicious personal gain, however, they both do so in different ways.

Computer malware generally attacks a personal system, like a home computer. Website malware generally attacks a public facing system, like an ecommerce website.

Since websites are visited by hundreds or thousands of visitors, website malware is frequently used as a staging ground to infect endpoint devices. For example, one of the most common types of website malware that we see is the [NDSW / NDSX](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/06/analysis-massive-ndsw-ndsx-malware-campaign.html) JavaScript malware. This infection aims to trick users into installing [fake browser updates](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html).

## What is the difference between malware and viruses?

A virus is often used as a synonym for “malware”, but it technically refers to one specific type of malware. A virus self-replicates by inserting its code into other programs, and can infect anything from a computer to mobile device, depending on its objective.

Malware, on the other hand, is a general term used to describe any malicious software. This term can be used regardless of how it’s distributed or what actions it performs.

Next, let’s go over some examples of malware.

## What are some examples of malware?

While there is some overlap in the way that the different types of malware operate, each type has its specific identifiers.

Here is a breakdown of some of the most common types of malware and viruses:

1. **[Virus](#virus)**
2. **[Worm](#worm)**
3. **[Trojan](#trojan)**
4. **[Scareware](#scareware)**
5. **[Spyware](#spyware)**
6. **[Adware and pop-up ads](#adware)**
7. **[Ransomware](#ransomware)**
8. **[Phishing](#phishing)**
9. **[SEO Spam](#seo-spam)**

### 1. Virus

A virus is a malicious computer application which is installed on an endpoint device, often by tricking the user into thinking that it is a legitimate application. Viruses can have many purposes, which we will get to in the next sections, but often have the end goal of either spying on or stealing money or data from the victim’s computer or online bank account.

Unlike some other types of malware, viruses do not automatically spread to other devices on the same network and are typically isolated to the device on which it was installed.

### 2. Worm

A worm is a self-replicating malicious application. Its goal is to spread onto as many computer systems as possible through internet-connected systems and applications. The most notorious worm was the Blaster Worm of the early 2000’s.

Unlike a virus though, it is autonomous—not requiring external activation. A worm has the ability to travel on its own through networks and find new locations to i...
