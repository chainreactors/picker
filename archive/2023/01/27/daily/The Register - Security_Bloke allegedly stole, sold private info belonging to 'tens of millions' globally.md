## If true, was it worth the $500k and prison jumpsuit?

A man suspected of stealing personal data belonging to tens of millions of people worldwide and selling that info on cybercrime forums has been arrested by Dutch police.

The 25-year-old now faces charges of violating data privacy and computer trespassing laws, and laundering cryptocurrency valued at around $491,000, according to media reports.

The alleged crook pulled together information including names, genders, addresses, and birth dates belonging to pretty much everyone in Austria, it is claimed. He also obtained records on some people in Britain, China, Colombia, Thailand, and the Netherlands, it is alleged, and then sold these massive datasets to other criminals online, we're told. The cops believe this data was "stolen" from all over the globe.
