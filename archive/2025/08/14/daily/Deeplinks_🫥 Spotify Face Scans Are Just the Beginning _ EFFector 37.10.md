Catching up on your backlog of digital rights news has never been easier! EFF has a one-stop-shop to keep you up to date on the latest in the fight against censorship and surveillanceâ€”our [EFFector newsletter](https://www.eff.org/effector/37/10).

This time we're covering an act of government intimidation in Florida when the state [subpoenaed a venue for surveillance video](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/you-went-drag-show-now-state-florida-wants-your-name?utm_source=effector) after hosting an LGBTQ+ pride event,Â calling out data brokers in California for [failing to respond to requests](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/data-brokers-are-ignoring-privacy-law-we-deserve-better?utm_source=effector) for personal dataâ€”even though responses are required by state law, and explaining why Canada's Bill C-2 would [open the floodgates](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/canadas-bill-c-2-opens-floodgates-us-surveillance?utm_source=effector) for U.S. surveillance.

Don't forget to also check out our audio companion to EFFector as well! We're interviewing staff about some of the important work that they're doing. This time, EFF Senior Speech and Privacy Activist Paige Collings covers the harms of age verification measures that are being passed across the globe. Listen now on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-1S2NSGAemQ) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.10).
