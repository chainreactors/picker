# Getting a career in cybersecurity isn’t easy, but this can help

[Threat Source newsletter](/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Happy summer, friends! I hope everyone is staying cool and/or warm.

I am fresh back from an exhaustive but great time in San Diego at Cisco Live U.S. It was so good to see colleagues, meet new friends and pet many therapy dogs in the Splunk booth. As often happens to me, I was approached by someone who was looking for mentorship and guidance in how to get into a cybersecurity career. It’s not unusual for me to be approached by folks looking to get into cybersecurity. I’m the large, bearded guy with the Talos shirt, so I stick out.

So, I’m often asked how I got the career I have in cybersecurity and how others can do the same. For a guy who often has a quip or answer for most things, I always pause here. I can’t help but think of my entire career and the dumb luck and hard work that landed me where I’m at. Giving that summation to others wouldn’t be fair, because... well, my journey wasn’t a linear one. I think for many of my peers, the same applies. We found cybersecurity as a career through a series of events that organically landed us in this field. In my case, moreso than others, the path isn’t easy to follow because there was no clearly staked path for me to follow, either.

I’ll explain as best I can: One today might go to school and graduate with a degree in information security and/or some security certificates, then begin the job hunt for an entry level gig. These types of degrees, certificates and even jobs simply didn’t exist in any meaningful way or numbers when I started my career. If you wanted to learn cybersecurity, there weren’t classes to take — you got a computer science degree and figured it out. I, like many in the GenX world, started as an IT professional. As the industry and cyber threats evolved, the career space over the years shifted and we found ourselves helping fight the good fight and keeping folks secure.

Today is truly different, and I’m so happy about it and the opportunities it can give others. I’m envious of the school degrees, industry certifications and mentorship programs that exist today that did not exist for me. There is also an incredibly helpful information security community that provides hacking tutorials, or Capture the Flag competitions (CTFs) or hackathons that I would have loved to have been a part of in my formative years.

By now, I know you’re thinking, "Cool story, grandpa, but answer the question: how do I get a job in cybersecurity?" In my estimation, the answers are as follows:

1. Have a good attitude.
2. Be easy to work with.
3. Be a forever student.
4. Be bad at giving up.
5. Find and join a (preferably local) security community.
6. Grow where you are planted.

Notice that none of those things mention anything specifically technical. No malware reverse engineering, red teaming, threat intelligence or security analyzing. I can tell you that to work at Talos, you must exhibit strong traits of all six of those things I listed. One through five makes sense. Good hackers are tenacious, smart, work well with others and seek out fellow friends to network and hack with.

Number six though – what’s up with that? Simply put, life deals us all a hand of cards that we must play, and those cards may not be great. For example, you want to get a job in cybersecurity, but you’re a primary care giver of a family member and you don’t have a lot of freedom. You might be financially constrained. You may have health issues or a disability that limits some options. Or you simply just have a job that you don’t like, and a career in security calls out to you, but the bills don’t pay themselves. This is all common, and you’re a bit “stuck.”

So while you’re stuck, find ways to grow where you’re planted. Study. Network locally or online. Try a CTF or a hacking competition. Whatever you do, just keep growing yourself, your skillset and your network. You can do it. And before you know it, you’ll have that career helping to fight the good fight with the rest of us.

I believe in you! You got this!

## The one big thing

[Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/cybercriminal-abuse-of-large-language-models/) by using uncensored versions, developing their own malicious LLMs or "jailbreaking" legitimate ones to bypass safety protocols. These compromised or malicious LLMs are then used to generate highly convincing phishing campaigns, create harmful code and automate various cybercrime operations, making attacks more sophisticated and scalable.

### Why do I care?

Cybercriminals’ widespread abuse of LLMs lowers the barrier to entry for sophisticated attacks, making it easier for even less skilled actors to launch effective campaigns. This means you’re more likely to run into highly convincing phishing attempts, scams and malware that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate communications, putting your personal info and company security at higher risk.

### So now what?

Given this evolving threat landscape, it’s important to be extra vigilant and skeptical online. Treat all online communications with caution, even if they look perfectly authentic. For individuals, that means double-checking emails and messages for anything fishy, no matter how well-written they seem. For businesses, it's time to beef up your cybersecurity defenses, invest in smart threat detection and keep your employees sharp on how to spot and report these increasingly clever social engineering tricks.
