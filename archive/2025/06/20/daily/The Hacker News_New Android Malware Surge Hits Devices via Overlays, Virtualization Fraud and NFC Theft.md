[![New Android Malware](data:image/png;base64... "New Android Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjw31gxEOE5HyY99xsSUhTdnewf7Ow_mP2tQ03MRyMhIIuf4vtC2AgxHD-wCXKLwTMigFsqM5UC-mZ0sF_BDlwOaCzZWEM17TRU3vNaHVHKFPvLZhiPwIKS29ah2kiocEKxg1s39c9D5SZFBcjsZgmRl_vYUDPgqFFkXu6uN3fj9i8sJK8t5CXrG7A7U2Ty/s790-rw-e365/android-malware.jpg)

Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the inner workings of an Android malware called AntiDot that has compromised over 3,775 devices as part of 273 unique campaigns.

"Operated by the financially motivated threat actor LARVA-398, AntiDot is actively sold as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) on underground forums and has been linked to a wide range of mobile campaigns," PRODAFT [said](https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/antidot) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

AntiDot is advertised as a "three-in-one" solution with capabilities to record the device screen by abusing Android's accessibility services, intercept SMS messages, and extract sensitive data from third-party applications.

The Android botnet is suspected to be delivered via malicious advertising networks or through highly tailored phishing campaigns based on activity that indicates selective targeting of victims based on language and geographic location.

AntiDot was first [publicly documented](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/fake-antivirus-websites-deliver-malware.html) in May 2024 after it was spotted being distributed as Google Play updates to accomplish its information theft objectives.

Like other Android trojans, it features a wide range of capabilities to conduct overlay attacks, log keystrokes, and remotely control infected devices using Android's MediaProjection API. It also establishes a WebSocket communication to facilitate real-time, bi-directional communication between the infected device and an external server.

In December 2024, Zimperium [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/fake-recruiters-distribute-banking.html) details of a mobile phishing campaign that distributed an updated version of AntiDot dubbed AppLite Banker using job offer-themed decoys.

The latest findings from the Swiss cybersecurity company show that there are at least 11 active command-and-control (C2) servers in operation that are overseeing no less than 3,775 infected devices across 273 distinct campaigns.

A Java-based malware at its core, AntiDot is heavily obfuscated using a commercial packer to sidestep detection and analysis efforts. The malware, per PRODAFT, is delivered as part of a three-stage process that starts with an APK file.

"An inspection of the AndroidManifest file reveals that many class names do not appear in the original APK," the company said. "These missing classes are dynamically loaded by the packer during installation, and include malicious code extracted from an encrypted file. The entire mechanism is intentionally crafted to avoid detection by antivirus tools."

Once launched, it serves a bogus update bar and prompts the victim to grant it accessibility permissions, after which it unpacks and loads a DEX file incorporating the botnet functions.

A core feature of AntiDot is its ability to monitor for newly launched applications and serve and serve a bogus login screen from the C2 server when the victim opens a cryptocurrency- or payment-related app that the operators are interested in.

The malware also abuses accessibility services to gather extensive information about the contents of the active screens and sets itself as the default SMS app for capturing incoming and outgoing texts. Furthermore, it can monitor phone calls, block calls from specific numbers, or redirect them, effectively opening up more avenues for fraud.

Another important feature is that it can keep track of real-time notifications displayed in the device's status bar and takes steps to either dismiss or snooze them in a bid to suppress alerts and avoid alerting the user of suspicious activity.

PRODAFT said the C2 panel that powers the remote control functions is built using MeteorJS, an open-source JavaScript framework that enables real-time communication. The panel has six different tabs -

* Bots, which displays a list of all the compromised devices and their details
* Injects, which displays a list of all target apps for overlay injection and view the overlay template for each inject
* Analytic, which displays a list of applications installed on victim devices and likely used to identify new and popular apps for future targeting
* Settings, which contains the core configuration options for the panel, including updating the injects
* Gates, which is used to manage the infrastructure endpoints that the bots connect to
* Help, which offers support resources for using the malware

"AntiDot represents a scalable and evasive MaaS platform designed for financial gain through persistent control of mobile devices, especially in localized and language-specific regions," the company said. "The malware also employs WebView injection and overlay attacks to steal credentials, making it a serious threat to user privacy and device security."
