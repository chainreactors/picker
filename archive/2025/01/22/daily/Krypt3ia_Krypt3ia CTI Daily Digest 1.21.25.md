## Businesses prepare to update their cybersecurity playbooks for the Trump era amid increasing threats

The new administration hasn’t said much about its plans for combating the growing array of cyber threats facing Americans, but experts expect President Donald Trump to focus less on new regulation and more on cutting bureaucratic cyber red tape for industry and business.

The approach would mark a notable shift from the Biden administration’s [regulation-driven approach](https://fortune.com/2022/03/18/strengthening-american-cybersecurity-act-clear-incident-reporting-rules-biden-congress-sec-russia-tech-bipul-sinha/) to cybersecurity.

“I would be surprised if the Trump administration would embrace new categories of liability,”  said Brandon Pugh, policy director for R Street Institute’s Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team. Instead, Pugh reckons, the new administration might “look to other market forces that could get to the same outcomes.”

## New Mirai variant ‘Murdoc\_Botnet’ targets AVTECH cameras and Huawei routers

Researchers at cybersecurity software provider [Qualys Inc.](https://www.qualys.com/) are warning of a new Mirai botnet variant that’s being used to target vulnerabilities in AVTECH Cameras and Huawei HG523 routers.

The variant, dubbed “Murdoc\_Botnet,” was first detected in July and has already been found to have affected at least 1,300 devices globally, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, Mexico and Indonesia. Like all Mirai variants, the idea is to infect as many devices as possible to create new, extensive botnet networks.

## Russian ransomware hackers increasingly posing as tech support on Microsoft Teams

Russian cybercriminals are adopting a scam in which they pose as tech support on Microsoft Teams to convince victims they have an IT issue before tricking employees into allowing them to install ransomware on the targets’ computer networks.

British cybersecurity company Sophos reported on Thursday to have seen more than 15 incidents in which two separate groups used Microsoft Office 365’s default service settings to socially engineer their way onto a victim’s system.

## Ransomware attackers are “vishing” organizations via Microsoft Teams

The “email bombing + posing as tech support via Microsoft Teams” combination is proving fruitful for two threat actors looking to deliver ransomware to organizations, and they seem to be ramping up their efforts.

“Sophos MDR has observed more than 15 incidents involving these tactics in the past three months, with half of them in the past two weeks,” the company’s incident responders have warned today.
