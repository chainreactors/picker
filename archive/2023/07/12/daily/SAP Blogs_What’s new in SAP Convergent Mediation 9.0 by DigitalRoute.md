# **SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 by DigitalRoute**

## New Release

### Public![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/02/Picture1-44.png)

###

### July 2023

We are delighted to announce the general availability of **SAP Convergent** **Mediation 9.0 by DigitalRoute**. Major innovations have been introduced driven by customer demand and technology trends. These include new functionalities as well as improved security and performance.

This blog provides you with the highlights of this major modernization that is the largest product update in several years. The SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 will benefit our [SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management](https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/billing-revenue-innovation-management.html) (BRIM) customers as they upgrade to this new release.

---

Development has been focused on three main areas:

1. User Experience and Productivity

2. Cyber Security and Compliance

3. Cloud Integration

**User Experience and Productivity**

SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 Design Client Web UI – light theme

The brand-new web-based user interface is more intuitive, easier to manage (zero install on the desktop) and easier to secure. In addition, this new web-based interface is also foundational in providing adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, ensuring an inclusive experience for users with disabilities and key to comply to US government section 508 requirements.

For productivity, many customers want to reduce regression test effort via automated tests. In this new version there is a Unit Test Framework where users can define and execute unit test scenarios via Python, create and run tests for global APL functions.

Enhanced operational features also include a new transport mechanism and the ability to track all UDRs in a workflow with filters. See following [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3349719) for more detail.

**Cyber Security and Compliance**

The platform has been thoroughly updated to run on Java 17 which brings enhanced security, performance, and support.

SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 - Login with SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) is a critical requirement in large Enterprises within the SOX compliance scope. Convergent Mediation 9.0 now supports OIDC single sign-on. To enable centralized user management and control, it is now possible to tie SAP Convergent Mediation by DigitalRoute to a centralized identity provider. This enables users to log in using SSO, along with multi-factor authentication flows.

Other security improvements are found in [SAP Note](https://me.sap.com/notes/3349719).

**Cloud Integration**

SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 by DigitalRoute continues the product’s investment in hyperscaler support for BRIM customers.

Google Cloud Storage and Azure Data Explorer

In this new version it is now possible to move data between systems using Google Cloud Storage using two new agents: GCP Storage Collection and GCP Storage Forwarding.

This new version also provides support for Azure Data Explorer which is a service for real-time analysis on large volumes of data from all types of applications. SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 by DigitalRoute is now able to enrich transactions with derived data insights from Azure Data Explorer.

That’s all on our latest product release. Thank you for reading today’s blog post.

We are excited about the new functionalities in SAP Convergent Mediation 9.0 by DigitalRoute and recommend you to upgrade to benefit from them in your BRIM deployment.

Stay tuned and take care!

Best regards, SAP Convergent Mediation product team
