Organizations need to respond to fast-changing, dynamic environments. They often ask employees to do more, with less. As a result, finding team members who are recognized as ‚Äúall-rounders‚Äù can be extremely impactful to address the needs of the group, especially when there are gaps or missing parts.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/KartikCircleProfile.png)

An ‚Äúall-rounder‚Äù can be extremely valuable and is often rare to find. They represent individuals who perform different duties for the team, balance their workload, and help deliver tangible results. The skills associated with an ‚Äúall-rounder‚Äôs‚Äù contributions are learned over time through education, experiences, and observations.

For d0f353a852194dd0ac50cd72fca47323, SAP Champion, SAP Press Author, blogger, keynote speaker, and Principal Business Analyst at Ellucian, he knows the importance of participating as an ‚Äúall-rounder‚Äù in a team setting. He appreciates that individuals with versatility can help specialists and cross-teams make connections,
and ensure that deliverables are deployed, with the highest degree of accuracy.

It was great to catch up with Kartik from his home office in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Take a look at his recent [SAP Champions video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtIZrMShVL0) describing his career journey, learnings, and career tips.

**Stacey Fish (SF):** **Hi Kartik! You‚Äôve come full circle from a higher education standpoint! From the University of Mumbai, then to the University of California (Los Angeles), and now as a Principal Business Analyst at Ellucian where the global team supports 2,700+ higher education customers and 21+ million students. What inspired you to develop a career around strategy and automating business processes?![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/Kartik1.png)**

**Kartik Dua (KD):** Great question! I have been very fortunate to have this kind of versatility in my education. As I reflect, now is the time to show my gratitude towards the education industry by doing what I do at Ellucian.

The inspiration for my career comes from the passion I have for technology. With the emerging technologies associated with automation and machine learning era, I find my sweet spot in these areas and in strategizing processes for the businesses I support, and in partnering with many stakeholders.

**SF: One of your passions is to contribute to the Ellucian Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) (aka Affinity Groups) program dedicated to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Which ERG(s) do you focus on? What type of activities are taking place to help employees with talent development?**

**KD:** Love this question. There are many ERGs I volunteer for. One of them, where I am a committee member, is called ERG Harmony. This ERG honors and supports folks from the Asia PAC regions. We celebrate festivals, do book clubs, invite guest speakers, hold events to support charities and non-profits physically and monetarily, cooking events, rewards and recognition, and the list goes on. Ellucian is big on DEI and ERGs, and I simply love the organization for making it a priority.

**SF: In your blog, ‚Äú**[**3 SkiLLLs which will make you a Champion!‚Äù**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/16/3-skillls-which-will-make-you-a-champion/) **you reference skillful listening, learning, and leading (*****Note: The 3 ‚ÄúLs‚Äù was on purpose! :-)).*** **Given these vital skills‚Ä¶How did you become an SAP Champion? How do you apply them to engaging with SAP Community members?**
