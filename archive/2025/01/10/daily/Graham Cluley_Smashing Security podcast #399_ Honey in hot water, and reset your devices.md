Ever wonder how those ‚Äúfree‚Äù browser extensions that promise to save you money actually work? We dive deep into the controversial world of Honey, the coupon-finding tool owned by PayPal, and uncover a scheme that might be leaving you with less savings and your favorite YouTubers with empty pockets.

Plus, we take a look at Kagi, the search engine you pay not to show you adverts, and discuss what you should do with your old, no-longer-wanted technology.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
