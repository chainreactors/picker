# Fake AI video generator tools lure in Facebook and LinkedIn users to deliver malware

Posted: May 28, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Cybercriminals are taking advantage of the public’s interest in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) and delivering malware via text-to-video tools.

According to [researchers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/cybercriminals-weaponize-fake-ai-websites?hl=en) at Mandiant, the criminals are setting up websites claiming to offer “AI video generator” services, and then using those fake tools to distribute information stealers, Trojans, and backdoors.

Links to the malicious websites were brought to the researchers’ attention by ads and links in comments on social media platforms. The researchers uncovered thousands of malicious ads on Facebook and LinkedIn—beginning in November 2024—that promote fake AI video generator tools such as “Luma AI,” “Canva Dream Lab,” and “Kling AI.”

To avoid detection, the group constantly rotates the domain used in the ads and creates new ads every day, while using both compromised and newly created accounts. The campaign operates through more than 30 websites that imitate popular legitimate AI tools.

Researchers identified the first payload as the Starkveil [dropper](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-dropper) (detected by Malwarebytes/ThreatDown) classified as [Trojan.Crypt](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-crypt). The [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan), written in Rust, requires users to run it twice to fully compromise their machines. After the first run, the malware displays an error window to trick victims into executing it again.

The dropper then deploys the XWorm (detected as [Backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor).XWorm) and Frostrift (detected as Trojan.Crypt) backdoors and the GRIMPULL [downloader](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-downloader) (also detected as Trojan.Crypt).

After it has fully compromised the system, this constellation of malware will harvest all kinds of data from the infected devices and send it to the cybercriminals using various methods of communication. For a full technical analysis of the malware, feel free to read the [researchers’ report](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/cybercriminals-weaponize-fake-ai-websites?hl=en).

## How to avoid fake AI tool scams

The researchers stated:

> “The temptation to try the latest AI tool can lead to anyone becoming a victim.”

So, it’s important to be aware of these campaigns and adopt ways to recognize and thwart them.

* Be vigilant. Posts or ads with high numbers of views that promise free AI text-to-video tools are a red flag and should be examined carefully, especially if they prompt downloads of executable files, which could be disguised as videos.
* Don’t trust unsolicited messages or ads promising unbelievable AI tools or free trials, especially if they pressure you to act quickly or provide [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).
* Run up-to-date and [active protection](https://www.malwarebytes.com/pricing) to intercept these [malware infections](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) in the early stages, as well as detect and remove infostealer malware.
