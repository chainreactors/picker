I wanted to write this Blog for quite some time now. I have been working with SAP Sales Cloud in various functions at SAP for over ten years. Along the way, I had the honour of exchanging with our large customer community within the Retail and Consumer Product industry. And although the Retail Execution functionalities (REX) and the concept that we call the “Perfect Store” might be well-known to many of our pure Retail Customers and Sales Cloud users, I am often surprised how this set of features is still a best-kept secret to so many other Sales Cloud Customers that could benefit from it.

In this blog, I will outline the essential features that make up our Retail Execution offering in SAP Sales Cloud and combine them with Best Practices and the expertise that I collected over the last years in exchange with our customers. A little spoiler: Retail Execution does not only help Retailers – many other customers, industries and processes can benefit from a highly structured activity management – like the one that Retail Execution in SAP Sales Cloud provides.

> Who can benefit from the REX Features in SAP Sales Cloud? - Almost everyone who produces or sells products for end consumers! And it does not matter if you are selling B2B2C and are dependent on Partners as your Points of Sales or if you run your stores and outlets yourself (B2C).

In today's competitive consumer products world, maximising sales performance and ensuring a seamless shopping experience is critical for success. With SAP Retail Execution, businesses can create the perfect store to meet expectations where purchasing decisions are made.

Let us break up the Retail Process into these main sections:

+ Establishing your Retail Notion (including KPIs and Processes)
+ Visit Planning and Prioritization
+ Visit Execution (including Shelf Management, Task Management, Audits and Order Management
+ Analytics and Reporting

**Establishing your Retail Notion**

![Picture1.jpg](/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/183277iDF5D2D72604A5514/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "Picture1.jpg")

the Circle of Excellence - Plan, Execute, Analyse and Repeat!

Software or features will only help you grow your business if you have clarity on your goals, KPIs and processes.

The Perfect Store Concept can guide you: Think of the “Perfect Store” for your brand and products. What would the perfect outlet/point of sales look like? Where would you need to be present in the store? How many shelf meters do you want to take over? Where should your Products be placed? What other criteria make up a guarantee for your success? Pricing Compliance? Avoiding Out-of-Stock Situations? Placement in the Store? How many times should your Sales Rep visit? What activities should they do? Any checklists to run regularly? Etc. Etc.

> If you now, want to stop reading because you think: “No, we do not have Stores as an Important Point of Sales”. Stay with me. Just exchange the STORE for whatever makes sense in your sales process: The Perfect Bar, perhaps? The Perfect Optician? The Perfect Repair Shop? The Perfect Partner? – The Store in Perfect Store is a synonym for your products’ perfect outlet/point of sales.

Do you have that vision set? Are your requirements clear? Perfect. Let us see what SAP Sales Cloud can do for you:

**Score and Benchmark your In-Store Strategies**

The Perfect Store solution is a methodology that makes the most of retail execution information and takes a highly disciplined approach to achieving maximum sales.

**Business Configuration (Prep and Scoping)**

Enable Perfect Store features in your system: Edit Project Scope -> Scoping -> Industry Solution -> Consumer Product Extended -> Perfect Store Execution.

Scoping

***Relevant Scoping Questions:***

To enable greater precision in scores:

+ Check scoping question: ‘Would you like to see KPI values in decimal?

+ To enable adding of visual images to plot PoEs in an Engagement Map, enable scoping question: **‘Would you like to utilise visuals at the time of setting up your Engagement Maps?’**

+ To enable standard tasks and survey determination via activity plans (facets) in additional to PSE objectives, enable scoping question: **‘Would you like to enable standard task and survey (worklist) determination for perfect store visits**

+ To enable survey-based store scoring (this will disable KPI-based scoring but will still allow you to create and measure KPIs), enable scoping question: **‘Would you like to enable survey-based scoring for perfect store?’**
