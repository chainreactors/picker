# U.S. Anti-Piracy Bills See Headline Blocking Claim Squeezed By Democracy

With two pirate site blocking bills under discussion in the U.S., and a third expected in the weeks ahead, a key statistic seems to be shrinking. During 2024 it was claimed that site blocking is a common tool in ~60 countries, a figure now reframed as "50 democratic countries" in the latest blocking bill. Yet if countries are excluded from the total on the basis they have never blocked, no longer block, or fail to meet the democratic threshold, the total may shrink to less than 40.

In 2012, America missed a golden opportunity to show the world how site blocking and other internet restrictions could be deployed at scale to protect rightsholders’ revenues.

Vast opposition led to the SOPA bill being withdrawn but elsewhere, site blocking was being introduced in one country after another, driven by the same core rightsholders.

Claims that the United States needed to catch up led to a new push towards site blocking. After publicly getting underway in January, a key statistic concerning the common use of blocking outside the U.S. seems to have changed its appearance.

## Blocking Democracy

Confirmation that site-blocking was back on the political agenda was announced at CinemaCon in April 2024.

“Site-blocking is a common tool in almost 60 countries, including leading democracies and many of America’s closest allies,” MPA Chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin [informed](https://www.motionpictures.org/remarks/charles-rivkin-state-of-the-industry-address-at-cinemacon-2024/) the audience.

“So today, here with you at CinemaCon, I’m announcing the next major phase of this effort: the MPA is going to work with Members of Congress to enact judicial site-blocking legislation here in the United States.”

The [FADPA](https://torrentfreak.com/new-bill-aims-to-block-foreign-pirate-sites-in-the-u-s-250129/) bill, the yet-to-be-published [ACPA](https://torrentfreak.com/fears-of-overblocking-unite-critics-of-u-s-pirate-site-blocking-bill/) bill, and new addition [Block BEARD](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-senators-introduce-new-pirate-site-blocking-bill-block-beard/) bill, represent three different takes on a familiar site-blocking recipe.

Each bill contains more or less of the same core ingredients utilized in countries engaged in blocking elsewhere. The headline figure of 60 countries may have needed some initial adjustment, and potentially even more after democracy entered the site-blocking equation.

“This targeted legal tool mirrors successful approaches used in over 50 democratic countries,” the background text for the Block BEARD bill [explains](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2025/7/tillis-colleagues-introduce-framework-to-combat-foreign-online-piracy-protect-american-copyright-holders).

## Site Blocking and Democracy

![block beard bill](https://torrentfreak.com/images/block-beard-bill.png)
If site blocking is a common tool in 60 countries around the world, having 50 democracies in the mix seems to imply that blocking is compatible with democratic values.

While that may well be the case, it doesn’t explain the sudden disappearance of 10 countries, which in theory could include “leading democracies” and/or close American allies.

In reality, quietly disposing of a few isn’t such a bad idea. While many countries block pirate sites, some also have a tendency to block other sites for different reasons, including around election time to ensure a ‘fair’ vote. These countries swell the numbers, but on balance the optics aren’t that great.

Framing site blocking as popular in democracies isn’t new. However, the headline figure of 60 countries in which the MPA previously [reported positive site-blocking experiences, “with one of the most effective tools” in the toolbox](https://www.ipophil.gov.ph/news/ipophl-mpa-hopes-for-swift-passage-of-site-blocking-law-amid-new-study-showing-cyber-threats-in-piracy-sites/), has no corresponding public list of countries for reference.

As a result, determining how 60 sites became 50 isn’t straightforward. That being said, presentations made available by the World Intellectual Property Organization show blocking countries on a map of the world, and color coded to show the blocking mechanisms they use.

The only thing left to do was add them all up.

## Site-Blocking Countries Part 1

Using the presentation slides, data from other sources, and a more clearly defined map, we attempted to identify every country present in the most recent original dated February 2025 *(above/far right, below/grayed out)* to compile a more detailed list.

![siteblockingmpa1jaa](https://torrentfreak.com/images/siteblockingmpa1jaa.png)

*Countries potentially identified: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, Vietnam (30 countries)*

Based on the original map, all of these countries block sites on copyright grounds, but how many are democracies?

![democornot1a](https://torrentfreak.com/images/democornot1a.png)
***Full democracy (22), Flawed democracy (3) Not a democracy (6)***

We assume the 22 full democracies above are among the ~50 countries referenced in the bill, but since there’s no official list with every country named, we don’t know which of the remaining countries are accounted for.

## Site-Blocking Countries Part 2

![siteblockingmpa2jaa](https://torrentfreak.com/images/siteblockingmpa2jaa.png)

*Countries potentially identified: Argentina, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Democratic Republic Of Congo, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mexico, Niger, Paraguay, Peru, Republic Of Congo, Senegal, Uruguay, Venezuela (23 countries)*

Based on the original map, all of these countries block sites on copyright grounds, but how many are democracies?

![democornot2a](https://torrentfreak.com/images/democornot2a.png)
***Full democracy (2), Flawed democracy (11), Not a democracy (10)***

We assume the pair of full democracies are among the ~50 countries referenced in the bill, but since a comprehensive list remains elusive, we draw no firm conclusions.

Overall, we’ll also assume that both full and flawed democracies from both sets qualify for inclusion, which leaves us with 22 full democracies and 14 flawed democracies. That’s 36 countries in total but still short of the ~50 required. If anyone has any additional details to share, please feel free to [contact us](https://torrentfreak.com/contact/).

## Additional Countries and Aggressive Blockers

Countries that allow site blocking that we initially missed include Israel (barely visible but indeed present on the MPA’s ma...
