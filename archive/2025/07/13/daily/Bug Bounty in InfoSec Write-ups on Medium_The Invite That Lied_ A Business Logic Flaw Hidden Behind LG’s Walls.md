I wasn‚Äôt chasing a bounty this time.
 This time, the thrill was different ‚Äî I wanted to earn a **Letter of Appreciation** from LG.

Not a bug bounty. Not a write-up trophy. Just a clean, solid find. Something they‚Äôd remember.

Because when you‚Äôre dealing with a brand like LG ‚Äî where polish meets production ‚Äî **you know there‚Äôs more beneath the surface**.

So, I did what I do best: opened my recon toolkit, fired up some intuition, and started hunting for cracks in the logic.

## üïµÔ∏è Step One: Recon at Scale

My recon game started with a weapon I absolutely love: **ShrewdEye**.

It pulls out subdomains like magic ‚Äî raw, downloadable, no UI fluff.

```
wget https://shrewdeye.app/domains/<domain_name>.txt
```

The file dropped, and with it came **hundreds of subdomains** ‚Äî some dormant, some suspicious, and a few‚Ä¶ *just alive enough* to be dangerous.

I filtered down the list for targets with `200 OK` responses.

And then I saw it.

A subdomain I won‚Äôt name here (*you know the drill*), but let‚Äôs just call it:

`xyz.redacted.lg.com`

It wasn‚Äôt just alive.
 It was buzzing ‚Äî login flows, invitation systems, beta-looking dashboards just like every other normal web-app

The kind of place where real bugs hide in **real logic**.

## üîÅ The Feature That Felt Too Predictable

I headed straight for the **‚ÄúInvite via Email‚Äù** flow.

At first glance, it was clean.

You send an invite ‚Üí The user gets an email ‚Üí They register.

Nice and boring.

So I started testing for **rate limiting**, **race conditions**, and all the usual suspects. I was even hammering requests just to see if it cracked.

Nothing explosive happened.

No duplicate invites.
 No crazy invite flooding.
 No race-based privilege escalations.

Honestly? It was getting dull.

So I leaned back and thought:

> *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do something stupid. Let‚Äôs check if the system is even linking the invitation email to the registered account.‚Äù*

**Basic stuff. Almost boring.**
 But that‚Äôs the thing about boring checks ‚Äî **they often reveal the most absurd bugs**.

And this one? It wasn‚Äôt just a bug.

It was a glitch in reality.

[## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª ‚ÄúI Didn‚Äôt Plan to Find a P1‚Ä¶ But My Script Had Other Plans üß†üí£‚Äù

### üé¨ It all started with a YouTube video‚Ä¶

infosecwriteups.com](/%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F-i-didnt-plan-to-find-a-p1-but-my-script-had-other-plans-77691a46985b?source=post_page-----a49cca506294---------------------------------------)

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è The Check That Shouldn‚Äôt Have Mattered

I sent an invite to `testvictim@gmail.com`.

The email came through.
 I clicked the invite link.
 Registration page opened.

At this point, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. Just wanted to see **whether an account gets created only if the person is just invited without being registered !**

(If you‚Äôre into bug hunting, and haven‚Äôt ever asked this question, *note it down*. Seriously.)

Then I noticed something weird:

The email field wasn‚Äôt locked. It was editable.

Surely that was just a frontend thing, right?

So I typed in `attacker@gmail.com` instead.
 Typed a password. Hit submit.

And it‚Ä¶ **worked**.

The system happily created an account for `attacker@gmail.com`.

No warnings. No validation errors. No logs I could see.

But here‚Äôs the real kicker:

> ***In the admin dashboard, the system said that `` had accepted the invitation.***

Read that again.

* The **real invited user**? No account. Never signed up.
* The **attacker**? Full access, brand-new account.
* The **system**? Totally unaware anything was wrong

[## üí• CVE-2025‚Äì0133 Made Easy ‚Äî Find Vulnerable Assets in 2 Minutes

### You don‚Äôt need fancy tools. You just need good eyes and the right search queries. Here‚Äôs how I easily find real‚Ä¶

infosecwriteups.com](/cve-2025-0133-made-easy-find-vulnerable-assets-in-2-minutes-140a9ba8e2da?source=post_page-----a49cca506294---------------------------------------)

## üí• The Ghost Account Problem

This wasn‚Äôt just a small validation mistake.

It was a **fundamental logic flaw**.

The backend wasn‚Äôt binding the invitation token to the original email.
 It just accepted *anyone* who had the link.

Worse ‚Äî **it marked the wrong person as registered**.

That means:

* Analytics are broken.
* Referral logs are fake.
* Trust assumptions are completely shattered.

It *looked* like the invite was used.
 It *looked* like the right person signed up.

But no one knew the real user never even touched it.

If you‚Äôre a dev or security analyst reading this, **note this bug down**:

> *üî¥* ‚ÄúInvited email address can be altered during registration. Account is created under a different email, but the original invite is falsely marked accepted.‚Äù

### Let me take you on an exciting journey of how I uncovered a massive security flaw in a professional networking‚Ä¶

## üîö Conclusion: The Invite That Lied

This wasn‚Äôt a zero-day.
 There was no shell, no script injection, no bypass chain.

But it was **just as dangerous**.

An editable input field ‚Äî seemingly harmless ‚Äî let me impersonate users, skew business data, and expose the entire invitation logic as **fake trust**.

 If I had skipped the ‚Äúsanity test‚Äù...
