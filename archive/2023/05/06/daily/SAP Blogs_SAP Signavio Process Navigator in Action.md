Dear Community Members,

Few days back, SAP launched Process Navigator by SAP which is now called SAP Signavio Process Navigator as described by my colleague in his blog [Winning together: SAP Signavio Process Explorer and SAP Signavio Process Navigator join forces.](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/05/winning-together-sap-signavio-process-explorer-and-sap-signavio-process-navigator-join-forces/)

In this blog, I’d would like to showcase how to navigate & leverage the capabilities of **SAP Signavio Process Navigator.** By now, we are aware that **SAP Signavio Process Navigator** is a cloud native service **providing insights** and **best practices** into **SAP’s process portfolio.**

We can navigate to SAP Signavio Process Navigator via the link [Process Navigator - SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/processnavigator). The landing page of SAP Signavio Process Navigator is as shown below:

Home Page

On the home page, we have two tiles:

**Solution Scenario:** This provides us the list of SAP Best Practices for various SAP Solutions i.e., SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central etc. with the latest version of that solution on offer. It also provides us various Solution Scenarios for End-to-End Business Processes such as Lead to Cash, Source to Pay etc.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/05/2-5.png)

Solution Scenario View

**Solution Process:**  This provides us the list of various solution process provided by SAP Solutions. The user can filter based on Version, Country/Region & Name of the Solution Process. You can also filter based on the Scope Item Number if you remember it ![:winking_face:](/html/@27CADAAF49AA8A48479FAEF452C414F3/emoticons/1f609.png ":winking_face:")

Solution Process View

Solution Process based on a filter.

Now, I would like to showcase how SAP Best Practices for a solution looks like. In this blog, I have taken the example of **SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.**

From the **Solution Scenario Tile**, I scroll down and click on **SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.** Once I click on it, the below shown page is displayed.

SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud

On the left-hand side, we have the **Version & the Country/Region** for which we are viewing the solution scenario. User can change the Country/Region from the dropdown as per his/her wish.

On the top right corner, there is a **Download** button to download the SAP Best Practices.

Below **Version & the Country/Region**, we have three tabs namely **Solution Process, Related Assets & Description.**

Under **Solution Process Tab**, we have different **Line of Business** and the corresponding **Solution Process** for that Line of Business. We can expand the **Line of Business** to list various **Solution Process Groups** which can be clicked upon to view the **Solution Process** within it.

User can also search directly for a Solution Process by providing the name of the solution process or the scope item number in the search box provided in the Solution Process area.

Solution Process in SAP Best Practices for SAP S/4HANA Cloud

Once I click on the Solution Process, a new page is displayed. In this blog, I have taken the example of **Automotive Supply to Customer – Inventory Management (55F)**

As soon as the page is loaded, we view the **Solution Process Flow** for the Solution Process.
