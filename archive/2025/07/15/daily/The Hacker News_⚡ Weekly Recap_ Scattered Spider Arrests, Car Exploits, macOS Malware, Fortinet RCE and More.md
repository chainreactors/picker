In cybersecurity, precision matters‚Äîand there's little room for error. A small mistake, missed setting, or quiet misconfiguration can quickly lead to much bigger problems. The signs we're seeing this week highlight deeper issues behind what might look like routine incidents: outdated tools, slow response to risks, and the ongoing gap between compliance and real security.

For anyone responsible for protecting systems, the key isn't just reacting to alerts‚Äîit's recognizing the larger patterns and hidden weak spots they reveal.

Here's a breakdown of what's unfolding across the cybersecurity world this week.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[NCA Arrests for Alleged Scattered Spider Members](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/four-arrested-in-440m-cyber-attack-on.html)** ‚Äî The U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) announced that four people have been arrested in connection with cyber attacks targeting major retailers Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods. The arrested individuals include two men aged 19, a third aged 17, and a 20-year-old woman. They were apprehended in the West Midlands and London on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and participating in the activities of an organized crime group. They are believed to be associated with the notorious cybercrime group known as Scattered Spider, an offshoot of a loose-knit collective called The Com, which is responsible for a vast catalog of crimes, including social engineering, phishing, SIM swapping, extortion, sextortion, swatting, kidnapping, and murder.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[PerfektBlue Bluetooth Flaws Expose Millions of Vehicles to Remote Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/perfektblue-bluetooth-vulnerabilities.html)** ‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a set of four security flaws in OpenSynergy's BlueSDK Bluetooth stack that, if successfully exploited, could allow remote code execution on millions of transport vehicles from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Skoda. "PerfektBlue exploitation attack is a set of critical memory corruption and logical vulnerabilities found in OpenSynergy BlueSDK Bluetooth stack that can be chained together to obtain Remote Code Execution (RCE)," PCA Cyber Security said. Volkswagen said the identified issues exclusively concern Bluetooth and that neither is vehicle safety nor integrity affected. It also noted that exploitation of the vulnerabilities is only possible when several conditions are met simultaneously.
* **[North Korean Hacker Behind Fraudulent IT Worker Scheme Sanctioned](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/us-sanctions-north-korean-andariel.html)** ‚Äî The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Tuesday sanctioned a member of a North Korean hacking group called Andariel for their role in the infamous remote information technology (IT) worker scheme. Song Kum Hyok, 38, is alleged to have enabled the fraudulent operation by using foreign-hired IT workers to seek remote employment with U.S. companies and planning to split income with them. The sanctions mark the first time a threat actor linked to Andariel, a sub-cluster within the Lazarus Group, has been tied to the IT worker scheme. "While the Treasury's announcement marks a formal public association of the Andariel (APT45) hacking group with North Korea's remote IT worker operation, the connection reflects a much broader and long-running pattern," Michael "Barni" Barnhart, Principal i3 Insider Risk Investigator at DTEX, told The Hacker News.
* **[Chinese Hacker Arrested for Silk Typhoon Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/chinese-hacker-xu-zewei-arrested-for.html)** ‚Äî A Chinese national has been arrested in Milan, Italy, for his alleged links to a state-sponsored hacking group known as Silk Typhoon and for carrying out cyber attacks against American organizations and government agencies. Xu Zewei, 33, has been accused of being involved in the U.S. computer intrusions between February 2020 and June 2021, including a mass attack spree that leveraged then-zero-day flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server, a cluster of activity the Windows maker designed as Hafnium. Xu, alongside co-defendant and Chinese national Zhang Yu, are believed to have undertaken the attacks based on directions issued by the Ministry of State Security's (MSS) Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB).
* **[Threat Weaponize Leaked Version of Shellter to Distribute Stealers](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/hackers-use-leaked-shellter-tool.html)** ‚Äî Hackers are exploiting a popular red teaming tool called Shellter to distribute stealer malware and remote access trojans. The campaigns are believed to have started in April 2025, around the same time a company that procured a licensed version of the software leaked a copy on cybercrime forums. "Although the Shellter Project is a victim in this case through intellectual property loss and futu...
