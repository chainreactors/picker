# How Secure Texting for Healthcare Improves Patient Portals

October 3rd, 2024

Patient portals were once hailed as a game-changing tool for healthcare companies to engage patients throughout their healthcare journey. In theory, they offer a convenient platform where patients and customers can access their medical records, communicate with their providers or suppliers, book appointments, and even pay bills—safely and securely. But despite the optimism around patient portals, the reality is much more complex. Adoption rates remain stubbornly low, and many patients simply don’t like using them.

So, why is this the case? More importantly, how does the relatively mediocre adoption of patient portals impact patient engagement, outcomes, and overall cost?

In this post, we’ll take a closer look at the shortcomings of patient portals, share current trends in patient and customer communication preferences, and explore how text communication can improve portal adoption and patient engagement.

### **Why Patient Portals Aren’t Enough**

At their core, patient portals are online platforms that provide access to a range of healthcare-related services. These services typically include:

* Access to medical records
* Secure messaging with healthcare providers
* Appointment scheduling
* Prescription refill requests
* Bill payments

These portals were designed with good intentions, but as we’ll discuss, they often fall short of delivering the seamless, user-friendly experience that people expect today.

### **Preferences for Healthcare Communications**

Healthcare communication preferences have shifted. Today’s patients don’t just want portals—they want a range of communication options, from phone calls and emails to secure texts. According to a 2023 survey by [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en), patients’ preferred communication channels include:

* **Phone Calls:** 62% of patients still prefer phone conversations with their healthcare providers.
* **Email:** 44% like receiving emails for lab results, appointment reminders, and other updates.
* **Text Messaging:** 37% of patients prefer receiving healthcare communications via text, particularly for reminders and follow-ups.
* **Patient Portals:** Only 28% of patients prefer using portals for routine interactions.

There are several reasons why people are reluctant to adopt patient portals, including:

* **Complexity:** Many portals can be clunky, difficult to navigate, and not user-friendly. Patients and customers often find it difficult to log in, locate their information, or contact their provider or supplier through the portal.
* **Lack of Engagement:** Patients are rarely encouraged to use these portals consistently, and some are unaware they even exist.
* **Concerns About Security:** While patient portals are designed to be secure, many patients still harbor concerns about their personal health information being compromised.
* **Limited Access:** Some portals only provide limited access to medical records, appointment scheduling, or other information, making them less useful.

Relying solely on patient portals leaves a significant portion of patients and customers under-served. By integrating secure texting apps into their engagement strategies, healthcare providers, payers and suppliers can diversify their communication methods and connect with patients and customers more effectively across the channels they prefer.

### **How Secure Texting Complements Patient Portals**

Secure texting apps for healthcare solve many of the issues patient portals alone cannot. By offering an additional, patient-friendly communication channel, these apps improve patient engagement and streamline interactions.

Here’s how secure texting apps work:

* **Secure Access to Patient Portals:** Secure texting apps allow patients to access ePHI and other sensitive information directly from mobile devices via regular SMS text messages.
* **Instant Notifications & Alerts:** Patients and customers can click on a link in text messages and view information in a secure mobile web browser on their smartphones or tablets, including appointment reminders, updates, product upgrades and promotions.
* **User-friendly:** Most secure texting apps are designed with usability in mind, offering an intuitive, seamless experience  – with no new applications required.

By offering secure texting as an additional communication channel, healthcare organizations can reach more patients and customers, and improve engagement by offering patients multiple channel options for communication and easier access to portals.

### **Security and HIPAA Compiance**

It’s essential to note that not all texting apps are appropriate for healthcare use. Traditional text messaging services don’t offer the level of encryption and security required by HIPAA regulations, making them risky for exchanging protected health information (PHI).

LuxSci’s secure texting for healthcare ensures that patient and customer communications comply with HIPAA’s strict privacy and security standards. Our secure texting solution offers encryption, authentication, and data protection, ensuring that patients can directly and safely access portals for viewing health information, treatment plans, payments, promotions and more.

### **Benefits of Secure Texting for Healthcare**

Adopting secure texting apps for healthcare, alongside other communication tools, including email and web forms, brings numerous benefits to both patients and providers, including:

* **Increased Engagement:** Patients and customers are more likely to respond and engage with providers through their preferred communication method, not just a portal.
* **Improved Outcomes and Results:** Engaged patients are more likely to adhere to their treatment plans, stay informed and use the right products, improving overall health outcomes.
* **Lower Costs and Greater Efficiency:** Better communication leads to fewer missed appointments, more efficient processes and greater patient participation in their healthcare journeys.
* **Greater Satisfaction:** Patients and customers appreciate having a choice in how they communicate with their providers and healthcare suppliers, leading to higher satisfaction, loyalty and trust.
* **Reduce Missed Appointments:** Instant notifications and reminders via text can help patients stay on top of their appointments and follow-ups.

### **Secure Texting is Key to Modern Healthcare Communication**

Patient portals alone are no longer enough to drive the kind of patient engagement needed for optimal healthcare outcomes. By integrating secure texting apps for healthcare with other communication tools like email and web forms, providers can offer a more patient-centric approach to healthcare communication.

At LuxSci, we’re committed to helping healthcare providers offer secure, HIPAA-compliant communication solutions that improve patient engagement, outcomes and results. By giving patients the flexibility to choose their preferred communication channel—whether it’s secure texting, email, phone, or a patient portal—you can increase engagement, improve outcomes, and lower costs.
