In August, the Tulsa police department held a [press conference](https://ktul.com/news/local/tulsa-police-to-hold-press-conference-about-success-of-flock-safety-devices) about how its new Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs), a [controversial](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/flock-license-plate-reader-homeowners-association-safe-problems) piece of surveillance technology, was the policing equivalent of “turning the lights on” for the first time. In Ontario, California, the city put out a [press release](https://www.ontarioca.gov/press_releases/flock-cameras-assist-apprehension-burglary-suspect) about how its ALPRs were a “vital resource.” In Madison, South Dakota, [local news](https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/09/01/how-states-first-flock-safety-camera-busted-car-thieves-madison/) covered how the city’s expenditure of $30,000 for ALPRs “paid off” twice in two days.

All these stories have two things in common: One, they are all about the same brand of ALPRs, Flock Safety.
