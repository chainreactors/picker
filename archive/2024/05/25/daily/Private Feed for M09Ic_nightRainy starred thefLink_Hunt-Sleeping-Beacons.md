This project is ( mostly ) a callstack scanner which tries to identify IOCs indicating an unpacked or injected C2 agent.

All checks are based on the observation that C2 agents wait between their callbacks causing the beacons thread to idle and this tool aims to analyze what potentially caused the thread to idle.

This includes traditional IOCs, such as unbacked memory or stomped modules, but also attempts to detect multiple implementation of sleepmasks using APCs or Timers. The latter is done by both: analyzing the callstack but also **enumerating timers and their exact ...
