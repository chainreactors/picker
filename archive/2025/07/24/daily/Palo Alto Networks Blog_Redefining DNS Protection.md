# Palo Alto Networks Launches Resolver-Based Advanced DNS Security

### Secure every DNS request and response in real time. Now easier than ever to deploy.

DNS-layer attacks are evolving fast, and attackers are actively exploiting gaps left by traditional defenses. It’s time to rethink how we protect this foundational internet protocol. Palo Alto Networks has long led the way in DNS threat prevention with Advanced DNS Security (ADNS) – a solution purpose-built to give organizations and customers stronger, more intelligent protection at the DNS layer.

ADNS inspects both DNS requests and responses in real time, stopping threats like command and control (C2), DNS tunneling and data exfiltration before they can impact users or systems. This level of real-time response inspection is unique to Palo Alto Networks and sets our DNS Security apart from other solutions. Every day, ADNS analyzes up to 1.1 billion new domains, prevents up to 7.7 million new malicious domains, and blocks up to 2.06 billion threats inline, delivering the scale, precision and protection that organizations need to stay ahead.

ADNS leverages [Precision AI](/resources/ebooks/strata-revolutionize-your-security-posture-with-cloud-delivered-security-services-powered-by-precision-AI)®, our proprietary AI system that combines deep learning, machine learning and generative AI to deliver unmatched DNS-layer protection. This same intelligence analyzes up to 5.43 billion new events, identifies up to 8.95 million never-before-seen attacks, and blocks up to 30.9 billion attacks inline every day, giving customers real-time detection and prevention of threats that others may miss.

Now we’re taking that same high-efficacy protection and extending it across an organization's entire DNS infrastructure. We’re excited to introduce you to Advanced DNS Resolver (ADNSR) — a powerful new addition to the Advanced DNS Security portfolio, offering customers an expanded choice of deployment. With ADNSR, you can get started quickly and easily, thanks to flexible deployment options that work seamlessly across today’s multivendor environments.

## Advanced DNS Resolver for a Flexible Deployment of Real-Time Threat Prevention

Advanced DNS Resolver (ADNSR) is purpose-built for this modern reality, delivering intelligent threat prevention with effortless deployment. As a cloud-delivered DNS resolution service, complete with 99.999% availability, ADNSR makes it easy to protect your entire organization, regardless of where your users or infrastructure reside. It’s built for fast, flexible deployment across multivendor environments, delivering real-time DNS-layer protection that covers 2x more DNS threats than the closest competitor.

With a simple DNS redirect to the cloud-hosted resolver by Palo Alto Networks, you can activate enterprise-grade protection in minutes, enabling consistent, always-on security across hybrid environments and multivendor infrastructures.

Seamlessly integrated with Strata™ Cloud Manager, ADNSR provides centralized visibility and unified policy control through the Strata platform. This enables organizations to maintain high performance, streamline operations at scale and meet requirements related to DNS visibility and threat prevention.

#### Customers Are Moving from Competitors and Turning to ADNSR

* **Precision AI:** Trained on the richest, high-fidelity threat data of any pure-play cybersecurity company, enabling deep understanding of attacker behavior across network, cloud, endpoint and DNS layers.
