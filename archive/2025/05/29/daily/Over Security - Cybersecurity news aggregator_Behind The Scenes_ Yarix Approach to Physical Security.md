**TL;DR:** In our experience, even organizations that you’d think are really solid often have serious gaps in their physical securitys—simply because they’ve never put their defenses to the test. And those that have invested heavily in technology frequently overlook the human factor, which remains one of the weakest links.

In this post, we share a practical framework for building a physical security service from the ground up. We walk through how to get started with an assessment, the key steps involved in the planning phase, the tools and methods we rely on, how we approach testing and evidence collection, and finally, how we present findings using real-world attack scenarios and a structured scoring system.

## 1 – Introduction

This blog post explores physical security as an important aspect of information security. The perimeter of physical security refers to the clearly defined boundary that surrounds and protects a specific area—such as a building, data center, or corporate facility—and is secured through a comprehensive set of measures. These include physical barriers (fences, walls, reinforced doors), surveillance systems (such as CCTV cameras), access control mechanisms (like electronic badge readers, biometric scanners, and turnstiles), intrusion detection technologies (motion and infrared sensors), and response protocols (including alarms, security personnel, and contingency plans), all designed to deter, detect, delay, and respond to unauthorized access or potential threats.

This reading is aimed at both curious IT professionals and red teamers who are new to this field. Our goal is to share insights from our own experiences, clear up common misconceptions, and encourage a mindset shift toward taking physical security threats more seriously.

### 1.1 – Why Physical Security Matter

Physical security assessments address a critical, yet frequently overlooked area of an organization’s overall security posture. In this section, we aim to highlight the importance of these assessments by examining key issues and challenges.

Many organizations, including those responsible for critical infrastructure, tend to prioritize cybersecurity while underestimating physical threats, not realizing the significant risks at that level. As a result, the physical perimeter is significantly less protected than the digital one, up to the point where threat actors might find it easier to breach the physical perimeter in order to establish access to the internal systems.

Additionally, unlike the fast-paced evolution of cybersecurity technologies, physical security tends to advance more slowly, leaving gaps that attackers can exploit. Needless to say, the physical perimeter is part of almost every company, but few are really aware of their security standpoint.

Moreover, physical security assessments cannot be replaced by automated scans or tools, nor they can be conducted remotely. They require on-site presence, hands-on analysis and direct interaction with the target environment.

These factors underscore the importance of investing in physical security and the need for comprehensive assessments. This is particularly relevant for clients who have never conducted such testing before, especially those operating within – or connected to – critical infrastructures.

With the upcoming introduction of new regulations such as [DORA](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) and [CER](https://www.critical-entities-resilience-directive.com/), it’s become essential to address these topics, as part of a broader compliance and resilience strategy. In our view, open discussions around this subject help ensure that all stakeholders are better prepared, and more aware of the physical threat landscape.

> *The ICT risk management framework shall include at least strategies, policies, procedures, ICT protocols and tools that are necessary to duly and adequately protect all information assets and ICT assets, including computer software, hardware, servers, as well as to protect all relevant physical components and infrastructures, such as premises, data centres and sensitive designated areas, to ensure that all information assets and ICT assets are adequately protected from risks including damage and unauthorised access or usage.*

The rest of this blog post outlines some of the key challenges we’ve encountered and offers practical suggestions based on our experience in this field.

In your opinion what are the most critical areas of your Company — where are the most valuable assets located?

* Server room / Data center
* Executive offices
* Vault or secured archives
* Storage areas
* Business continuity areas
* Research & development labs

### 1.2 – Companies Awareness and Understanding

Despite the critical nature of physical security, convincing clients of its importance remains probably the greatest challenge. Many companies lack awareness of the full scope of potential risks, and while they may recognize the need for security tests, they often misidentify the type of assessment required. From our experience, they are often unaware of the risks until they are presented with demonstrations of the attack techniques that could be used to compromise their security.

Under these circumstances, our role should not only be to bring technical expertise but also to deeply understand our clients’ specific needs and the most relevant threats to their operations. In other words, in certain situations, this type of activity might provide a significant added value beyond traditional cybersecurity services, and should be discussed with the client. For instance, we should recommend a physical security assessment to a client, if we believe that threats to the physical perimeter present a more immediate or tangible risk than those targeting the digital perimeter (which is typically far more protected). Furthermore, there might be situations where physical security assessments could be combined with tests on the technological perimeters to provide a more holistic approach.

A rule of thumb to tell whether a company may benefit from a physical security assessment could be if any of the following apply:

* It operates from a physical location with employee workstations, internal network cabling, and on-site servers.
* A delayed detection of an intrusion could result in reputational harm (e.g., data breaches, unauthorized surveillance) or financial losses (e.g., theft of equipment, products, or sensitive information).
* The company is involved in delivering or managing critical services, such as public infras...
