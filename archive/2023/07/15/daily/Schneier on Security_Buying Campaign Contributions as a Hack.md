## Buying Campaign Contributions as a Hack

The first Republican primary debate has a popularity threshold to determine who gets to appear: 40,000 individual contributors. Now there are a lot of conventional ways a candidate can get that many contributors. Doug Burgum came up with a novel idea: [buy them](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/us/politics/doug-burgum-donations-debate.html):

> A long-shot contender at the bottom of recent polls, Mr. Burgum is offering $20 gift cards to the first 50,000 people who donate at least $1 to his campaign. And one lucky donor, as his campaign advertised on Facebook, will have the chance to win a Yeti Tundra 45 cooler that typically costs more than $300—just for donating at least $1.

It’s actually a pretty good idea. He could have spent the money on direct mail, or personalized social media ads, or television ads. Instead, he buys gift cards at maybe two-thirds of face value (sellers calculate the advertising value, the additional revenue that comes from using them to buy something more expensive, and breakage when they’re not redeemed at all), and resells them. Plus, many contributors probably give him more than $1, and he got a lot of publicity over this.

Probably the cheapest way to get the contributors he needs. A clever hack.

EDITED TO ADD (7/16): These might be “straw donors” and [illegal](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/10/us/politics/doug-burgum-donations-debate.html):

> The campaign’s donations-for-cash strategy could raise potential legal concerns, said Paul Ryan, a campaign finance lawyer. Voters who make donations in exchange for gift cards, he said, might be considered straw donors because part or all of their donations are being reimbursed by the campaign.
>
> “Federal law says ‘no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person,'” Mr. Ryan said. “Here, the candidate is making a contribution to himself in the name of all these individual donors.”
>
> Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in election law, said that typically, campaigns ask the Federal Election Commission when engaging in new forms of donations.
>
> The Burgum campaign’s maneuver, he said, “certainly seems novel” and “raises concerns about whether it violates the prohibition on straw donations.”

Something for the courts to figure out, if this matter ever gets that far.

Corruption always looks like a clever hack.

However, this hack advertises this candidate to everyone as corrupt to the bone.

@Bruce

Bruce forgot the sarcasm indicator. Things like that can probably be bought from some Russian operator in Moscow.

Reminds me of the time when the German party “die Partei” *sold money* to increase their income and thereby qualified for more subsidies.

Iirc another party sold gold before to get the same effect, but straight up selling money really rubbed the absurdity in everyone’s face.

I don’t know. In the US money-fueled political system, this feels like noise.

I remember a truism saying:
*Corrupt politicians are elected by corrupt voters*

This is a clear demonstration of this principle.

This reminds me a bit of Japan’s “hometown tax”. It was introduced because, as in most of the world, young people have been moving to the big cities, leaving the traditional fishing and farming villages short on tax revenue. So, people now have the option to donate money to their home town and receive almost the full amount as a tax credit (except for the first 2000 yen—approximately 15 US dollars—and up to about 3% of their income).

But, how does one define “home town”? Is it where one was born? Where one spent most of one’s childhood? Where one’s ancestors lived? What if one is a foreigner and wishes to give money to the home town of a Japanese spouse? The Japanese government decided to avoid the question and simply let people choose a city each year.

So, of course, the cities who needed this tax revenue started offering incentives. They started as true “thank you gifts”, mostly small amounts of local foods or crafts that people might miss after moving away and would have trouble finding in a big city. Then it evolved into a marketplace, where people could use online portals to “shop around” for the best rewards, effectively buying things at far-below-retail prices—such as a year’s supply of rice for $15. This led to [a “crackdown” in 2019](https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/c07702/). Now, “Return gifts must basically be locally sourced and all costs, including shipping, must be within 50% of the donation received”—a disadvantage to cities without popular products, or with higher shipping costs.

… “Gaming the System” is a very common & legitimate response to any human devised program with arbitrary “Rules”.

Very difficult for rule-makers to create comprehensive rules that cover all possible situations, especially deliberate exploitation of permissible “Loopholes” in the official rules.

nothing at all dishonest about Mr. Burgum buying contributions — it is perfectly within the stated rules.

Note also that pristine ethics are severely absen...
