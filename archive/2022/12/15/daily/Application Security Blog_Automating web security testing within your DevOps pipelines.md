In traditional security, developers run tests for code security and operators ensure that firewalls and other protections work in the production environment. Access control and other tasks are handled by security experts and managers. DevSecOps uses version control and CI/CD pipelines to configure and manage security tasks automatically, across all teams, before deployment.

## From DevOps to DevSecOps

DevSecOps evolved from DevOps to address the need to embed security across the software development life cycle ([SDLC](/glossary/what-is-sdlc.html)). By shifting security not just left in the SLDC but everywhere, DevOps teams can continuously deliver secure applications without sacrificing velocity. Incorporating testing, triage, and risk mitigation into in the [CI/CD](/glossary/what-is-cicd.html) workflow itself prevents the time-consuming and costly repercussions of making a fix postproduction. By automating continuous testing, DevSecOps enables developers to fix security issues in their code in near real time rather than “bolting on” security at the end of the SDLC. DevSecOps spans the entire SDLC, from planning and design to coding, building, testing, and release, with real-time continuous feedback loops and insights.

One of the key ways organizations facilitate DevSecOps is by enabling automated and continuous testing, which aligns with the continuous integration and delivery concepts that are a [key pillar of DevSecOps](/glossary/what-is-devsecops.html). Because every business is a software business, maintaining the velocity of product delivery largely depends on how well you can find vulnerabilities, and how fast you can fix them.

Modern software development is based on a complex, distributed computing model that includes [microservices](/glossary/what-are-microservices.html), serverless, and cloud-native systems....
