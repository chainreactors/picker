# LuxSci Expands Executive Team to Scale Enterprise Growth and Operations

September 17th, 2024

LuxSci, a leading provider of secure, HIPAA-compliant communications software, today announced new executive appointments as part of its strategy to drive future growth and further expansion into the enterprise market. Experienced B2B software executives [Robert Sullebarger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bsullebarger/) and [Geneviève du Lac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdulac/) have joined the company as Head of Sales and Head of Finance, respectively – reporting to recently appointed CEO Mark Leonard. In addition, David Hillman has joined the company as Director of Engineering, reporting to Erik Kangas, Chief Technology Officer.

“LuxSci has proven its capabilities with some of the largest, most forward-looking companies in healthcare, including patient engagement platform, EHR systems, and payment providers, as well as healthcare retail and in-home care providers,” said Leonard. “Bob, Geneviève and David all bring deep leadership experience combined with a willingness to be hands-on in helping us optimize our operations and execute quickly for our customers and partners.”

### **Proven Sales Leader and Trusted Advisor**

Bob’s career has focused on enterprise software sales and customer acquisition across both established and emerging technologies, including security & compliance, conversational AI and virtual assistant platforms, machine learning, and telecom & networking. Bob brings LuxSci more than two decades of experience in sales, marketing, and product management roles, serving as both a trusted business advisor and a technology expert for customers and partners. Most recently, he led the sales teams for AI solution providers ModuleQ and Interactions LLC, where he helped the company grow from $10 million to more than $100 million in annual revenue. He has also held leadership positions at contact center analytics provider CallMiner, and data security provider Vericept Corporation.

“LuxSci is the gold standard for HIPAA-compliant email and secure healthcare communications with a leadership position in the market,” said Sullebarger. “With healthcare portal adoption maxing out, we have a real opportunity to improve patient engagement and outcomes by opening up the email, SMS and marketing channels to bring more people into today’s healthcare conversation.”

### **Experienced CFO and Finance Leader**

Geneviève joins LuxSci with more than 15 years of experience in CFO and Finance leadership roles. This includes building world-class Finance teams and organizations in the cybersecurity, consumer, and services industries at companies including Cypress Security, Astro Gaming and Wine Country Connect. Throughout her career Geneviève has established a proven track record of success in Finance leadership for ‘scale-up’ businesses, with focus on SaaS companies. Geneviève also brings LuxSci deep experience in implementing systems & processes aimed at building operational scalability, which will be a key part of her responsibilities at the company.

“I’m excited to be joining LuxSci as we build it into a world-class organization,” said Du Lac. “The company has achieved tremendous success to date, and we’re positioned better than ever to keep growing – and to help transform the healthcare industry with secure communications.”

### **Full Stack Software Architect and Data Scientist**

David joins LuxSci with more than 20 years of experience across the entire spectrum of application development, data analysis and automated systems. This includes architect, engineer, developer, and consultant roles at innovative companies, such as Kapital Trading, Gogo, Monster, Livetext, and AT&T Bell Labs. David specializes in designing and building data-intensive applications that analyze large datasets and extract intelligence, as well as developing tools to empower users to interact with those resources. At LuxSci, David will play a key role in the future development of LuxSci technology, helping guide the company’s product direction and roadmap moving forward.

“I’m looking forward to collaborating with the outstanding team already in place at LuxSci and continuing to enhance our products to make our customers’ healthcare communications and operations both smoother and safer,” said Hillman.

In other recent news, LuxSci continues to innovate in secure healthcare communications, recently rolling out new email reporting capabilities and achieving best-in-class performance for email security.
