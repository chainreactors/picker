## **1. Introduction**

In this blog, we discuss major business trends in manufacturing and quality management that industry. For details, we refer you to the initial blog where we introduced the overall value chain. We concentrate on the following areas, in which we address challenges from both business and SAP perspectives:

* **Digitalization in manufacturing** as a top-priority focus

* **Supply chain disruption,** which requires agility in manufacturing and logistics

* **Needs and benefits of business networks** to enable the next level in supply chain integration

* **Sustainability** as a necessary global topic and relevant for energy-intensive production processes

To achieve the goals of digitalization, quality must be managed in line with business needs. The business trends that are currently driving manufacturing processes are also impacting the means of quality control across industries. From sourcing through delivery and distribution, manufacturing and quality processes have been uplifted to align with the principles of Industry 4.0 and global digitalization. Some key areas in which SAP solutions are helping the chemical industry become more sustainable are:

* **Supplier management**, which aligns closely with the sustainably driven business

* **Use of sustainable materials and packaging** to support organizations with a systematic means to achieve their sustainability goals

* **Intuitive nonconformance management** to allow a robust means of capturing and analyzing nonconformities

* **Improved trace and control for batches** to eliminate cumbersome and erroneous data collection and evaluation and to improve the user experience

## **2. Business Trends and Their Impacts in Manufacturing**

**Digitalization in Manufacturing**

A key element of business transformations in the chemical industry today is the adoption of Industry 4.0 as foundation for new business models and improved business processes. Industry 4.0 will make it possible to gather and analyze data across machines and business systems to enable faster, more flexible, and more efficient processes. Currently, machines and sensors are often not connected with the ERP systems, and paper processes are still prevalent.

Resilient Supply Chain from Design to Consume

The vision is to have a seamless data flow and a closed loop from design to consumption. Machines can deliver real-time consumption and order status to feed the planning function with actual data. This is only one example of how connectivity helps to improve the supply chain process. New cloud-based solutions such as SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud will deliver the capabilities and technology to make this vision a reality.

**Supply Chain Disruption**

Supply chain disruptions are having a high impact on nearly all industries. How is manufacturing affected? Missing raw or packaging materials necessitate short-term re-planning of manufacturing orders. What is the right setup to mitigate and reduce the number of short-term planning changes? Data and planning information must flow downstream and upstream without delay or interruption. Manufacturing plants and suppliers are often in different regions. Materials have long lead times. Information about delays in the supply chain must be reflected into planning solutions. For example, if a ship carrying raw materials between Asia and Europe will not reach its destination on time, an updated delivery date is required to plan manufacturing and delivery of the customer order.

All business domains and partners involved in the supply chain must work jointly in an end-to-end process. The operations model and IT infrastructure must be aligned to capture all data for that process in a single source. Products such as SAP Business Network for Logistics and SAP Digital Manufacturing Cloud already support comprehensive integration scenarios.
