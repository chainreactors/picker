Meta's security team has [formally confirmed](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/metas-adversarial-threat-report-q3-2022/) the involvement of the US military in a pro-Western influence operation the social network took down this summer.

The company said it removed 39 Facebook accounts, 16 Facebook pages, and 26 Instagram accounts that tried to pose as locals in various countries.

The accounts posted content in different languages and across several countries as part of an influence operation meant to praise the anti-terrorism efforts of the US military and criticize China, Russia, and the Taliban.

> "The people behind this activity posted primarily in Arabic, Farsi and Russian about news and current events, including terrorism concerns and praise of the US military, as well as content about the COVID-19 pandemic — some of which we removed for violating our misinformation policy. This operation also shared posts criticizing Iran, China and Russia, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's treatment of the Uyghur people, Iran's influence in the Middle East, and the support of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan by Russia and China."

This is the same campaign that was first described at the end of August in a joint report from [Graphika](https://graphika.com/reports/unheard-voice) and the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/sio-aug-22-takedowns)—a joint report based on Meta and Twitter datasets the companies released in advance, and the campaign that was ridiculed for gaining almost zero engagement despite its years-long effort.

At the time, the two organizations formally linked the campaign to the Trans-Regional Web Initiative, a somewhat obscure DOD project [launched 15 years ago](https://www.wired.com/2008/01/special-operati/) and meant to create and run regional news websites to educate and inform local audiences.

While back in the 2000s, the project looked like another [Radio Liberty initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty), it appears the project turned into your run-of-the-mill covert influence operation.

While Meta didn't specifically connect their findings to the Trans-Regional Web Initiative project, they did say that their "investigation found links to individuals associated with the US military" and that these individuals actively tried to conceal their identities and coordination.

This probably didn't help with the concealment thing:

> "This network posted primarily during US business hours (EST) rather than during work hours in the countries they targeted."

While the Pentagon did not formally confirm the August report, the DOD did order a [sweeping audit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/19/pentagon-psychological-operations-facebook-twitter/) of its "information warfare" efforts, most likely not pleased with either the abysmal results they were getting or getting publicly doxxed and shamed. All of this is particularly interesting since WaPo also reported that Meta gave the DOD a small nudge about its easy-to-spot clandestine info-op back in 2020, telling them to knock it off before cracking down on the accounts two years later.

### Breaches and hacks

**DraftKings account hacks:** Sports betting service [DraftKings confirmed](https://archive.ph/fxqOk) that hackers stole $300,000 from customer accounts. The company blamed the incident on users who reused (compromised) passwords for their accounts. However, online, several users said they used unique passwords, which might suggest that some users might have had their computers infected with malware that stole their DraftKing credentials.

**Radio Free Asia breach:** US news agency Radio Free Asia has [disclosed](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/15d25674-a4a0-46de-b499-4d1cd704f26d.shtml) a security breach that might have exposed the personal information of more than 3,700 of its employees. RFA said that a threat actor exploited a vulnerability in a service provider's systems to gain access to "a limited number of servers." The agency said it took down impacted servers and is now moving to a new email provider and changing passwords.

### General tech and privacy

**5G network security breaches:** According to a survey commissioned by Nokia among 5G network operators, at least a third of all 50 respondents said they experienced eight or more security breaches over the past year. More in the [survey](https://onestore.nokia.com/asset/212741) itself or in [CybersecurityDive's coverage](https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/5g-security-breaches/636693/).

**AWS Nitro System:** Amazon has [published](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system.html) details about the security design of its AWS Nitro System [[PDF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system.pdf)], the underlying virtualization platform on which all modern EC2 instances run.

**Far-right figures reinstated on Twitter:** Cyberscoop [reports](https://www.cyberscoop.com/twitter-welcomes-back-trump-accounts-disinformation/) on how Twitter (also recently known as $8chan) is silently unbanning all the crazy right-wing figures the former management spent years removing from its platform for abhorrent abuses. Similarly, WaPo [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/22/elon-musk-twitter-content-moderations/) that the team that hunted foreign influence operations was either fired or decided to quit after Musk took over the site. Probably why advertisers are [running for the hills](https://www.teamblind.com/post/i-told-my-team-to-pause-our-750kmonth-twitter-ads-budget-last-week-4dnbo1Ft) and not even looking back.

**Meta improves privacy on children's accounts:** Meta [announced](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/protecting-teens-and-their-privacy-on-facebook-and-instagram/) this week that it would apply default options with increased privacy settings for children under the age of 18/16 that register new accounts on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. In addition, the company said it was also developing new tools to stop the spread of self-generated intimate images online.

**More Apple privacy drama:** Security researchers Tommy Mysk and Talal Haj Bakry said they found that Apple's analytics service creates an identifier named "*dsId*" (Directory Services Identifier) that is unique for each user and tied to their iCloud account. The duo warns that because of this, Apple can track...
