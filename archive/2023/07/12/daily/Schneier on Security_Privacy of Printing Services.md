## Privacy of Printing Services

The *Washington Post* has an [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/10/printing-privacy-security-printed-documents/) about popular printing services, and whether or not they read your documents and mine the data when you use them for printing:

> Ideally, printing services should avoid storing the content of your files, or at least delete daily. Print services should also communicate clearly upfront what information they’re collecting and why. Some services, like the New York Public Library and PrintWithMe, do both.
>
> Others dodged our questions about what data they collect, how long they store it and whom they share it with. Some—including Canon, FedEx and Staples—declined to answer basic questions about their privacy practices.

And what about “cloud printers” that require Internet connection and an account with the manufacturer to function?

@ Bruce, Peter A.,

> “…about popular printing services, and whether or not they read your documents **and mine the data when you use them for printing**“

It rather depends on what you mean by “mine”.

A probably valid assumption would be that as the documents are being paid for, the documents were already massaged and proof read by one or more humans. Thus of a reasonably high standard.

So they would have value, not just as the documents, but for other purposes…

Look at it this way, if they stored all they printed out, that could be sold as more original content to be shoved through an AI LLM learning process. Thus avoiding many issues of Internet scraping…

@ Peter A.,

It’s not just print manufacturers, consider the value of the Microsoft Office “online” for “original human contrnt.

The person incharge of Microsoft currently appears to lack all morals when it comes to other peoples IP and it reflects down through the organisation.

I’m not at all surprised, and predicted that “Cloud Services” would be bad news in many ways years ago and let’s say they’ve lived well below expectation so far. Also if what the Industry is asking the EU to do against Microsoft for it’s behaviours they are currently at the bottom of the barrel…

WaPo’s [Printer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/10/printer-home-hacks-tips/) [Week](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1678488129039388672) has all the makings of a hit.

*“Printers may act like apex predators, but you don’t have to be their prey.”*

Good one. Plus, here’s an idea for a spin-off:

@ Peter A.

Often ‘require’ is a marketing lie….. Not saying it’s always that case, but for the DeskJet 2752e it is.

I think I had to remove a snapped on cover to access the USB port, once I did that and installed the software it’s fully functional.

A local church asked me to fix their new HP InkJet printer.

Hope more people dump HP for this forced subscription crap.

If it’s forced, it’s not a subscription.

@Petre Peter

conscription ≠ subscription

Even WaPo couldn’t wring the truth out of all the miscreants, so what’s a body to do when Lawyers, Accountants and @Clive Robinson insist on getting everything on paper? Perhaps a nice unerasable pencil that sends everything written back to China …

@Clive Robinson

Why do you say that about the head of M.S.?
You may be correct, I’m curious.

@lurker re: wanting everything in print form – At least some semblence of privacy can be maintained over printed materials, given some basic diligence. You can bloody well assume that any content in digital form that lacks complex and expensive encryption will either turn up somewhere for sale to the highest bidder, or possibly made universally available for free.

@Grim Sqeaker

Sure, there’s a subtle difference between physical security and digital security. But @Bruce’s point is, if printing your material on paper involves passing it in digital form to a mechanical device that may be owned or operated by unknown forces, then it’s Game Over Man.

@ lurker, Grim Sqeaker,

> “passing it in digital form to a mechanical device that may be owned or operated by unknown forces, then it’s Game Over Man.”

Just one addition,

“If they can get communications to it”.

I have a policy of not buying anything that “requires, needs, or uses without my consent data connectivity”.

This results in me not having the dubious upsides of “Spy on you tech” but it also has the downside for them of not just not being able to take my money under false pretenses, it also stops the “commoditizing” of me for their profit as well.

Has the loss of the ...
