In the SAP HANA tooling User Assistance team, we are working to bring the principles of ***simplicity***, ***improved user experience***, and ***improved performance*** to the help that we create for SAP HANA Cloud Central.

To that end, in Q4 of 2021, the first version of integrated help for SAP HANA Cloud Central was released. The integrated help is a web-based help system that provides context-sensitive user assistance directly on top of the current application screen. It allows you to move through your tasks quickly and find all relevant information easily without needing to leave your application.

As SAP HANA cockpit and database explorer functionality gets integrated into the SAP HANA Cloud Central (For more information on this initiative, see [SAP HANA Cloud Central Gets Renovated!](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/05/sap-hana-cloud-central-gets-renovated/)), we are working hard to increase the robustness of the integrated help and provide you with the information you need where and when you need it.

Clicking the **Help** icon ( ![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/HelpIcon-1.png) ) opens the integrated help sidebar:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/SCHelp.png)

The **Help Topics** tab (![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/StaticHelp.png)) contains topics with user assistance for the current screen and links to the official documentation on the SAP Help Portal. Topics may be either static within the sidebar or connected via a hotspot indicator to a specific UI element.

For example, if you’re unsure which license type to select when creating an SAP HANA Cloud instance, the integrated help can help you decide which one is right for you by explaining the differences:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/HotSpotExample.png)

New applications for instance administration and monitoring currently contain an **About This Screen** topic that includes contextual information relevant to the application as well as links to further information as needed. A **Required Prerequisites and Authorizations** topic is also present that lists any privileges or roles necessary for viewing application data or performing tasks.

The **Guided Tours** tab (![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/GuidedTour.png)) contains tutorial-like content that walks you through specific features or functionality.

The **What’s New** tab (![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/WhatsNew-1.png)) contains a guided tour and help topics on highlighted features from the most recent quarter as well as a link to the full list of new features for SAP HANA Cloud Central listed by release date.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/WNGuidedTourExample.png)

If you want to get a look at our integrated help content without having to log into the SAP HANA Cloud Central application, all of our topics are also available on the SAP Help Portal in the [SAP HANA Cloud Central Reference Guide](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/287f5dd35bb44eabba4f08ff68d2211e/aedb6ca544bc4d488eb22b30c63e4b1e.html).

We encourage you to keep checking the integrated help as we work tirelessly throughout 2023 to add to and improve its content and overall user experience!
