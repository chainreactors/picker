# Fraudulent Slack ad shows malvertiser’s patience and skills

Posted: August 21, 2024

In the past year alone, we have reported almost five hundred unique [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) incidents related to Google search ads. While it can be difficult to attribute each incident to a specific threat actor, we usually notice similarities between campaigns.

Some malvertisers go to great lengths to bypass security controls, while others know they will get caught and are willing to burn their accounts and infrastructure. Having said that, we have generally observed stealthier attacks and the one we are covering in this blog is one of them.

Targeting the popular communication tool Slack, a threat actor is relying on several online services to narrow down their victims’ list and most importantly evade detection.

## Context is everything

For several days we noticed a suspicious ad for Slack that appeared when you googled the search term for it. The ad actually looks quite legitimate and is listed above the organic search result for the official site. Despite its appearance, we knew it was likely malicious, even though clicking on it at the time would only result in being redirected to slack.com.

Almost every Google ad contains additional information about its advertiser and why it was displayed to you. This is accessible by clicking on the 3 dots beside the ad URL and it brings you to the Google Ads Transparency Center.

What we notice is that this advertiser is promoting products that look targeted at the Asian market, and then there’s this Slack ad that appears in the middle of nowhere.

We’ve mentioned before how contextualized detection could be a good way to identify an advertiser account that has been compromised. We don’t know whether Google’s algorithms are trained on this or not, but it has certainly helped us many times in the past to find new malicious ad campaigns.

## Slow cooking

For days, clicking on this Slack ad would only redirect to a price page on Slack’s official website. Ads aren’t always weaponized right away; in fact it is a common practice for threat actors to let their ad ‘cook’ such that it does not immediately become detected.

Eventually, we saw a change in behavior. Rather than redirecting to slack.com, now the ad first started redirecting to a click tracker. This is one of the weaknesses in the Google ad ecosystem as such services can be abused to filter clicks and essentially send traffic to a domain of anyone’s choosing. Tracking templates as they are known, are a built-in feature that has become synonym with fraud for us.

## Playing games of hide and seek

Now the ad’s final URL had become *slack-windows-download[.]com* an interesting choice for a domain name created less than a week ago. While it is obvious that this page was automatically generated, perhaps using [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet), there is nothing malicious on it. For whatever reason, the server side checks determined that we should only be seeing this decoy page at the time:
