## Introduction

Welcome to the thrilling world of bug bounty hunting — where finding glitches in software is not just a hobby but a gateway to potential riches and recognition! Imagine being a digital detective, solving mysteries that most folks wouldn’t even notice, and getting rewarded for it. In this guide, we’ll unravel the basics of bug bounty hunting, give you a step-by-step walkthrough of unearthing common vulnerabilities, and share some nifty resources to get you started. Buckle up, it’s going to be a bug-tastic ride!

## What is Bug Bounty Hunting?

Bug bounty hunting is like being a superhero in the realm of cybersecurity, but without the flashy suit. It involves sniffing out and reporting security vulnerabilities in systems, apps, or websites. Companies run bug bounty programs to lure ethical hackers (like you) into spotting and reporting these weak spots, which helps them beef up their security. In return, you get rewards, recognition, or at least a virtual high-five from the tech community.

## Step 1: Learn the Basics of Web Security

Before you start hunting bugs, you need to get comfy with the basics of web security. Think of it as learning the ABCs of cyber sleuthing.

![]()

* **HTTP & HTTPS**: These are like the postal services of the web. HTTP is the standard protocol, while HTTPS is its secure cousin that encrypts data between the browser and the server. Always go for HTTPS — it’s like wearing a seatbelt on the web.
* **OWASP Top 10**: This is your cheat sheet to the top 10 web security risks. Familiarize yourself with these troublemakers:
* **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: When hackers play with your database like it’s a toy.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: When bad scripts crash the party on your website.
* **Broken Authentication**: When your login system is as secure as a paper lock.
* **Sensitive Data Exposure**: When your private info goes public like it’s on a billboard.
* **XML External Entities (XXE)**: When your XML files are sneaky troublemakers.
* **Broken Access Control**: When users access more than they should, like breaking into the VIP section.
* **Security Misconfiguration**: When your security settings are as mixed up as a puzzle.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: When attackers make your site do things it shouldn’t.
* **Insecure Deserialization**: When data being processed gets all messed up.
* **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: When using outdated parts is like bringing a leaky bucket to the party.
* **Networking Basics**: Learn how IP addresses, DNS, and data travel over networks. It’s like understanding how letters get to your mailbox, but with a lot more technical mumbo jumbo.

## Step 2: Get Familiar with Tools of the Trade

Every superhero needs their gadgets, and for bug bounty hunting, you’ve got some cool tools:

* **Burp Suite**: Think of it as your magnifying glass for HTTP requests and responses. It’s powerful and comes in a community edition if you’re just starting out. Check out the Burp Suite Community Edition and Burp Suite Tutorial for Beginners.
* **Nmap**: Your go-to tool for scanning networks and discovering open ports. It’s like your radar for finding weak spots. Explore the [Nmap Official Site](https://nmap.org/) and Nmap Tutorial for Beginners.
* **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source security scanner that helps you spot vulnerabilities. It’s like having a sidekick that never sleeps. Check out the OWASP ZAP Official Site and the OWASP ZAP User Guide.
* **Google Dorking**: Use advanced search operators to dig up information exposed on the internet. It’s like using a super-powered search engine to find hidden gems. Read up on Google Dorking Guide.

## Step 3: Choose a Bug Bounty Platform

Now, where do you actually hunt these bugs? Here are some platforms where you can get started:

![]()

* **HackerOne**: The big leagues with programs from major companies. Check out [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) and their Beginner’s Guide.
* **Bugcrowd**: Another top platform with various programs to explore. Visit [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/) and Bugcrowd University.
* **Synack**: A more exclusive platform with an application process. Head over to [Synack](https://www.synack.com/) if you’re feeling fancy.
* **Open Bug Bounty**: Focuses on responsible disclosure even if you don’t have a formal program. Check out [Open Bug Bounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org/).

## Step 4: Finding Vulnerabilities — Step-by-Step Examples

Let’s put on our detective hats and dive into some classic vulnerabilities:

## **Example 1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

XSS is like a prankster who injects malicious scripts into web pages. Here’s how to catch them:

* **Identify Input Fields**: Look for places where you can type stuff — search boxes, comment sections, or profiles.
* **Inject Test Script**: Drop a simple script like:
* `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
* into the input field and hit submit.
* **Check for Execution**: If you see an alert box popping up, you’ve found an XSS vulnerability. Congrats!
* **Report the Vulnerability**: Describe your findings in a report — explain how you did it, the impact, and offer suggestions for fixing it. It’s like writing a detective’s report.

**Example: Testing a search field**

* Enter `<script>alert('Test')</script>` in the search box.
* If an alert box appears, it’s an XSS vulnerability.

## **Example 2: Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

RCE ...
