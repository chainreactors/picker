Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) started the new year off strong and got a running start on its resolution to better help teams secure their software supply chain at the speed of modern software development. Let’s look at some of the highlights of the 2023.1.0 release.

## Open source component intelligence

Bugs, defects, and security vulnerabilities are an unavoidable cost of doing business in the software industry, and open source code is no exception. Ideally, these defects are discovered by a responsible party, disclosed properly, assigned a CVE number, and communicated to impacted organizations. This process remains a crucial aspect of open source risk management. But as modern development depends more and more on open source, how can we get more proactive in avoiding potential risk introduced further up the supply chain?

With its latest release, Black Duck now provides users with enhanced component intelligence to enable them to look beyond known vulnerabilities and get ahead of potential security risks. Overseen by the Black Duck [Cybersecurity Research Center](/resources/cybersecurity-research-center.html) (CyRC), this fully automated process uses static analysis to analyze component behavior and flag issues for review by security and development teams. Potentially malicious component behavior identified by this process includes

* Network communication to external IP addresses or URLs
* Component installation behavior (i.e., suspicious commands invoked during install, side installation of other applications, etc.)
* Component capabilities such as crypto-mining, disk encryption, serialization of data, file system access, and compression

Confusingly, this type of malicious component behavior is sometimes a crucial aspect of a trustworthy component, we’re finding that security teams are becoming more risk adverse as they de...
