[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

*This is the way the world ends*
*This is the way the world ends*
*This is the way the world ends*
*Not with a bang but a whimper.*– T.S. Eliot

So this is how Summer Camp 2025 ends, not with a bang but a whimper. We’ve put the summer behind us and are moving on to the next phase of the year, where we all put our noses down and grind from here to the holiday season. Happy Grind Season 2025.

As you know, threat research never takes a day off, but I’m going to step in and remind you all to look at your calendars. Decide, here and now, to take some time before that holiday season so that you can take care of your mental health, because mental health *is* health.

This is doubly important if you lead a team of people. Take a minute and make sure that they are going to do the same. Ensure your entire team is taking care of themselves. In the end, you will all be better for it.

Since we are on the subject of mental health, I don’t know if anyone else has read this paper [(Psychopathia Machinalis: A Nosological Framework for Understanding Pathologies in Advanced Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.psychopathia.ai/), but I found it truly fascinating. It’s one of the things we, as security practitioners, need to be cognizant of as we go forward with our AI tooling and efforts to protect against AI threats.

*"As artificial intelligence (AI) systems attain greater autonomy and complex environmental interactions, they begin to exhibit behavioral anomalies that, by analogy, resemble psychopathologies observed in humans."*

The behavior of an evolving AI, and the psychosis it could present, is a touch-point to the long-standing problematic internal employee. This creates an interesting dynamic for defense and strategies within the evolving internal landscape.

I think understanding this presented framework can go a long way in identifying the types of behaviors that lead to malicious activity — not unlike understanding employee behavior. Stay ahead of the curve and prepare for not only a hallucinated package from an internal AI tool but perhaps a revelation that leads to new and interesting malicious behaviors.

## The one big thing

In the latest episode of [The Talos Threat Perspective,](https://youtu.be/RJvp25sbYeE) we explore three vulnerabilities that Talos researchers uncovered (and helped to fix) this year which highlight how attackers are pushing past the boundaries defenders rely on. One lived in the security chip within Dell laptops’ firmware, another in Microsoft Office for macOS permissions and the third in small office/home routers.

### Why do I care?

These aren’t just isolated issues. The Dell vulnerability showed that even a clean Windows reinstall isn’t always enough to kick out an attacker. The Office for macOS issue demonstrated how adversaries can “borrow” sensitive permissions like microphone access from trusted apps. And compromised routers allowed attackers to blend in with legitimate ISP traffic, making malicious connections hard to spot. Each case reveals current attacker creativity levels.

### So now what?

Take a closer look at the research:
