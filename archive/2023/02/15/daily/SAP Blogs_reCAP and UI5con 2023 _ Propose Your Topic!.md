## UI5con & reCAP?

Yes, we are good to finally announce **[UI5con](https://openui5.org/ui5con/germany2023/)** and [**reCAP 2023**](https://recap-conf.dev/)! This time with a clear focus an an actual onsite conference experience. For our friends from UI5 this means "[back to the roots](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/09/ui5con-2023-save-the-date/)". For the CAP community it means a new chapter (as reCAP was born when the pandemic hit), so we are more than excited!

You don't know what **UI5con** and **reCAP** are? Then it's about time to join the party. In short we talk about two awesome developer conferences all around ([Open](https://openui5.org/)) [UI5](https://ui5.sap.com/) and the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model ([CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/)). The time of the year where our vivid communities, customers, and partners meet the SAP product teams and exchange best practices, technical concepts, current projects, ideas for the future, and way more...

**So why together?**

The idea of bringing UI5con and reCAP together was based on community feedback. As the topics and communities have an overlap, having the chance to visit both conferences should make it even more attractive for customers and partners. And finally it's a great chance to emphasize and jointly demonstrate how well the different technology pieces fit together from UI to the backend - the **full stack conference experience**... so make sure to not miss it! ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@D5B60FFD43F3456C6831F3387D779148/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

## You would like to get on stage?

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Audimax.png)

Great, our conferences need your contributions in order to make it an interactive and unforgettable experience. Check-out the links above and feel free to enter your topic proposals (you can always change them after they are submitted, so don't hesitate to enter them early).

## You would like to support us?

As UI5con and reCAP are **community events** exclusively organized by both, the UI5 / CAP development communities as well as the development teams at SAP, we require support to get the conferences realized. If you would like to help us financially, please reach-out to the orga teams. There are more details on the **sponsorship packages** mentioned on the landing pages linked above.

In addition we are looking for **volunteers** helping us to prepare the events and to ensure that the onsite events run smooth. If you would like to get involved, please reach-out to us.

## You would like to take part onsite (online)?

We will open the registration for the onsite events in **April** and let you know how it works. As always the conferencers are free of charge, you just have to take care for your travel expenses.

There will also be a global broadcast similar to the recents years, but it will not be provided for all sessions (maybe only for a small subset, tbd). As always we will try to provide recordings for most sessions after the event, but nothing compares to the onsite experience... ![:winking_face:](/html/@D1BFF04316CA1FF82DFB90B096AEEE85/emoticons/1f609.png ":winking_face:")
