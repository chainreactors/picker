People work at EFF because they believe in wringing justice from a world that’s often unfair. For us, setting things right means [legal work](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/eff-tells-minnesota-supreme-court-strike-down-geofence-warrant-fourth-circuit), [activism](https://act.eff.org), [convincing policymakers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/briefing-negotiating-states-must-address-proposed-un-surveillance-treatys-risks), and creating [tech tools](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/why-privacy-badger-opts-you-out-googles-privacy-sandbox) to tip the balance of power back toward you. Will you move that mission forward by supporting EFF?

EFF gives legal advice to folks like them [all year](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders) because computer security has always relied on skilled hackers, and your privacy and free expression rely on [strong web security](https://www.eff.org/issues/security).
