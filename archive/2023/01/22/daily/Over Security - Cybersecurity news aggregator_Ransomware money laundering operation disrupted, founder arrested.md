# [updated]Ransomware money laundering operation disrupted, founder arrested

Posted: January 20, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has released [information](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-cryptocurrency-exchange-charged-processing-over-700-million) about the arrest of Anatoly Legkodymov, the founder and majority owner of a [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) exchange called Bitzlato, on money laundering charges. Legkodymov, a Russian national who lives in China, is accused of processing over $700 million of illicit funds.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also [issued an order](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-identifies-virtual-currency-exchange-bitzlato-primary-money-laundering) that identifies Bitzlato as a “primary money laundering concern” in connection with Russian illicit finance.

The exchange is thought to have fueled crypto-related crimes like [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) by helping cybercriminals launder illegally obtained money.

As stated by Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division:

> As alleged, the defendant helped operate a cryptocurrency exchange that failed to implement required anti-money laundering safeguards and enabled criminals to profit from their wrongdoing, including ransomware and drug trafficking.

Bitzlato’s largest counterparty in cryptocurrency transactions was Hydra, a Russian language [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/09/what-is-the-dark-web-the-dark-web-explained) marketplace for narcotics, stolen financial information, fraudulent identification documents, and money laundering services.

What made Bitzlato popular among criminals was the fact that it marketed itself as requiring minimal identification from its users. Where other exchanges require users to submit selfies and official [IDs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/internet-safety-tips-for-kids), Bitzlato said this was not required, and allowed  “straw man” registrants. According to the DOJ these deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, allegedly made Bitzlato a haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity.

Bitcoin—the most popular cryptocoin used in cybercrime—is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions between entities are public and easy to trace, but the identity of the entities is hidden behind numeric addresses. If law enforcement can identify the owner of a [bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin) address they can see the transactions that person has made. As a result, some countries insist that exchanges take identifying information from customers when they open an account so that their transactions can be attributed to a real identity easily.

The lax procedures at Bitzlato would have given its users piece of mind that any illicit transactions can’t be traced back to them, since they were able to use stolen identities to register their accounts.

To reassure its users, Bitzlato issued a statement saying it suffered a minor hack:

```
Our service was hacked, part of the funds was withdrawn from the service.

We ask you DO NOT REPLENISH our service during the proceedings!

Withdrawals will also be suspended indefinitely.

Sin...
