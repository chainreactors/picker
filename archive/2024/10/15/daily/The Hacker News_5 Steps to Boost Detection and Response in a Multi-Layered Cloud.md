The link between detection and response (DR) practices and cloud security has historically been weak. As global organizations increasingly adopt cloud environments, security strategies have largely focused on "shift-left" practices—securing code, ensuring proper cloud posture, and fixing misconfigurations. However, this approach has led to an over-reliance on a multitude of DR tools spanning cloud infrastructure, workloads, and even applications. Despite these advanced tools, organizations often take weeks or even months to identify and resolve incidents.

[![Detection and Response](data:image/png;base64... "Detection and Response")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiz1cZfP_jSOdzddH53DUKUOaigCLS-jHzLg1GIt54sK0jT1rd80xpZiYK8EauAw6FEa84YjPIAp6iHr4rgKdO2mbf9weSdE5nzB6HMO9PpPOc48PMcwBlSvcJa1TCzu-g7D3NB9EQUCIWb0pia84_75vZFjc8XuDl_sA5OuOF__soRoCFe7wo8oP9ImzE/s790-rw-e365/1.png)

Add to this the challenges of tool sprawl, soaring cloud security costs, and overwhelming volumes of false positives, and it becomes clear that security teams are stretched thin. Many are forced to make hard decisions about which cloud breaches they can realistically defend against.

By following these five targeted steps, security teams can greatly improve their real-time detection and response capabilities for cloud attacks.

## Step 1: Add Runtime Visibility and Protection

When security teams lack real-time visibility, they're essentially operating blind, unable to respond effectively to threats. While cloud-native monitoring tools, container security solutions, and EDR systems offer valuable insights, they tend to focus on specific layers of the environment. A more comprehensive approach is achieved by using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) sensors. eBPF enables deep, real-time observability across the entire stack—network, infrastructure, workloads, and applications—without disrupting production environments. By operating at the kernel level, it delivers visibility without adding performance overhead, making it a powerful solution for runtime security.

Here are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:

* **Topology Graphs:** Displays how hybrid or multi-cloud assets communicate and connect.
* **Full Asset Visibility:** Showcases every asset in the environment, including clusters, networks, databases, secrets, and operating systems, all in one place.
* **External Connectivity Insights:** Identifies connections to external entities, including details about the country of origin and DNS information.
* **Risk Assessments:** Evaluate the risk level of each asset, alongside its impact on the business.

## Step 2: Use a multi-layered detection strategy

As attackers continue to evolve and evade detection, it becomes harder to find and stop breaches *before* they unfold. The biggest challenge in doing so lies in detecting cloud attack attempts where adversaries are stealth and exploit multiple attack surfaces— from network exploitation to data injection within a managed service — all while evading detection by cloud detection and response (CDR), cloud workload detection and response (CWPP/EDR), and application detection and response (ADR) solutions. This fragmented strategy has proven inadequate, allowing attackers to exploit gaps between layers to go unnoticed.

Monitoring cloud, workloads and application layers in a single platform provides the widest coverage and protection. It makes it possible to correlate application activity with infrastructure changes in real-time, ensuring attacks no longer slip through the cracks.

Here are some key capabilities to leverage for this step:

* **Full-Stack Detection**: Detects incidents from multiple sources across the cloud, applications, workloads, networks, and APIs.
* **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes machine learning and behavioral analysis to identify deviations from normal activity patterns that may indicate a threat.
* **Detects Known and Unknown Threats:** Pinpoints events according to signatures, IoCs, TTPs, and MITRE known tactics.
* **Incident Correlation:** Correlates security events and alerts across different sources to identify patterns and potential threats.

## Step 3: View vulnerabilities in the same pane as your incidents

When vulnerabilities are isolated from incident data, the potential for delayed responses and oversight increases. This is because security teams end up lacking the context they need to understand how vulnerabilities are being exploited or the urgency of patching them in relation to ongoing incidents.

In addition, when detection and response efforts leverage runtime monitoring (as explained above), vulnerability manage...
