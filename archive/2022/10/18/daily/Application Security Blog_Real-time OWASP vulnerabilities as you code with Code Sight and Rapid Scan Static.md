Imagine you are developing an application – no matter if it’s a web, mobile, or desktop app – and your IDE informs you of security vulnerabilities as you code. The release of Code Sight 2022.9.0 for VS Code and IntelliJ makes that a reality. With Black Duck’s industry-leading [static application security testing](/static-analysis-tools-sast.html) (SAST) engine powering Code Sight’s [Rapid Scan Static](/blog/rapid-scan-sast.html), there is no configuration or tuning. It’s actual sophisticated taint flow and not just lint. Fixes for the vulnerabilities are also confirmed in real-time. If you are on a security team or the security champion, you will appreciate the fix confirmed without you having to chase it down in the next security review.

## Detect OWASP vulnerabilities in the IDE as you code

[Code Sight](/code-sight.html) analyzes your projects in real-time, as you write code, so that you can see new vulnerabilities and fixes as you type. The lightweight scan engine minimizes resource consumption and maximizes speed so you can remediate quickly before pushing vulnerable code downstream. You can access detailed risk information and remediation advice alongside the source code in the IDE, helping you maintain context for the issue and learn more secure development techniques.

One of the most impactful examples of this are the taint flow checks, which clearly list events that describe the full flow of user-controlled data so that you can understand the issue and implement the right fix the first time. With the Code Sight IDE plugin, finding and fixing security vulnerabilities without breaking your workflows has never been this fast.
