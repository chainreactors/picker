**Abstract**Are you struggling to manage the ever-increasing amount of data in your SAP ERP system? Look no further! this blog provides a comprehensive overview of data strategy, Information Lifecycle Management (ILM), data archiving, and data volume management techniques specifically tailored for SAP customers.

In this blog, I've gathered known methods and techniques in one place to help you explore different options that can fulfill your specific needs. I've also included references and links to SAP training courses at the end of this blog for those who are interested in earning SAP official certificates or training in this field. And if you need expert support, I've even included a link to SAP's payable on-demand consultant services.

After receiving multiple inquiries from customers about archiving strategy, data volume management and information lifecycle management options available in SAP, whether in SAP ERP or SAP PaaS and SaaS, I decided to write this blog as an overview to assist them with their operational tasks or projects needs.

## **Target Readers:**

* SAP consultant /SAP Architect who is looking to start working on data volume management or archive strategy
* As a motivated professional you want to extend your career in this field
* A customer would like to get a high level guidance about this topic to choose the right approach
* SAP colleague and partners who would like to provide an overview of data archiving and ILM to their clients

* Leverage Inbuilt SAP programs to automate destroying the documents its retention reached, and all legal requirements are met
* On-demand SAP data retrieval after the required archiving
* Tax auditing, product liability, data privacy or data protection and the mandate to protect of personal or business partner data or GDPR
* Facing performance degradation in your existing SAP systems because of unpredictable database growth with high memory footprint and CPU consumption
* Dealing with a corporate merger or acquisition, an in-house consolidation of multiple systems, or the transition to the Intelligent Enterprise
* Migration from ECC to S/4 HANA Private Edition and striving to reduce the future cost and memory footprint

**Some terminologies ,concepts, and solutions:**

**Document** **Management** **services (DMS):**A Document Management Service (DMS) is designed to manage documents efficiently without the challenges associated with physical storage. A well-implemented DMS relies on a Content Management Service (CMS) to provide the necessary infrastructure for storing and retrieving documents in a structured manner.
