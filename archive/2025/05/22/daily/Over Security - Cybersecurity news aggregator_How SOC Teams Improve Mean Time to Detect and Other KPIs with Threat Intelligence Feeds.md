How SOC Teams Improve Mean Time to Detect and Other KPIs with Threat Intelligence Feeds

[Security Operations Centers](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/sandbox-for-every-tier/) (SOCs) are under constant pressure to detect threats faster, respond more effectively, and reduce operational noise. Metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), [Mean Time to Respond](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-feeds-in-incident-response/) (MTTR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR) are more than just numbers — they define the health and impact of a business security posture.

[Threat intelligence feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-feeds-integration/) — curated, real-time data streams about emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and attacker tactics — play a pivotal role in optimizing these metrics hence SOCs’ performance. By integrating high-quality solutions, like [ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_better_kpis&utm_term=210525&utm_content=linktotifeeds), teams can improve efficiency, accuracy, and proactive defense.

## 1. Reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

MTTD measures the average time taken to identify a security incident. Threat intelligence feeds provide real-time [indicators of compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/iocs-iobs-ioas-explained/) (IOCs) such as malicious IP addresses, domains, or file hashes. By correlating these IOCs with network and endpoint data, SOCs can detect threats faster. Tools like SIEMs and EDRs use feeds to match artifacts against known malicious signatures in real time.

MTTR tracks the time from detection to containment or resolution. Threat intelligence feeds enhance response by enabling automation and faster decision-making.

As a result, known threats get detected immediately, not after hours of investigation, and analysts get context-rich alerts (e.g., malware family, [MITRE technique](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/)), speeding up triage.

[ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_better_kpis&utm_term=210525&utm_content=linktolanding) contain IOCs from real-world attack investigations across [15,000 companies](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/). Namely:

* **IP addresses**. Digital markers of cybercriminal operations, often linked to Command-and-Control (C2) servers or phishing campaigns.
* **Domains**. Often used as staging points for cyberattacks. Domains provide a higher-level view of malicious activity, often connecting multiple IPs or malware instances within a single campaign.
* **URLs**. By link analysis, cybersecurity teams can uncover attack patterns, block harmful traffic, and prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.

ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds provide [detailed context on the indicators](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/inside-cyber-threat-intelligence-feeds/) that enriches information and helps to assess the impact of each IOC. The contextual data includes:

* **External references**: Links to relevant [sandbox analyses](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/) of malware samples that let users observe an attack in detail and elements and extract actionable data about threat behaviors and adversary TTPs.
* **Label**: Name of the malware family or campaign.
* **Detection timestamps**: “Created” and “Modified” dates provide a timeline to understand if a threat is ongoing or historical.
* **Related objects**: File hashes and network indicators related to the indicator in question.
* **Score**: Value representing the severity level of the IOC.
