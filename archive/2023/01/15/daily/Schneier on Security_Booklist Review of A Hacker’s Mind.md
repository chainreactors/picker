## *Booklist* Review of *A Hacker‚Äôs Mind*

*Booklist* [reviews](https://www.booklistonline.com/A-Hacker-s-Mind-How-the-Powerful-Bend-Society-s-Rules-and-How-to-Bend-them-Back-/pid%3D9771457) *A Hacker‚Äôs Mind*:

> Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (*Data and Goliath*, 2015) defines a ‚Äúhack‚Äù as an activity allowed by a system ‚Äúthat subverts the rules or norms of the system [‚Ä¶] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.‚Äù In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier‚Äôs fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier‚Äôs deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold.

The book will be published on February 7. [Here‚Äôs](https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/) the book‚Äôs webpage. You can pre-order a signed copy from me [here](https://www.schneier.com/product/a-hackers-mind-hardcover/).
