----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Invision Community <= 4.7.20 (calendar/view.php) SQL Injection Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

https://invisioncommunity.com

[-] Affected Versions:

Certain 4.x versions before 4.7.21.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located within the
/applications/calendar/modules/front/calendar/view.php script.
Specifically, in the IPS\calendar\modules\front\calendar\view::search()
method: user input passed through the "location" request parameter is not
properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be
exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to e.g. read sensitive data
from the database through boolean-based SQL Injection attacks. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability requires the "calendar" application to
be installed and a "GeoLocation feature" (like Google Maps) to be
configured.

NOTE: SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Invision Community 4.x might lead to
admin account takeover and RCE attacks, by resetting the admin's password.
However, starting from version 4.7.18, a new security encryption key has
been introduced within the password reset mechanism. As such, this attack
vector won't work anymore with versions >= 4.7.18.

[-] Proof of Concept:

https://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2025-48932.php

[-] Solution:

Upgrade to version 4.7.21 or later.
