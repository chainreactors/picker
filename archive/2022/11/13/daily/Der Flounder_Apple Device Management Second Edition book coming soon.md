Three years back, both Charles Edge and I wrote a book together:

> Just in time to bring a little Holiday cheer, the [@apple](https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Device Management book I wrote with [@rtrouton](https://twitter.com/rtrouton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) is now shipping from [@Apress](https://twitter.com/Apress?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) <https://t.co/P4SjJaU1BZ>
>
> Thanks to all of the people that lent a helping hand. This one required a bit more than any other I’ve worked on!

We decided to put the band back together for a Second Edition, which I’m pleased to say is far enough along in the publishing process that it’s been assigned an ISBN number and a listing on Amazon.

> Finished the technical edits with [@rtrouton](https://twitter.com/rtrouton?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) on “Apple Device Management: A Unified Theory of Managing Macs, iPads, iPhones, and AppleTVs, Second Edition” yesterday and it’s not available for pre-order but does have an isbn and is closer to shipping! <https://t.co/Dm6AZKljaV>

While it’s not yet available for pre-order, hopefully you’ll be able to add a pre-order for it to your Christmas shopping list!

Charles and I were also on the Mac Admins Podcast to discuss the new book so if you’re interested in learning more, please see the link below:
