# What is real-time protection and why do you need it?

Posted: May 20, 2024
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

The constant barrage of cyber threats can be overwhelming for all of us. And, as those threats evolve and attackers find new ways to compromise us, we need a way to keep on top of everything nasty that’s thrown our way.

Malwarebytes’ free version tackles and reactively resolves threats already on your system, but the real-time protection you get with Malwarebytes Premium Security goes one step further and actively monitors your computer’s files, processes, and system memory in real time to block threats before they have a chance to do any damage. You don’t need to worry about what happens after your initial scan, because real-time protection is actively waiting to combat new threats and keep you safe.

Imagine your computer is like a castle, and you want to protect your people from potential invaders. Having real-time protection is like having guards stationed all around your castle, constantly watching for signs of trouble and stopping them in their path before they can cause harm.

Here’s how guarding that castle looks like in cybersecurity terms:

**1. Proactive and continuous monitoring**

We monitor your files, processes, and system memory, your incoming and outgoing data, and the behavior of applications on your system. All in real time.

**2. Dynamic detection**

Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on detecting [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that is already [known to exist](https://www.malwarebytes.com/why-us), Malwarebytes employs dynamic detection techniques, such as [heuristic analysis](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/08/just-tell-me-how-to-fix-my-computer-a-crash-course-on-malware-detection), behavior monitoring, and [machine learning](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-machine-learning) to detect and block threats based on their behavior and characteristics, even if the threats have never been seen before.

**3. Multi-layered defense**

Malwarebytes real-time protection offers a multi-layered approach to security, combining various technologies to provide comprehensive protection against a variety of threats. This includes protection against [viruses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer-virus), [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware), [potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-pup), [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware), [trojans,](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits), and other forms of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware).

**4. Rapid response**

When Malwarebytes detects suspicious activity or potential threats, it responds quickly. Malwarebytes quarantines or removes malicious files, protects you from harmful websites, and blocks unauthorized access to your system.

**5. Minimal impact**

Malwarebytes runs quietly in the background and protects you without hogging your device’s resources.

**6. Regular updates to malware detection database**

To ensure our program is equipped to detect and block the latest threats, we continuously update our database and algorithms.

In short, real-time protection serves as a proactive defense layer against constantly evolving cyber threats. Having this layer improves your cybersecurity and gives you peace of mind in this increasin...
