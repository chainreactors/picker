# Spyware maker Paragon confirms US government is a customer

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

12:54 PM PST · February 4, 2025

Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions confirmed to TechCrunch that it sells its products to the U.S. government and other unspecified allied countries.

Paragon’s executive chairman John Fleming said in a statement to TechCrunch on Tuesday that “Paragon licenses its technology to a select group of global democracies — principally, the United States and its allies.”

Fleming also said that Paragon “requires that all users agree to terms and conditions that explicitly prohibit the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society figures. We have a zero-tolerance policy against such targeting and will terminate our relationship with any customer that violates our terms of service.”

These comments come after [WhatsApp alleged on Friday that Paragon’s spyware was used in a hacking campaign](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/) that targeted around 90 journalists and other members of civil society. Since then, at least two people have come forward claiming they were among the targets: [Italian journalist Francesco Cancellato](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/), and Sweden-based Libyan activist [Husam El Gom](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware)[ati](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/03/critic-of-italy-libya-migration-pact-told-he-was-target-of-israeli-spyware).

Fleming did not respond to a series of specific questions, including those asking for more details about who Paragon considers to be a U.S. ally and a democracy; what exactly its terms of service say about the prohibition of targeting journalists and members of civil society with its spyware; whether the company can and does investigate allegations of abuse, such as those made by WhatsApp; whether the company is investigating WhatsApp’s allegations; and if Paragon has ever terminated a contract because of such violations.

Last year, Wired [first reported](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-solutions-contract/) that Paragon’s U.S. subsidiary had [signed a contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70CTD024P00000012_7012_-NONE-_-NONE-) worth $2 million with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the company did not comment at the time.

U.S. private equity firm [AE Industrial made a bid to acquire Paragon](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/israeli-spyware-maker-paragon-bought-by-u-s-private-equity-giant/) last year for around $900 million. When reached for comment, AE Industrial spokesperson Matt Conroy did not comment and deferred to Paragon.

WhatsApp said Friday that it had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Paragon. Fleming declined to comment on the letter.

Cancellato is the director of news website [Fanpage.it](https://www.fanpage.it/backstair/story/gioventu-meloniana-inchiesta-su-giovani-di-fdi/), which [published an investigation](https://www.fanpage.it/backstair/story/gioventu-meloniana-inchiesta-su-giovani-di-fdi/) last year on the “Gioventù Meloniana,” the youth wing of the Fratelli d’Italia party, led by current prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been at the head of the Italian government since 2022. Thanks to undercover video recordings of members of the “Gioventù Meloniana,” Fanpage showed that a number of them made racist and antisemitic remarks, used the N-word, and chanted Nazi and pro-Italian dictator Benito Mussolini slogans. The investigation [prompted opposition parties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/italy-fascist-chants-national-youth) to criticize Meloni.

“I feel violated,” Cancellato, [who spoke of learning that his phone was targeted](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/), told TechCrunch. “You ask yourself, why me? This is the thing, I mean, what did they want from me?”
