Authorities in Kazakhstan have decided to kick a hornet's nest and arrested Nikita Kislitsin, the top executive for Russian cybersecurity firm FACCT—the former Russian branch of Group-IB, which split from its parent company earlier this year.

Kislitsin was detained following an international arrest warrant issued by the United States. US authorities are seeking his extradition in relation to a [case](https://cyberscoop.com/group-ib-nikita-kislitsin-indicted-formspring-nikulin/) where he's accused of selling login credentials for Formspring accounts way back in 2012.

All of this happened on June 22. Six days later, on June 28, a Moscow court issued an arrest warrant in absentia in Kislitin's name on some mysterious hacking charge. No details provided.

Now, Russian authorities are [seeking Kislitsin's extradition to Russia](https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/28/06/2023/649c09c99a79470f0aa00d53) in what appears to be the start of another diplomatic tug-of-war between US and Russian officials over yet another suspected cybercriminal.

We've seen this before many times. Every time a big Russian hacker gets arrested outside Russia's borders, Russian authorities hocus-pocus some charges out of a hat and try to get him back home like the suspects are some sort of national treasure.

It happened before with [Yevgeniy Nikulin](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/25/europe/us-russia-extradition-fight/index.html), the Russian national behind the hacks of Dropbox and LinkedIn. As soon as Nikulin was detained in Czechia, Russian authorities also realized he was a dangerous hackerm@n and sought his extradition too. This one they lost.

It also happened with [Alexander Vinnik](https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-national-vinnik-greece-extradited-united-states-bitcoin/31975304.html), the founder of e-BTC, a cryptocurrency platform that was at the heart of many ransomware payments in the mid-2010s. As soon as Vinnik was detained in Greece, Russian authorities had an epiphany and realized what a dangerous cyberlord Vinnik was and also sought his extradition. This one they initially won, but they lost on the appeal.

It also happened with [Aleksei Burkov](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-extradites-russian-hacker-to-us-despite-protests-by-moscow/), the administrator of the CardPlanet carding forum. As soon as Burkov was detained in Israel, Russian officials also sought his extradition in their own hacking case. Russian officials went as far as arresting and sentencing an Israeli woman to seven years in prison on drug-related charges and offering to release her in a prison swap with Burkov.

It also happened with [Pyotr Levashov](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/russia-extradition-levashov.html), the Russian national behind the Kelihos botnet. As soon as he was detained in Spain, someone in Russian law enforcement realized he hacked a Russian hospital years before and immediately sought his extradition—even if Levashov said in court he was working with the FSB.

And stuff like this has been happening for years, even as far back as 2012, with [Dmitry Zubakha](https://roem.ru/04-03-2014/112156/glavnomu-geroyu-spaseniya-ryadovogo-zubahi-dali-4-goda-uslovno-po-33-i-158-statyam-uk-rf/), who was accused of launching DDoS attacks on Amazon and eBay. As soon as Zubakha was detained in Cyprus, Russian authorities waved their wand, made some criminal case appear out of the blue, filed an extradition request, got Zubakha extradited to Russia, and then gave him a suspended sentence.

It's stuff like—"*oh, we totally forgot we were prosecuting him too*"—that makes it hard to believe that Russian authorities actually have a case against Kislitin.

We're not here to say Kislitsin is guilty. [Group-IB](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/official-statment-gib-cr-16-00440/) and its new Russian incarnation [FACCT](https://t.me/F_A_C_C_T/2894) have both pointed out Kislitin was working as a journalist and security researcher when all of the stuff in the US indictment happened. We're just pointing out that Kislitsin's case in Russia may just be made up.

The most interesting part in this extradition battle isn't actually the case, but if Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic, will extradite Kislitsin to the US.

Earlier this year, Georgia, another former Soviet republic, broke an invisible line and [arrested and extradited a Russian national](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/politics/dariy-pankov-arrest-hacking-tool/index.html) accused of creating the NLBrute hacking tool to the US. That case came out of the blue and didn't give Russian officials time to react and hocus-pocus a counter-extradition claim. Russia was also busy with some stuff in Ukraine.

If the US manages to extradite another Russian national from a former Soviet republic, things are about to get very interesting in the Russian-speaking cybercrime underground.

Dmitry Smilyanets, director of product management at Recorded Future, says the arrest has already caused some waves, with some calling the arrest a "[betrayal" and "backstabbing](https://therecord.media/russian-cyber-expert-arrested-in-kazakhstan-triggering-showdown)."

Russian-speaking groups often considered the former Soviet space to be their back garden and a safe space. All of a sudden, the back garden got a lot smaller.

### **Breaches, hacks, and security incidents**

**Themis cyber-heist:** A threat actor has used a prophecy machine manipulation attack to steal $370,000 worth of crypto-assets from DeFi platform Themis. The hack took place less than two weeks after the project launched. The company is now trying to "[work with the hacker](https://archive.li/mUVc8)" to get some of the stolen funds back.

**USPTO data leak:** The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has confirmed it inadvertently exposed the home addresses of almost 61,000 patent filers. The leak occurred following a misconfiguration in one of the agency's APIs. The API endpoint was being used by the USPTO staff and filers to check the status of pending trademark registrations. The leak lasted from February 2020 to March 2023, when the agency discovered and fixed the issue.

**Let's Encrypt incident:** Let's Encrypt says it [found a bug](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2023-06-15-certificate-policies-extension-mismatch/200155) in one of its new systems that led to the incorrect issuances of 645 certificates. Everything has been revoked and fixed. More on t...
