Several radio stations across multiple Russian cities were hacked this Wednesday (February 22) to broadcast air raid warnings.

The air raid alerts were heard in Belgorod, Kazan, Novosibirsk, Magnitogorsk, Penza, Ufa, Voronezh, Nizhny Novgorod, Tyumen, Izhevsk, and other cities, according to reports from *[Vedomosti](https://www.vedomosti.ru/society/news/2023/02/22/963970-v-mchs-oprovergli-soobscheniya-ob-ugroze-raketnogo-udara)*and *[SbirMedia](https://t.me/sibirmedia/25554)*.

Multiple radio stations were hacked, including the likes of Relax FM, Humor FM, Business FM, Like FM, Comedy FM, Romantika, Avtoradio, Radio Energy, and Children's Radio. According to [RIA](https://ria.ru/20230222/radio-1853668209.html), many of the stations were part of Gazprom Media, which may offer a clue on how the hackers managed to blast the fake air raid warning at about the same time.

Russian local officials called the incident "a provocation by supporters of the Kyiv regime."

The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations confirmed the hack in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/mchs_official/7448), but they did not share any info on the attack or any attribution.

This is not the first time suspected Ukrainian hackers have hacked Russian radio stations. In June 2022, one such hacker hijacked Kommersant's FM radio to blast the Ukrainian anthem and anti-war songs, forcing the company to temporarily shut down its air programming and broadcast solely via the internet for a few hours.

Two months later, in August 2022, Ukrainian hackers [hijacked security cameras](https://americanmilitarynews.com/2022/08/russian-surveillance-cameras-hacked-to-blast-pro-ukraine-music-over-speakers/) across the occupied Crimea and Donbas to play patriotic Ukrainian music on Ukraine's Independence Day.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Gate.io hid a 2018 hack:** Cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io hid a major hack that took place in April 2018 when the company had its hot wallet compromised by North Korean hackers and lost $230 million worth of assets. The hack was [discovered](https://archive.ph/CIjj7) last November by a blockchain investigator named ZachXBT but only got widespread attention this week after the hackers [moved $3.2 million](https://archive.ph/cTjIN) worth of Ether to new addresses.

**Dole ransomware:** A ransomware attack has forced agricultural and food production giant Dole to shut down its food packaging and distribution operations across North America. The incident took place earlier this month and impacted the company's ability to ship ready-to-eat salad kits across the US. According to *[CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/22/business/dole-cyberattack)*, Dole [disclosed the incident](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=643034774494517&id=100063639997295) to retailers once it took place, but two weeks later, the company's operations are still down across the US.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Valve's Dota2 honeypot catch cheaters:** Gaming company Valve has [banned over 40,000 Dota2 accounts](https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3677788723152833273) using a game patch that introduced a honeypot that caught their cheating software. Valve says the cheating tool used a Dota2 exploit to allow cheaters to read game data that would not show up on the screen during normal gameplay. Through a recent update, Valve says it patched the exploit but also added a honeypot system to keep the data available but also log which user accounts accessed it. Valve says that each account banned this week continued to read this data following its patch and that each ban handed out was "well-deserved." Also, in good news for gamers everywhere, Activision has also won a civil case it filed against the company behind EngineOwning, the most popular cheating tool for the Call of Duty franchise. A judge ordered EngineOwning to pay Activision [$3 million](https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/modern-warfare-2-voice-actors-for-all-characters-1964695/) in damages.

**Twitter Blue already abused (or used as intended):** Internet and big tech research group Reset says that Russian propaganda networks are buying Twitter Blue subscriptions to promote and spread misinformation about the Ukrainian war atop people's timelines. The discovery comes after several misinformation experts warned Musk last year that the feature would be abused this way. According to a Reset report shared with the *[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/22/russian-propagandists-said-buy-twitter-blue-check-verifications/)*, most of these accounts are brand-spanking new, created last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and focus on spreading messages from Russian politicians and its media. But the actual discussion here is about the potential and the very likely possibility of oppressive governments funneling money into Twitter's accounts for its silent and complicit consent to carry their garbage propaganda.

> "The accounts claim to be based outside of Russia, so they can pay for verification without running afoul of US sanctions. But they pass along articles from state-run media, statements by Russian officials, and lies about Ukraine from Kremlin allies."
