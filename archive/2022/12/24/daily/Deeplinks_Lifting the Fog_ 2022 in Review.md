Earlier this year, a cross-team group of EFF technologists, researchers, activists, and lawyers broke the story of [Fog Data Science, a secretive data broker](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police) that sells cops access to huge quantities of people's precise location data. The data they use is harvested from our phone apps, sent to data brokers, and sold to the highest bidder â€“ including, we learned, to state and local law enforcement. This [violates](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/fog-data-science-puts-our-fourth-amendment-rights-sale) the Fourth Amendment. While federal agencies have been [notorious](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/how-federal-government-buys-our-cell-phone-location-data) in recent years for their purchase of such data, our reporting seems to be the first showing a company selling it to state and local police. In addition to our [several deep-dives](https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers) into Fog and its product, we collaborated with Associated Press on a [major article](https://apnews.com/article/technology-police-government-surveillance-d395409ef5a8c6c3f6cdab5b1d0e27ef) which led to further reporting from [dozens](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-mass-surveillance-fog-reveal-tech-tool/) [of](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/09/cops-wanted-to-keep-mass-surveillance-app-secret-privacy-advocates-refused/) [other](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7v34a/fog-reveal-local-cops-pho...
