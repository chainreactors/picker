This week's cyber world is like a big spy movie. Hackers are breaking into other hackers' setups, sneaky malware is hiding in popular software, and AI-powered scams are tricking even the smartest of us. On the other side, the good guys are busting secret online markets and kicking out shady chat rooms, while big companies rush to fix new security holes before attackers can jump in.

Want to know who's hacking who, how they're doing it, and what's being done to fight back? Stick around‚Äîthis recap has the scoop.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Turla Hackers Hijack Pakistan Hackers' Infrastructure ‚Äî** Imagine one hacker group [sneaking into another hacker group](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/russia-linked-turla-exploits-pakistani.html)'s secret hideout and using their stuff to carry out their own missions. That's basically what the Russia-linked **Turla** group has been doing since December 2022. They broke into the servers of a Pakistani hacking team called **Storm-0156** and used those servers to spy on government and military targets in Afghanistan and India. By doing this, Turla not only got easy access to important information but also made it way harder for anyone to figure out who was actually running the show. This is a classic move for Turla‚Äîthey often hijack other hackers' operations to hide their tracks and make it super confusing to tell who's really behind these attacks.

### **üîî Top News**

* **Ultralytics and @solana/web3.js Libraries Targeted by Supply Chain Attacks ‚Äî** In two separate incidents, unknown threat actors managed to push malicious versions of the popular [Ultralytics](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/ultralytics-ai-library-compromised.html) library for Python and [@solana/web3.js](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/researchers-uncover-backdoor-in-solanas.html) package for npm that contained code to drop a cryptocurrency miner and a drainer, respectively. The maintainers have since released updated versions to address the issue.
* **New Android Malware DroidBot Targets Over 70 Financial Institutions ‚Äî** Dozens of banking institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and national organizations have become the target of a newly discovered Android remote access trojan (RAT) called [DroidBot](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/this-3000-android-trojan-targeting.html). The malware is capable of gathering a wide range of information from compromised devices. A majority of the campaigns distributing the malware have targeted users in Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. DroidBot has been observed operating under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model for a monthly fee of $3,000.
* **A Busy Week of Law Enforcement Actions ‚Äî** Europol last week announced the disruption of a clearnet marketplace called [Manson Market](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/europol-shuts-down-manson-market-fraud.html) that facilitated online fraud on a large scale by acting as a hub for stolen financial information. A 27-year-old and a 37-year-old have been arrested in Germany and Austria, respectively, in connection with the operation. They are currently in pretrial detention. Separately, the law enforcement agency said it also dismantled an invite-only encrypted messaging service called [MATRIX](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/europol-dismantles-criminal-messaging.html) that's created by criminals for criminal purposes, including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, and money laundering.
* **Tibetans and Uyghurs Become the Target of Earth Minotaur ‚Äî** A newly christened threat activity cluster dubbed [Earth Minotaur](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/hackers-target-uyghurs-and-tibetans.html) has been found leveraging the MOONSHINE exploit kit to deliver a new backdoor called DarkNimbus as part of long-term surveillance operations targeting Tibetans and Uyghurs. In the attack chains documented by Trend Micro, the attackers leveraged WeChat as a conduit to deploy the backdoor. The use of MOONSHINE has been previously linked to other groups like POISON CARP and UNC5221, suggesting some kind of tool sharing.
* **Salt Typhoon Guidance Issued ‚Äî** Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. issued a [joint guidance](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/joint-advisory-warns-of-prc-backed.html) for organizations to safeguard their networks against threats posed by Salt Typhoon, which has been recently linked to a spate of cyber attacks directed against telecommunication companies in the U.S., including AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. As many as eight telecom companies in the U.S., with dozens of other nations, are estimated to be affected as a result of the campaign.
* **Malware Campaign Leverages Corrupt Word and ZIP Files ‚Äî** New phishing campaigns [ongoing since at least August 2024](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/hackers-use-corrupted-zips-and-office.html) have been taking advantage of corrupted Microsoft Office documents and ZIP archives as a way to bypass email defenses.
