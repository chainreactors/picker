Organizations in the health care sector and those that work with it often hear about HIPAA, HITECH, and HITRUST compliance but may not understand what they all are and what they have to do with each other. This post will help clear this up by explaining the similarities and differences between each of these frameworks.

## HIPAA

The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/pdf/PLAW-104publ191.pdf) is a law originally passed in 1996 with five titles, each covering a different topic:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Title** | **Purpose** |
| Title I | Protecting health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs |
| Title II | Establishing standards for electronic health care transactions and requiring their use |
| Title III | Setting guidelines for pre-tax medical accounts |
| Title IV | Setting guidelines for group health plans |
| Title V | Regulating company-owned life insurance policies |

When most organizations ask about HIPAA compliance (especially organizations reaching out to security consulting firms like TrustedSec), they are specifically concerned with HIPAA Title II. While the main purpose of Title II is to define the standards for electronic transactions, it also mandates security and privacy requirements for those electronic transactions.

The law resulting from HIPAA only provides vague outlines of its requirements and instructs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create detailed regulations to better define the requirements. To support Title II, HHS has produced regulations including:

* The Administrative Rule at [45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 162](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-162) that documents the standard transaction formats and when they are required
* The Security Rule at [45 CFR Part 164 Subpart C](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-C/part-164/subpart-C) that defines how the electronic transactions covered by the Administrative Rule must be protected
* The Privacy Rule at [45 CFR Part 164 Subpart E](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/part-164/subpart-E) that defines what organizations can do with the information contained in the transactions covered by the Administrative Rule

## HITECH

HIPAA was amended by another law, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, which is contained in Title XIII of the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ5/pdf/PLAW-111publ5.pdf). The ...
