ANY.RUN Becomes a Gold Winner in Threat Intelligence at Globee Awards 2025

We are honored to announce that [ANY.RUN](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=globee_2025_ti&utm_term=240425&utm_content=linktolanding) became a gold winner at the annual Globee Business Awards 2025. The award aims to recognize and celebrate excellence in various industries worldwide, including cybersecurity.

Our solution, ANY.RUN’s [TI Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=globee_2025_ti&utm_term=240425&utm_content=linktolookup), was named best in the Cyber Threat Intelligence category. We believe that threat intelligence is an essential aspect of [ensuring the cybersecurity of organizations](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-threat-intelligence-lookup-helps-enterprises/), and recognition in this sphere is important to us.

We’d like to thank you—our readers, partners, users of our products, and all fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals!

## **What makes TI Lookup special**

It is continuously enriched with extensive data on the latest threats analyzed by 500,000 security professionals and 15,000 companies in [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=globee_2025_ti&utm_term=240425&utm_content=linktoregistration#register/).

As a result, it contains a wealth of indicators and events logged during analyses, including [**IOCs, IOAs, and IOBs**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-in-ti-feeds/)**.**
