# All Gmail users at risk from clever replay attack

Posted: April 22, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Cybercriminals are abusing Google’s infrastructure, creating emails that appear to come from Google in order to persuade people into handing over their Google account credentials.

This attack, first [flagged by Nick Johnson](https://x.com/nicksdjohnson/status/1912439023982834120), the lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a [blockchain](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blockchain-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-work) equivalent of the popular internet naming convention known as the Domain Name System (DNS).

Nick received a very official looking security alert about a subpoena allegedly issued to Google by law enforcement to information contained in Nick’s Google account. A URL in the email pointed Nick to a sites.google.com page that looked like an exact copy of the official Google support portal.

> Recently I was targeted by an extremely sophisticated [phishing attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing), and I want to highlight it here. It [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) a vulnerability in Google's infrastructure, and given their refusal to fix it, we're likely to see it a lot more. Here's the email I got: [pic.twitter.com/tScmxj3um6](https://t.co/tScmxj3um6)

As a computer savvy person, Nick spotted that the official site should have been hosted on `accounts.google.com` and not `sites.google.com`. The difference is that anyone with a Google account can create a website on `sites.google.com`. And that is exactly what the cybercriminals did.

Attackers increasingly use Google Sites to host phishing pages because the domain appears trustworthy to most users and can bypass many security filters. One of those filters is DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), an email [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) protocol that allows the sending server to attach a digital signature to an email.

If the target clicked either “Upload additional documents” or “View case”, they were redirected to an exact copy of the Google sign-in page designed to steal their login credentials.

Your Google credentials are coveted prey, because they give access to core Google services like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube, but also any third-party apps and services you have chosen to log in with your Google account.

The signs to recognize this scam are the pages hosted at `sites.google.com` which should have been `support.google.com` and `accounts.google.com` and the sender address in the email header. Although it was signed by `accounts.google.com`, it was emailed by another address. If a person had all these accounts compromised in one go, this could easily lead to [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft).

## How to avoid scams like this

* Don’t follow links in unsolicited emails or on unexpected websites
* Carefully look at the email headers when you receive an unexpected mail
* Verify the legitimacy of such emails through another, independent method
* Don’t use your Google account (or Facebook for that matter) to log in at other sites and services. Instead create an account on the serv...
