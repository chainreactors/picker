A new hero's journey is beginning... and YOU are writing the adventure.

CyberSec Games has just announced their [CyberSec Game Challenge 2025](https://cybersecgames.com/pages/the-cybersec-game-challenge). The mission? Share your initial concept for a physical game that helps people understand cybersecurity through play.

An adventure wouldn't be complete without some clues, so read closely:

* What’s your game idea?
* How do you play it?
* How does your game create a real cybersecurity outcome?

Adam is excited to play his role as the Dwarven Cleric, guiding builders with wisdom and playful defenses. He and the council of judges are looking forward to seeing a new hero's tale, one filled with learning, opportunity, and fresh ideas.

So come forward, share your idea, and let the adventure begin!

⏳ Deadline: 10 October 2025 (little less than a month out... start tinkering!)
