# Supporting Victims of the Lykke Exchange Shutdown: A New Initiative for Legal Action and Asset Recovery

December 27, 2024/in [News](https://blog.backbox.org/category/news/)

BackBox.org is launching a dedicated platform to assist victims of the Lykke Exchange incident, a presupposed hacker attack that occurred in June 2024 and resulted in the loss of approximately 20 million Swiss francs. This initiative focuses on helping affected users navigate the aftermath of the platform’s closure and the failure to reimburse customers for their lost assets.

Our mission is to provide guidance, connect victims with legal professionals, and support technical investigations. Legal actions will be directed at those who may hold responsibility for the platform’s abrupt shutdown and the lack of compensation for users.

If you have been affected by this incident or are interested in supporting the cause, we invite you to become part of our community. By joining, you’ll gain access to valuable resources, expert support, and collective efforts aimed at holding those responsible accountable. Together, we can pursue justice and strive for the recovery of lost assets.
