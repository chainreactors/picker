# Beyond good ol’ Run key, Part 140

Posted on [2022-12-30](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2022/12/30/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-140/ "11:29 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

This is a real oldie, but still worth a mention…

Java gives us a lot of persistence possibilities and one of them are environment variables; when set, they will be adhered to, and as such, can be abused:

* JAVA\_HOME – where java run-time resides
* LIBRARY\_PATH – where the Java libraries sit
* JVM\_DLL – this is a juicy one, which Java virtual machine DLL to load

If you see these set on the system, keep an eye on what they are pointing to.
