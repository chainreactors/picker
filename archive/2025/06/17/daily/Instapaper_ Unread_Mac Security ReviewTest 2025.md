# Mac Security Review/Test 2025

13. June 2025

* [Press Releases](https://www.av-comparatives.org/category/press-section/press-releases/)

AV-Comparatives has released its latest [Mac certification test report](https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mac-security-test-review-2025/), covering the effectiveness and usability of antivirus products for macOS.

The 2025 test assessed nine security solutions on systems running macOS Sequoia, including both consumer and business products. The certified solutions (in alphabetical order) are:

* Avast Security Free for Mac
* AVG AntiVirus Free for Mac
* Avira Free Security for Mac
* Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac
* CrowdStrike Falcon Pro for Mac
* Intego Mac Internet Security X9
* Kaspersky Premium for Mac
* Norton AntiVirus Plus for Mac
* Trellix Endpoint Security (HX) for Mac

To earn certification, products had to demonstrate strong malware protection, zero false positives, solid system performance, and effective real-time protection, while avoiding misleading alerts and maintaining usability.

The evaluation included detection of Mac-specific malware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), along with an optional test for Windows malware detection to ensure Mac users don’t become unwitting carriers of threats to others.

Beyond technical performance, the report also analyzes the installation experience, user interface, and alert behavior of each product. A dedicated section offers practical security advice for everyday Mac users.

Macs continue to face cybersecurity threats despite long-standing myths about immunity. AV-Comparatives’ testing reaffirms the importance of using trusted and reliable security software on Apple devices.
