Organizations are approaching [secure access service edge](/cyberpedia/what-is-sase) (SASE) adoption from two main directions: network-led or security-led transformation. Both approaches ultimately converge on the same SASE outcome with a unified, cloud-delivered platform for more secure, performant access to applications and data from anywhere. The choice depends on whether your business’s primary challenge is network agility or security complexity. In practice, successful SASE transformations often require balancing both priorities for a fully integrated solution. Here’s how these approaches differ.

### **Network-Led Transformation to SASE**

Network-led transformation is often initiated by the need to modernize and optimize the network. This generally starts with an SD-WAN deployment to improve branch connectivity, application performance and overall network agility. The initial emphasis is on enhancing network efficiency, reducing latency, while supporting distributed and cloud-based environments. Security features are integrated as the network evolves, but networking remains the foundation. Organizations replace legacy WAN (like MPLS) with SD-WAN, then incrementally add cloud-delivered security services (SWG, CASB, ZTNA) as part of the SASE stack.

* **Benefits**
  + Improved costs and economies of scale.
  + Improved network performance and reliability.
  + Simplified network management.
  + Easier cloud adoption and support for hybrid workforces.
  + Security is gradually integrated, often resulting in a more seamless transition for IT teams focused on connectivity.

### **Security-Led Transformation to SASE**

Security-led transformation is initiated by the need to enhance security posture, address new threats, as well as simplify fragmented security tool sets. The emphasis is on consolidating and modernizing security controls (SWG, CASB, ZTNA, FWaaS), often via a security service edge (SSE) approach. Networking enhancements are integrated as security matures. Organizations may already have robust networking in place and focus first on unifying security policies, gaining visibility and enforcing zero trust principles across users and devices, regardless of location.

* **Benefits**
  + Stronger and more consistent security enforcement.
  + Reduced risk from legacy, fragmented security tools.
  + Centralized visibility and policy management.
  + Quick wins for security compliance and threat protection, especially for remote and cloud access.

[Prisma SASE](/sase) seamlessly enables both pathways to secure digital transformation. The network-led SASE transformation and Prisma SD-WAN pave the pathway forward.

## Unlock Network-Led SASE Transformation with Palo Alto Networks Prisma SASE

Palo Alto Networks Prisma SASE enables network-led SASE transformation by tightly integrating advanced networking capabilities with robust security in a unified, cloud-delivered platform.

Here’s how Prisma SASE supports organizations prioritizing network modernization as the foundation for their SASE journey.

### 1. Integrated SD-WAN and Networking Services

[Prisma SD-WAN](/sase/sd-wan) offers a best-in-class, Cloud managed wide area network (WAN) solution, featuring an elastic, application-defined connectivity and a cloud-scale, controller-based architecture. This enables organizations to modernize their network infrastructure by replacing legacy WANs and providing users with direct-to-app access for enhanced performance and agility.

Prisma SD-WAN provides features, such as application-aware routing, AIOps-driven automation and cloud-delivered branch services. These capabilities make it ideal for businesses looking to optimize their SaaS, UCaaS and overall cloud application performance. As exemplified by [Salesforce](/customers/salesforce), which described the templatized deployment of Prisma SD-WAN across more than 70 global offices as "a snap," the simplicity and ease of management drive adoption for skilled IT teams focused on operational efficiency. Palo Alto Networks has been recognized as the only leader in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant for both Single-Vendor SASE and SD-WAN, validating its innovation and market relevance.

### 2. Zero Trust Security Built Into the Network

While network transformation is the entry point, Prisma SASE embeds zero trust network access (ZTNA) and comprehensive security natively, ensuring that as the network evolves, security is not an afterthought but an integral part of the architecture.

### 3. Internet of Things (IoT)/operational Technology (OT) Security

Protects IoT, OT and unmanaged devices in SD-WAN-connected branches (e.g., retail POS systems, industrial IoT) with device identities and profiles, but without additional sensors.

### 4. Unified Management and Reduced Complexity

By consolidating network and security operations into a single cloud management portal, the platform provides unified visibility and control, significantly reducing complexity and operational overhead for IT teams. Management is further streamlined through multitenant capabilities and automation, which makes it easier for organizations to scale their operations and adapt to evolving business requirements.

### 5. Autonomous Digital Experience Management (ADEM)

Natively integrated within Prisma SD-WAN, [Autonomous Digital Experience Management (ADEM)](/sase/adem) delivers comprehensive visibility across all network paths and endpoints. By continuously monitoring the digital experience, it leverages AI to proactively help identify and remediate network issues before they can impact users. Capabilities like this are crucial for maintaining a consistent and exceptional user experience across distributed environments, fulfilling a core requirement for any network-led transformation initiative.

### 6. AI-Driven Network Optimization and Resilience

Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, the platform actively monitors, optimizes traffic, as well as repairs enterprise networks in real time. It intelligently manages traffic flows by identifying anomalies and autonomously adjusting routing to proactively prevent any service degradation. Furthermore, Prisma SD-WAN's AIOps capabilities extend to analyzing network configurations and providing actionable recommendations for improvement, helping organizations maintain a robust and resilient network infrastructure as they continue to scale.
