Right as rain

While it wasn‚Äôt as ‚Äúsoon‚Äù as I would have liked, I am (*finally*) pleased to announce the availability of public images of iOS 16, Android 14, and iOS 17.

A few notes. First, there are no Reader versions. I will revisit including them in the future, though. Second, there is no non-Cellebrite-extraction-structure version for the iOS images. In talking with a few folks I found that format was not needed. Third, the iOS 17 image is a continuation of the iOS 16 image (i.e., I upgraded the phone to iOS 17 and kept documenting and generating data). Expect to see that again for future iOS and Android considering iOS 18 and Android 15 are literally around the corner. üôÇ

All files are hosted by [Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org). As usual, each image is accompanied by documentation:

* Android 14 image can be found [here](https://corp.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/mobile/android_14/). Documentation can be found [here](https://thebinaryhick.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Android14-ImageCreation.pdf).
* iOS 16 image can be found [here](https://corp.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/mobile/iOS16/). Documentation can be found [here](https://thebinaryhick.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iOS16-ImageCreation.pdf).
* iOS 17 image can be found [here](https://corp.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/mobile/iOS17/). Documentation can be found [here](https://thebinaryhick.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iOS17-ImageCreation.pdf).

Hash information for each of the tar.gz files is as follows:

Android\_14\_Public\_Image.tar.gz

MD5:

Each image and associated data comes in a tar.gz file. For Windows users I recommend 7-Zip, and for macOS users I recommend Keka. Uncompressed, each image is between 30 ‚Äì 35 GBs in size. Hash values are listed in the accompanying documentation.

**\*\*\*Please do not attempt to download any cloud data from any of the apps in the image. If you want cloud data, please contact me directly to discuss.\*\*\***

As always, these images are freely available to anyone who wants them for training, education, testing, or research. Thanks to [Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org) for hosting.

   When parsing with Cellebrite Physical Analyzer, I am prompted for password to Wickr Pro. This however does not figure in the documentation PDF. Have you set a password? Thanks in advance.
