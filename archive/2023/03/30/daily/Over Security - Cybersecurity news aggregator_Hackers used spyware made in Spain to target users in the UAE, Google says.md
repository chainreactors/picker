# Hackers used spyware made in Spain to target users in the UAE, Google says

In November 2022, Google [revealed the existence](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/30/variston-spyware-chrome-firefox-windows/) of a then-unknown spyware vendor called Variston. Now, Google researchers say they have seen hackers use Variston’s tools in the United Arab Emirates.

In a [report published on Wednesday](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/spyware-vendors-use-0-days-and-n-days-against-popular-platforms/), Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) said it discovered hackers targeting people in the UAE who used Samsung’s native Android browser, which is a customized version of Chromium. The hackers used a set of vulnerabilities chained together and delivered via one-time web links sent to the targets by text message. Of the four vulnerabilities in the chain, two were zero-days at the time of the attack, meaning they had not been reported to the software maker and were unknown at that point, according to the new blog post by TAG.

If a target clicked on the malicious web links, they would have been directed to a landing page “identical to the one TAG examined in the [Heliconia framework](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-details-on-commercial-spyware-vendor-variston/) developed by commercial spyware vendor Variston.” (Both campaigns used the same exact and unique landing page, Google told TechCrunch. Once exploited the victim would have been infected with “a fully featured Android spyware suite” designed to capture data from chat and browser apps, according to the post.

“The actor using the exploit chain to target UAE users may be a customer or partner of Variston, or otherwise working closely with the spyware vendor,” the blog post read.

It’s unclear who is behind the hacking campaign or who the victims are. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that TAG observed about 10 malicious web links in the wild. Some of the links redirected to StackOverflow after exploitation and may have been the attacker’s test devices, Google said. TAG said it wasn’t clear who was behind the hacking campaign.

Samsung spokesperson Chris Langlois said that the company has “already taken necessary steps to prevent these potential exploit chains by issuing patches for the Samsung Internet app in December 2022.”

“December’s updates to the Samsung Internet app disable entry points for the remaining vulnerabilities and ensure devices are protected. We are actively collaborating with our partners to release patches for the remaining vulnerabilities as early as possible, starting in April, and recommend all users keep their devices updated with the latest software to ensure the highest level of protection possible,” Langlois said.

Ralf Wegener and Ramanan Jayaraman are the founders of Variston, [according to Intelligence Online](https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2021/10/22/german-ralf-wegener-builds-small-cyber-intelligence-empire-in-cyprus-and-beyond%2C109700415-gra), an online news publication that covers the surveillance industry. The two owned half of the company each in 2018, according to Spanish business records.

Neither founder responded to a request for comment. Variston is headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. According to business registration records in Italy, Variston acquired the Italian zero-day research company Truel in 2018.

The hacking campaign in the UAE was discovered by Amnesty International’s Security Lab. [In a press release](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/03/new-android-hacking-campaign-linked-to-mercenary-spyware-company/), Amnesty said that the campaign has been active since at least 2020 and targeted both mobile phones and computers. Amnesty said they observed the exploits being delivered by a network of more than 1,000 malicious domains, “including domains spoofing media websites in multiple countries.” The organization also said they observed traces of the campaign in Indonesia, Belarus, the UAE and Italy, but these countries “likely represent only a small subset of the overall attack campaign based on the extensive nature of the wider attack infrastructure.”

Google also said on Wednesday that it discovered hackers exploiting an iOS zero-day bug, [patched in November](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/apple-zero-day-webkit-iphone/), to remot...
