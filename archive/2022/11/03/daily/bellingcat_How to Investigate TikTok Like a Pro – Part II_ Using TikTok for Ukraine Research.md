# How to Investigate TikTok Like a Pro - Part II: Using TikTok for Ukraine Research

November 2, 2022

TikTok has emerged as a key platform on which footage of the invasion of Ukraine is shared.

This includes footage of missile strikes and [their aftermath](https://www.tiktok.com/%40weekend.vn.tour/video/7120175032499735813), [damaged or destroyed military equipment](https://www.tiktok.com/%40romapyrotech/video/7084495064696622341), as well as visual evidence of suspected war crimes and other atrocities.

Misinformation and disinformation about the invasion can also be found on the platform. This includes posts by [Russian state-backed media](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/propaganda-russia-state-controlled-media-flood-tiktok-with-ukraine-disinformation/), posts of old or unrelated videos falsely claiming to show contemporary events and misleading or false claims about the details of a video -such as the location it was recorded.

In short, there is much for digital investigators to explore on TikTok.

But compared to other social media companies, TikTok does not currently allow researchers to access and inspect data at scale. Investigating content on TikTok is mostly a manual process that can be very time consuming. Yet there are methods, tools and shortcuts that can help.

**Bellingcat released a guide in 2020 detailing some of the basic steps to investigate TikTok. This detailed how to:**

* Extract user profile information, download and archive profile photos and videos
* Understand the differences between using TikTok on a web browser and mobile app
* Tips on privacy for users and investigators
* Use the app for content and information discovery for videos, users and hashtags
* Use external platforms such as search engines and other social media platforms to find TikTok content

Readers can view this guide [here](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/05/25/investigate-tiktok-like-a-pro/).

**What follows is a guide that builds on that introduction, adds new tips and techniques and shows how they can be applied to the War in Ukraine.**

Among the topics covered are:

* An update on the differences between the mobile app and web browser
* Tips on content searches and how to find metadata on the app
* Using third party tools and browser plugins to extract audio, text from images, and conduct real-time translation
* Recording your work as you go and how to get the best out of the app and web browser versions

While this article can work as a standalone guide, it is also worth reading our original intro to TikTok as a refresher. More recently, we also published [this guide](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2022/05/11/this-new-tool-lets-you-analyse-tiktok-hashtags/) on the Bellingcat-built tool that lets you analyse TikTok Hashtags.

Before we begin, however, a quick word on privacy and security. If you are using TikTok for research purposes, it’s recommended you operate anonymously and disclose as few personal details as possible. In November, TikTok released an [important privacy policy update](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/an-update-to-our-privacy-policy) for users in the UK and EU, confirming that their data can in some cases be accessed by employees outside the continent including in China. [New research](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/19/technology/tiktok-browser-tracking.html) found that code in TikTok’s in-app web browser allows the company to track users’ keystrokes. Researchers should never share any sensitive personal information on TikTok’s in-app web browser or via the mobile app.

Before beginning your research, take some time to update your privacy settings on the app. Switch off ‘suggest your account to phone contacts,’ switch off ‘people who open or send links to you,’ switch off ‘Facebook friends sync’ and switch off ‘profile view history’.

## **What has Changed Since 2020?**

TikTok originally only supported 15-to-60-second video options, but users can now also post three-minute videos. Ten-minute videos are currently available to some users and full release is likely to follow soon. TikTok has also added a livestream option for users who are over 16-years-old and have more than 1,000 followers.

User profiles still contain profile photos, biography, follower metrics, display and username, but users can now also link to other social media accounts (only Instagram and YouTube for now) in their profile. Currently, it is only possible to see if a user has linked to other social media accounts when using the TikTok mobile app.

Similarly, users can add a URL to their biography. Many use this to link to a landing page platform such as [Linktree,](https://linktr.ee/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BAU_UK_Google_Search_Brand_Intent&utm_term=linktree&utm_content=BAU_UK_Google_Search_Brand_Intent_Linktree&gclid=CjwKCAjw5P2aBhAlEiwAAdY7dHd59thtGs6nCzXv88MkZ66inxioLF5T4iQK_SOIPyFFhHjtxOYTfRoCmnkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) so be sure to click through to this if investigating a user as you might find links to their other social media accounts.

Users can now also create playlists, although these are also only viewable on the app, not a web browser like Chrome or Firefox.

## **Update on Mobile App vs Web Browser Experience**

TikTok is designed to be a mobile application. That means the web browser version has limited functionality compared to the mobile app but you’ll probably end up using both and moving videos from your mobile to a web browser like Chrome or Firefox on your laptop/desktop during the course of an investigation. I tend to think of the process like this: use the mobile app for content/account discovery and use the browser version on a laptop for archiving or performing analysis (geolocation, etc).

A user’s followers and following lists are viewable on the app but not on the web browser, so if you find a noteworthy account and want to find more like it, use the app to click through and inspect these lists, effectively using a [snowball sampling methodology](https://research-methodology.net/sampli...
