In episode 11 of The AI Fix, OpenAI battles a Shakespearean lawyer, Graham sings an uncanny bluegrass acrostic, Google drops the ball with a terrible AI ad, and Mark wonders why there‚Äôs no sound on a video of an AI dentist.

Graham finds religion with a little help from a man named ‚ÄúL Ron‚Äù, a traffic cone saves the world, and Mark has a heated argument with belligerent ChatGPT.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
