# 23andMe will retain your genetic information, even if you delete the account

Posted: October 17, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Deleting your personal data from 23andMe is proving to be hard.

There are good reasons for people wanting to delete their data from 23andMe: The DNA testing platform has a lot of problems, so let’s start with a recap.

A little over a year ago, cybercriminals put up information belonging to as many as [seven million 23andMe customers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/23andme) for sale on criminal forums following a credential stuffing attack against the genomics company.

In December 2023, we [learned](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/12/23andme-says-er-actually-some-genetic-and-health-data-might-have-been-accessed-in-recent-breach) that the attacker was able to directly access the accounts of roughly 0.1% of 23andMe’s users, which is about 14,000 of its 14 million customers. So far not too many people affected, but with the breached accounts at their disposal, the attacker used 23andMe’s opt-in DNA Relatives (DNAR) feature—which matches users with their genetic relatives—to access information about millions of other users.

For a subset of these accounts, the stolen data contained health-related information based upon the user’s genetics.

In January 2024, 23andMe had the audacity to lay the [blame at the feet of victims](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/01/23andme-blames-negligent-breach-victims-says-its-their-own-fault) themselves in a letter to legal representatives of victims. 23andMe reasoned that the customers whose data was directly accessed re-used their passwords, gave permission to share data with other users on 23andMe’s platform, and that the medical information was non-substantive.

And in September 2024, we found out that the company would pay $30 million to settle a class action lawsuit, as that was all that 23andMe could afford to pay. And that’s only because the expectation was that cyberinsurance would cover $25 million.

As a result, the value of 23andMe plummeted. And last month the [company said goodbye to all its board members](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/23andme-independent-directors-resign-from-board-read-the-ceo-memo.html) except for CEO Anne Wojcicki who stood by her plans to take the company private.

This uncertainty about the future of the company and, with that, who will be the future holder of all the customer [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), has caused a surge of users looking to close their accounts and delete their data.

However, it turns out it’s not as easy as just asking for the data to be removed. You can delete your data from 23andMe , but 23andMe says it will retain some of that data (including genetic information) to comply with the company’s legal obligations, according to its [privacy policy](https://www.23andme.com/en-eu/legal/privacy/full-version/).
