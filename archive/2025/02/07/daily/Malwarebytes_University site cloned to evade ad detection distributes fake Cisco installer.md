# University site cloned to evade ad detection distributes fake Cisco installer

Posted: February 5, 2025
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

There is a constant “cat and mouse” game between defenders and attackers, the latter trying to outsmart and get a head start on the former. In the context of online advertising, this involves creating fake identities or using stolen ones to push out malicious ads.

An attacker not only needs to evade detection but also create a lure that will be convincing to most people. In this blog post, we focus on what malvertisers use in almost all of their campaigns, namely decoys also known as “white pages” in order to fool the advertising entity.

The particular case is a malicious Google ad for Cisco AnyConnect, a tool often used by employees to remotely connect to company networks, but also by universities. In fact, we found that threat actors were using the name of a German university to create a fake website designed not to fool actual victims, but rather to bypass detection from security systems.

To be sure, victims were part of the overall scheme, but they were instead redirected to a lookalike Cisco site linking to a malicious installer containing the NetSupport RAT remote access [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan).

## The perfect disguise

The malicious ad comes up from a Google search for the keywords “*cisco annyconnect*“. The ad displays a URL that looks somewhat convincing for the domain *anyconnect-secure-client[.]com*. We should note that this domain was [registered](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/domain.png) less than a day before the ad appeared.

Upon clicking on the ad, server-side checks will determine whether this is a potential victim or not. Typically, a real victim has a residential [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) and other network settings that differentiate it from crawlers, bots, VPNs or proxies.

In recent times, we have seen criminals [rely on AI to generate fake pages](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/ai-generated-malvertising-white-pages-are-fooling-detection-engines) that look innocuous. These are also referred to as “white pages” and they do serve an important purpose. If it’s obviously so fake and bad, it will raise suspicion. We thought that in this case the perpetrator had a rather clever idea by stealing content from a university that actually does use Cisco AnyConnect.

Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden), is a public research university in Germany whose site can be found [here](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/zugang_datennetz/vpn/ssl_vpn?set_language=en). Funnily enough, the threat actors left a trail while doing their copy/paste. We can see that they added the cookie opt-in notification which is required for websites in Europe, which here leaked their browser language (Russian).
