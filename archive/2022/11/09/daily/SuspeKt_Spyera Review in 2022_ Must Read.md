# Spyera Review in 2023: Must Read

January 5, 2023January 4, 2023 by [Stefan Esser](https://www.suspek.org/author/admin/ "View all posts by Stefan Esser")

Our smartphones have become an integral part of our lives, so much so that the first and last thing most people look at before they end and the start of the day is to look at their phones. Hence, it is no surprise that most of our lives revolve around our devices.

Along with the conveniences offered by the internet, many dangers and temptations come through our smartphones and social media apps every day. This can be especially dangerous for children or partners.

With this in mind, concerned parents and partners can now rely on spy apps to help keep a close eye on their kids’ or spouses’ online activity via their smartphones.

Phone spy apps help you keep a watchful eye over your kids to ensure they’re out of harm’s way and partners can also use such apps to catch on cheating spouses. One such many monitoring apps that are available for you to count on is the Spyera app. But, is this the right app for you?

In our Spyera review article today, we will be talking about what you can and cannot do with the Spyera App. Without further ado, let’s jump straight into the review.

## What is Spyera?

Spyera is a popular monitoring app that helps parents and partners track the online activity of their target phone.

The parental control software gives you full access to the target phone by working in the background to give you details such as GPS location, emails, SMS, social media activities, and the ability to record phone calls without physical access to the actual target device.

The Spyera app works on most Android and iOS devices, as well as personal computers. However, it is still worth checking the compatibility of your target devices before purchasing a subscription – a topic which we will cover in a later section in our Spyera Review today.

## How Does Spyera Work?

As mentioned earlier, the Spyera parental control software works on a wide range of mobile phones by embedding itself deeply into the target phone and running in the background so as to not notify owners about your surveillance activity.

To begin spying on a phone, you need to first create a Spyera account and install the Spyera app on the target device. However, just like most spy apps, you’ll need temporary physical access to the iPhone or Android device to install the app.

Once the app is installed, it will begin tracking all important information on the phone and uploading them onto a cloud where you can access it any time, anywhere.

## Device Compatibility

Before purchasing an account with Spyera, you need to first check whether the app can work on the target phone. Below is a list of supported devices that work well with Spyera:

### Android

Android holds the biggest share in the smartphone market, hence it is obvious that Spyera needs to be designed to cater to Android users.

In fact, Spyera has made it such that all smartphones and tablets running on the Android operating system, including the latest version 10, can use Spyera. However, you need to keep in mind that your smartphone may need to be rooted to access the advanced features offered.

### iOS

Second to Android is iOS, which is why Spyera also offers its services for iOS devices. All iOS smartphones and iPads running on IOS versions up to 13.X can be effectively tracked by Spyera. However, you’ll need to jailbreak the iPhone in order to use most of Spyera features.

### macOS

In addition to smartphones, Spyera can also be used to monitor computers and Macs. Macs running on macOS Sierra/High Sierra, macOS El Capitan, Apple macOS Yosemite, Apple macOS Mavericks, and Apple macOS Mojave can be used with Spyera.

### Windows

On the other hand, if your target uses Windows PC or laptop instead of Mac, fret not as the company has also created a version where they can help you monitor devices running on Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows 7, Microsoft Windows 8.X, and Microsoft Windows 10.

### Pre-Installed Spyera App Devices

If you find the idea of rooting and jailbreaking a device simply way too complicated, Spyera has an option where you get to purchase smartphones with their app already pre-installed. This is a great option for parents to buy new phones for their kids without them knowing that they’re keeping track of what’s happening on their phones.

By purchasing the pre-installed Spyera phone, you get to eliminate the job of installing the app by yourself and any problems that comes with it. The app is professionally installed by the team at Spyera and all you need to do is to pass the new phone to your target and you’re all set.

## Key Features of Spyera

### Easy-to-Use Online Dashboard

Once you log onto Spyera, the website will direct you to their dashboard where you’re presented with all the relevant information extracted from the target phone along with any data available on the device such as the phone’s model, operating system, IMEI, SIM card, battery percentage, last sync time, and status.

The Spyera dashboard sports a very user-friendly interface with important categories listed on the left column of the page. On the right side, you get access to information such as recent received and missed calls, the date and time the calls took place, and even the phone number that contacted them.

Similar to incoming and outgoing calls, Spyera shows you information about all the text messages sent via the handphone along with the date and time of their occurrence. The spy app also has a function where it records the keystrokes recently made that are saved under the Latest Keylogs section and further organized according to apps.

All these features and important tracking information are made available on the Spyera dashboard that you can remotely access through your user account.

### Incoming and Outgoing Call Logs

The Spyera parental control software helps keep track of all calls made through the phone. The monitoring app stores all the information in the Call Logs in the control panel.

The data collected includes call duration, calls made, received, or missed, phone number and name of the contact saved on the phone, even the time and date stamp for each call is available.

The spy software even has a search option at the top-right corner of its control panel that you can use to filter out and search a specific number t...
