If you use the BTP Cockpit today and have some time to tell SAP about your experiences, here’s your chance: we will be running user feedback sessions from November 29th through December 1st. Here how you can participate.

### Developer experience on BTP

SAP Business Technology Platform has continued to evolve over a number of years. The central tool and access point has always been the BTP Cockpit. We are working on new UX concepts to change and improve the developer experience of BTP. We would like to share those with you and collect your honest feedback.

* Do you use the BTP Cockpit in your daily work?

* Are you a developer implementing on the BTP?

* Are you exploring BTP functionality and services or setting up and planning development projects?

* AND are you open and interested in sharing your perspective, providing feedback, and helping improve the future developer experience on BTP?

Then we invite you to join our user feedback sessions:

**Register for Topic 5: [Application Development & Integration – Reimagining the SAP Business Technology Platform Experience](https://experience.sap.com/remoteusabilitytesting/)**

We are running these sessions as part of the [TechEd Remote Usability Testing](https://www.sap.com/germany/about/events/teched/discover-more.html#usability-testing) program from November 29th through December 1st
Each session will be held as 1:1 interview running 60 min. Multiple slots are available every day.

### Goal and content of the sessions

We first want to understand your perspective, learn how you use BTP, and collect your feedback .
Then we want to show our ideas and design concepts on how we could improve the developer experience in the future. We are looking for an open discussion.

Your insights and expectations will help us influence future design and investment decisions.

Feel free to share this post with other colleagues who might be interested in joining.

We are very much looking forward to meeting you there ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@B969BAE0D8C981CE827F5448473094FE/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")!
