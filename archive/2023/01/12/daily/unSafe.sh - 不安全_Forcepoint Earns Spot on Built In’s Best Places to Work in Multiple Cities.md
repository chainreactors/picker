In early 2022, Forcepoint made the decision to formalize our hybrid working environment and prioritize a more fulfilling and sustainable work-life blend for our people.

In our most recent Point of View employee engagement survey, we received a **73% engagement score** and confirmation that we feel connected and clear about our strategy in the hybrid work environment we’ve adopted. In the same survey, we received an **83% engagement score** that indicates our team feels a sense of belonging at Forcepoint. It’s been a year of learning, adapting and exploring the right balance that allows us to stay connected as a team.

Thank you, Team Forcepoint. Your involvement in Employee Resource Groups, think tanks, holiday celebrations and Hackathons, to name just a few, are ways we are building Forcepoint’s inclusive culture, together.

**The good news? We’re certainly doing something right.**

We’re thrilled to announce we’ve been recognized by Built In for the culture, benefits and working model we’ve put in place at Forcepoint. What’s resonating about our company inside Forcepoint walls is being celebrated with external awards—and that feels really rewarding!

Today, **Built In** announced that Forcepoint was honored in its **2023 Best Places To Work Awards,** earning places on each of the following award lists:

* [Washington DC Best Large Places to Work](https://builtin.com/awards/washington-dc/2023/best-large-places-to-work "https://builtin.com/awards/washington-dc/2023/best-large-places-to-work")

The Built In annual awards program includes companies of all sizes, from startups to those in the enterprise, and honors both remote-first employers as well as companies in large tech markets across the U.S.

Built In determines the winners of Best Places to Work based on an algorithm, using company data about compensation and benefits. To reflect the benefits candidates are searching for more frequently on Built In, the program also weighs criteria like remote and flexible work opportunities, programs for DEI and other people-first cultural offerings.

Here's what Built In's Chief Marketing Officer, Sheridan Orr had to say:

> It’s my honor to congratulate this year’s Best Places to Work winners,”
>
> “These exemplary companies understand their people are their most valuable asset, and they’ve stepped up to meet the modern professional’s new expectations, including the desire to work for companies that deliver purpose, growth and inclusion."
>
> "These winners set the stage for a human-centered future of work, and we can’t wait to see that future unfold.”

While the recognition from Built In feels good for those working within Forcepoint, it’s also a tremendous lever for attracting the right talent into our company. And, as we continue to strategically grow our team to deliver on our transformative roadmap, this is extremely important!

We’re hyper-focused on hiring the right, diverse-of-thought, innovative and experienced talent to Forcepoint in 2023.
