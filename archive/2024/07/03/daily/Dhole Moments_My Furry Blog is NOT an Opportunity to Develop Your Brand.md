A common narrative on discussion boards like Hacker News is that my inclusion of my fursona on my technical blog posts somehow makes them [unsuitable for consumption in a business setting](https://soatok.blog/2023/11/17/this-would-be-more-professionally-useful-if-not-for-the-furry-art/). (This claim is made despite the fact that I’ve never posted pornographic art on this blog.)

**Well, Internet marketers must have missed *that* memo!**

They keep contacting me through various channels to try to pay me to publish something that promotes some business.

A few years ago, [I briefly humored one of these outreach requests](https://soatok.blog/2021/05/18/avoiding-the-frigid-hellscape-of-online-marketing/) just to see if they’d attempt to write it in my distinct style, complete with furry stickers. In the end, I declined payment and fully disclosed [their draft blog post and the emails](https://github.com/soatok/website/raw/master/public/static/soatok-vs-wise-marketing.zip).

If the recent deluge of emails from marketing agencies are indicative of a trend, neither the furry art nor shenanigans have made me enough of a pariah to the advertising industry for them to leave me alone.

## A word on emails and incentives

I generally don’t want to make a habit of publishing emails I’ve received, no matter how hilarious they would be to dunk on. This is especially true of hate emails I received over the years.

Part of the reason for my stance here is that it creates perverse incentives: Some people will enhance their negativity in the hopes that their email gets published next. This can lead the blogger to experience more negative feedback from their audience, which can lead to all sorts of toxic outcomes. Even if you avoid those, you still generally feel shittier about your own blog and interacting with people.

Conversely, I receive a lot of positive and thoughtful letters and comments from folks across the world. It’s a delight to hear from most of you.

I even occasionally hear from technical recruiters (and one investor) that are interested in working with cryptography or privacy experts. When this happens, I’ll funnel recruiters towards excellent people I know that are on the market for new jobs, and refer investors to companies staffed by people I’ve worked with before and know to be capable of delivering incredible work.

I actually don’t mind hearing from recruiters or investors in this way because there’s no editorial pressure on my blog’s contents. Connecting people on both sides of a potentially mutually beneficial business transaction is called *being part of society* and not a burden, nor something I hope to personally extract value from.

The problem is when people think they can pay me to publish their words as my own.

## I’m not interested

I’d like to believe that explanation is sufficient and satisfactory, but we clearly don’t live in the ideal world.

So here’s some more reasons why I’m not going to entertain any offers from advertisers.

### Your brand sucks

There’s no gentle way to put this, so I’m not going to mince words.

If you’re so desperate to try to get eyeballs on a product or service that you’ll ask furry bloggers that have explicitly made it a point to be hostile towards Advertising as an industry, your product or service is probably (at best) utter shit. In all likelihood, it’s even more likely to be a scam or a grift than merely “not valuable” to potential buyers.

If you’re that desperate, why would I subject my readers to your product or service at all, let alone endorse it?

Native Advertising is a known quantity in 2024.

### Your offer sucks

The dollar amount attached to these offers is, in practice, irrelevant. I wouldn’t sell out for any price, after all.

Having said that, the fact that these unsolicited offers are as cheap as they are also makes me feel kind of insulted.

You advertising parasites really think $100 (or *less*) is going to compel me to sell out? I’m not a middle school kid arguing for a bigger allowance. I have a career and pay a mortgage.

Give me *some* credit for fucks sake.

$100 wouldn’t even cover my hosting costs for this blog for half a year. Did someone in your network veer into the creepy realm of pick-up artists and suggest *negging* as an outreach strategy?

![XKCD comic about pickup artists.  [Hairy and Cueball sitting at a table.] Hairy: I've been learning tricks from pickup artist forums. Cueball: Pickup artists are dehumanizing creeps who see relationships as adversarial and women as sex toys. [Close-up of Hairy's head, with a faint outline of Black hat and Danish sitting at a table in the background.] Hairy: No, it's just a bunch of tips! Like negging: you belittle chicks to undermine their self-confidence so they'll be more vulnerable and seek your approval. [Close-up of Cueball's head.] Cueball: Just talk to them like a fucking human being. Hairy: Nah, that's a sucker's game. Hairy: Ok— wish me luck! [Small frame across top of panel reads Meanwhile... and Danish is sitting at a table with Black hat standing next to the table holding a bowling ball under his arm.] Black Hat: I'm going to the bathroom to roll a bowling ball down under the line of stalls. Danish: Cool. [Close up of Cueball's head, with Hairy approaching Danish's table in the background.] Cueball: Oh no. [Hairy and Danish at a table. Hairy is standing up and leaning on the table.] Hairy: You look like you're on a diet. That's great! Hairy: How's the fruit plate? [Close-up of Danish's head.] Danish: Ooh- are we negging? Danish: Let me try! [Close-up of Danish's head, with her hand raised.] Danish: You look like you're going to spend your life having one epiphany after another, always thinking you've finally figured out what's holding you back, and how you can finally be productive and creative and turn your life around. Danish: But nothing will ever change. That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. It's who you are. Danish: The thing standing in the way of your dreams Danish: is that the person having them is you. [Hairy and Danish at a table. Hairy is standing up.] Danish: Ok, your turn! Ooh, try insulting my hair! Hairy: I think I need to go home and think about my life. Danish: It won't help.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/xkcd-1027.png?resize=540%2C931&ssl=1)
