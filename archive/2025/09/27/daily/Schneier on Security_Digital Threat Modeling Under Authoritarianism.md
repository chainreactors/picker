## Digital Threat Modeling Under Authoritarianism

Today’s world requires us to make complex and nuanced decisions about our digital security. Evaluating when to use a secure messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp, which passwords to store on your smartphone, or what to share on social media requires us to assess risks and make judgments accordingly. Arriving at any conclusion is an exercise in threat modeling.

In security, [threat modeling](https://shostack.org/resources/threat-modeling) is the process of determining what security measures make sense in your particular situation. It’s a way to think about potential risks, possible defenses, and the costs of both. It’s how experts avoid being distracted by irrelevant risks or overburdened by undue costs.

We threat model all the time. We might decide to walk down one street instead of another, or use an internet VPN when browsing dubious sites. Perhaps we understand the risks in detail, but more likely we are [relying on intuition](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/08/risk_intuition.html) or some trusted authority. But in the U.S. and elsewhere, the average person’s threat model is changing—specifically involving how we protect our personal information. Previously, most concern centered on corporate surveillance; companies like Google and Facebook engaging in digital surveillance to maximize their profit. Increasingly, however, many people are worried about government surveillance and how the government could [weaponize personal data](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Schneier-Written-Testimony.pdf).

Since the beginning of this year, the Trump administration’s actions in this area have [raised alarm bells](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Schneier-Written-Testimony.pdf): The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) [took](https://www.epi.org/publication/trump-is-enabling-musk-and-doge-to-flout-conflicts-of-interest-what-is-the-potential-cost-to-u-s-families/) [data](https://ash.harvard.edu/resources/understanding-doge-and-your-data/) from federal agencies, Palantir combined disparate streams of government [data into a single system](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/privacy-under-siege-doges-one-big-beautiful-database/), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) [used social media posts](https://epic.org/documents/epic-v-ice-location-and-social-media-surveillance/) as a reason to deny someone entry into the U.S.

These threats, and others posed by a techno-authoritarian regime, are vastly different from those presented by a corporate monopolistic regime—and different yet again in a society where both are working together. Contending with these new threats requires a different approach to personal digital devices, cloud services, social media, and data in general.

### What Data Does the Government Already Have?

For years, most public attention has centered on the risks of tech companies gathering behavioral data. This is an enormous amount of data, generally [used to predict](https://www.publift.com/blog/what-is-behavioral-targeting) and influence consumers’ future behavior—rather than as a means of uncovering our past. Although commercial data is highly intimate—such as knowledge of your precise location over the course of a year, or the contents of every Facebook post you have ever created—it’s not the same thing as tax returns, police records, unemployment insurance applications, or medical history.

The U.S. government holds extensive data about everyone living inside its borders, some of it very sensitive—and there’s not much that can be done about it. This information consists largely of facts that people are legally obligated to tell the government. The IRS has a lot of very sensitive data about personal finances. The Treasury Department has data about any money received from the government. The Office of Personnel Management has an enormous amount of detailed information about government employees—including the very personal form required to get a security clearance. The Census Bureau possesses vast data about everyone living in the U.S., including, for example, a database of real estate ownership in the country. The Department of Defense and the Bureau of Veterans Affairs have data about present and former members of the military, the Department of Homeland Security has travel information, and various agencies possess health records. And so on.

It is safe to assume that the government has—or will soon have—access to all of this government data. This sounds like a tautology, but in the past, the U.S. government largely followed the [many laws limiting](https://www.superlawyers.com/resources/civil-rights/how-can-the-government-use-the-information-it-has-about-me/) how those databases were used, especially regarding how they were shared, combined, and correlated. Under the second Trump administration, this no longer seems to be the case.

### Augmenting Government Data with Corporate Data

The mechanisms of corporate surveillance haven’t gone away. Compute technology is constantly spying on its users—and that data is being used to influence us. Companies like Google and Meta are vast surveillance machines, and they use that data to fuel advertising. A smartphone is a portable surveillance device, constantly recording things like location and communication. Cars, and many other Internet of Things devices, do the same. Credit card companies, health insurers, internet retailers, and social media sites all have detailed data about you—and there is a vast industry that buys and sells this intimate data.

This isn’t news. What’s different in a techno-authoritarian regime is that this data is also shared with the government, either as a paid service or as demanded by local law. [Amazon shares Ring doorbell data](https://www.theverge.com/news/709836/ring-police-video-sharing-police-axon-partnership) with the police. [Flock, a company](https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-pushback) that collects license plate data from cars around the country, shares data with the police as well. And just as [Chinese corporations share](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/the-chinese-communist-party-ccp-a-quest-for-data-control) user data with the government and companies like [Verizon shared](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order) calling records with the National Security Agency (NSA) after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, an authoritarian government will use this data as well.

### Personal Targeting Using Data

The government has vast capabilities for targeted surveillance, both technically and legally. If a high-level figure is targeted by name, it is almost certain that the government can access their data. The government will use its investigatory powers to the fullest: It will go through government data, [remotely hack](https://...
