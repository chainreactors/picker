As businesses continue to adapt to hybrid work and increasingly complex IT environments, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to security solutions. Many organizations today rely on a mix of deployment models, including [Prisma SASE](/sase) and [Next-Generation Firewalls](/network-security/next-generation-firewall) (NGFW), to help secure their networks and keep operations running smoothly. However, traditional monitoring tools provide fragmented insights, making it difficult to pinpoint issues that impact end-user experience, such as user device slowdowns, connectivity disruptions or degraded application performance. This goes across the entire service delivery chain, from users and branch offices to applications, spanning on-premises, cloud and hybrid environments. Without a comprehensive digital experience monitoring (DEM) solution, IT teams lack end-to-end visibility, impacting both user experience and productivity, making it harder to maintain seamless operations.

That's where Palo Alto Networks steps in to bridge the gap. Building on the trusted visibility and remediation capabilities already used by over a thousand Prisma® SASE customers, we've expanded our [Autonomous Digital Experience Management (ADEM)](/sase/adem) solution to NGFW. This brings a unified solution that empowers IT teams to help take control over their network’s health and performance.

## Enhance User Experience and Productivity with a Unified DEM Approach

With ADEM now natively integrated with both Prisma SASE and NGFW, IT teams can deliver an unparalleled user and application experience across their entire network security estate. No matter where users work or how the infrastructure is secured, ADEM provides consistent, real-time visibility into the health and performance of users, branch sites, applications and IT infrastructure.

By aggregating data from hybrid deployments into a single, centralized data lake, IT teams no longer have to jump between different tools and platforms to troubleshoot performance issues. ADEM also proactively detects and isolates performance issues with guided remediation playbooks from a unified dashboard, significantly increasing IT and employee productivity.

Whether managing remote users or branch offices to secure mission-critical applications, ADEM enables IT teams to ensure that everyone in their organization has the best possible experience:

* **Rapid Discovery –** Take proactive measures before minor issues escalate into major problems. With comprehensive monitoring for mobile users and SD-WAN deployments secured via SASE or NGFW, managed from a centralized dashboard in Strata Cloud Manager, IT teams gain full visibility into network health. For example, quickly understand overall network health and pinpoint issues related to user devices, WiFi networks, hop-by-hop internet nodes or applications with segment-wise insights.
* **AI-Driven Remediation –** Free up time to focus on what matters most. Take advantage of intelligent suggestions and guided playbooks to streamline troubleshooting processes. For example, employees and admins can perform complex remediation actions using simple, natural language requests with the built-in Strata Copilot, which deflects tickets and reduces the burden on IT teams.
* **Native Integrations –** Simplify operations without extra hassle. ADEM seamlessly integrates with the existing infrastructure, so IT teams can optimize user and app performance without additional hardware or software installations. For example, get the best possible meeting experiences with powerful [UCaaS integrations,](/blog/sase/improve-microsoft-teams-meeting-performance-with-adem/) like MS Teams and Zoom.

## Transform Troubleshooting Workflows with ADEM for NGFW

With the introduction of ADEM for NGFW, two key use cases are supported:

**1. Troubleshooting for Mobile Users Connected to the NGFW GlobalProtect Gateway**

Gain end-to-end visibility into all mobile user experiences, from the device to applications, through the NGFW GlobalProtect gateway, Prisma Access or direct internet access.

**2. Troubleshooting for NGFW SD-WAN**

Uncover whether specific WAN circuits and internet service providers are impacting the overall user experience with end-to-end visibility into impacted segments, from the SD-WAN branch to the applications, through the NGFW SD-WAN hub, Prisma Access or direct internet access.

## Unlock the Power of Platformization

Platformization is about moving from disjointed point products to an intelligent, unified platform that is easier to manage, more effective and scales with the business. Expanding ADEM to NGFW is a significant step toward a fully integrated, platformized security and operations approach for modern enterprises, delivering one unified solution for superior user experiences. With ADEM available within [Strata Cloud Manager](/network-security/strata-cloud-manager?utm_source=google-jg-amer-sase-smco-smco&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=google-sase-smco-amer-multi-awareness-en&utm_content=7014u000001tbTCAAY&utm_term=strata%20palo%20alto&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-KmRi9KQjAMVGiFECB0dpQQaEAAYASAAEgI5TvD_BwE) for both Prisma SASE and NGFW, IT teams can reduce operational complexity, accelerate troubleshooting and enhance productivity by improving digital experiences.
