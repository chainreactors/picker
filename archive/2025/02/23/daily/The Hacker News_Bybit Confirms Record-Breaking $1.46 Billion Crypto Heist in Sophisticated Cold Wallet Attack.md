Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit on Friday revealed that a "sophisticated" attack led to the theft of over $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency from one of its Ethereum cold (offline) wallets, making it the largest ever single crypto heist in history.

"The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet [executed](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb61413c495fdad6114a7aa863a00b2e3c28945979a10885b12b30316ea9f072c) a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic," Bybit [said](https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1892965292931702929) in a post on X.

"As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address."

In a separate statement posted on the social media platform, Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou [emphasized](https://x.com/benbybit/status/1892963530422505586) that all other cold wallets are secure. The company further [said](https://x.com/Bybit_Official/status/1893044807217393910) it has reported the case to the appropriate authorities.

While there is no official confirmation from Bybit yet, [Elliptic](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomarobinson_almost-15-billion-in-crypto-was-stolen-activity-7298798116160368641-Okp-/) and [Arkham Intelligence](https://x.com/arkham/status/1893033424224411885) confirmed that the digital theft is the work of the infamous Lazarus Group. The incident makes it the biggest-ever cryptocurrency heist reported to date, [dwarfing](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) that of [Ronin Network](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/norway-seizes-584-million-in.html) ($624 million), [Poly Network](https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/hacker-steal-over-600-million-worth-of.html) ($611 million), and [BNB Bridge](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-steal-100-million.html) ($586 million).

Independent researcher [ZachXBT](https://www.wired.com/story/meet-zachxbt-243-million-crypto-theft/) said they "connected the Bybit hack on-chain to the [Phemex hack](https://rekt.news/phemex-rekt/)," the latter of which took place late last month.

The North Korea-based threat actor is one of the most prolific hacking groups, orchestrating dozens of [cryptocurrency heists](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-pull-off-308m.html) to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. Last year, Google [described](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/examining-web3-heists) North Korea as "arguably the world's leading cyber criminal enterprise."

In 2024, it's [estimated](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/lazarus-group-spotted-targeting-nuclear.html) to have stolen $1.34 billion across 47 cryptocurrency hacks, accounting for 61% of all ill-gotten crypto during the time period, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.

"Cryptocurrency heists are on the rise due to the lucrative nature of their rewards, the challenges associated with attribution to malicious actors, and the opportunities presented by nascent familiarity with cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies among many organizations," Google-owned Mandiant [said](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/securing-cryptocurrency-organizations/) last month.

### Update

In a standalone update, Bybit said it detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum (ETH) Cold Wallets during a planned routine transfer process on February 21, 2025, at around 12:30 p.m. UTC.

"The transfer was part of a scheduled move of ETH from our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet to our Hot Wallet," it [said](https://announcements.bybit.com/en/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/) in a statement.

"Unfortunately, the transaction was manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet. As a result, over 400,000 ETH and stETH worth more than $1.5 billion were transferred to an unidentified address."

TRM Labs has also [attributed](https://www.trmlabs.com/post/trm-links-north-korea-to-record-1-5-billion-record-hack) the hack with high confidence to the Lazarus Group, based on "substantial overlaps observed between addresses controlled by the Bybit hackers and those linked to prior North Korean thefts" such as [Phemex, BingX, and Poloniex](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1893211577836302365).

"The recent incident with Bybit marks a new phase in attack methods, featuring advanced techniques for manipulating user interfaces," Check Point Research [noted](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-bybit-incident-when-research-meets-reality/). "Instead of just exploiting protocol mechanics, the attackers employed advanced social engineering through manipulated interfaces, allowing them to compromise a significant institutional multisig setup."

The cybersecurity company also pointed out that the attack highlights a scenario where threat actors are [manipulating legitimate transactions](https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/unveiling-the-scam-how-fraudsters-abuse-legitimate-blockchain-protocols-to-steal-your-cryptocurrency-wallet/) through th...
