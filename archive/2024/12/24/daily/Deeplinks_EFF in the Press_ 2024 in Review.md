EFF’s attorneys, activists, and technologists were media rockstars in 2024, informing the public about important issues that affect privacy, free speech, and innovation for people around the world.

Perhaps the single most exciting media hit for EFF in 2024 was “[Secrets in Your Data](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/secrets-in-your-data/),” the NOVA PBS documentary episode exploring “what happens to all the data we’re shedding and explores the latest efforts to maximize benefits – without compromising personal privacy.” EFFers Hayley Tsukayama, Eva Galperin, and Cory Doctorow were among those interviewed.

One big-splash story in January demonstrated just how in-demand EFF can be when news breaks. Amazon’s Ring home doorbell unit announced that it would disable its Request For Assistance tool, the program that had let police seek footage from users on a voluntary basis – an issue on which EFF, and Matthew Guariglia in particular, have done extensive work. Matthew was quoted in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/amazon-s-ring-to-stop-letting-police-request-video-from-users), the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ring-amazon-camera-police-request-56a128dcd77a4cb0b27d71be9384fe1a), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/tech/amazons-ring-video-sharing-with-police/index.html), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/25/ring-camera-footage-sharing-police/), [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049165/ring-police-neighbors-app-clips-search-warrant), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/24/police-warrant-amazon-ring...
