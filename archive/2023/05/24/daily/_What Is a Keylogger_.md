Welcome to the world of keyloggers, where every keystroke you make may be watched, recorded, and potentially used against you! Now that we’ve got your attention, let’s dive into the somewhat unsettling realm of these sneaky little digital spies.

In this blog post, we’ll uncover the mysteries behind keyloggers — what they are, how they work, and why they pose a potential threat to our privacy and security. We’ll also share some tips to help you identify if a website is infected and serving malicious downloads for trojans like keyloggers and other information stealers.

So, buckle up and get ready for a ride through the dark underbelly of the internet, where privacy is a luxury, and your personal information is merely a few clicks away from being exposed.

## What is a keylogger?

A keylogger, short for “keystroke logger,” is a type of spyware that records and steals consecutive keystrokes inputted by a user on a device.

When unsuspecting individuals type on their keyboards, they often input confidential information like online banking credentials, social security numbers, and personal messages. Hackers can leverage keylogging to capture these sensitive details and obtain information about a users’ social media activity, email responses, visited websites, and even sent text messages. They may also use this data to potentially gain unauthorized access to a user’s accounts, servers, or databases.

That being said, not all keyloggers are inherently malicious; they can be legally used (in some regions) for various purposes. For instance, IT departments might use keyloggers to troubleshoot technical problems on their systems and networks or to monitor employee activities. And parents might install keyloggers to keep an eye on their children’s online behavior.

However, the primary concern surrounding keyloggers arises when they are employed by bad actors. In these cases, victims are typically unaware that their privacy has been compromised. Attackers can use keyloggers to intercept keystrokes, steal passwords, capture sensitive data submitted onto a web page, and even gather sensitive financial information. Stolen information is then transmitted to a remote computer or C2 (command-and-control) server, where the attacker can retrieve it and potentially use it for criminal purposes.

## Hardware vs. software keyloggers

Keyloggers come in two main forms: hardware and software applications.

### Hardware

Hardware keyloggers are physical devices found embedded in the internal PC hardware or attached to an open port, intercepting signals as a user types. For a bad actor to plant a hardware keylogger, physical access to the device must be available or the victim must be tricked into inserting the tool themselves, which makes this type of keylogger less common in website-related attacks. However, hardware keyloggers can still pose a threat to devices used in public spaces, such as internet cafes, or in targeted attacks on specific organizations or individuals.

### Software

Software keyloggers are more prevalent in website-related attacks due to their ease of installation on victims’ devices. Keyloggers can be distributed from infected websites via malicious redirects and drive-by-downloads for unwanted trojans and software. Unlike hardware keyloggers, software keyloggers do not require physical access to the device, making them a more significant concern for webmasters.

## Keylogger distribution via hacked websites

One common method bad actors employ is the use of hacked websites to distribute keyloggers to unsuspecting website visitors.

For example, the [Balada Injector](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/04/balada-injector-synopsis-of-a-massive-ongoing-wordpress-malware-campaign.html) malware is known to redirect unsuspecting website visitors to scams, adult websites, and crypto promotions — but more concerningly, it can also redirect users to pages that promote sketchy software downloads for trojans like keyloggers and information stealers.
