QR codes are being weaponised by scammers ‚Äî so maybe think twice before scanning that parking meter. And in a blunder so dumb it makes autocorrect look smart, the White House explains how it leaked war plans on Signal because an iPhone mistook a journalist for a government insider.

Plus! Don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with Josh Donelson of Material and Tony Albano of Google, about detection and response in today‚Äôs AI-driven world.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
