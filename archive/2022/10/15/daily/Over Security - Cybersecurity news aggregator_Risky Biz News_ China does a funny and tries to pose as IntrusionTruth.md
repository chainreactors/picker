Something weird and very cringe-worthy happened at the start of the week when over the course of two days, on Monday and Tuesday, a few hundred (obviously very botty-bot) Twitter accounts started pushing a dumb rumor that the APT41 cyber-espionage group was actually the US National Security Agency.

In addition, some accounts tried to reinforce this ridiculously braindead disinformation attempt by floating a rumor that US cybersecurity firm Mandiant also linked APT41 to the NSA, which is [obviously not true](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation).

Some accounts posted in Chinese, others posted in English, while others even went as far as to try and pose as [IntrusionTruth](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/)—a mysterious entity that has been doxing Chinese APTs for half a decade now—in an attempt to give legitimacy to their wacky theory.

In fact, after exposing some of their internal structure in a blog post [back in July](https://intrusiontruth.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/chinese-apts-interlinked-networks-and-side-hustles/), IntrusionTruth seems to believe that it was APT41 itself who orchestrated this entire Twitter lameness.

Intrusion Truth @intrusion\_truth

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. #APT41 can’t seem to stop themselves from emulating our work. We must be doing something right. As the Chinese say - 见贤思齐

It appears that Chinese actors may be trying to up their active measures/disinformation game. Noteworthy: low quality, low reach—and self-defeating subtext. For if indeed Chinese then this only illustrates that Intrusion Truth actually bites. Also note @NSA\_CSDirector's response.

We call it lameness because anyone with a basic understanding and foothold in the cybersecurity industry saw through this in the first five seconds.

Obviously, this disinformation campaign wasn't meant for the big-brains in the infosec industry, but because it was caught on early on and ridiculed into the ground, it was also almost immediately yeeted into the sun by the time of this newsletter, with the vast majority of the participating accounts being wiped clean (*see list of accounts [here](https://pastebin.com/kf48hxwW), compiled by Stairwell security researcher [Silas Cutler](https://twitter.com/silascutler/status/1580612613352099847)*).

All of this fits in some bizarre trend that we've [observed](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-china-complains-about) [this year](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-china-does-its-best) from the Chinese government, which has been obsessed with painting the US government, and the NSA in particular, as some sort of Dick Dastardly of the cyber-espionage world, responsible for all sorts of bad things, like... spying. Because that's obviously not what an intelligence agency does.

But trying to attribute your own operations to your adversary, despite quite obvious targeting and tooling differences, is some sort of brazen [GigaChad](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/gigachad) move... that's just on another level of stupid and incompetence.

For disinformation like this to work, there needs to be at least some sort of doubt about the information you're trying to counter, and nobody believes that the NSA spent years spying on US government agencies and running a ransomware op as a side hustle.

Anyway, to whoever had this idea, thanks for the chuckles! T'was a boring week in infosec.

### Breaches and hacks

**Guacamaya leak exposes Australian police ops:** A large collection of classified documents taken from the Colombian government and leaked online by the Guacamaya hacktivist group has inadvertently exposed details about criminal investigations into Colombian drug cartels and the personal details of police agents from several countries, the [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/national/secret-agents-targeting-drug-cartels-in-australia-exposed-in-data-hack-20221004-p5bmzg.html) reported.

> "The leak contains details of 35 Australian Federal Police operations, some ongoing, as well as surveillance reports from undercover agents, phone taps and payroll records for Colombian law enforcement officers. Many overseas police agencies are also affected."

**SHEIN fined for 2018 breach:** The New York Attorney General's Office has [fined](https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-secures-19-million-e-commerce-shein-and-romwe-owner-zoetop) retailer SHINE $1.9 million for its [2018 data breach](https://www.zdnet.com/article/shein-fashion-retailer-announces-breach-affecting-6-42-million-users/), during which hackers stole details on 6.42 million customers.

**QANplatform hack:** The QANplatform cryptocurrency bridge [said](https://medium.com/qanplatform/qanx-bridge-wallet-disclosure-analysis-continuously-updated-724121bbbf9a) it lost an estimated $2 million worth of cryptocurrency after an attacker manipulated one of its smart contracts.

QANplatform @QANplatform

The bridge smart contract that is offline was hacked and the attacker managed to withdraw tokens.
Please don’t perform any transactions related to the QANX token.
We are investigating the issue and going to keep you updated.](https://twitter.com/QANplatform/status/1579759166478254080)[9:01 AM ∙ Oct 11, 2022
