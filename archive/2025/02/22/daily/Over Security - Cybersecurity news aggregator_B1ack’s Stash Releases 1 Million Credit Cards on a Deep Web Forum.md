# B1ack’s Stash Releases 1 Million Credit Cards on a Deep Web Forum

[Data Leak](https://www.d3lab.net/category/data-leak/)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B1acks_Stash_ADS.png?resize=1009%2C423&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B1acks_Stash_ADS.png?fit=1009%2C634&ssl=1 "B1acks_Stash_ADS")

#### **Introduction**

On February 19, 2025, the illegal marketplace *B1ack’s Stash* released a massive collection of sensitive data containing over **1 million unique credit and debit cards**. This free release follows the strategy previously used by *[BidenCash](https://www.d3lab.net/bidencash-another-credit-card-market-publishes-data-for-free/)*, where criminals distribute stolen data en masse to promote their marketplace.

#### **The Leak Announcement**

The announcement of the release was shared on February 17 on a well-known deep web forum, commonly used for selling and sharing data leaks. The post promised the release of **4 million free credit cards**, with the actual upload of **6 archives** containing **1,018,014** unique cards. Among these, **192,174** were issued by European financial institutions.

#### **Analysis of the Released Data**

The leaked data contains highly sensitive information, including:

* **PAN** (Primary Account Number) of the credit/debit card
* **Expiration date** and **CVV2**
* **Cardholder’s personal details** (Full Name, Address, Date of Birth, Phone Number)
* **Associated email address**
* **IP address** and **User-Agent** used during the compromised transaction

An example of a record (with sensitive data redacted):

```
4539********8255|05/2025|***|BIxxxI FEyyyCA||Bologna|BO|IT|3933*******|fb******@libero.it|03-04-1971|151.42.**.**|Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) Chrome/102.0.5005.62
```

#### **Source of the Data Leak: Web Skimming**

The analysis indicates that the data was likely stolen using **Web Skimming** techniques. This method involves inserting malicious JavaScript code into compromised e-commerce payment pages, intercepting sensitive data entered by users in real-time.

The inclusion of User-Agent and IP address data supports the hypothesis that a web skimmer was used to steal the information.

#### **Inside the B1ack’s Stash Marketplace**

The *B1ack’s Stash* marketplace used this free release as a marketing strategy to attract new users. After the initial free drop, additional cards were made available for purchase, typically priced around **$25** each.

Cards are categorized based on type (credit, debit, prepaid) and sorted by issuing country and bank. ~~The dumps also include magnetic stripe data, allowing criminals to create physical card clones.~~

#### **Risks and Implications**

The public release of such detailed data significantly increases the risk of:

* **Financial fraud**: Direct use of stolen cards for online purchases.
* **Identity theft**: Personal data can be exploited for further illicit activities.
* **Targeted phishing**: Email addresses and phone numbers can be used for sophisticated phishing campaigns.

#### **Recommendations**

For financial institutions and end-users:

* **Banks and issuers** should implement enhanced monitoring on potentially compromised cards and promptly notify affected customers.
* **Online merchants** must ensure their payment systems are secure to prevent Web Skimmer intrusions.
* **End-users** should regularly check their bank statements and report any suspicious activity immediately.

#### **Conclusion**

This massive data breach highlights the critical need for proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly in securing online payment systems. Web Skimming remains one of the most prevalent threats to e-commerce platforms and credit card holders.
