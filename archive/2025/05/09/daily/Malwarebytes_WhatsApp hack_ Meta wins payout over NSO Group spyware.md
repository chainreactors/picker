# WhatsApp hack: Meta wins payout over NSO Group spyware

Posted: May 8, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

Meta has won almost $170m in damages from Israel-based NSO Group, maker of the Pegasus [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware). The ruling comes after a six-year legal case against the company after Meta accused it of misusing its servers to spy on users.

According to the original complaint against NSO Group, filed in October 2019, the spyware vendor used WhatsApp servers to send [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) to around 1400 mobile phones. The purpose was to gain access to the messages on those devices, which were typically used by attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats, and other senior foreign government officials.

NSO Group reverse engineered WhatsApp’s software and developed its own software and servers to send messages to victims via the WhatsApp service that contained malware. That malware installed itself on the victims’ smartphones using a zero-click attack, meaning that the victim didn’t have to take any action such as opening an link or even answering a call for the compromise to happen; it was enough simply for the message to arrive.

A judge ruled in December that NSO Group had repeatedly dodged requests to provide its code for review, and granted Meta partial summary judgment over the vendor. That set up conditions for a trial to determine damages that started in late April.

NSO Group [reportedly](https://www.courthousenews.com/meta-seeks-damages-from-israeli-spyware-company-over-whatsapp-hacks/) argued that Facebook lost nothing as part of the attack, arguing that it should pay the minimum amount in damages. However, the jury awarded Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages and $167,254,000 in punitive damages.

NSO Group is no stranger to controversy. The US federal government [blacklisted](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list) it in 2021 for enabling foreign governments to spy on a range of people in acts of “transnational repression”. The same year, investigative website The Pegasus Project [alleged](https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/) that the company targeted over 180 journalists around the world. The European Data Protection Supervisor [recommended an EU ban](https://www.edps.europa.eu/system/files/2022-02/22-02-15_edps_preliminary_remarks_on_modern_spyware_en.pdf) on the technology in 2022, although this has not yet happened.

The ruling drew praise from Amnesty International, which had filed a court brief as part of the case outlining the human rights implications of the attacks on Meta. The organization [commented](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/05/ruling-against-nso-group-in-whatsapp-case-a-momentous-win/):

> “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to governments to take proactive, concrete steps to regulate the surveillance industry, to enforce safeguards on their surveillance practices, and to comprehensively ban tools that are inherently incompatible with human rights obligations and standards, such as Pegasus,”

One takeaway stands out for our readers: end-to-end encryption is important for privacy, but it is not enough on its own.

As Meta pointed out in its complaint, NSO couldn’t decrypt WhatsApp messages in transit to users because they are encrypted when they’re ...
