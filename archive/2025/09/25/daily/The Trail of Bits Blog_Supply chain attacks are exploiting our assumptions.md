Every time you run `cargo add` or `pip install`, you are taking a leap of faith. You trust that the code you are downloading contains what you expect, comes from who you expect, and does what you expect. These expectations are so fundamental to modern development that we rarely think about them. However, attackers are systematically exploiting each of these assumptions.

In 2024 alone, PyPI and npm removed thousands of malicious packages; multiple high-profile projects had malware injected directly into the build process; and the XZ Utils backdoor nearly made it into millions of Linux systems worldwide.

Dependency scanning only catches known vulnerabilities. It won’t catch when a typosquatted package steals your credentials, when a compromised maintainer publishes malware, or when attackers poison the build pipeline itself. These attacks succeed because they exploit the very trust that makes modern software development possible.

This post breaks down the trust assumptions that make the software supply chain vulnerable, analyzes recent attacks that exploit them, and highlights some of the cutting-edge defenses being built across ecosystems to turn implicit trust into explicit, verifiable guarantees.

## Implicit trust

For many developers, the software supply chain begins and ends with the software bill of materials (SBOM) and dependency scanning, which together answer two fundamental questions: what code do you have, and does it contain known vulnerabilities? But understanding what you have is the bare minimum. As sophisticated attacks become more common, you also need to understand where your code comes from and how it gets to you.

**You trust that you are installing the package you expect.** You assume that running `cargo add rustdecimal` is safe because `rustdecimal` is a well-known and widely used library. Or wait, maybe it’s spelled `rust_decimal`?

**You trust that packages are published by the package maintainers.** When a popular package starts shipping with a precompiled binary to save build time, you may decide to trust the package author. However, many registries lack strong verification that publishers are who they claim to be.

**You trust that packages are built from the package source code.** You may work on a security-conscious team that audits code changes in the public repository before upgrading dependencies. But this is meaningless if the distributed package was built from code that does not appear in the repository.

**You trust the maintainers themselves.** Ultimately, installing third-party code means trusting package maintainers. It is not practical to audit every line of code you depend on. We assume that the maintainers of well-established and widely adopted packages will not suddenly decide to add malicious code.

These assumptions extend beyond traditional package managers. The same trust exists when you run a GitHub action, install a tool with Homebrew, or execute the convenient `curl ... | bash` installation script. Understanding these implicit trust relationships is the first step in assessing and mitigating supply chain risk.

## Recent attacks

Attackers are exploiting trust assumptions across every layer of the supply chain. Recent incidents range from simple typosquatting to multiyear campaigns, demonstrating how attackers’ tactics are evolving and growing more complex.

### Deceptive doubles

**Typosquatting** involves publishing a malicious package with a name similar to that of a legitimate package. Running `cargo add rustdecimal` instead of `rust_decimal` could install malware instead of the expected legitimate library. This [exact attack](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/05/10/malicious-crate-rustdecimal/) occurred on crates.io in 2022. The malicious `rustdecimal` mimicked the popular `rust_decimal` package but contained a `Decimal::new` function that executed a malicious binary when called.

The simplicity of the attack has made it easy for attackers to launch numerous large-scale campaigns, particularly against PyPI and npm. Since 2022, there have been multiple typosquatting campaigns targeting packages that account for a combined [1.2 billion weekly downloads](https://blog.phylum.io/phylum-detects-active-typosquatting-campaign-targeting-npm-developers/). Thousands of malicious packages have been published to PyPI and npm alone. This type of attack happens so frequently that there are too many examples to list here. In 2023, researchers documented [a campaign that registered 900 typosquats of 40 popular PyPI packages](https://blog.phylum.io/a-pypi-typosquatting-campaign-post-mortem/) and discovered [malware being staged on crates.io](https://blog.phylum.io/rust-malware-staged-on-crates-io/). The attacks have only intensified, with [500 malicious packages published](https://blog.phylum.io/typosquatting-campaign-targets-python-developers/) in a single 2024 campaign.

**Dependency confusion** takes a different approach, exploiting package manager logic directly. Security researcher Alex Birsan [demonstrated and named](https://medium.com/%40alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610) this type of attack in 2021. He discovered that many organizations use names for internal packages that are either leaked or guessable. By publishing packages with the same names as these internal packages to public registries, Birsan was able to trick package managers into downloading his version instead. Birsan’s proof of concept identified vulnerabilities across three programming languages and 35 organizations, including Shopify, Apple, Netflix, Uber, and Yelp.

In 2022, an attacker used this technique to [include malicious code](https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/) in the nightly releases of PyTorch for five days. An internal dependency named `torchtriton` was hosted from PyTorch’s nightly package index. An attacker published a malicious package with the same name to PyPI, which took precedence. As a result, the nightly versions of PyTorch contained malware for five days before the malware was caught.

While these attacks occur at the point of installation, other attacks take a more direct approach by compromising the publishing process itself.

### Stolen secrets

Compromised accounts are another frequent attack vector. Attackers acquire a leaked key, stolen token, or guessed password, and are able to directly publish malicious code on behalf of a trusted entity. A few recent incidents show the scale of this type of attack:

* **ctrl/tinycolor** (September 2025): [Self-propagating malware](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised) harvested npm API credentials and used the credentials to publish additional malicious packages. Over 40 packages were compromised, accounting for more than 2 million weekly downloads.
* **Nx** (August 2025): A compromised token allowed attackers to publish [malicious versions](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/security/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c) containing scripts leveraging already installed AI C...
