# Introducing the smarter, more sophisticated Malwarebytes Trusted Advisor, your cybersecurity personal assistant

Posted: July 24, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

You ever get that feeling when you double-check the locks, but still wonder if you’ve missed something? That’s what a lot of people feel about cybersecurity.

That’s where [Malwarebytes Trusted Advisor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/08/trusted-advisor) comes in. You can see it as your very own cybersecurity personal assistant, giving you real-time insight into how protected you are, without all the jargon or notifications.

Trusted Advisor checks the state of your cybersecurity tools like real-time protection, [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) connection, scheduled scans, and browser safety, and gives you a clear, color-coded view of your current risk level.

And now, our Windows version is sharper, smarter, and more helpful than ever.

What’s new?

* **Stronger Wi-Fi protection\***: Trusted Advisor now checks if your Wi-Fi network is connected to an open, unsecured network.

* **Smarter security score**: Your protection score is now more accurate and personalized, giving you clearer insights into your overall security health.

* **Seamless identity protection integration**: Trusted Advisor now works hand-in-hand with our identity protection, making it easier to stay ahead of threats like [data leaks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) and [identity fraud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/identity-fraud).

* **Take control of ads\***: Trusted Advisor now helps you disable Windows’ ad features, such as start menu suggestions and login screen ads, allowing you to enjoy a smoother Windows experience free from distractions.

Cybersecurity sometimes feels like quantum physics, but it doesn’t have to. With its latest updates, Malwarebytes Trusted Advisor makes it easier than ever to understand what’s going on behind the scenes, and to take control of your digital safety without needing a degree in computer science.

Want to see the new Trusted Advisor in action? Open [Malwarebytes on Windows](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium) and check your protection dashboard.

*\* Windows 11 only.*
