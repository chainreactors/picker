Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

### Press Release

KeeLoq is a cipher used in several car anti-theft mechanisms
distributed by Microchip Technology Inc. It may protect your car if
you own a Chrysler, Daewoo, Fiat, General Motors, Honda, Toyota, Volvo,
Volkswagen, or Jaguar. The cipher is included in the remote control
device that opens and locks your car and that activates the anti-theft
mechanisms.

Each device has a unique key that takes 18 billion billion values.
With 100 computers, it would take several decades to find such a key.
Therefore KeeLoq was widely believed to be secure. In our research we
have found a method to identify the key in less than a day. The attack
requires access for about 1 hour to the remote control (for example,
while it is stored in your pocket). Once we have found the key, we can
deactivate the alarm and drive away with your car.

This research is the joint work between 3 research groups: the computer
science department of the Technion, Israel, the research group COSIC of
the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the math department of
the Hebrew University, Israel.

### Paper abstract

KeeLoq is a lightweight block cipher with a
32-bit block size and a 64-bit key. Despite its short key size, it
is widely used in remote keyless entry systems and other wireless
authentication applications. For example, authentication protocols
based on KeeLoq are supposedly used by various car manufacturers in
anti-theft mechanisms. This paper presents a practical key recovery
attack against KeeLoq that requires 216 known plaintexts
and has a time complexity of 244.5 KeeLoq encryptions. It
is based on the slide attack and a novel approach to meet-in-the-middle
attacks. The fully implemented attack requires 65 minutes to obtain the
required data and 7.8 days of calculations on 64 CPU cores. A variant
which requires 216 chosen plaintexts needs only 3.4 days on
64 CPU cores. Using only 10000 euro, an attacker can purchase a cluster
of 50 dual core computers that will find the secret key in about two
days. We investigated the way KeeLoq is intended ...
