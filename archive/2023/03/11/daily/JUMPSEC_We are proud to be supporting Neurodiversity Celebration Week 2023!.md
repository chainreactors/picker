![](https://www.jumpsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Were-Supporting-NCW-300x300.png)We embrace Neurodiversity here at JUMPSEC. It is our strong belief cybersecurity teams regardless of neurological differences contribute positively to the uniqueness of our brand and enable the creative problem solving that our clients value. Talented teams pulling together and supporting each other to tackle cybersecurity challenges. So, it’s important to us to raise awareness.

“It is great to see more organisations realising the power of neurodiverse thinking. We need people who think differently, think outside of the box, they challenge the norm helping us deliver innovative outcomes to clients. There are not enough skilled people in this field, neurodivergent individuals bring an essential skillset to cybersecurity — hyper focus on analyzing data and identifying trends and passion for the industry,” explains **Sam Temple**, CEO at JUMPSEC.

Neurodiversity Celebration Week is a worldwide initiative that challenges stereotypes and misconceptions about neurological differences. Together, let’s change the narrative to understand, accept, and celebrate neurodiversity!
