# Rite Aid says 2.2 million people affected in data breach

Posted: July 17, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The US’ third-largest pharmacy chain Rite Aid has filed a [data breach notification](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/c4bace65-85df-4fff-b99f-f8fd390bb41a.html) in which it reports that the data stolen during a June [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) compromised the data of some 2.2 million people.

Ransomware group RansomHub claimed responsibility for the attack that took place on June 6, 2024. Ransomware groups are always looking for ways to increase their leverage over their victims, and threatening to leak stolen customer data is one of their most common methods.

The site where RansomHub’s leaks stolen data features a ransom demand next to a typical countdown timer, demanding payment before the timer expires on July 26, after which the group has threatened to release the stolen data.

After the discovery of the breach on June 20, Rite Aid started an investigation. The restoration of the compromised systems has now reached completion, [according to Rite Aid](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rite-aid-confirms-data-breach-after-june-ransomware-attack/).

[Reportedly](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/16/rite_aid_says_22_million/), the stolen data appears to be limited to purchases made between June 6, 2017, and July 30, 2018. Rite Aid says names, addresses, dates of birth, and the numbers associated with driver’s licenses or other ID documents were stolen.

RansomHub claims that:

> ​”While having access to the Riteaid network we obtained over 10 GB of customer information equating to around 45 million lines of people’s [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii). This information includes name, address, dl\_id number, dob, riteaid rewards number.”

Rite Aid is offering affected customers a standard 12 months of credit monitoring from Kroll. Details on how to claim that offer can be found in the letter it’s sending customers.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor.
