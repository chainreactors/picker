## For starters, it could launch a prompt injection attack on itself...

The latest version of AI startup Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model can use computers – and the developer makes it sound like that's a good thing.

"Why is this new capability important?" the AI biz wonders aloud in its celebratory [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/developing-computer-use). Then it answers its own question: "A vast amount of modern work happens via computers. Enabling AIs to interact directly with computer software in the same way people do will unlock a huge range of applications that simply aren't possible for the current generation of AI assistants."

The current generation of AI assistants has of course been shown to be quite capable of engaging with computers – given multimodal input and output capabilities, appropriate middleware like browser automation tools Puppeteer or Playwright, and a language model integration framework like LangChain.
