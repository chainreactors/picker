@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards,

> “AI and the Future”

Whilst I think AI does have a future…

I don’t think the same can be said for current LLM, LRM, ML and hypothetical AGI.

I could give a long set of arguments, but in all honesty the real reason is,

“Man moves the goal posts”

It’s much like religion and deities. Mankind in general has a desire to better themselves in various ways. So the deities mankind creates are always that little bit beyond current reach.

The same applies to intelligence but the other way, mankind will always define intelligence to be that little bit ahead of other creatures in nature, and obviously the machines that we create.

It can be seen with the Turing test, LLMs pass that test fairly well now (bar the odd hallucination). But Searl’s Chinese Room made it clear the Turing test was deficient long before LLM’s and ML got there.

The same is true for LRMs and if we ever get out of the LLM cul-de-sac all the current ML systems will be found wanting as well. Because there is no intelligence around that bend.

To be able to reason you need to be able to test your environment, this means AI needs adaptive agency, which current LLMs don’t have, nor are ever likely to. It’s something that babies and many creatures can be shown to have implicitly but not current AI systems.

Is this a problem? Not really unless you’ve bet your shirt on it…
