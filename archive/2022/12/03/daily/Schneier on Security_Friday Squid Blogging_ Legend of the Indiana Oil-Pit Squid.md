This ties into the previous Fermi Paradox thread: of course the aliens are here, we’re just not looking in the right place.

Ars Technica says Windows wiper malware is specifically targeting courts and mayor’s offices in Russia.

Kaspersky describes the malware but doesn’t mention a specific target.

“In addition to the families of Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Umberger, The Times has spoken to five men who said they were drugged at gay bars in the city — including the Eagle, the Boiler Room and the 9th Avenue Saloon — and then robbed. The Times has also spoken to a man who said he was robbed and held captive inside his apartment for several hours by someone he met on the dating app Grindr.

In each of the bar attacks, the men said they were drugged by people they did not remember meeting. When they awoke, they discovered that someone had gained access to their phone using its facial recognition technology while they were unconscious. The thieves then used apps to empty their victims’ bank accounts and max out their credit cards. Some also stole cash and valuables.”

It’s worth pointing out that several of these men died of overdose, so I think it’s worth patching Face ID so this kind of attack isn’t possible.

@ V, ALL,

> “Ars Technica says Windows wiper malware is specifically targeting courts and mayor’s offices in Russia.”

From the Kaspersky Report,

> *“our experts are confident that the main goal of the attackers is not financial gain, but destroying data.”*

It is not exactly difficult to work out that the most likely “beneficiaries” of such “Wiper Malware” would be Russians. Which leaves the question of,

“Which Russians in particular?”

Again it is not hard to work out that they are currently or previously related to Putin and his cronies.

It can be further assumed if still related they are “covering for the boss”… And if not still related and after the recent crypto-coin related deaths of Russians those who are trying to hide their connections / tracks for their own longevity.

Which brings us to the “wiping method”. The first thing said is,

> *“The files are not really encrypted; instead, the Trojan overwrites them with pseudo-randomly generated data.”*

This could be a “mistake” that is the malware developers could in theory have been trying to use some kind of “stream cipher”… So we need to read more details, but we find,

> *“You can find technical details of the attack along with indicators of compromise in a post on Securelist (in Russian only).”*

Which is not very helpfull.

@Clive Robinson:

Your reply to @pup vas: does not make sense.

@Ismar,

@Steve had another link to this on the Fermi Paradox thread. There’s a ’60s meme calls it subspace.

@ ALL

Did you know, that you can run a whole virtual machine inside of ChatGPT?

<https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/>

Looks to me every session is a VM and it knows this.

No, I am not going to ask it which distro it is, but that it knows it has real network access and storage, is, to put it bluntly, very scary.

Old style Weird Machine is like, WTF?

The implicature of GPT3.5

Scary impressive in this example with ChatGPT.

Note how clear the response to the prompt is.
