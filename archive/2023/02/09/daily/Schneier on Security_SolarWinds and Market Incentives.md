## SolarWinds and Market Incentives

In early 2021, *IEEE Security and Privacy* asked a number of board members for brief perspectives on the SolarWinds incident while it was still breaking news. This was my response.

The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.

SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target.

Why did SolarWinds have such bad security? The answer is because it was more profitable. The company is owned by Thoma Bravo partners, a private-equity firm known for radical cost-cutting in the name of short-term profit. Under CEO Kevin Thompson, the company underspent on security even as it outsourced software development. The *New York Times* reports that the company’s cybersecurity advisor quit after his “basic recommendations were ignored.” In a very real sense, SolarWinds profited because it secretly shifted a whole bunch of risk to its customers: the US government, IT companies, and others.

This problem isn’t new, and, while it’s exacerbated by the private-equity funding model, it’s not unique to it. In general, the market doesn’t reward safety and security—especially when the effects of ignoring those things are long term and diffuse. The market rewards short-term profits at the expense of safety and security. (Watch and see whether SolarWinds suffers any long-term effects from this hack, or whether Thoma Bravo’s bet that it could profit by selling an insecure product was a good one.)

The solution here is twofold. The first is to improve government software procurement. Software is now critical to national security. Any system of procuring that software needs to evaluate the security of the software and the security practices of the company, in detail, to ensure that they are sufficient to meet the security needs of the network they’re being installed in. If these evaluations are made public, along with the list of companies that meet them, all network buyers can benefit from them. It’s a win for everybody.

But that isn’t enough; we need a second part. The only way to force companies to provide safety and security features for customers is through regulation. This is true whether we want seat belts in our cars, basic food safety at our restaurants, pajamas that don’t catch on fire, or home routers that aren’t vulnerable to cyberattack. The government needs to set minimum security standards for software that’s used in critical network applications, just as it sets software standards for avionics.

Without these two measures, it’s just too easy for companies to act like SolarWinds: save money by skimping on safety and security and hope for the best in the long term. That’s the rational thing for companies to do in an unregulated market, and the only way to change that is to change the economic incentives.

Since this was nearly two years ago, perhaps now is a good time to ask how it has turned out in the end? Or is the case perhaps still rattling around in the courts?

If the consequences of a data breach aren’t serious enough to make the entire board and C\*O suite concerned about their wealth and freedom, then they will just hire a well-paid scapegoat to take the fall. Data breach happens, scapegoat uses golden parachute then gets hired by the next company. Rinse, repeat.

So make the entire board and C\*O suite personally responsible for the data breach, no exceptions. Make the penalties REAL. Otherwise it’s just security theater.

“In general, the market doesn’t reward safety and security”

Nonsense. Poorly managed companies go out of business, via competition, low/no profits, customer lawsuits, and shunning by liability insurance companies.

“The only way to force companies to provide safety and security features for customers is through regulation.”

… more Nonsense. Government employees (REGULATORS) have no more expertise & honesty & noble service to the public than people in the private sector… and usually less.
A government title and guaranteed paycheck does not eliminate normal human shortcomings.
Plus, big hacks of government computer systems are just as common as in the private sector.

History amply shows that it takes a government to really devastate an economy or country, just as it takes a government to implement certain kinds of economic and political good. As Aristotle said, the same thing is the cause of good and bad, by its presence or absence, illustrating by the boat pilot.

The discussion should center primarily on justice, regulation is just a tool which can promote justice or destroy it.

@ Linc,

> Nonsense. […] This is how markets routinely and successfully purge bad actors.

Equifax is still around. A family member just had an identification card borrowed for a bit while checking into Marriott. Home Depot doesn’t seem to be having any real trouble. Off the top of my head, I can’t think of *any* company that went out of business due primarily to a computer security...
