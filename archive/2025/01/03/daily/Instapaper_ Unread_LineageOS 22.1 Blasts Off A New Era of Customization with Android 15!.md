![LineageOS 22.1](https://securityonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/LineageOS_Wordmark.svg_.png)

The LineageOS team has smashed expectations with a lightning-fast release of LineageOS 22.1, based on Android 15 QPR1. Thanks to a surge in passionate contributors and new project leaders, the team has not only adapted to Android 15‚Äôs complexities but also delivered this update way ahead of schedule.

‚Äú*This is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a device perspective we have seen in years*,‚Äù the team [announced](https://lineageos.org/Changelog-29/). This means more devices are supported right from launch day!

**What‚Äôs New in 22.1?**

* **[Security](https://securityonline.info/CVE-WATCHTOWER) Boost:** Includes [security](https://securityonline.info/CVE-WATCHTOWER) patches from March 2024 to November 2024, keeping your device safe and sound.
* **App Updates:** Popular apps like SeedVault and Etar have been refreshed to their latest versions.
* **WebView Upgrade:** Enjoy smoother browsing with Chromium 131.0.6778.200.
* **Extraction Overhaul:** Thanks to contributor demon000, extracting files is now blazingly fast, with a ‚Äú30x speed improvement!‚Äù
* **Virtualization Support:** For the tinkerers, contributor 0xCAFEBABE has added support for virtIO targets (QEMU/crosvm/UTM).

LineageOS 22.1 welcomes two brand new apps:

* **Twelve:** A modern music app replacing the aging Eleven. Twelve boasts a sleek Material You design, landscape and tablet support, and compatibility with various music library server protocols like Subsonic and Jellyfin. Get ready for improved search, Android Auto support, and more!
* **Camelot:** A simple and efficient PDF reader, perfect for viewing those important documents on the go.

The LineageOS team has been busy optimizing the core system:

* **Common Kernels:** SoC-specific common kernels have been developed to streamline updates and security patches for maintainers.
* **Shared Shims:** Legacy device support is easier than ever with commonized ‚Äúshims‚Äù ‚Äì interpolating libraries that ensure compatibility.

While LineageOS 22.1 marks a major milestone, the team isn‚Äôt slowing down. They‚Äôve adopted a new versioning system to align with Google‚Äôs minor SDK releases, ensuring clarity and easier tracking of updates.

Head over to the [LineageOS Wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) for detailed upgrade and installation instructions for your device. Remember, if you‚Äôre on an official build, you likely won‚Äôt need to wipe your device!
