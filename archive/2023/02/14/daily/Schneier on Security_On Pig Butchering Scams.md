In earlier times, we called it “the stock market.”

I’ve seen Sean (aka @thepacketrat) tweet about some questionable contacts and I’ve worried a little for him. But his and Lily Hay Newman’s research has turned into a really nice piece.

I had forgotten that pig butchering could be the result of forced labor. That’s quite a sad ordeal.

Did one scam really bring in $500,000 a month? Wow. I’m curious about the cryptocurrency transactions and victims here. The “conversation” Sean reported did seem a little unnatural.

I also hope the app stores are giving a very serious look at fraud-enabling apps that are making it in the stores. Are compromised certificates common?

Ya, the compromised certificates are upsetting. I hope we can keep that system working well.

@ Bruce, ALL,

From the article,

> *“Sophos researchers have recently found pig butchering-related apps that skirted Apple’s defenses to sneak into the company’s official App Store”*

This yet again sadly confirms that the “Walled Gardens” used by the large Silicon Valley Corporates are a “scam” in their own right.

As the “security claims” are effectively bogus.

Forced labour is common in these scams, Malaysians are popular for this for English proficiency and vulnerability to generous fake job adds. The call centres are in Myanmar, Cambodia and sometimes Thailand. The local police are in cahoots to catch runaways

Passengers are reminded not to accept packages from strangers or people they do not know well.

It’s unfortunate that many fell victim to these scam platforms. Thankfully, was able to resolve the issue by reporting to Westinghousef.com. Their assistance in recouping our investments was invaluable. Grateful for their support during a challenging time. do mention Sally as it will give preferntial treatment
