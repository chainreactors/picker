# Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn block access in France, VPN use set to soar

Posted: June 5, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are suddenly popular in France. Not because France has suddenly become super privacy conscious, but because Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, have [blocked access in France](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20250604-france-porn-sites-protest-new-french-age-checks-by-blacking-out).

But why? Last year, France enacted a law mandating that pornographic sites implement stricter age-verification technology.

Since March 1, 1994, [French law has prohibited exposing minors to pornographic content](https://www.arcom.fr/presse/larcom-prend-acte-de-la-decision-du-groupe-aylo). To strengthen this, a 2020 law empowered the French Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication (ARCOM) to issue warnings to non-compliant online services and seek judicial orders to block access if necessary.

In 2024, the French law on securing and regulating the digital environment (SREN) further enhanced ARCOM’s authority, allowing it to administratively block platforms that fail to prevent minors from accessing pornographic content.

On October 9, 2024, ARCOM adopted a technical framework, approved by the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL), outlining minimum requirements for age verification systems.

The requirements consisted of three major pillars:

* Reliability
* Third party implementation
* Mandatory on each access

Services had until January 9, 2025, to comply with a transitional period until April 9, 2025, during which credit card-based verification was temporarily accepted under specific conditions.

In response to these regulations, the major adult websites like Pornhub, YouPorn, and RedTube have now suspended access in France, citing concerns over user privacy and data security associated with the mandated age verification methods.

This is a major decision for Pornhub because France is its second biggest market behind the US. Alex Kekesi, VP of president of brand and community of Aylo Holdings (Pornhub’s owner) said that:

> “French citizens deserve a government and a regulator who are serious about preventing children from accessing adult content. They also deserve laws which protect their privacy and safeguard their sensitive data.”

In the United States, 19 states have passed laws requiring pornographic sites to confirm a user’s age by checking a government-issued ID, scanning their face, or other methods. The laws have led some of the largest adult sites, including Pornhub, to block users from those states, rather than paying millions for ID-checking services.

Naturally, everywhere where people want to View Porn Normally, the use of VPNs has increased because VPNs can be used to circumvent access restrictions imposed by such regulations. While specific figures for France are not publicly available, similar scenarios in other regions provide insight into user behavior:

* Texas: After the implementation of comparable laws[, VPN ...
