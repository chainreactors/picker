## What is the WordPress White Screen of Death?

The WordPress White Screen of Death, sometimes condensed to WSoD, is an infamous error that transforms your carefully crafted WordPress site into a plain white screen. This error stems from issues within your website’s PHP files or database. Depending on the cause, it can either blanket your entire website in white or selectively affect certain areas like your WordPress admin dashboard or individual web pages.

The white screen error may present differently in various browsers. In Google Chrome, it can come with an [HTTP 500 error](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/09/what-is-a-500-internal-server-error-how-to-fix-it.html) warning, while in Mozilla Firefox, it can simply appear as a blank screen.

[![Example of a 500 error message](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example500.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example500.png)

Regardless of the browser you’re using, the error messages are not usually helpful in highlighting the actual problem.

## What are the most common causes of a white screen in WordPress?

The White Screen of Death typically results from PHP code errors and conflicts, PHP version incompatibility, memory limit exhaustion, misconfigured .htaccess files, or database errors. These problems can be triggered by a number of things, including unresponsive scripts that are interrupted by your hosting server or exceed your PHP memory limit.

One common cause is faulty or incompatible themes or plugins on your website. If your front-end isn’t working but your WordPress admin area is accessible, it’s likely a theme or plugin issue. You can quickly verify your admin panel by navigating to **yoursite.com/wp-admin**.

Other potential culprits include parsing or syntax errors in your code, issues with caching, corruption in your files, or server downtime. One common cause is interrupted updates, leaving a `.maintenance` file in your site’s root directory that produces a white screen or 503 status until it’s removed. Though its roots may vary and identification can be tough, the good news is there are actionable steps to mitigate and solve this error, which we’ll explore in the following section.
