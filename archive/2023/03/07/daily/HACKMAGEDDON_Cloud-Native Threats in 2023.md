Similarly to what I have done in [2022](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/01/31/cloud-native-threats-in-2022/), [2021](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/01/21/cloud-native-threats-in-2021/), and [2020](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2020/12/30/cloud-native-threats-in-2020/),Â  I am listing those cyber attacks, whose information is available via OSINT, which exploited the cloud in one or more stages of the attack chain.

The campaigns are classified in four categories: **Delivery and Exploitation** (the cloud service is exploited to deliver a malware strain or a phishing page), **Actions on Objective** (the cloud service is exploited to steal data, or launch other attacks), **Command and Control** (the cloud service is exploited as a command and control infrastructure), and **Data Exfiltration** (the cloud service is used as a drop zone for the exfiltrated data).

Below you will find some statistics and a table with detailed information on the attacks.
