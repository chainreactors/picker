Hey everyoneüëã

I hope you‚Äôre having an A+ weeküöÄ!

In today‚Äôs blog, I am going to tell you that, ‚Äú*How I Got $10,000 From GitHub For Bypassing A Filtration oF HTML tags*‚Äù

A few months back, One day I was just scrolling the Twitter feed. And, Suddenly a tweet from [@github](https://twitter.com/github) came into my focus. Basically, The Tweet was regarding GitHub‚Äôs new feature that gives the ability to render or display Mathematical expressions(TeX and LaTeX style syntax) in Markdown through the [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org)library.

### What is [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org)?

MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers, with built-in support for assistive technology like screen readers.

After reading the tweet, I got to know that, ‚Äú*GitHub is now using MathJax library to display Mathematical expressions in Markdown files*‚Äù. So, The first thing I tried was to find any previous or known bugs in the [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org)library. And mainly, I was looking to find any previous XSS or HTML injection CVEs.

Luckily, **I found the known XSS issue in the MathJax library which affects versions <*2.7.4*** *.* And, The Payload should be in a Unicode form to work.

> \unicode{}

Known CVE in a MathJax library which affects versions <2.7.4

Then, I created a markdown file in my test repository. And, I started my testing. So, I entered üëá this payload in a file:

> Payload:- `$$\\u003cu\u003eHello\u003c/u\u003e{}$$` or `$$\\u003cu\u003eWhy\u003c\uffofu\u003e{}$$` , etc.
>
> *\**Note:`$$...$$` *are math delimiters.*

But, Nothing worked for me. And, I knew the reason is that ‚Äú*The CVE was only vulnerable for version <2.7.4 meanwhile the GitHub is using a newer version*‚Äù.

Thus, I thought that ‚Äú*I had to find a bypass by myself to successfully exploit the attack and* *If somehow I am able to render basic HTML tags like:* `<b>,<i>,<u>`*.*‚Äù And, You may be wondering why I said only **basic HTML tags**? Coz, Most of the time websites use WAFs, different kinds of filters, and restrictions to prevent the use of **advanced tags** but they don‚Äôt do the same thing for basic and common tags. That‚Äôs why I said!.

And once I found a bypass or way to render **basic tags using math expressions**. Then only in this situation, ‚Äú***I will try to escalate the impact by trying advanced tags***‚Äù.

### The First way or method of exploiting:

So, The first thing I did ‚Äú*was to find any interesting behavior which can be very useful for me to render basic tags using math expressions*‚Äù. For this, I tried different-different types of methods(like Unicode, URL encoding, and etc). And again, This also does not work for me.

But, Somehow I was able to find a way that is very helpful for rendering the basic tags using math expressions. I **noticed** that ‚Äú***when I used basic tags after the*** `\` ***then only that time the tag gets render*** *without any error or without being filtered*‚Äù.And, The payload is `$$\<u>HELLO</u>{}$$`

So, I quickly replaced the `<u>` tag with other advance tags(like <script>,<iframe>, <style>) in order to know ‚Äú*Is the website using more filters to prevent the use of the advance tags?*‚Äù. The answer is ***Yessss***, The GitHub markdown files are using some more filters in which ‚Äú***they simply filtered any advance tags except*** `<style>` ***tags***‚Äù.

Then after testing this mathjax integration, I found that it‚Äôs possible to add `<style>` tags on using a backslash(`\`) before it (like: `\<style>{property:value}</style>`). So for customizing the CSS, I used these below **payloads** in my `test.md` files:

```
$$\<style>*{display:none}</style>{}$$$$\<style>div{background-color:#66f3e6}</style>{}$$$$\<style>*{font-size:23px;}</style>{}$$$$\<style>body{padding: 50px;background-color: #4b6bb7;}</style>{}$$
```

Hence, I noticed that now I am able to change the CSS of the whole page.

And, I created and submitted my first report to GitHub‚Äôs HackerOne program. But, You know what happens with my report ‚Äú***Report closed within 5 mins by bot*** *saying that it is a previously identified issue and is being tracked internally*‚Äù. For the minutes, I was so confused and thought that ‚Äú*The bot is really a bot or a human is behind the bot*‚Äù.

So, I asked the program, ‚Äú*Is this quick response coming from the BOT or from a real person?*‚Äù. Then, GitHub‚Äôs traiger confirmed and replied, ‚Äú*Yes, please rest assured that your report was reviewed by a real person. Thanks for checking in on my humanity!*‚Äù

All I can say is that ‚Äú*My first ever bug report to GitHub closed as Duplicate*‚Äù.

### The second way or method of exploiting:

GitHub fixed the issue within 24 hours.

So, I thought to retest the issue with my previous method and payloads. And, I found that ‚Äú*I was no more able to use advance tags with previous method and payloads*‚Äù.

And somehow, I managed to find a new way to render tags. But this time, I was only able to use normal tags(like: *<div>,<span>,<section>,<input>,<label>,<button>*) not ‚Äú<*style*> and <*script*>‚Äù in the math expressions.

```
$$<div>Test</div>{}$$$$<input type=text>{}$$$$<button>Click Here</button>{}$$
```

Although, We can also use a few ta...
