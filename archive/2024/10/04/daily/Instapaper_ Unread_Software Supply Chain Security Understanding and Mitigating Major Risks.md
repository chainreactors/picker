## **Understanding Software Supply Chain Security Risks**

When we discuss the software supply chain, this includes applications hosted internally, software-as-a-service (SaaS), hosted services, open-source libraries, and more. Each component can potentially introduce security weaknesses, particularly with the rise of AI tools that can now quickly identify and exploit vulnerabilities. To protect against software supply chain security threats, it’s essential to understand the main types of risks involved:

1. Catastrophic flaws
2. Product vulnerabilities
3. Backdoors and malware
4. Vendor security control gaps

Let’s look at each category and how you can proactively reduce your organization’s risks.

## **Catastrophic Flaws: When Updates Go Wrong**

Catastrophic flaws occur when unintended software issues arise during an update or release, potentially causing widespread damage. A recent example is the [CrowdStrike incident](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/our-q3-2024-top-control-is-third-party-risk-management-lessons-from-the-crowdstrike-outage/) that took place this summer. On July 19th, a flawed software update caused Windows kernel crashes, resulting in the “blue screen of death” on over 8.5 million computers worldwide.

Catastrophic flaws like this demonstrate the critical importance of software supply chain security. Let’s look at how your organization can prepare for potential catastrophic events.

**Risk Reduction Strategies:**

* **Rigorous Testing Before Updates**: Quickly conduct comprehensive testing across multiple environments to catch as many issues as possible before releasing an update into critical production environments.
* **Emergency Response Planning**: Have a rollback mechanism and a crisis communication plan to mitigate damage and restore systems quickly if an update fails.
* **Backup Systems and Rollback Mechanisms**: Keep automated backups and rollback capabilities ready to minimize downtime during an unexpected system failure.

## **Product Vulnerabilities: Exploiting Plugins and Third-Party Components**

Product vulnerabilities often arise from widely used software components, such as third-party plugins or libraries. A notable example is the GiveWP WordPress plugin, which had a critical flaw allowing unauthorized users to create files on web servers and gain complete control. We found an exploit for this vulnerability on the dark web, freely available to attackers, which shows how easily product vulnerabilities can be weaponized. For more details and screenshots of how this happened, watch our [software supply chain video](https://youtu.be/Y5z-XwLED88) at minute mark 4:50.

Another critical vulnerability surfaced in JetBrains TeamCity, a popular tool for managing and sharing source code. Attackers exploited an unpatched flaw to gain access to deve...
