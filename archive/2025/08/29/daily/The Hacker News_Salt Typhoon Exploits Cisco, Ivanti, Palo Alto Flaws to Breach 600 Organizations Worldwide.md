The China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) actor known as **[Salt Typhoon](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/joint-advisory-warns-of-prc-backed.html)** has continued its attacks targeting networks across the world, including organizations in the telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure sectors.

"While these actors focus on large backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers, they also leverage compromised devices and trusted connections to pivot into other networks," according to a [joint cybersecurity advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/27/cisa-and-partners-release-joint-advisory-countering-chinese-state-sponsored-actors-compromise) published Wednesday. "These actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks."

The [bulletin](https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/salttyphoon082725.mp4/view), courtesy of authorities from 13 countries, said the malicious activity has been linked to three Chinese entities, Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd., and Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd.

These companies, the agencies said, provide cyber-related products and services to China's intelligence services, with the data stolen from the intrusions, specifically those against telecoms and Internet service providers (ISPs), providing Beijing with the ability to identify and track their targets' communications and movements globally.

The countries that have co-sealed the security advisory include Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S.

Brett Leatherman, head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Cyber Division, [said](https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/salttyphoon082725.mp4/view) the Salt Typhoon group has been active since at least 2019, engaging in a persistent espionage campaign aimed at "breaching global telecommunications privacy and security norms."

In a standalone alert issued today, Dutch intelligence and security services MIVD and AIVD [said](https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/08/28/nederlandse-providers-doelwit-van-salt-typhoon) while organizations in the country "did not receive the same degree of attention from the Salt Typhoon hackers as those in the U.S.," the threat actors gained access to routers of smaller ISPs and hosting providers. However, there is no evidence the hackers penetrated these networks further.

"Since at least 2021, this activity has targeted organisations in critical sectors including government, telecommunications, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure globally, with a cluster of activity observed in the U.K.," the National Cyber Security Centre [said](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-expose-china-tech-companies-enabling-cyber-campaign).

According to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/chinese-spies-hit-more-than-80-countries-in-salt-typhoon-breach-fbi-reveals-59b2108f) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/08/27/fbi-advisory-china-hacking-expansion/), the hacking crew has expanded its targeting focus to other sectors and regions, attacking no less than 600 organizations, including 200 in the U.S., and 80 countries.

Salt Typhoon, which [overlaps](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/cisa-alert-aa25-239a-analysis-simulation-and-mitigation-of-chinese-apts) with activity tracked as GhostEmperor, Operator Panda, RedMike, and UNC5807, has been observed obtaining initial access through the exploitation of [exposed network edge devices](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cisco-confirms-salt-typhoon-exploited.html) from Cisco ([CVE-2018-0171](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-0171), [CVE-2023-20198](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-20198), and [CVE-2023-20273](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-20273)), Ivanti ([CVE-2023-46805](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-46805) and [CVE-2024-21887](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-21887)), and Palo Alto Networks ([CVE-2024-3400](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-3400)).

However, the agencies pointed out these vulnerabilities are not "exhaustive" and that the threat actors may also go after other devices such as Fortinet firewalls, Juniper firewalls, Microsoft Exchange, Nokia routers and switches, Sierra Wireless devices, and Sonicwall firewalls, among others for initial access.

"The APT actors may target edge devices regardless of who owns a particular device," the agencies noted. "Devices owned by entities that do not align with the actors' core targets of interest still present opportunities for use in attack pathways into targets of interest."

The compromised devices are then leveraged to pivot into other networks, in some cases even [modifying the device's configuration](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/hackers-exploited-pan-os-flaw-to-deploy.html#salt-typhoon-exploits-vulnerable-cisco-devices-to-breach-telcos) and adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.

Persistent access to target networks is accomplished by altering Access Control Lists (ACLs) to add IP add...
