Just short of a year after the initial incident, the state of Georgia's higher education government agency has confirmed that it was the victim of an attack on its systems affecting the data of 800,000 people.

University System of Georgia (USG), which oversees 26 higher education institutions in the USA state, [filed](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/5b9aff63-0dc1-429a-a5e4-6b8e6c859f02.shtml) a disclosure with the attorney general of Maine on Tuesday – the first time it has publicly explained the incident it detected on May 31, 2023.

In a [letter](https://www.usg.edu/news/release/notice_of_data_breach/) sent to the 800,000 victims, USG explained that the breach was actually one of many from last year linked to the Cl0p gang's exploitation of a since-patched flaw in Progress Software's MOVEit MFT tool.
