# Ensure Tor is strong for years to come: become a monthly donor

Tor is powered by community. Just as the privacy the Tor network provides is made possible by a decentralized network of volunteers running relaysâthe Tor Project is made possible by a wide variety of supporters.

As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, the Tor Project relies on external support to fight for your privacy online. We will always build and offer free software. Itâs part of our mission and our vision of a better internet. We donât harvest or sell your data. We donât charge you to use what we build. That means that everyone in the world can use Tor. It also means that if you have the ability, [making a monthly donation](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp2-pbp) to Tor ensures its availability for others.

By becoming a [Defender of Privacy with a monthly donation](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp2-pbp), you make it possible for Tor to plan for the years ahead with confidence. Consistent support ensures that the Tor Project is sustainable and stableâand every donation, no matter the amount, helps.

I recently asked our Defenders of Privacy with the longest-running monthly donations why they donate regularly to better understand why Tor matters to them, and why donating monthly is a priority. One anonymous supporter put it this way:

> (a) Privacy is near and dear to my heart. Living in Switzerland, that's maybe just a luxury or makes it a little harder for people to track me, but there are countries in this world where people are less fortunate. Where privacy can mean protection from oppression and/or prosecution.
>
> (b) I'm also aware that projects like these take a lot of time and effort, often from very smart people who could make a lot of money working in a big corporation, who choose to do this. So, if I can help a little, I [will] gladly do that.
>
> (c) I only do this for very few organizations, Mozilla being another one for example, also because they are providing me with a free product that works well and has a privacy focus, like you guys.

Beyond supporting our mission, when you [become a monthly donor](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp2-pbp) of any amount, you'll receive an exclusive [Defenders of Privacy patch](/become-a-monthly-donor/monthly-giving-patch.jpg) + gifts from the Tor Project throughout the year. **Plus, brand new Tor stickers will come to you in January if you become a donor today!**

Take the step to power privacy online for everyone: [become a Defender of Privacy with a monthly gift](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp2-pbp).
