# Sling TV settles with California for allegedly violating state consumer privacy law

California’s attorney general announced Thursday that his office has settled with the parent company of the streaming service Sling TV for allegedly failing to give consumers an easy way to block sales of their personal data and for inadequately protecting the privacy of children.

Sling TV has agreed to pay a $530,000 fine for violating the California Consumer Privacy Protection Act, according to a [press release](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-secures-530000-settlement-sling-tv-first-enforcement) from Attorney General Rob Bonta.

The company also has agreed to make it simpler for consumers to opt out of data sales and give parents “clear disclosures and tools” to minimize the collection and use of data belonging to their children.

Sling TV did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement is subject to court approval.

The enforcement action was the result of an “investigative sweep” focused on data sales tied to streaming services, Bonta’s office said.

“Sling TV combined cookie preferences with the CCPA opt-out, even though to truly opt-out, turning off cookies was insufficient,” the press release said. “Consumers had to look for an embedded link to a webform and click through confirmation steps to complete their request.”

Even customers who were logged in to Sling TV’s website had to fill out a detailed web form reproducing information the service already had, Bonta said. Sling TV did not give consumers a way to opt out within its apps or devices, according to the press release.

The streaming service also did not allow kids to have separate profiles so that targeted advertising to them could be minimized. Parents had no way to give affirmative opt-in consent for children under the age of 16.
