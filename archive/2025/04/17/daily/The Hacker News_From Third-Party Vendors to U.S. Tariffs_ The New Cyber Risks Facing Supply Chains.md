## Introduction

Cyber threats targeting supply chains have become a growing concern for businesses across industries. As companies continue to expand their reliance on third-party vendors, cloud-based services, and global logistics networks, cybercriminals are exploiting vulnerabilities within these interconnected systems to launch attacks. By first infiltrating a third-party vendor with undetected security gaps, attackers can establish a foothold, leveraging these weaknesses to penetrate the primary business partners' network. From there, they move laterally through critical systems, ultimately gaining access to sensitive data, financial assets, intellectual property, or even operational controls.

Recent high-profile breaches like the 2024 ransomware attack that hit Change Healthcare, one of the world's largest health payment processing companies, demonstrate how attackers disrupted supply chain operations stealing up to 6TB of millions of patients' protected health information (PHI). This incident was one of the most disruptive cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure to date and could have been prevented with simple multifactor authentication (MFA) on the targeted remote server.**1**

Unlike traditional cyber threats that target a single organization, supply chain attacks exploit the weakest links within a business ecosystem. As businesses work to mitigate risks, it is important to understand the emerging threat landscape, the industries most at risk, and the security strategies necessary to secure supply chains. Additionally, as the U.S. implements new tariffs on foreign goods, businesses must assess whether these trade policies will introduce new cybersecurity challenges or alleviate some existing risks.

## Emerging Threats Affecting Supply Chains

* **Ransomware Attacks:** Ransomware has evolved into one of the most damaging cyber threats to supply chains. Attackers increasingly target logistics providers, manufacturers, and critical suppliers, encrypting their systems and demanding hefty ransoms to restore operations. In 2024 CDK Global, a software provider for nearly 15,000 North American car dealerships, was hit by a ransomware attack. The malware targeted personally identifiable information (PII) such as Social Security numbers, bank account details, and credit card data. Dealerships were forced to revert to manual operations for days if not weeks thereafter, including using pen and paper and physically transporting auto records to Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices in the U.S. The attack resulted in significant operational disruptions and financial losses estimated at over $1 billion.1
* **Software Supply Chain Attacks:** Cybercriminals have shifted their focus to compromising software vendors, and injecting malicious code into trusted applications and updates. In April 2024, hackers uploaded malicious Visual Studio projects to GitHub, manipulating search algorithms to increase visibility. These projects contained malware resembling Keyzetsu Clipper, designed to intercept and alter cryptocurrency wallet addresses copied to the clipboard, redirecting funds to attackers.2
* **Third-Party Credential Theft:** Attackers often gain access to corporate networks by exploiting weak authentication measures used by third-party vendors. Phishing attacks, credential stuffing, and password leaks provide hackers with a pathway to infiltrate multiple organizations through a single compromised vendor. Weak vendor security practices can allow unauthorized access to critical systems, leading to data theft and operational disruptions.
* **AI-Powered Cyber Attacks:** Artificial Intelligence has become a double-edged sword in cybersecurity. While businesses use AI for threat detection and defense, cybercriminals leverage AI to automate phishing campaigns, bypass security controls, and identify vulnerabilities within supply chain networks. AI-driven attacks make it easier for hackers to evade detection, increasing the frequency and sophistication of supply chain cyber threats.
* **IoT and OT Exploits:** Supply chain operations heavily rely on Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) devices, such as smart sensors, automated manufacturing equipment, medical devices, and connected logistics systems. However, many IoT and OT devices lack robust security measures, making them attractive targets for hackers. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, manipulate production processes, or gain access to enterprise networks.

## Industries Most Impacted and Why

**Manufacturing & Industrial**

Manufacturers depend on global supply chains for raw materials, hardware components, and logistics. Cyberattacks targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and enterprise resources planning (ERP) software can halt production, delay shipments, and lead to financial losses. Additionally, intellectual property theft poses a significant risk in this sector, as hackers target sensitive trade secrets.

**Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals**

The healthcare industry relies heavily on third-party suppliers, wholesale distribution centers, R&D, lab equipment and chemical suppliers, hospitals and clinics, government buyers, and more. Healthcare, and specifically pharmaceutical companies, must manage one of the largest industry supply chains filled with 10s if not 100s of vendors....
