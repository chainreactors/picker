## Life Moves Fast in the Cloud

Did you know that 72% of organizations from around the world moved 30% or more of their workloads to the cloud in the last 12 months? More impressively, a quarter of these organizations moved upwards of 50% of their workloads. As our 2023 cloud-native security survey shows, life indeed moves fast in the cloud.

Change also cycles rapidly, particularly with cloud-native application development, where everything from IP addresses to containers is ephemeral. Each year delivers us to the brink of a new horizon, and each year Palo Alto Networks seeks out leaders on the cloud-native frontlines to ask about their challenges, as well as the strategies and solutions they employ to achieve their cloud-native security outcomes.

### The State of Cloud-Native Security Report 2023

As in previous years, the State of Cloud-Native Security Report 2023 explores the findings of a survey spanning seven countries and five sectors of industry to inquire about practices affecting cloud-native development and security. Of 2,500+ survey respondents, greater than 50% represent enterprise-sized organizations. Approximately 50% of our population hold executive roles and 50% hold practitioner roles. From our 2023 findings, two themes emerge:

1. The application lifecycle moves faster than we would have imagined 12 months ago.
2. Complexity across an amalgam of challenges is the ultimate threat to securing cloud environments.

Our goal in this report remains the same, to provide you with empirical insights and inform your cloud-native security decisions in 2023 and beyond.

## Cloud Migration Trends

As mentioned, workloads moved fast in 2023. Overall, survey respondents report a 13% increase over last year. Traditionally, cost and speed have been the catalyst drawing organizations to the cloud. After all, the cost and speed at which an enterprise can build an idea into a product are integral to success.

According to this year’s survey, though, cost did not make the list of top objectives behind migrating to the cloud. Cost, in fact, was an outlier, with only 8.5% of organizations citing “reducing/optimizing costs” for continuing to expand their cloud.

In 2023, organizations are foremost interested in building new and expanding existing products and services. Increasing efficiency and agility follows in a close second. The remaining reasons organizations are migrating to the cloud in order of rank are:

3. Creating new processes and workflows

4. Mitigating business and regulatory risk

5. Expanding into new markets

On average, organizations spend 24% of their total cost of ownership on application migration. The breakdown in methodology for application deployment is cloud native (37%), lift and shift (36%) and refactor or rebuild (27%). This is the first time cloud native is at the forefront of application development.

![36% lifted and shifted, 27% refactored or rebuilt, 37% cloud-native.](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/word-image-180620-1.png)

Figure 1. Primary method of application deployment to the cloud.

Platform as a service (PaaS) and serverless are the dominant application execution environments. Both PaaS and serverless are also expected to experience growth, as 70% of respondents report planned use increases in the next 24 months.

Because serverless and PaaS play a critical role in cloud application development, we may see further increases in cloud native, as well as replatforming, with lift and shift receding somewhat. This expectation is reasonable in view of Covid-era benchmarks that reflect an elevated push to move applications to the cloud.

## Application Velocity

The cloud unquestionably improves time to market, innovation and operational efficiency. For developers eager to adopt [DevOps](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-devops), migrating to the cloud is an opportunity to accelerate the application development lifecycle. This year’s survey reveals just how agile and operationally efficient cloud-native applications can be.

Feature 2: Rates at which organizations deploy code to production or release to end users.

Seventy-seven percent of organizations we surveyed are deploying new or updated code to production weekly. As fast as that is, 38% of enterprises commit new code daily, and 17% deploy code multiple times a day.

But frequent deployment requires fast response times. A third of enterprises report operating with internal service level objectives of less than a day of lead time for changes. Thirty-eight percent of organizations expect service restorations within a day. Here’s the catch, though. Sixty-eight percent of respondents report increased deployment frequency, while 64% also report increased lead time for changes.

Because deployment frequency and lead time for changes measure velocity, we’re left with two questions to contemplate:

1. If organizations aren’t achieving or sustaining velocity performance goals, does this point to inefficiencies in DevOps processes?
2. Do increases in deployment frequency and lead time for changes suggest that security professionals are struggling to keep pace and pressure is taking its toll?

Speed and scale drive complexity. When we superimpose the ratio of 10 developers to one security professional, on top of code deployment rates, we can gauge the potential for oversights and complications.

## Top Challenges with Cloud Expansion

While 60% of enterprises have been operating in a cloud environment for three or more years, complexity remains an issue. Most organizations attribute technical complexity to impeding their ability to leverage the full advantages of the cloud. It likely doesn’t help that cloud infrastructure continues to evolve for 80% of survey respondents.

When asked about their top cloud migration challenges, 42% of organizations cited technical complexity (defined in the survey as infrastructure limitations, system dependencies, etc.).

Interestingly, the next four challenges, as ranked by survey respondents, all stem from technical complexity.

**2. Lack of Talent or Consulting Services**: Complex environments require high levels of talent and adaptiveness to changing technology.

**3. Maintaining Comprehensive Security**: Complex environments are difficult to secure.

**4. Lack of Visibility Across Services and Providers**: Full visibility across the continuum of the application lifecycle is difficult in complex environments.

**5. Meeting Compliance Requirements**: Complex environments pose greater challenges in both maintaining compliance and reporting on it.
