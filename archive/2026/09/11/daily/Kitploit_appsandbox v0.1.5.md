# App Sandbox

App Sandbox is a virtual machine app for Windows and macOS that's focused on performance and ease of use.

Windows features:

* Works on Windows 11 Home or Pro, without Hyper-V
* Windows 11 or Ubuntu 26.04 LTS VM Support
* Zero touch install
* Copy and Paste
* 2 Channel Audio
* GPU Acceleration via Paravirtualization (GPU-PV) with support for DirectX 12 (Windows only), OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA, OpenCL
* GPU Hardware Video Decoder/Encoder support
* SSH via Hyper-V socket proxy (no network required)
* Snapshots
* Fixed 1080P60 display
* Host to client hot-key support
* Provision and boot with / without internet
* Supports running Claude Cowork and Docker inside the VM thanks to Nested Virtualization Support
* Headless mode: a scriptable local HTTP/JSON API + dependency-free Python SDK (`asb.py`) for creating and driving GPU-accelerated VMs programmatically

Mac features:

* macOS or Windows 11 ARM VM support
* Zero touch install for Windows 11, macOS has 3 unskippable onboarding steps
* Copy and Paste
* 2 Channel Audio
* macOS: GPU Acceleration via Paravirtualization with support for Metal, Windows: No GPU Acceleration
* SSH via virtio-vsock (no network required)
* Fixed 1080P60 display on Windows 11 guests, Dynamic display sizing on macOS guests
* Provision and boot with / without internet
* Headless mode: the same scriptable local HTTP/JSON API + Python SDK (`asb.py`) as on Windows, for driving macOS and Windows 11 VMs programmatically

Requirements:
Windows 11 with an x64 Processor or macOS Tahoe (M Series)

## About App Sandbox

App Sandbox creates and runs full desktop virtual machines — Windows 11, Ubuntu, and
macOS. It is free and open-source (MIT), distributed as prebuilt binaries (EV-signed on
Windows, Apple-Developer-signed on macOS) on its
[Releases](https://github.com/jamesstringer90/appsandbox/releases) page. It is driven two
ways: from a graphical UI, or programmatically through a headless daemon with a
dependency-free Python SDK (`asb.py`). Either way you pick an OS, point it at an installer
image, and App Sandbox provisions the disk, runs an unattended install, and boots the
guest. You supply a Windows or Ubuntu ISO; macOS guests download their restore image
automatically. It runs on a Windows 11 (x64) PC or an Apple Silicon Mac, including laptops.

**Runs on Windows 11 Home, without Hyper-V.** On Windows, App Sandbox does not use Hyper-V
or Hyper-V Manager; it creates and runs VMs through the Windows Host Compute System (HCS)
and Host Compute Network (HCN) APIs, which require only the *Virtual Machine Platform*
feature. Hyper-V is limited to Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise, while Virtual Machine
Platform is available on Windows 11 Home, so a Windows 11 Pro license is not required.
Virtual Machine Platform is the same Windows feature WSL2 uses.

**What you can use it for:**

* A full Windows or Ubuntu **desktop** VM — a complete graphical OS with GPU acceleration
  (OpenGL, Vulkan, CUDA) — for building and testing your own software on a clean install.
* Running a program in a VM, kept separate from your main OS and files.
* Developing and testing Windows drivers: a built-in **Test Mode** enables test-signing
  inside the guest, so the host's Secure Boot and boot configuration are left unchanged.
* Running a computer-use AI agent (such as Claude's computer use model) in its own VM. App
  Sandbox provides the desktop and the VM; the agent's own model loop runs inside the guest.
  Several agents can run at once, each in its own VM, on a single laptop or desktop.
* Creating GPU-accelerated (**GPU-PV**) VMs, from the GUI or the headless API.
* Scripting the VM lifecycle from code — create, snapshot, branch, SSH into, and delete
  GPU-accelerated VMs — with the Python SDK.

**Headless API.**
`appsandbox.exe --headless`
(or `sudo /Appsandbox.app/Contents/MacOS/AppSandbox --headless` on macOS) starts a
single-owner daemon that hosts the same core as the GUI and exposes it as a Docker-style
local HTTP/JSON API on `127.0.0.1`, identical on both platforms. The stdlib-only Python SDK
(`asb.py`) wraps it: create GPU-accelerated VMs (GPU-PV is a `gpuMode` create option), SSH
in over an auto-deployed key (Windows, Ubuntu, or macOS guests), snapshot and branch them,
open the live display, and run several at once — how many run concurrently is bounded by host
CPU, RAM, and GPU memory, not by a fixed limit. The daemon is single-host — it drives VMs on
the machine it runs on and does not provision cloud VMs; for CI, run it on a self-hosted
runner. Provisioning a VM runs a full unattended install; snapshots, branches, and templates
(Windows-only) start a new VM from a provisioned state instead of reinstalling. A VM persists
until deleted. A snapshot is a disk-state checkpoint taken with the VM stopped, and a branch
forks a writable disk from it to run divergent actions. The full API reference and runnable
examples are in [`tools/headless-api/`](https://github.com/jamesstringer90/appsandbox/blob/main/tools/headless-api).

**How it works:** this repo also aims to be a working example of creating full desktop VMs
programmatically with the Windows HCS/HCN APIs and Apple's Virtualization.framework. On
Windows, App Sandbox submits a hand-built HCS machine document to `computecore.dll` /
`computenetwork.dll` — the HCS/HCN layer that also underlies WSL2 and Windows Sandbox —
rather than going through Hyper-V Manager. GPU acceleration uses GPU paravirtualization
(GPU-PV) to share the host's installed GPU with the guest — the same WSL2 path, not a
dedicated passthrough (no VFIO/IOMMU, no second GPU). Windows guests get DirectX 12, OpenGL,
Vulkan, CUDA, and OpenCL; Ubuntu guests the same minus DirectX; macOS guests Metal. A custom
**IddCx** indirect display driver and a virtual audio device carry the screen and sound, and
guest↔host clipboard, audio, input, and SSH run over **Hyper-V sockets**. Guest disks are
built by an in-repo tool with support for ext4, squashfs, qcow2, and VHDX. On macOS, App
Sandbox uses Apple's **Virtualization.framework** (`VZVirtualMachine`, `VZMacOSInstaller`)
over **virtio-vsock**. On Windows, Linux (Ubuntu) guests reach the GPU through a custom
DRM/KMS kernel module (`asb_drm`), Microsoft's WSL2 `dxgkrnl`, and a custom Mesa build. The
apps are native C / Objective-C with an HTML/JS UI (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS).

# Tips:

[Windows] Enable hotkeys or mute the VM audio: connect to the VM and right-click the connection title bar

[Windows] Need a high performance remote desktop to remotely access your VM? [Phaze](https://phaze.app) works well

[Windows] You can check if the GPU-PV driver setup is working by running gpu-test.exe inside your App Sandbox Windows VM, gpu-test.exe will show a box with 6 rotating cubes, each using a different rendering engine (D3D9, D3D10, D3D11, D3D12, OpenGL and Vulkan). If one or more fail, they will not correctly show a rotating cube for that rendering API. [gpu-test.zip](https://github.com/jamesstringer90/appsandbox/releases/download/v0.1.2/gpu-test.zip). Note: The rendering API succeeding means that the GPU-PV worked, but sometimes games or apps are coded in such a way that they will not detect the GPU-PV system correctly and...
