China's government has declared the nation's information security industry needs to grow – fast.

A document with the catchy title of "Guiding Opinions of Sixteen Departments Including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Promoting the Development of the Data Security Industry" was issued last week, setting out an ambitious program to scale the industry at 30 percent compound annual growth rate, so it reaches ¥15 billion ($22B) of annual revenue by 2025.

To get there, China will build five security labs, between three and five national data security industrial parks, ten advanced demonstration areas for innovative applications, and "cultivate a number of leading and backbone enterprises with international competitiveness, individual champion enterprises and specialized, special and new little giant' enterprises."
