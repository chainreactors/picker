Smart folks investigating a memory-dumping vulnerability in the Great Firewall of China (GFW) finally released their findings after probing it for years.

The eight-strong team of security pros and academics found the data-leaking flaw, and started using it to learn about the GFW's inner workings in October 2021. It named the flaw Wallbleed after the Heartbleed disaster in OpenSSL.

To clear things up right from the start, this is no [Heartbleed](https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed_explained/). Yes, it's a memory-leaking bug, specifically an out-of-bounds read, but the team was only able to get it to reveal up to 125 bytes from the firewall's equipment. Wallbleed is not something that can be used to unearth the deepest secrets locked up by the Middle Kingdom but still… finding a bug in the GFW is a pretty cool thing.
