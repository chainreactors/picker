Organizations talk about having a data-driven culture, but it is difficult to achieve without first implementing a data-driven strategy.  A data-driven strategy is the prioritization of both context and richness of all data coupled with technology that enables the whole organization to accurately curate the data and make decisions.  With SAP data and analytics solutions, organizations can maximize the value of data and enable trusted, well governed insights across the enterprise.

Many changes in the past few years have stressed the importance of embracing a data-driven strategy including; distributed workforces, supply chain challenges, economic factors, and more. These global challenges have underscored the impact a data-driven strategy can have on an organizations ability to weather a storm or be left behind.

SAP understands that each data and analytics environment is unique.  Whether your organization is focused on centralizing or decentralizing your environment or a hybrid of both, SAP data and analytics solutions embrace your strategy and focus on the data, especially core application data.  Unlike other vendors, SAP data and analytics maintains the context of SAP data, allowing users to get maximum value out of that data to drive the most impactful business decisions. SAP data can be enriched with any 3rd party data virtually on an open, modern data stack that delivers trusted insights. And, because SAP data and analytics includes planning capabilities, insights and predictions can be quickly transformed into action plans that are extended across the enterprise, bringing finance and operations into alignment.
