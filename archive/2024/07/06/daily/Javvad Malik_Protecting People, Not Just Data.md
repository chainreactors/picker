As I sit here, reflecting on the recent news of the ransomware attack on pathology lab Synnovis, I can’t help but feel a sense of unease wash over me. It’s not just another headline or statistic; this time, it’s a bit more personal.

My neighbour, [Oliver Dowson](https://oliverdowson.com/), is one of the many individuals directly affected by this breach, his heart valve replacement surgery postponed indefinitely due to the fallout. The gravity of the situation weighs heavily on my mind, as I consider the far-reaching consequences of this single cybersecurity incident.

Oliver’s story is a reminder that behind every data breach, there are real people whose lives are thrown into turmoil. The stress and uncertainty that come with a postponed medical procedure cannot be overstated. It’s not just the inconvenience of rearranging one’s schedule or the disappointment of a delayed surgery; it’s the constant worry about potential health complications that may arise from the delay. For someone like Oliver, who has likely spent months mentally preparing for this life-altering operation, the emotional toll is immeasurable.

As a cybersecurity professional, I’ve built a career on analysing breaches, dissecting the technical details, and offering insights on how to prevent future incidents. However, Oliver’s situation has forced me to confront the human impact of these attacks in a way I’ve never experienced before. It’s one thing to discuss the importance of data protection and the need for robust cybersecurity measures in abstract terms; it’s another to witness firsthand the pain and frustration of someone whose life has been upended by a breach.

Covering cybersecurity breaches and incidents is my daily bread and butter, but rarely do I come face-to-face with the human impact of these attacks. Oliver’s story brings into sharp focus the real-world consequences of cybercrime – the stress, the uncertainty, and the potential health complications that can arise from delayed medical procedures. It’s a stark reminder that the work we do in the cybersecurity industry is not just about protecting data; it’s about safeguarding the well-being of individuals and communities.

The more I delve into the details of the Synnovis breach, the more I realise that this incident is not an isolated case, but rather a symptom of a larger problem plaguing the healthcare industry. The attack on Synnovis is just one example of how cybercriminals are increasingly targeting healthcare organisations, drawn by the wealth of sensitive data and the potential for significant disruption. In recent years, we’ve seen a surge in ransomware attacks on hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities, with devastating consequences for patients and healthcare providers alike.

The healthcare sector is particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks due to a combination of factors, including outdated IT infrastructure, a lack of cybersecurity expertise, and the pressing need to prioritise patient care over security concerns. Many healthcare organisations operate on tight budgets, with limited resources to invest in cybersecurity measures. Additionally, the rapid adoption of digital technologies, such as electronic health records and connected medical devices, has expanded the attack surface, providing more opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.

According to [Check Point Research](https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/a-continuing-cyber-storm-with-increasing-ransomware-threats-and-a-surge-in-healthcare-and-apac-region/), in the first three quarters of 2023, there was a 3% uptick in average weekly global cyberattacks compared to the corresponding period in the previous year – not enough to set off alarms. But the attacks in the global healthcare sector outpaced the global average by nearly four times, with an average of 1,613 attacks per week – an 11% year-over-year surge that is still rising.

IBM’s 2023 [Cost of a Data Breach](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) Report showed the global average cost of a data breach reached $4.45 million in 2023 – an all-time high for the report and a 15% increase over the last three years. Both the rate of increase in costs per attack for the sector in the last three years, and the average cost of a breach, were more than three times higher than the global average in the same period, with the cost per breach in healthcare averaging nearly $11 million, the costliest of all sectors.

As I dig deeper into Synnovis’ history, a troubling pattern emerges. Formerly known as Viapath, the company has a track record of mismanagement and questionable practices. In 2014, leaked internal documents revealed that Viapath had overcharged the NHS by £283,561 over a mere three-month period due to “unreliable” and “materially inaccurate” invoicing and billing systems. Complaints from clinicians also surfaced, highlighting concerns over the company’s policy of employing less experienced and less expensive staff.

This revelation is particularly disturbing, as it suggests a culture of prioritising financial gain over the quality of service and the well-being of patients. The decision to employ less experienced and less expensive staff may have contributed to the company’s vulnerability to cyberattacks, as a lack of skilled personnel can lead to inadequate security measures and a failure to identify and address potential threats.

Fast forward to 2022, and Viapath, now rebranded as Synnovis, experienced an IT outage that impacted genetic testing capabilities. And now, in the wake of this ransomware attack, it appears that the company had no backups or alternative methods to continue operations, leaving patients like Oliver in limbo. This is a damning indictment of Synnovis’ cybersecurity practices and overall management.

The absence of a robust backup and recovery plan is a cardinal sin in the world of cybersecurity. It’s a fundamental principle that organisations should always have multiple copies of their data, stored in separate locations, to ensure business continuity in the event of a breach or system failure. The fact that Synnovis had no such plan in place is a clear indication of a cavalier approach to cybersecurity and a disregard for the potential consequences of a successful attack.

Moreover, the inability to continue operations in the aftermath of the brea...
