The blog series is about the impact of digital transformation on Quality Management and how quality managers can transition from traditional Quality Management to Smart Quality Management. The transition involves bringing together people, processes, and technology to create additional value for the company. The blog series provides valuable insights on this topic to help quality managers take their quality management to a higher-level using SAP QM. The goal is to develop an intelligent approach that goes beyond compliance with regulations and cost savings.

**Listen also to my SAP Podcast “Inside SAP S/4HANA Episode 79 – The Power of SAP Quality Management”:**

# **Quality Management in digital Transformation**

Digital transformation brings fundamental changes to the way work will be done in the future. The impacts can also be felt in the field of Quality Management. Changing customer needs and increased expectations for quality require an adjustment of the role of quality management. Today, it is no longer limited to just ensuring product and service quality, but also plays an important role in business development. This change offers the opportunity to reorient quality management in a future-oriented way. The goal should be to develop an intelligent approach that goes beyond compliance with regulations and cost savings and creates additional value - the approach of «smart Quality Management».

# **Why this blog series?**

I would like to address quality managers who are interested in taking their quality management to a higher level with SAP QM to move from a traditional QM approach to a Smart Quality Management approach. This approach will add value to your business.

The two examples below illustrate the approach.

* Correcting defects, e.g. on a collaboration platform like SAP Quality Issue Resolution (SAP QIR), not only eliminates the defects and defines, implements and verifies the necessary measures, but also results in the positive effect of a sustainable improvement in relationships with customers and suppliers. This positive impact has an influence on future business and helps to improve quality

* With the help of appropriate technologies such as "embedded analytics," employees can now view relevant quality data easily and quickly. This enables them to become more engaged in quality, which in turn increases their awareness of the importance of quality.

In general, it's about capitalizing on technological advancements to add value. In my blog series I would like to provide valuable insights on this topic.

## **People**

People are at the heart of every company - you should consider them as your most important resource.It is essential to understand that people still play a crucial role in the digital era. The following two reasons will show you why humans are important in a digitized world.

* First, humans bring creativity and innovation to the table. Even with the most advanced technology, only humans can generate unique ideas and approaches that can help solve complex problems.

* Secondly, humans possess emotional intelligence and empathy, which are essential traits in a world where interactions are increasingly digital. Emotional intelligence allows humans to understand and relate to others and communicate effectively. Empathy, on the other hand, enables people to understand the feelings and emotions of others and respond accordingly.

## **Processes**

Effective processes can improve communication between expected and departments, resulting in remarkable benefits such as improved precision, speed and efficiency. By reducing daily confusion and frustration, team members can focus on taking responsibility and achieving their goals.

## **Technology**

Technology is an enabler that makes work easier by automating work processes and quickly and accurately capturing and processing data. Therefore, it should be viewed as a crucial element in the transition to a Smart Quality Management approach.

In summary, bringing together people, processes, and technology is a critical factor in successfully transitioning to a Smart Quality Management approach. I hope my blog series will be helpful to you, and I wish you success on your journey to Smart Quality Management.
