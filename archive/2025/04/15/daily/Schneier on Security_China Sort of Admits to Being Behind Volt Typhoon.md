## China Sort of Admits to Being Behind Volt Typhoon

*The Wall Street Journal* has the [story](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-u-s-infrastructure-hacks-c5ab37cb?st=UfFBTh&reflink=article_copyURL_share):

> Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind a widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter, underscoring how hostilities between the two superpowers are continuing to escalate.
>
> The Chinese delegation linked years of intrusions into computer networks at U.S. ports, water utilities, airports and other targets, to increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan, the people, who declined to be named, said.

The admission wasn’t explicit:

> The Chinese official’s remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan, a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting said.

No surprise.

…and **still** governments think that backdoors can be integrated for *their* side only.

@ ALL,

When I read,

> *“Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind a widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter…”*

A question arises in my mind.

“For whom do these ‘Chinese officials’ actually work for?”

That is,

1, The Chinese Citizens?

I know this might appear an odd question to ask, and some might say “what the heck who cares?”

But bearing in mind what is happening in several other regions of the world currently it’s rather more pertinent than many might think.

People need to remember that at one point even the US Government said it was considering kinetic responses to what it called Nation State Cyber attacks.

Thus knowing

A, That it’s going on.
B, Where it appears to originate from.

If not sufficient.

A lesson was proposed by Ex-NSA Chief General Michael Hayden’s 2014 statement of,

“We Kill People Based on Metadata”

It was an implicit admission that Western Nations do exactly what we accuse other Nations of for “political point scoring”.

Thus the question arises from it,

“What have we learned in the decade since about the morality of what some people do in the name of XXX?”

Then the next question which we all know was behind 9/11, 7/7, and many other attacks on the West,

“What response do we really expect and what mitigations do we have available that might be effective to protect National Citizens both at home and abroad?”

He said – she said

Whoever it was from @Clive’s list of possible suspects behind this “leak”, the precise words to use will have been carefully rehearsed, and the particular agent won’t be seen again.

@ TimH,

With regards,

> “Pot meet kettle. Stuxnet, anyone?”

It did not turn out so well…

I have good reason to remember it very well. Because I was one of the very few people who worked out who the real target was and why and was happy to say so publicly.

I did this even before the NOKs who likewise worked it out took the action that humiliated certain US Politicians.

Then months later a “unnamed source” let out what the USG had been doing and how it had been caught effectively flat footed.

An admission that surprised me more than the fact the stuxnet mission had had the sign off from the highest in atleast two countries.

As we subsequently found out the Iranian Government Agencies not only worked out who had done it, they also had found “Agents working for the CIA” due to poor CIA “OpSec”. They passed this on to the Chinese who did a round up and execution party of the CIA agents they found in China.

Now was it retribution?

Who knows but the loss of those agents certainly hurt the CIA badly.

Good thing we’re keeping our allies so close and giving them every reason to continue trusting us with intelligence.

China Sort of Admits?

Or U.S. Media Sort of Writes to Blame China?

“Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting” … “according to people familiar with the matter” … “the people, who declined to be named, said.”

“The admission wasn’t explicit”

So there was supposedly a secret meeting where this or that was said. Say people who declined to be named.

Truly convincing.

@BW

You missed that the “secret meeting” was reportedly held in Geneva, hot-bed of spies.

With the WSJ demanding .js ON, adbblocker OFF, and ca$h upfront, one wonders if this is a diversion from all the other excitement coming from Pennsylvania Ave.
