## Disruption as a Force for Good: Why We Built PreCrime™ to Stop Threats Before They Strike

When we started BforeAI, we knew we didn’t want to build just another threat intelligence company. The world already had enough tools that were reactive, that alerted security teams after an attack was underway, or worse, after it had already succeeded. Our conviction was simple: if we know how attackers work, and if we can observe and predict the signals of their preparation phases, we should be able to disrupt the attack before it starts.

That idea became PreCrime, a predictive engine for cyber disruption. But prediction alone isn’t enough. [Disruption](https://bfore.ai/disruption/) is where the impact happens. It’s where technology, intelligence, and purpose converge to stop harm before it reaches its victims.
