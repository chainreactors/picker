In our little niche corner of technology, it’s hard not to get excited about all the new command line interface (CLI) tools popping up all the time. I decided to make this blog post because recently, I had to get back into a lot of command line development stuff, and I found a few really cool new CLI tools. I showed a few teammates in Vegas this year, and based on the interest, I decided to showcase some of the stuff I use in my daily life. Along with a few other tooIs that I have been using for many years, these simple, well done CLI tools have completely changed the way I approach my work, making everything faster, smoother, and more efficient.

These CLI tools aren’t the traditional hacking utilities that you would normally see in a TrustedSec blog post. These are utilities that increase productivity. Many of these tools streamline the clunky ways we’ve been doing things for years. Learning to navigate your system with speed and precision, even if it’s not directly hacking-related, will always make you a more efficient consultant. The ability to zip through directories, automate tasks, and manipulate files effortlessly gives you an edge on any engagement. Plus, let’s be real: there’s something undeniably cool about clean, colorized, and properly formatted screenshots when you’re showing off your l33t hax. It's like someone finally decided to build the tools we’ve always wanted.

But here’s the thing: as rad as some of these CLI tools are, they’re not always an option. A lot of the time, we find ourselves working on systems where these modern languages just don’t exist. That’s why, even though the new, new shiny is great, it’s important not to rely on them too much until you’ve mastered the old-school commands they’re replacing. You should understand the basics of what really happening under the hood, no matter what kind of system you’re up against.

Whether you’re deep into hacking or just love tinkering with your system, I think you’ll appreciate how these tools can enhance your workflow. They’re not just about getting the job done, they’re about doing it with style and precision. There’s something deeply satisfying about navigating your environment with a few well-placed commands. I’ve always believed that the right setup on your machine can make all the difference, so, in this post, I’m sharing the tools that have made a real impact on how I work, hoping they might inspire you to take your command line game to the next level too.

I am making a few assumptions here:
