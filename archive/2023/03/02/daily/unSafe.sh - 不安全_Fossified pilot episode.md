Henrik, Johan, Magnus and I are all Swedish “FOSS people” and friends since many years back.

We like open source. We work with Open Source. We have contributed to Open Source since a long time back. We also have slightly different backgrounds and areas of expertise so we don’t all just totally overlap.

We decided we wanted to try putting together a podcast and talk about all things FOSS: from lightweight news down to more deep dives and interviews and discussions with peeps who know more. With our takes and personal views applied of course.

We named it **Fossified**. We have recorded a first pilot where we test the concept a little, but more importantly this is just the beginning and we have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fossified/podcast) where we collect program ideas and proposals.

We certainly need and appreciate your help. With ideas for topics and guests. Perhaps even with a logo or why not an intro song?

## The Pilot

We have recorded our first episode. You can find it on our very fancy website [fossified.com](https://fossified.com/).

## tech, open source and networking
