### *Local Cybersecurity Cloud Infrastructure to Support Digital Transformation*

Digital transformation is at the heart of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 program as the nation looks to future-proof its economy and enhance people’s lives. The Kingdom is looking to diversify its economy and develop public service sectors, such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation and tourism.

However, achieving these targets will require companies and governmental organizations to navigate a rising number of cybersecurity challenges. Specifically, the range and sophistication of cyber attacks are likely to increase alongside the rapid development of infrastructure across the region.

Saudi Arabia has already made important regulatory steps in these areas, announcing Data Cybersecurity Controls, Operational Technology Cybersecurity Controls and passing the Personal Data Protection Law, set to be enforced in September 2024. This regulatory progress will need to be matched by technological innovation and investment.

## New Local Cloud Infrastructure Delivers Innovative, Best-in-Class Cybersecurity Platforms

As a trusted provider of cybersecurity services to customers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Palo Alto Networks is committed to delivering and innovating the best technology and services to protect and enable the nation’s digital future.

By launching a new cloud location in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, this location will provide local and high-performance access to Palo Alto Networks industry-leading cybersecurity capabilities to customers in the Kingdom and across the region. This will help them meet their data residency needs.

The new cloud location will give customers domestic, high-performance access:

[**Prisma® Access**](/sase/access): The security service edge (SSE) solution of Prisma SASE – the industry’s most complete SASE solution that delivers consistent security to all users (headquarters, office branches and on the road) using internet, cloud and data centre applications. With a domestic cloud footprint, Saudi Arabia customers can bring Zero Trust security to the hybrid workforce with the lowest latency and highest performance in the industry.

[**Cortex XDR®**](/cortex/cortex-xdr)**:** The industry’s first and most effective extended detection and response platform, which integrates endpoint, network and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks. With the new Saudi Arabia cloud infrastructure, customers can process logs and perform analytics in Saudi Arabia.

[**Cortex XSOAR®**](/cortex/cortex-xsoar)**:** The industry’s most comprehensive SOAR solution, unifying workflow automation, case management and Threat Intel Management. With XSOAR, security teams can take action on threat intelligence, standardize processes and automate repeatable tasks to efficiently manage incidents across the product stack and speed response. Cortex XSOAR’s cloud-native SaaS environment (also offered as on-premises deployment) can be rapidly deployed for instant ROI.

[**Cortex XSIAM®**](/cortex/cortex-xsiam)**:** The AI-driven security operations platform for the modern SOC, harnessing the power of AI to simplify security operations, stop threats at scale, and accelerate incident remediation. With Cortex XSIAM, Saudi Arabia customers can now accelerate their SOC transformation while centralizing multiple products into a single platform, purpose-built for security operations.

[**Cortex® Xpanse**](/cortex/cortex-xpanse)**™:** An advanced attack surface management solution that proactively finds and fixes exposures on internet-connected assets before attackers can exploit them. It discovers and maintains a current, complete and accurate view of assets while applying threat and exploit intelligence to prioritize risks, autoremediate exposures, or enable analysts to fix them manually, reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks.

[**Advanced WildFire**](/network-security/advanced-wildfire)**:** Customers can fully utilize the industry’s largest malware prevention engine while ensuring that files submitted for analysis are processed in Saudi Arabia. Advanced WildFire can be leveraged by the Palo Alto Networks Zero Trust Network Security Platform (i.e., Prisma SASE, ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls and VM-/CN-Series software firewalls) and Cortex XDR, which secure a world where any user can work anywhere without restrictions, as well as by third-party products via API.

[**Strata Logging Service:**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/services/education/cortex-data-lake) Customers can collect, transform and integrate their enterprise's security data to enable Palo Alto Networks solutions while data logs are stored locally.

## Cloud Benefits Delivered Locally

The availability of the regionally hosted services is part of Palo Alto Networks ongoing commitment to deliver the most complete set of security services locally for customers in Saudi Arabia and across the region.

These services enable customers to balance data privacy concerns with the ability to detect emerging threats, providing a seamless, streamlined security solution, operated and delivered within Saudi Arabia.
