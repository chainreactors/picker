## Surveillance through Push Notifications

The *Washington Post* is [reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/29/push-notification-surveillance-fbi/) on the FBI’s increasing use of push notification data—”push tokens”—to identify people. The police can request this data from companies like Apple and Google without a warrant.

> The investigative technique goes back years. Court orders that were issued in 2019 to Apple and Google demanded that the companies hand over information on accounts identified by push tokens linked to alleged supporters of the Islamic State terrorist group.
>
> But the practice was not widely understood until December, when Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), in a [letter](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter.pdf) to Attorney General Merrick Garland, said an investigation had revealed that the Justice Department had prohibited Apple and Google from discussing the technique.
>
> […]
>
> Unlike normal app notifications, push alerts, as their name suggests, have the power to jolt a phone awake—a feature that makes them useful for the urgent pings of everyday use. Many apps offer push-alert functionality because it gives users a fast, battery-saving way to stay updated, and few users think twice before turning them on.
>
> But to send that notification, Apple and Google require the apps to first create a token that tells the company how to find a user’s device. Those tokens are then saved on Apple’s and Google’s servers, out of the users’ reach.

The article discusses their use by the FBI, primarily in child sexual abuse cases. But we all know how the story goes:

> “This is how any new surveillance method starts out: The government says we’re only going to use this in the most extreme cases, to stop terrorists and child predators, and everyone can get behind that,” said Cooper Quintin, a technologist at the advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation.
>
> “But these things always end up rolling downhill. Maybe a state attorney general one day decides, hey, maybe I can use this to catch people having an abortion,” Quintin added. “Even if you trust the U.S. right now to use this, you might not trust a new administration to use it in a way you deem ethical.”

In every decade there has been a group of undesirables. Do it or the Germans will get you, then the Russians will get you, then the Black Panthers, now it’s child predators and the terrorists. It always reads to me like, “Need more power, can’t articulate why, so ‘booooooo!'”

@ ALL,

> *“But these things always end up rolling downhill.*

The important things to renember,

1, All technology is agnostic to use.
2, The use is decided by a directing mind.
3, It is the observers that decide if that use is good or bad.

Now remember that for what is now seen as an increasing percentage of the population is those who have one or more mental deficiencies that as far as we know are incurable, and may be heritable as well as caused by repeated insults to the brain (see CTE).

These deficiencies are the underlying cause for the “Dark Pentad” sociopathic behaviours. Untill recently it was mistakenly believed to be “male criminal traits” only effecting around 1% of the population. That is very far from true, they are found about equally in men and women and in reality represent somewhere between 15-25% of the population.

If you want a very simplistic mathematical model look up game theory around the likes of “Hawks and Doves”.

Roughly the behaviours of authoritarians and authoritarian followers are split. Whilst the former are well studied the latter are very much less so. Importantly the behaviours of men “appear” to present differently than women. This is actually due to the fact the studies were mostly flawed as they were carried out on convicts in male prisons (which is not exactly representative of the general population).

Unfortunately both authoritarians and authoritarian followers are attracted to power and control structures such as those found in the organisational structures of Governments and the Guard Labour the Governments put in place.

So this “rolling downhill” effect of abusing powers against the civilian society is very much built into politics thus legislation and implementation of legislation and regulation.

I’ve given references before especially the work of Bob Altemeyer who sadly died just a month ago,

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Altemeyer>

He provided some of his work for free on his web pages,

<https://theauthoritarians.org/options-for-downloading-authoritarian-nightmare/>

His work on authoritarian followers forms part of the research materials for some research I’m doing about the behaviours of senior management running technology organisations where the actual work is carried out by those that tend to fall into the high functioning autism classification.

Likewise research papers on the dark Pentad that just a few years back pre C19 was known as the Dark Triad. It too is an area that is under researched but is now getting a larger spotlight turned on it. I would say that people who want to understand what goes on in the higher levels of the “computing stack” with regards security or lack there of, should really get to know the material.

Countermeasure – if you are sensitive about the use/abuse of these push notification techniques then stop using Android and Apple phone app for communicating. Might need to review the security of using web-based communication tools on a secure OS such Tails <https://tails.net/>

The US really needs to implement human rights and equality law at all levels from the constitution on down. It stops a lot of problems happening before they begin.
