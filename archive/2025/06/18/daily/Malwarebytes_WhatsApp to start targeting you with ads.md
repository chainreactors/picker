# WhatsApp to start targeting you with ads

Posted: June 17, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

WhatsApp [has announced](https://blog.whatsapp.com/helping-you-find-more-channels-and-businesses-on-whatsapp) that it will start to show you targeted ads on the app. The ads, it says, will appear under the **Updates** tab.

WhatsApp launched the Updates tab a year ago, and now 1.5 billion people visit it every day. Updates has historically been a place for users to follow news and updates from their favorite companies, news organizations and celebrities.

This is different to the **Chats** tab where users send and receive messages. Chats remain end-to-end encrypted and, according to Meta’s vice president for product management Nikila Srinivasan, will not display ads.

To determine your interests for ad purposes, WhatsApp says:

> “We’ll use limited info like your country or city, language, the Channels you’re following, and how you interact with the ads you see. For people that have chosen to add WhatsApp to Accounts Center, we’ll also use your ad preferences and info from across your Meta accounts.”

That means that anyone who has linked their Facebook or Instagram accounts with their WhatsApp account will now have that data used for ad targeting. This cross-platform integration feels like a significant invasion of privacy, especially for users who expected WhatsApp to remain more private than Facebook or Instagram.

The European privacy group NOYB (None Of Your Business) has already [voiced concerns](https://noyb.eu/en/whatsapp-getting-ads-using-personal-data-instagram-and-facebook), warning that WhatsApp may soon adopt the same “Pay or OK” model as Facebook and Instagram to obtain the user consent that’s required under EU law.

With Meta’s “Pay or OK” system, users face a choice between two options nobody asked for: either pay a monthly subscription fee to avoid targeted ads and tracking, or accept extensive data collection and personalized advertising in exchange for free access. If you don’t want your data tracked, you must pay. If you don’t pay, you must accept tracking and profiling for ads.

Meta introduced this model in response to strict privacy regulations in Europe, especially the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to get clear, “freely given” consent from users before using their data for personalized ads.

In the past, Meta has argued that it had obtained a ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that [accepted the subscription model](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/11/meta-sued-over-forcing-users-to-pay-to-stop-tracking) as a valid form of consent for an ads funded service.

Meta also said its pricing was in line with those of ad-free services such as YouTube Premium and Spotify Premium. However, it conveniently forgot to consider that ad-free services are not the same as those that gather data about you and sell them to the highest bidder to create personalized ads.

WhatsApp built its reputation on privacy, with end-to-end encryption and minimal data collection. And, as privacy advocates feared, bringing it into the Meta “family” moved the platform away from its privacy-first roots.

Even if WhatsApp says it won’t read your messages, it can still use your usage patterns, contacts, and other metadata to build detailed profiles for advertisers. This increases the risk of [data ...
