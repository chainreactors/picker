## Microsoft will spotlight ​​its AI-first, end-to-end security platform at the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit. Read our blog post for details on how to connect with us there and a teaser of what to expect from our sessions.​​

Security professionals visiting booths scattered around a hall, eager for solutions to today’s top cybersecurity challenges to protect their resources and people. The hum of hundreds of conversations. Presenters in packed sessions sharing expertise, trends, and stories to energize attendees. Few occasions are as thrilling as a cybersecurity event, knowing that all around you are people who understand the frustrating challenges and exciting wins of working in cybersecurity. The rise in quantum computing and AI as tools used by adversaries make such events both inspiring and necessary as professionals seek new approaches and ways to manage risk and protect assets.

Join Microsoft Security at Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, where we will showcase end-to-end security innovations and share world-class threat and regulatory intelligence to give you the advantage you need in the era of AI. This is an opportunity to learn how Microsoft’s AI-first end-to-end security platform can help you overcome the top security challenges and manage risk effectively even as high-level threats evolve.

The Summit is one of many [top cybersecurity events in 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/03/hear-from-microsoft-security-experts-at-these-top-cybersecurity-events-in-2025/?msockid=024eaf7d510e63232291bab3505c62b4) where security professionals like you can hear insights from Microsoft Security and interact with your peers. Microsoft Security offers AI-first, end-to-end protection for identities, endpoints, apps, and clouds, providing comprehensive security in the AI era, powered by unmatched threat intelligence. Accelerate your secure adoption of AI with ready-to-go security and governance tools built for generative AI.

We’re excited to be returning to the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit and look forward to giving attendees several ways to connect.  We invite you to come see our innovation and engage with us. Our experts will be giving two sessions, we’ll be offering live demos in our booth (#945), and we’ll be chatting with attendees during one-on-one meetings.

##### **Sign up for a one-on-one meeting**

We’re excited to meet with conference attendees and encourage you to book a time. During these meetings, we can exchange perspectives on the latest cybersecurity threats, security best practices, and industry trends.

We’re always up for sharing security strategies too. [Book a one-on-one meeting with a Microsoft expert](https://aka.ms/GartnerMeetings).

##### **Propel your security efforts with Microsoft sessions**

When choosing session topics for conferences, we consider several factors. What topics or trends are top of mind in the industry? What is sparking conversation with our clients? Where can we add the most value to help organizations facing modern security challenges? The Gartner Security & Risk Management is no exception and attendees can benefit from attending one – or even better, both –- of Microsoft’s two sessions at the event.  If you want to hear insights on AI news and maximize the value of Microsoft products, you won’t want to miss these sessions for insights that can help you better manage your organization’s risk:

Agentic workflows are set to revolutionize security by enabling complex problem-solving, agent collaboration, and iterative learning. Hammad will also discuss the continued importance of principles like Zero Trust, least privilege, and assume breach, but share why they will be insufficient as AI reshapes enterprises and cybersecurity, requiring new principles.
