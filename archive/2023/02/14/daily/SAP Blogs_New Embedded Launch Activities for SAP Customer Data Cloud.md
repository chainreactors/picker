SAP Data Cloud is a powerful cloud-based solution that enables organizations to securely manage, store, and analyze their data in a single platform. This solution provides a centralized and simplified way of managing data and makes it easier for businesses to gain insights and make informed decisions based on real-time data. With the recent launch of embedded launch activities for SAP Data Cloud, businesses can now take advantage of an even more streamlined and efficient data management process.

If you are about to start the deployment project of your new SAP Customer Data Cloud and you need help planning the activities for your team, we are excited to announce the release of our new Embedded Launch Activities (EmLA) for SAP Customer Data Cloud.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/CXapture-1.jpg)

EmLA refers to a set of pre-configured and pre-built processes that help organizations get started with SAP Data Cloud quickly and efficiently. These activities cover various aspects of data management, from data preparation and integration to data governance and security. The embedded launch activities are designed to help organizations get started with SAP Data Cloud in a matter of weeks, rather than months.

One of the key features of Embedded Launch Activities content is the ability to quickly and easily integrate with other SAP and non-SAP systems. This allows organizations to easily consolidate data from various sources and provides a single source of truth for all data within the organization. This enables businesses to make more informed decisions and take advantage of real-time data insights.

EmLA for SAP Data Cloud also includes comprehensive documentation and support, providing organizations with the resources they need to get up and running quickly. This includes detailed instructions on how to set up the solution, as well as access to a dedicated support team who can help with any questions or issues that may arise.

All these enablement materials to support your implementation journey can be located in the [Onboarding Learning Journeys for Customer Data Solutions](https://jam2.sapjam.com/groups/XS3V45Ayvo8jyLId47qwHk/overview_page/qZToxzI0CLDyaQ8yckeFZ3) which is structured in multiple phases to keep you in control of your project.
