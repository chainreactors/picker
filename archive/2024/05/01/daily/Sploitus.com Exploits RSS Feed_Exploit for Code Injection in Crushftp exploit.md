# Exploit Code for CVE-2024-4040
## Overview
This exploit code targets the CVE-2024-4040 vulnerability, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts by reading and validating tokens stored in the "sessions.obj" file. If the tokens are valid, hackers can gain entry to the targeted accounts. Unlike other methods exploiting similar vulnerabilities such as CVE-2023-43177, this script does not include the backdoor JAR creation and upload functionality (you can develop this part for your self).
