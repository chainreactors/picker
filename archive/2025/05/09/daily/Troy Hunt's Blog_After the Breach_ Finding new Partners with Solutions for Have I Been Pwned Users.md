# After the Breach: Finding new Partners with Solutions for Have I Been Pwned Users

09 May 2025

For many years, people would come to [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) (HIBP), run a search on their email address, get the big red "Oh no - pwned!" response and then... I'm not sure. We really didn't have much guidance until [we partnered with 1Password](https://www.troyhunt.com/have-i-been-pwned-is-now-partnering-with-1password/) and started giving specific advice about how to secure your digital life. So, that's passwords sorted, but the impact of data breaches goes well beyond passwords alone...

There are many different ways people are impacted by breaches, for example, identity fraud. Breaches frequently contain precisely the sort of information that opens the door to impersonation and just taking a quick look at the HIBP stats now, there's *a lot* of data out there:

1. 227 breaches exposed physical address
2. 243 breaches exposed date of birth
3. 288 breaches exposed phone numbers

That's just the big numbers, then there's the long tail of all sorts of other exposed high-risk data, including partial credit cards (32 breaches), government-issued IDs (18 breaches) and passport numbers (7 breaches). As well as helping people choose good passwords, we want to help them stay safe in the other aspects of their lives put at risk when hackers run riot.

Identity protection services are a good example, and I might be showing my age here, but I've been using them since the 90's. Today, I use a local Aussie one called [Truyu](https://www.truyu.com.au/?ref=troyhunt.com) which is built by the Commonwealth Bank. Let me give you two examples from them to illustrate why it's a useful service:

The first one came on [Melbourne Cup day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cup?ref=troyhunt.com) last year, a day when Aussies traditionally get drunk and lose money betting on horse races. Because gambling (sorry - "gaming") is a heavily regulated industry, a whole bunch of identity data has to be provided if you want to set up an account with the likes of [SportsBet](https://www.sportsbet.com.au/?ref=troyhunt.com). Whilst I personally maintain that gambling is a tax on people who can't do maths, Charlotte was convinced we should have a go anyway, which resulted in Truyu popping up this alert:

This was me (and yes, of course we lost everything we bet) but... what if it wasn't me, and my personal information had been used by someone else to open the account? That's the sort of thing I'd want to know about *fast*. As for all those "Illion Credit Header" entries, I asked Truyu to help explain what they mean and why they're important to know:

* *Illion Credit Header – Banking Finance Segment : This segment includes information that links you to financial institutions—such as banks, lenders, or credit card provider. It helps confirm your financial presence and association with trusted entities, but it can also reveal if your identity is being used across multiple banks fraudulently.*
* *Illion Credit Header – Telecommunications Segment: This covers data from telco providers (e.g., Optus, Telstra, Vodafone), indicating that your identity has been used to open or inquire about telco services. Telco accounts are often targeted for fraud (SIM swaps, device purchases), so unexpected entries here can flag potential misuse of your ID.*
* *Illion Credit Header – Utilities Segment - This segment includes information showing you've been associated with utility services like electricity, gas, or water. If someone uses your ID to set up a utility account, it will show here—often before more obvious signs of fraud occur.*
* *Illion Credit Header – Public Records Segment: This includes any publicly available identity-linked records, such as: Court judgements, Bankruptcies, ASIC or other official listings*

Yep, I'd definitely want to know if it wasn't me that initiated all that!

Then, on a recent visit to see [the Irish National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/?ref=troyhunt.com), we found ourselves hungry in Dublin. Google Maps recommended this *epic* sushi place, but when we arrived, a sign at the front advised they didn't accept credit cards - in 2025!! Carrying only digital cards, having no cash and being hungry for sushi, I explored the only other avenue the store suggested: creating a [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) account. Doing so required a bunch of personal information because, like betting, finance is a heavily regulated industry. This earned me another early warning from Truyu about the use of my data:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/image-14.png)

I pay Truyu A$4.99 each month via a subscription on my iPhone, and IMHO, it's money well spent. For full disclosure, Truyu is also an enterprise subscriber to HIBP (like 1Password is), and you can see breaches we've processed in their app too. I've included them here because they're a great example of a service that adds real value "after the breach", and it's one I genuinely use myself.

The point of all this is that there are organisations out there offering services that are particularly relevant to data breach victims, and we'd like to find the really good ones and put them on the new HIBP website. We've even built out some all-new dedicated spaces, for example on [the new breach page](https://preview.haveibeenpwned.com/pages/breach?ref=troyhunt.com):

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/2025-05-08_13-00-08.jpg)

But choosing partners is a bit more nuanced than that. For example, a service like Truyu caters to an Aussie audience, and the way identity protection works in the US or UK, for example, is different. We need different partners in different parts of the world, and further, offering different services. Identity protection is one thing, but what else? There are *many* different risks that both individuals and organisations (of which there are hundreds of thousands using HIBP today) face after being in a data breach.

So, we're looking for more partners that can make a positive difference for the folks that land on HIBP, do a search and then ask "now what?!" We're *obviously* going to be very selective and very cautious about who we work with because the trust people have in HIBP is not something I'll ever jeopardise by selecting the wrong partners. And, of course, any other brand that appears on this site needs to be one that reflects not just our values and mission, but is complementary to our favourite password manager as well.

Now that we're on the cusp of launching this new site (May 17 is our target), I'm inviting any organisations that think they fit the bill to [get in touch with me](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/) and explain how they can make a positive difference to data breach victims looking for answers "after the breach".
