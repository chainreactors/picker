## Shadowserver counts more than 13,000 appliances still wide open – including thousands in US, Germany, and UK

Thousands of Citrix NetScaler appliances remain exposed to a trio of security flaws that the vendor patched this week, one of which is already being actively exploited in the wild.

Fresh data from [the Shadowserver Foundation](https://x.com/shadowserver/status/1960662959232860281?s=46) shows that the number of vulnerable systems dropped from more than 28,000 on Wednesday to 13,000 on Thursday, suggesting that admins have been scrambling to patch. Even so, thousands remain open to attack, with more than 7,500 affected devices in the US, over 4,000 in Germany, and more than 1,200 in the UK.

The findings underscore what security researchers have long warned: patch lag is leaving enterprises wide open, even when the vendor has already confirmed exploitation.
