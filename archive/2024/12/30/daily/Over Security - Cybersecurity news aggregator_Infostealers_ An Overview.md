## What are Infostealers?

An infostealer is malicious software designed to infiltrate computer systems and extract valuable information from compromised devices. These malware programs operate covertly (not like some malware that perhaps gives pop-ups or noticeably hamper system performance) to collect sensitive data.

For a shorter description, an infostealer is malware that covertly steals secret information from a computer.

 Our computers have tons of sensitive information tucked away – passwords in the browser, cookies with connection tokens, files with sensitive information saved (how many people do you think have a text file saved with a name like “passwords” or “private”?), PDFs with their recovery key codes, Word documents with their banking information – to name a few.

 And in every operating system, there are typical “hidden” places with loads of information about that computer (e.g., Windows registry, Linux /etc, /usr, /bin).

Those are the items that infostealers are after.

## Typical Techniques

Infostealers use varied techniques for system infiltration and data extraction. These techniques include but aren’t limited to phishing, infected websites, malicious software downloads (e.g., video game mods, pirated software), and exploiting system vulns.

 Once installed, infostealers harvest data via methods like [browser hooking](https://beefproject.com/?ref=secjuice.com), web injection scripts, form grabbing, keylogging, clipboard hijacking, screen capturing (ironically, this sounds like [Microsoft’s recent Recall feature](https://www.techspot.com/news/105943-microsoft-recall-capturing-screenshots-full-sensitive-information-despite.html?ref=secjuice.com)), and browser session hijacking.

## Some more specific information

After infecting a computer, infostealers use various the following techniques (including, but not limited to) to acquire data. These include:

1. **Credentials**: Credentials are a significant target, providing the quickest and easiest way for the criminal element to access computers. These stolen creds are used to collect login links, usernames, and even passwords stored in the browser.
2. **Cookies**: Cookies enable malicious actors to access a logged-in session, bypassing security measures like MFA/2FA.
3. **Documents and text files**: Infostealers discover and target high-risk files containing confidential information such as financial, intellectual property, server passwords, and crypto private keys.
4. **Machine-specific properties**: These properties include computer name, operating system, IP address, date and pathway of infection, as well as existing antivirus and installed applications. It’s their way of doing recon!

## Anatomy of an Infostealer

### Bot Framework

The bot framework is an essential component of many infostealers, designed to operate on many victim machines for infection distribution. Here are key aspects of the Bot Framework:

1.     **Configurability**: The framework includes a builder allowing attackers to customize the infostealer's behavior on the target computer. This enables them to specify the data to collect and how the malware should operate.

2.     **Data collection capabilities**: Bot frameworks typically include modules for:

·                Harvesting browser data (passwords, cookies, autofill information)

·                Extracting credentials from various applications

·                Capturing keystrokes

·                Taking screenshots

·                Gathering system information

3. **Stealth**: Infostealers are designed to be lightweight and stealthy, leaving a minimal footprint on the infected system.

4. **Exfiltration**: The bot framework is responsible for sending the collected data back to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

5. **Versioning**: Some sophisticated bot frameworks, like the one used in the [Jupyter infostealer](https://blog.morphisec.com/jupyter-infostealer-backdoor-introduction?ref=secjuice.com), implement a versioning matrix to manage different malware versions.

6. **More advanced** Bot frameworks may include capabilities for:

·       Downloading and executing additional malware

·       Running PowerShell scripts and commands

·       Process hollowing (for injecting malicious code into apps)

7. **Compatibility**: Bot frameworks are often designed to work across multiple Windows versions and system architectures. For example, the [Continental Stealer is compatible](https://cyberint.com/blog/research/the-new-infostealer-in-town-the-continental-stealer/?ref=secjuice.com) with systems from Windows 7 (x32) to Windows 11 (x64) and supports both ARM and x86-x64 architectures.

8. **Anti-detection features**: Some bot frameworks incorporate anti-VM capabilities to evade detection when running in virtual environments and self-destruct mechanisms to remove traces after execution.

Here’s a pictorial and general overview of a bot framework:

## All in the Family

Infostealers are technically malware, which we often think of as a product – like buying an office suite or photo editing program - and is, more technically, Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) because one can pay [$130-$750](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/vidar-malware-analyst-note-tlpclear.pdf?ref=secjuice.com) for Vidar infostealer, for example – depending on the license - to get it from a vendor. But it’s often also referred to as if certain ones are their own entity, family, distributor, reseller, market, campaign, and threat actor. Here, I’ll talk about infostealers in both ways, not focusing on whether or not it’s the malware or threat actor.

Some of the most prevalent infostealer families include Raccoon, RedLine, AgentTesla, Vidar, and AZOrult.

One example of the sophistication of MaaS is the stealer  Rhadamanthys (here’s [quick overview](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rhadamanthys?ref=secjuice.com) of it, with Yara rules at the bottom of the page if you need that to search for activity).

Rhadamanthys has [instructional videos on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/user185512701?ref=secjuice.com) about how to use it.

## The Top 3?

What are the main ones to be aware of and protect against? There’s no way to determine “Who’s or What’s the most dangerous?” It’s like asking, “What’s the best band?” or “What’s the worst company?” There are so many technical details and subjective experiences that calling something “worst” or best” is not quantifiable. For infostealers, some are spun up and th...
