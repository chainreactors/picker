Last time , we found an **HTML Injection Vulnerability** . Let‚Äôs keep going and try to escalate it into **XSS** .

So, basically, we‚Äôll replace the `h1`tag with a `<script>` tag and change the script content to `alert(something)` to see if we get an alert pop-up when it's executed successfully.

**Here's the trick**: we'll remove the last `>`, because the web app automatically appends the closing tag, as we saw in previous examples .

So, we got our alert reflected here, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything because the web app uses some kind of filtering to prevent injecting JavaScript into the **HTML** .

However, we‚Äôll try other methods and payloads to bypass this filter. One of my favorite XSS payload repositories is the[**XSS.js.org**](https://xss.js.org/#/xss01) website, which contains a large number of great payloads.

Let‚Äôs try some of them manually. If that doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll use Burp Suite Intruder.

After four failed attempts, the fifth one finally gave us the desired result: **XSS found!**

```

And here is the used payload

```
<IMG SRC=x onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))"
```

Or we can simply

```
<IMG SRC=x onerror=alert("XSS")
```

Also , remember to omit the closing tag `>` from the payload as we did earlier .

And we did it , we achieved the desired XSS !

Now, let‚Äôs return to the home page and explore further. We‚Äôll start by examining the booking form to see if it has any vulnerabilities.

First, we‚Äôll perform some manual testing. If we don‚Äôt find anything, we can use automated tools to dig deeper.

So, as a normal user, we‚Äôll fill out the form inputs and observe how the web app behaves.

After filling out the form, the web app displays: ‚Äú**This order is pending confirmation.**‚Äù I also noticed that it redirects from `book.php` to `confirmed.php` , huum interesting .

After some manual attempts and testing, we didn‚Äôt find anything interesting. Let‚Äôs intercept the request through **Burp Suite** to see if we can find something .

Here‚Äôs the request :

We didn‚Äôt find anything unusual except the data sent from the form.

After some investigation, I noticed something interesting, whenever we write into the form, the data gets **Reflected** in the source code within the `value` attribute. Here is an example:

From this discovery, I think we can achieve a **Reflected XSS**.

Let‚Äôs intercept the request again and try injecting some XSS payloads from our repo [**XSS.js.org**](https://xss.js.org/#/xss03) , we hope we can successfully exploit it.

So, as always, after many failed attempts trying to find the winning payload, we finally found it.

```
"><script>alert(233)</script>
```

Out of curiosity, I wanted to determine which input field is vulnerable.

After retesting, I discovered that the `Date`input is the vulnerable field in this form.

And I got the same result as above .

Here is the source code. As you can see, the script tag in the `Full Name`and `Email Address`fields is being placed within the input box, which means these inputs are not vulnerable.

However, in the `Date` field, we don‚Äôt see anything initially. When we inspect the code, we notice the selected `Date`followed by the closing tag `‚Äù>` we inserted, causing our script to be treated as part of the page‚Äôs code.

**Good achievement for now**, but there‚Äôs still a long way to go. Let‚Äôs continue our journey in the next part and see what other vulnerabilities we can uncover.

### So far, we‚Äôve uncovered üêûüêûbugs, but there‚Äôs much more to explore. In the next part, we‚Äôll dive deeper and find even more vulnerabilities. Hope you enjoyed this segment ü•≥ see you soon!
