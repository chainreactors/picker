# After global IT meltdown, CrowdStrike courts hackers with action figures and gratitude

## CrowdStrike tried to go back to business as usual at one of the world’s largest annual cybersecurity conferences

5:00 AM PDT · August 10, 2024

On Wednesday morning, thousands of cybersecurity professionals swarmed the halls of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, the epicenter of the annual Black Hat cybersecurity conference, where dozens of companies were advertising their wares.

In the first row and with one of the biggest booths stood CrowdStrike, a company that has recently become a household name — but not because of its prowess in stopping malicious hackers.

On July 19, CrowdStrike [pushed a faulty software update](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/what-we-know-about-crowdstrikes-update-fail-thats-causing-global-outages-and-travel-chaos/) that crashed [at least 8.5 million](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/) computers all over the world, causing [flight delays](https://www.reuters.com/legal/crowdstrike-is-sued-by-fliers-after-massive-outage-disrupts-air-travel-2024-08-05/), [disrupting hospitals’ operations](https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2024-07-23/the-crowdstrike-outage-disrupted-many-industries-hospitals-were-especially-vulnerable?_amp=true) — including [some surgeries](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-german-hospitals-cancel-elective-operations-citing-global-it-outage-2024-07-19/) — and hamstringing [several U.S. government agencies](https://fedscoop.com/federal-government-agencies-affected-by-worldwide-it-outage/), among many other organizations that had to manually reboot computers and servers to get back to normal.

Since then, CrowdStrike has been sharing updates on its own investigation of the outage. The company also [offered $10 Uber Eats gift cards to partners](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/24/crowdstrike-offers-a-10-apology-gift-card-to-say-sorry-for-outage/), some of which had to spend hours to recover from the incident, as a way to send its “heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience.”

Several people who received the voucher — some of whom felt the gift was tone-deaf — could not cash in the gift card before Uber flagged it as fraud, “because of high usage rates,” according to a CrowdStrike spokesperson.

Less than three weeks later, some CrowdStrike employees had the tough job of pitching the company’s products at its conference booth. As soon as the doors opened, dozens of attendees started lining up. They were not all there to ask tough questions, but to pick up T-shirts and action figures made by the company to represent some of the nation-state and cybercriminal groups it tracks, such as Scattered Spider, an extortion racket allegedly behind [last year’s MGM Resorts](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/mgm-cyberattack-outage-scattered-spider/) and [Okta cyberattacks](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/okta-admits-hackers-accessed-data-on-all-customers-during-recent-breach/); and Aquatic Panda, a China-linked espionage group.

“We’re here to give you free stuff,” a CrowdStrike employee told people gathered around a big screen where employees would later give demos.

A conference attendee looked visibly surprised. “I just thought it would be dead, honestly. I thought it would be slower over there. But obviously, people are still fans, right?”

For CrowdStrike at Black Hat, there was an element of business as usual, despite its global IT outage that caused widespread disruption and delays for days — and even weeks for some customers. The conference came at the same time as CrowdStrike [released its root cause analysis](https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/) that explained what happened the day of the outage. In short, CrowdStrike conceded that it messed up but said it’s taken steps to prevent the same incident happening again. And some cybersecurity professionals attending Black Hat appeared ready to give the company a second chance.

On the action figures’ boxes stacked at the company’s booth, which were getting restocked constantly, CrowdStrike wrapped a message addressing the outage. “Adversaries aren’t stopping. Neither are we,” the message read. “Resilience starts with us. Our focus remains with you.”

The company projected the same message onto a large screen in the hallway that leads from the Mandalay Bay casino to the convention center.

CrowdStrike’s senior director of corporate communications, Kevin Benacci, told TechCrunch that “the message shares our gratitude and appreciation for the Black Hat community, as well as the support we have received post incident.”

Benacci added that the company had “technical team members in the booth addressing the incident.”

When TechCrunch visited the booth on Thursday, we saw several sales engineers showing demos of the product, but also...
