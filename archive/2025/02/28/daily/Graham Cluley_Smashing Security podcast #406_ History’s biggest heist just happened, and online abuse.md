In episode 406 of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast, we explore how the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has been hacked to the jaw-dropping tune of $1.5 billion, and we look at what is being done to better defend women and girls‚Äô safety online.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.
