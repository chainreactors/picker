Who has time to decode tech policy, understand the law, then figure out how to change things for the users? EFF does. The purpose of every attorney, activist, and technologist at EFF is to watch your back and make technology better. [But you are the superstar who makes it possible with your support.](https://eff.org/r.ucrh)
