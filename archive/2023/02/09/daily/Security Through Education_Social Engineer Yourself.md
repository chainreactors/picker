At [SECOM](https://www.social-engineer.com/) we define social engineering as “the act of influencing someone to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest.” For example, by using social engineering principles such as reframing, commitment, and authority, a high school counselor can influence a student to improve their grades and thus have a better chance of attending college.

Social engineering is about influencing others, but what if I told you that you can social engineer yourself? Let me share with you some ways that I’ve used social engineering on myself and how it has benefitted me.

## Know Thyself

The first thing I learned when I attended the Advanced Practical Social Engineering course (APSE) was identifying my communication style. In class I took the [DISC assessment](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc). DISC is an acronym that stands for the four main personality profiles described in the DISC model: (D)ominance, (I)nfluence, (S)teadiness and (C)onscientiousness. It is not a personality test, rather it’s an assessment to discern your predominant way of communicating. Some may be short and direct communicators whereas others will include many details in their explanation. There is no superior or inferior communication style. However, a very direct communicator may find details annoying. On the other hand, a person that needs details to make a decision may find a direct way of communication abrasive.

In social engineering adapting the way we communicate with others is crucial. During an engagement when we can quickly assess the communication style of our target, we have a much better chance of success by adapting how we communicate with them. We can apply the same principle in our personal lives. Have you found yourself arguing with your significant other, just to realize you were both saying the same thing all along? Being [self-aware of our communication style and that of the other person](https://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/understanding-communication-styles/) can help us reduce conflict and improve relationships, both professional and personal.

## Pretexting

As social engineers we use [pretexts](https://www.social-engineer.org/general-blog/the-power-of-a-good-pretext/) in our everyday work. In essence, a pretext is a simple but believable story that we create to influence the target’s behavior. For example, during a vishing campaign I will call employees pretending to be from their IT department seeking to confirm information about their computers. I adjust my pretext and the way I speak to play the role of the IT specialist and sound as realistic as possible. However, I am not the most technically savvy person. So, believing the pretext myself conveys the needed trust in order to succeed with the vishing calls.

I have found myself creating pretexts in my mind to help me accomplish personal goals or to behave in a desired manner to fit a situation. There was an instance where I was asked to be part of a video shoot for an upcoming company project. This involved reading a teleprompter and appearing natural and at ease in front of professional cameras and blinding lights. To make matters worse, the whole production would take place with my peers. As an introvert, I found the whole ordeal very intimidating. Then it occurred to me: “If I can become another person during my vishing calls using a pretext, could I do the same now?” So, I created a story (or pretext) for myself that I was an experienced news anchor for the day. This gave me the motivation to complete my part of the project with confidence.

## Nonverbals

![Social Engineer Yourself](https://www.social-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2023-February-Newsletter-Image-2.jpg)
A large portion of our communication is not conveyed with words, but through our [nonverbal communications.](https://www.social-engineer.com/dispelling-body-language-myths/) In the book Emotions Revealed, Dr. Ekman explains that we can convey emotions such as anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and happiness, just by how they show across our faces. This not only provides signals for others to identify our feelings, but it can also alter the [emotions](https://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/emotions-used-in-human-hacking/) of the other person. Social engineers must become masters at understanding, reading, and influencing, people. During an in-person engagement a colleague spilled coffee on his shirt and resume, then walked into the office building with a sad look of disappointment. He then told the receptionist how important this job interview was and asked if he could hand her his flash drive so she could print a copy of his resume. The receptionist moved with pity complied. The SE accomplished the goal of exploiting human vuln...
