For decades, the world has strived for simplification through digitization. In this ongoing pursuit, things have, ironically, become complicated. While countless technologies, applications, and tools are available to help enterprises streamline their work, digitization has increased complexity for many businesses; most notably, expanding their attack [surfaces](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ciso-wins-reducing-risk-across-endpoint-identity-and-cloud-surfaces/).

As the number of connected devices and online services skyrocket, the task of identifying all these assets and managing each of their potential vulnerabilities has become one of the most significant security challenges enterprises face.

Digital [attack surface](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-cyber-security-attack-surface/) management is high-priority for enterprise leaders protecting their operations and brand. In this post, learn what security policies and best practices support a robust attack surface management strategy and how to implement the right controls for better surface visibility.

## What Attack Surfaces Are Enterprises Facing?

Enterprises face a multitude of digital attack surfaces in today’s interconnected and digitized landscape. With all businesses relying on interconnected systems, cyber threats have significantly broadened the potential avenues for both opportunistic and calculated attacks.

The digital attack surface refers to the sum total of all the potential entry points or vulnerabilities within an organization’s digital infrastructure that can be targeted by a [threat actor](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-actor/). It encompasses the various interconnected systems, devices, networks, and software applications that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, disrupt operations, or compromise sensitive data.

The attack surface expands as organizations adopt new technologies, such as IoT devices, [cloud](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/) services, and remote work environments, which introduce even more potential weaknesses. Understanding and managing the digital attack surface is a critical task for implementing effective cybersecurity measures in the long run.

To help understand the digital attack surface, it is helpful to break it down into a number of discrete categories that represent entry points for threat actors:

### Software Vulnerabilities

[Hackers](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-hacker/) and cybercriminals leverage coding or implementation mistakes in third-party applications, operating systems, and other software or firmware to infiltrate networks. Exploiting vulnerabilities allows them to obtain unauthorized access to user directories or spread their [malware](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-malware-everything-you-need-to-know/).

### Weak Credentials & Passwords

The use of easily guessable passwords or credentials that can be cracked through brute-force attacks heightens the vulnerability of administrative or privileged user accounts. Posing an increased risk of cybercriminals compromising networks, [weak credentials](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/rise-in-identity-based-attacks-drives-demand-for-a-new-security-approach/) enable threat actors to steal sensitive information, disseminate malware, and cause harm to critical infrastructure.

### System & Network Misconfiguration

Inadequately configured network ports, channels, wireless access points, firewalls, or protocols all act as potential gateways for hackers. In [adversary-in-the-middle](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-man-in-the-middle-mitm-attack/) (AiTM) attacks, for example, threat actors exploit weak encryption protocols used in message-passing channels, enabling unauthorized interception of communications between systems.

### Internet-Facing Assets

Web applications, web servers, and other resources exposed to the public internet run the risk of possessing inherent vulnerabilities that attackers can target. These kinds of risks are considered ‘low hanging fruit’ for hackers who can inject malicious code into unprotected APIs, leading to improper disclosure or potential destruction of sensitive information stored in associated databases.

### Shared Directories & Databases

Threat actors often exploit shared databases and directories across interconnected systems and devices, working to obtain unauthorized access to valuable resources or launching [ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/) attacks. Once inside, they may extract sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, or intellectual property.

### Shadow or Rogue IT

[Shadow IT](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-shadow-it-a-comprehensive-guide-to-understanding-and-securing-your-organizations-cloud-environment/) (*aka* Rogue IT) refers to the use of unauthorized software, applications, or services within an organization without the knowledge or approval of the IT department. Employees may adopt technology solutions outside their organization’s official IT infrastructure, which can create security risks, compliance issues, and a lack of centralized control and visibility.

## How to Stay Ahead | Understanding Shifts in Digital Attack Surfaces

As businesses scale and develop, their digital footprints and inherent risks quickly expand in tandem. Many have embarked on digital transformation efforts, [IoT](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/bringing-iot-out-of-the-shadows/) strategies, hybrid work plans, and [cloud](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/7-practical-solutions-for-modern-businesses-combating-cloud-based-attacks/) adoption, but often, cybersecurity becomes an afterthought in such expansion efforts.

This is where digital attack surface management comes in. Managing attack surfaces allows enterprises to proactively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. By conducting thorough assessments of their systems, networks, and applications, businesses can identify weak points and take necessary steps to fortify their defenses. This includes patching software vulnerabilities, implementing robust access controls, and configuring firewalls and intrusion detection systems effectively.

Also to consider is that the digital attack surface landscape is continually evolving, driven by technological developments and changes in how organizations operate. To get ahead in an ever-shifting landscape, enterprise leaders are focusing on actively discovering, assessing, and addressing the exposure of their internet-facing assets. Proactively managing attack surfaces also minimizes the potential impact of cyberattacks.

In the event of a [breach](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-data-breach/), organizations with a well-managed attack surface are better equipped to contain and mitigate the damage. They have established [incident response plans](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-an-incident-response-your-ir-guide/), backups, and di...
