## Zimbra Zero-Day Exploited to Target Brazilian Military via Malicious ICS Files

**Oct 06, 2025
Email Security / Zero-Day

A now patched security vulnerability in Zimbra Collaboration was exploited as a zero-day earlier this year in cyber attacks targeting the Brazilian military. Tracked as CVE-2025-27915 (CVSS score: 5.4), the vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Classic Web Client that arises as a result of insufficient sanitization of HTML content in ICS calendar files, resulting in arbitrary code execution. "When a user views an e-mail message containing a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details> tag," according to a description of the flaw in the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). "This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the victim's acco...](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/zimbra-zero-day-exploited-to-target.html)

Vulnerability / Threat Intelligence

Oracle has released an emergency update to address a critical security flaw in its E-Business Suite that it said has been exploited in the recent wave of Cl0p data theft attacks. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-61882 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns an unspecified bug that could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise and take control of the Oracle Concurrent Processing component. "This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., it may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password," Oracle said in an advisory. "If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may result in remote code execution." In a separate alert, Oracle's Chief Security Officer Rob Duhart said the company has released fixes for CVE-2025-61882 to "provide updates against additional potential exploitation that were discovered during our investigation."

## CometJacking: One Click Can Turn Perplexity's Comet AI Browser Into a Data Thief

**Oct 04, 2025
Agentic AI / Enterprise Security

Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed details of a new attack called CometJacking targeting Perplexity's agentic AI browser Comet by embedding malicious prompts within a seemingly innocuous link to siphon sensitive data, including from connected services, like email and calendar. The sneaky prompt injection attack plays out in the form of a malicious link that, when clicked, triggers the unexpected behavior unbeknownst to the victims. "CometJacking shows how a single, weaponized URL can quietly flip an AI browser from a trusted co-pilot to an insider threat," Michelle Levy, Head of Security Research at LayerX, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News. "This isn't just about stealing data; it's about hijacking the agent that already has the keys. Our research proves that trivial obfuscation can bypass data exfiltration checks and pull email, calendar, and connector data off-box in one click. AI-native browsers need security-by-design for agent...](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/cometjacking-one-click-can-turn.html)
