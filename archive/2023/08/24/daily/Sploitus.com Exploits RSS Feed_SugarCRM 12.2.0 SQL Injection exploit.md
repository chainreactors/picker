https://www.sugarcrm.com

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 12.2.0 and prior versions.
Version 12.0.2 and prior versions.
Version 11.0.5 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

e.g.
“/Notes/{recordID}/link/history” REST API endpoint is not properly
sanitized before
being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious
users to
e.g. read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection
attacks.
