# Fake Airplane Mode: A mobile tampering technique to maintain connectivity

Jamf Threat Labs developed a post-exploit persistence technique on iOS 16 that falsely shows a functional Airplane Mode. In reality, after successful device exploit the attacker plants an artifical Airplane Mode that edits the UI to display Airplane Mode icons and cuts internet connection to all apps except the attacker application. This enables the attacker to maintain access to the device even when the user believes it is offline. This technique has not yet been observed in the wild and is only possible on an already exploited or jailbroken device.

 For those with cyber-paranoia and technophobia, putting your phone on Airplane Mode may be a useful psychological trick to help achieve peace of mind and a feeling of additional privacy.

But should you use Airplane Mode to protect your security and privacy?
