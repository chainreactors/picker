### Breach Classification

## **Sensitive Breach**

HIBP enables you to discover if your account was
exposed in most of the data breaches by directly
searching the system. However, certain breaches are
particularly sensitive in that someone's presence in
the breach may adversely impact them if others are
able to find that they were a member of the site.

A sensitive data breach can only be searched by the
verified owner of the email address being searched
for. This is done via the notification system which
involves sending a verification email to the address
with a unique link.

There are presently 74 sensitive breaches in the
system including Adult FriendFinder, Ashley Madison,
and others.

## Recommended Actions

##### Change Your Password

If you haven't changed your SpyX password since 2024, do so
immediately.
