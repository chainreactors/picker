With the beginning of a new year, I´m excited to see which innovations and highlights are coming up for SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) in the next quarters. But isn´t it worthwhile reviewing the Q4 2022 highlights of our recent deliveries out of the SAP Business Technology Platform product roadmap as well? With the subset of innovation highlights that I am listing in this blog post, I want to share my personal view of the highlights of what our development teams brought to the platform.

I hope you enjoy spending some minutes on my personal view of innovation highlights in Q4 2022:

## SAP BTP Innovation Highlights Q4 2022:

### Integration

* User experience is an important topic for all our SAP products. As SAP Integration Suite offers many different tools to solve integration needs, we expose many interaction points to our users. With the October release of SAP Integration Suite, we now provide a coherent user experience across all of these touchpoints, bringing these tools together into one single web application. Having a combined navigation there is no need any more to switch between the core capabilities like Cloud Integration, Integration Advisor, or API Management. Furthermore, you now can directly develop cloud and hybrid integration scenarios across all the Integration Suite capabilities. Sounds interesting? Then check out the blog post ["SAP Integration Suite – Availability of a common & coherent User Interface to work with various cap...](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/10/sap-integration-suite-availability-of-a-common-coherent-user-interface-to-work-with-various-capabilities/) of shruthiarjun and enjoy the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02JUeYsBZEs&list=PLkzo92owKnVzjnJJZMrL0nyVU7kMPBSTy&index=36) video to learn more.

* Talking of user experience, we also took the chance to do a re-design in a specific area: Our API business hub enterprise, a component of API Management, has got a new UI as well as new features. The API business hub enterprise is the customer-owned central API catalog or developer portal for SAP as well as non-SAP API gateways. With an intuitive search, discovery, and consumption of APIs it helps to find exactly what you are looking for. Featuring of content, creating new navigation categories, as well as lot of further flexible customizations provides you now also more flexibility in interactions. Curious about the specifics of the update? Check out the blog post ["New Design for API Business Hub Enterprise/ Developer Portal"](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/08/new-design-for-api-business-hub-enterprise-developer-portal/) of kasturi.kabiraj and the [video](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_lvu6jhzb).

* In Q4 2022 SAP Integration Suite also received important innovations in the area of B2B integration. Our Integration Advisor capability provides you new content such as message definitions and codelist collections for frequently used B2B standards like ASC X12 and UN/EDIFACT. Based on those you can start building your own message implementation and mapping guidelines. The GS1 organization provides international standardized codelists of values allowed in a particular location. With the October release SAP Integration Advisor now offers GS1 global code lists relevant for the EDI domain and used in GS1 EDI messages. Find out more information in the blog post ["Integration Advisor – Now GS1 Global Codelists Library available"](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/20/integration-advisor-now-gs1-global-codelists-library-available/) of joerg.ackermann.Also, we provided a new powerful feature which helps you with advanced mapping scenarios. By adding a pre-transformation to the mapping guideline, you need to re-order the nodes of a source MIG first before the actual mapping takes place through the Integration Advisor. This is necessary if the mapped structures on source and target side are different in a way that line-based mapping between hierarchy levels are not sufficient. Feel free to have a look at the blo...
