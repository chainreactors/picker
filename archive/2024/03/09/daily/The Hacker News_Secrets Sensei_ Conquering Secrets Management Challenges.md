In the realm of cybersecurity, the stakes are sky-high, and at its core lies secrets management — the foundational pillar upon which your security infrastructure rests. We're all familiar with the routine: safeguarding those API keys, connection strings, and certificates is non-negotiable. However, let's dispense with the pleasantries; this isn't a simple 'set it and forget it' scenario. It's about guarding your secrets in an age where threats morph as swiftly as technology itself.

Lets shed some light on common practices that could spell disaster as well as the tools and strategies to confidently navigate and overcome these challenges. In simple words this is a first step guide for mastering secrets management across diverse terrains.

## Top 5 common secrets management mistakes

Alright, let's dive into some common secrets management mistakes that can trip up even the savviest of teams:

1. **Hard coding secrets in code repositories:** A classic mistake, hard coding secrets like API keys or passwords directly in code repositories is like leaving your house keys under the mat. It is convenient, and it is highly risky. Agile development environments are prone to this devastating mistake, as developers under time constraints might opt for convenience over security.
2. **Inadequate key rotation and revocation processes:** Static credentials face a growing risk of compromise as time progresses. Take, for example, a company employing unchanged encryption keys for prolonged periods without rotation; this can serve as a vulnerable gateway for attackers, particularly if these keys have been previously exposed in security incidents.
3. **On the flip side**, rotating keys too frequently also cause operational issues. If a key is rotated every time it is accessed, it becomes difficult for multiple applications to access the key at the same time. Only the first application would get access, and the next ones would fail. This is counterproductive. You need to find the right interval for secrets rotation.
4. **Storing secrets in public places or insecure locations:** Storing sensitive information like database passwords in configuration files that are publicly accessible, perhaps in a Docker image or a public code repository, invites trouble.
5. **Over-provisioning privileges for secrets:** Granting excessive privileges for secrets is similar to giving every employee a master key to the entire office. Employees with more access than needed could unintentionally or maliciously expose sensitive information, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.

## 3 Lesser-known pitfalls in secrets storage and management

Unfortunately, there are more…

1. **Improper secrets lifecycle management:** Often overlooked, the [lifecycle management of secrets](https://lp.entro.security/checklist-onboarding-to-offboarding) is one of the major pitfalls to avoid. It involves creating and using secrets and regularly updating and eventually retiring them. Poor lifecycle management can leave outdated or unused secrets lingering in the system, becoming easy targets for attackers. For example, if not properly retired, a long-forgotten API key from a decommissioned project can provide an unintentional backdoor into the company's system.
2. **Ignoring audit trails for secrets access:** Yet another nuanced yet consequential pitfall is the failure to recognize the significance of audit trails concerning secret access. Without a robust auditing mechanism in place, monitoring who accessed which secret and when becomes a daunting task. This oversight can impede the detection of unauthorized access to secrets. For example, the absence of audit trails might fail to alert us to unusual access patterns to sensitive secrets or to someone bulk downloading all secrets from the vault.
3. **Failure to encrypt Kubernetes secrets:** Let's understand why the lack of encryption is a matter of concern by seeing how secrets are created in the Kubernetes ecosystem. These secrets are often only base64 encoded by default, which is just a hash that can be simply reverted, a thin veil of security, far from robust encryption. This vulnerability opens the door to potential breaches if these secrets are accessed.

Encrypting secrets at rest enhances security, and Kubernetes allows for this through configurations like the EncryptionConfiguration object, which specifies key materials for encryption operations on a per-node basis.

## Remediations for Secrets Management Mistakes

A proactive and strategic approach is no longer optional in addressing secrets management mistakes. Here are some of the key strategies to effectively remedy the pitfalls discussed above and be a [guardian of your secrets](https://lp.entro.security/guardians-of-the-secrets):

* **Secrets Inventory:** It is imperative that you know the exact number of secrets within your systems, and where they exist. Most CISOs are unaware of this vital information and are therefore unprepared for a secrets attack.
* **Secrets classification and enrichment:** Not all secrets are created equal. While some safeguard highly confidential data, others protect more routine operational information. Security approaches must acknowledge this distinction when addressing attacks on secrets. Achieving this necessitates the creation of comprehensive metadata for each secret, detailing the resources it safeguards, its priority level, authorized access, and other pertinent details.
* **Implement robust ...
