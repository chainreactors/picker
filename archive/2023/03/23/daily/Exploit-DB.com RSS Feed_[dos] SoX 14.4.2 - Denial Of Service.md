# Exploit Title: SoX 14.4.2 - Denial Of Service
# Exploit Author: LiquidWorm

Vendor: Chris Bagwell
Product web page: http://sox.sourceforge.net
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX
Affected version: <=14.4.2

Summary: SoX (Sound eXchange) is the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
tools: it can convert sound files between many different file formats and
audio devices, and can apply many sound effects and transformations, as well
as doing basic analysis and providing input to more capable analysis and
plotting tools.

Desc: SoX suffers from a division by zero attack when handling WAV files,
resulting in denial of service vulnerability and possibly loss of data.

Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
           Microsoft Windows 10 Home

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
