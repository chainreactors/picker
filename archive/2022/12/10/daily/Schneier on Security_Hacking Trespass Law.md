## Hacking Trespass Law

This [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/26/business/hunting-wyoming-elk-mountain-access.html) talks about public land in the US that is completely surrounded by private land, which in some cases makes it inaccessible to the public. But there’s a hack:

> Some hunters have long believed, however, that the publicly owned parcels on Elk Mountain can be legally reached using a practice called corner-crossing.
>
> Corner-crossing can be visualized in terms of a checkerboard. Ever since the Westward Expansion, much of the Western United States has been divided into alternating squares of public and private land. Corner-crossers, like checker pieces, literally step from one public square to another in diagonal fashion, avoiding trespassing charges. The practice is neither legal nor illegal. Most states discourage it, but none ban it.

It’s an interesting ambiguity in the law: does checker trespass on white squares when it moves diagonally over black squares? But, of course, the legal battle isn’t really about that. It’s about the rights of property owners vs the rights of those who wish to walk on this otherwise-inaccessible public land.

This particular hack will be adjudicated in court. State court, I think, which means the answer might be different in different states. It’s not an example I discuss in my [new book](https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/), but it’s similar to many I do discuss. It’s the act of adjudicating hacks that allows systems to evolve.

I find it neat that in Britain the public paths take precedence over the private ownership and you are technically allowed to walk on all of them (not that the land owners don’t threaten the hikers).

Tom Scott had a video about it.

@ Bruce,

> “But, of course, the legal battle isn’t really about that. It’s about the rights of property owners vs the rights of those who wish to walk on this otherwise-inaccessible public land.”

Actually it’s just an artifact of a deeper problem.

For various ludicrous reasons, mainly to do with out and out violence by what we now know are abnormal or to be more blunt “mental defectives” we have “property laws”.

Where they originated from is hard to say because it goes back to when secrecy was a major survival skill[1], long before writing and even cave painting in Europe.

But we do know from other cultures where resources are not as such scarce that “ownership” is not an inate concept, nor for that matter is “social hierarchies”[1] both of which are symptoms of the desire by some for “Status, Power and Control”. All of which can be sumed up by “The King Game” that is underpined by “might is right” which in more modern times we call “A protection racket”.

The US has unfortunately become not just polarised but extream in it’s notions of “Might is Right” which kind of boils down to,

“You are, what you can steal and hold onto against others by force”.

It is the “Great American Dream” expressed more honestly.

Is it right? Or is it wrong?

Well actually it is neither it just is. Right or wrong are just oppinions based on points of view, which are usually biased by which side you are on.

So the “self entitled” will see the idea of “ownership” as sacrosanct others not, and some will see it as evil incarnate.

When you look at it evolution favours groups over individuals so favors social usage of resources.

The problems occure when resources become scarce, or are deliberately made scarce.

The history of “Water Wars” is fairly well known, and easy to look up. Less well known is the start around three hundred years ago of the “Energy Wars” that is still playing out but “Water Wars” are coming back into fashion as they always do. They are already happening in the US via legislation, but in some ways have already started turning violent via social unrest.

The point is that as demand rises, finite resources become scarce. They then become usefull tools of those who’s abberant mental makeup appears as thugish or self entitled. Basically those who see “status, power, control” and the ability to wilfully inflict harm on others as their right beyond question. And self justify by claiming the are both legally and morally right. Which the majority realy don’t believe when they have been on the receiving end of the capricious acts of the self entitled.

[1] You can “own” something in either of two basic ways,

1.1 Control information about it.
1.2 Control physical access to it.

If you keep knowledge of a resource secret than those unaware of it can not take it away from you. That is secrecy is an evolutionary advantage that long predates spoken and written language.

However once knowledge of a resource is known others will if it is scarce try to take advantage of it. Trying to protect a resource physically unlike secrecy requires the use of physical resources which is at best inefficient.

Whilst secrecy can be easy for an individual, it is less so for a group. Using physical control whilst difficult for individuals is easier for groups, especially tightly grouped groups where sharing of labour is easier. This builds via herd/tribe behaviour into a castle mentality around a secure store. Which in turn gives rise to a hierarchical social structure.

Legally (I couldn’t pass the article’s paywall):

This may be complicated by whether the public land is Federal or not, since the former could give the Federal government the right to restrict the rights of State-regulated private landowners part of whose land is needed for access.

If the private land ownership in the affected parcels includes ownership by the same respective owners of the air-space rights above the land, then trespass may still be occurring even without touching the land, and if the private parcels are laid out checkerboard-style then I don’t know how a walker can avoid touching private land. Jumping would still enter a private owner’s air-space. (If that’s not the law and jumping legally works, then I guess a hovercraft could easily avoid tresp...
