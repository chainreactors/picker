# Apple ID scam leads to $27,000 in-person theft of Ohio man

Posted: August 1, 2025

You’ve probably heard about people scamming from halfway around the world, but sometimes they turn up at your door.

That’s what happened in May, when 67 year-old Robert Wise of Ohio received a text telling him that his Apple ID had been compromised. It had been used at an Apple store for a $213 purchase, the text message said.

The scam text received by Robert Wise, as shown to 10 WBNS

After calling the number on the phone, a man identifying himself as John Cooper said that thieves had racked up a total of $27,000 in charges in his name. Unless Wise withdrew $27,000 from his account immediately, it would be drained, the man said.

As you’ve probably already guessed, there had been no $27,000 theft. At least, not yet. According to local news reports, the man at the other end of the line tried to get Wise to deposit the money into a [bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin) machine to send him the funds.

When Wise tried and failed to do that, the crook said he’d send someone to collect the money in person. This is where 42 year-old Liwei Zhang turned up at the victim’s door and Wise handed the money over.

All might have been well save for the thief’s greed. Zhang arranged to come back and collect more money from Wise, who by this time had finally grown suspicious and called the sheriff. The sheriff told Wise to keep the criminal engaged and they managed to catch the thief at the scene.

Zhang, a Chinese national who was in the country on a business visa, now faces charges of theft, [identity fraud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/identity-fraud) and telecommunications fraud. He told law enforcement officers that he was just a middleman, and “felt that he was doing this revolving criminal activity”.

This isn’t an isolated case. Last month, officers in Kentucky [arrested](https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/man-arrested-at-louisville-airport-in-300k-multi-state-scam-targeting-elderly-police-say/article_c61ec770-adef-4508-a321-d76a1ed0efe9.html) a Canadian citizen, Jia Hua Liu. Liu, who was in the US, had targeted multiple elderly victims with scams and then turned up at their homes to collect money. He had collected over $300,000 in total.

Last year, 21 year-old Tejaskumar Patel was [arrested](https://www.wpbf.com/article/chicago-man-arrest-scam-older-victims-gold-bars-warrants-florida/61456516) after collecting gold bars from a Florida resident. The victim, a retired marine, had been told he needed to pay to free himself from arrest warrants (which were fake). Officers only caught Patel after coming back for more gold, because the victim had called the police.

There are plenty of cases like these. Scamming this way is a reliable last resort for thieves because it will often be easier to collect cash personally from non-tech-savvy people rather than getting them to successfully make a bitcoin transaction.

However, the scammers also place themselves in great personal danger if a victim gets suspicious. Especially if they’re greedy enough to push their luck and come back ...
