## Friday Squid Blogging: Bobtail Squid

Nice [short article](https://a-z-animals.com/articles/this-tiny-squid-uses-camouflage-and-light-to-become-practically-invisible/) on the bobtail squid.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

“ We argue that there is no simple fix for these behaviors, but they are instead fundamental to how these models operate. Mitigation strategies, rather, must be implemented at various levels.”

Is this how AI might eliminate humanity?

=A research paper predicting that artificial intelligence will go rogue in 2027 and lead
to humanity’s extinction within a decade is making waves in the tech world.=

If they can stop criminals before they act then they do not have to worry about the difficulty of conviction. Conviction to deal with all those old case files in storage.

Not much intelligence.

During the Crimean War, British cavalrymen galloped straight into Russian cannon fire.

Looking at past military mistakes helps us see the dangers of flawed decision-making, reckless risk-taking, and poor strategic planning. We continue to live in a time in which history is ignored, facts seem like an inconvenience and there is a prevailing ideology – that one’s opinion is more important, regardless if you can back it up with facts or not.

The Supreme Court first allowed the president to fire independent agency officials.
Trump can now dismantle independent agencies and regulatory bodies without restraint.

The U.S. is now without qualified directors and experienced leaders in many senior roles.
The federal departments and agencies which protect the well-being of the public and the nation are headed by *noobs*. The people in these positions also make decisions that effect the lives of people outside the United States and have an important function in making decisions about information sharing and cooperation with partnering nations and military.

Political ignorance and the depletion of knowledge as a resource, is the new **Tragedy of the Social Commons**.

The politicization of complex subjects often presents a narrow view and over simplifies arguments during public discourse. As a result, the ability to identify matters of real public concern and engage in a broader discussion about them, has been weakened. This has very real consequences for our own understanding of important civic and moral concerns.

Without a deeper understanding – through our own actions – we put ourselves at greater risk of compromising not only our own well-being, but that of others and wider community itself.

@ResearcherZero that vpn article seems outright malicious. At that point, discussion becomes pointless and intelligence irrelevant, it’s not ‘ignored’ per se, just focused elsewhere. (Nothing for us to worry about)

This kills any remaining options of being able to challenge or discuss the changes suggested

@not important, all:

This is a link to the original paper about AI going rogue:

Other sites offer alternative endings to the scenario.

@Robin

ai-2027[dot]com is an interesting scifi thought experiment, but anybody who has read enough Aristotle, Locke, Kant, &c. must be wincing at the casual use of words like think, learn, reason, understand.

More concerning in a man-vs-machine scenario is the man-vs-man subplot overwhelming the main story. It would be interesting to compare a US -and- China version, rather than US -or- China.

=The Sinpung-dong missile base is located just 27 kilometers (about 17 miles) from the China border. It’s believed to store up to nine nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) as well as their mobile launchers, said the report by Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

The base sits in a narrow mountain valley, cut in half by a stream, and measures 22 square kilometers (about 5,436 acres) – bigger than New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Experts say that its location near the border lends a geographical advantage – countries like the United States might be wary of targeting it since any fallout could impact adjacent China.
