## Baggage Tag Scam

I just heard about [this](https://www.fodors.com/news/news/there-are-warnings-about-the-bag-tag-scam-but-is-it-really-a-scam):

> There’s a [travel scam warning](https://travelnoire.com/luggage-tag-scam) going around the internet right now: You should keep your baggage tags on your bags until you get home, then shred them, because scammers are using luggage tags to file fraudulent claims for missing baggage with the airline.

First, the scam is possible. I had a bag destroyed by baggage handlers on a recent flight, and all the information I needed to file a claim was on my luggage tag. I have no idea if I will successfully get any money from the airline, or what form it will be in, or how it will be tied to my name, but at least the first step is possible.

But…is it actually happening? No one knows. It feels like a kind of dumb way to make not a lot of money. The origin of this rumor seems to be [single Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1lqe76u/toss_your_bag_tags_at_home/).

And why should I care about this scam? No one is scamming me; it’s the airline being scammed. I suppose the airline might ding me for reporting a damage bag, but it seems like a very minor risk.

There is a receipt you get at check-in for the baggage. At least there was one at my last flight in Germany. The scammer will not in pesession of this receipt. Why do airlines not request this receipt?

As @MW mentions keep every receipt, and any other paper the airline and hotels gives you, until you get home and have been home for at least a few days. Then shred them.

Something I’ve found helpful in my travels is to put random duct tape on my bags.

There’s nothing a traveler can do to eliminate this risk. Holding onto both the luggage tag and the receipt will minimize your exposure, but all the information needed to make a claim is right there in public. One photograph trumps all of the shredding effort.

I also agree with the sentiment that this is the airline’s risk not the traveler’s risk. If the airline wants to mitigate it, then they’ll put another number on the receipt that’s not on the tag. That sounds like such low effort that it’s evidence that the airlines just don’t see this as a problem worth solving.

I have two Airtags in my Away bag. One easily found, one hidden under the lining. The stories of Airtag-tracked luggage can get quite weird. But yes, keep the receipt. Usually they stick it on the folder that has your boarding pass, another thing that I don’t discard until I’m home.

“From my own personal experience in currently dealing with this it is causing issue with reimbursing the real people if they submit a legitimate claim.” — I guess that’s the bit you’re supposed to care about.

@ Jaime L Smith, ALL,

You suggest two things with,

“… this is the airline’s risk not the traveler’s risk. If the airline wants to mitigate it…”

But you need to ask a follow question

If it is the airlines risk, do they carry liability?

At the moment bo they really don’t carry any liability that they can not shrug off.

Because as long as all airlines “do the same thing” it’s effectively “An Industry Standard”… Which even though it’s such a dubiously low standard it in effect is all you will get.

Because as @Bruce will find it’s effectively limited liability if no crime by the airline or their staff can be shown / acted upon.

I’m not sure what it is these days but back when I made a claim against British Airways for trashing my sail bag they tried claiming it was actually my fault before getting a snoty letter back from me via a friend who acted as a “legal representative” BA wrote back and pointed out that the limit was equivalent of $20, and I would have to “present a formal claim in person at the airport”.

Basically they had no intention of paying and were trying to run circles around me.

Their Chairman who’s address was fairly easily found got a “registered letter” which told him to be available at his home “to receive service” and that it would cost him transport + time + expenses and fees that would have to be paid…

They paid up, but only to the limit.

So a little investigation revealed the answer to your second point of the airline not mitigating it in any way.

It’s simple if they take any kind of extra mitigation, then they risk increasing their liability if it goes to court.

The argument is simply one of,

“Because they took extra mitigating action, they must have had a known reason for doing so…” Thus the “burden of proof” in what is a civil case gets thrown onto them. There is thus a very high probability they will fail and have to pay not just damages but depending on the jurisdiction a compensatory amount for legal representation.

For various reasons I’m now into my third decade of “not flying”, so things will have changed somewhat. I suspect not for the better of the traveler.

A piece of advice that used to be given was,

“Pay for everything by Credit Card”

Including all items such as electronics/gifts, clothes, and even cosmetics and toiletries (and in some places medications). Because in most cases the card provider covered such losses by an inclusive insurance policy.

BUT… Don’t claim on “travel insurance” as they just bounce it back to your “Household insurance” in some places.

It was why I switched to only carrying “hand luggage”. There was a trick back then in that hard-shell and similar bags were subject to not just size limits but weight limits as well… But “suit carriers” were treated the same way as coats, jumpers, and other weather protection. That is with few restrictions.

I used to get four sets of cloths and two pairs of “dress shoes” along with things like phone charger universal power socket and other stuff in the shoes. Leaving my “carry on bag” being my “tool kit and computer”.
