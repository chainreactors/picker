# To Blur Or Not To Blur: Exposing Finland’s Lakeside Neo-Nazi Meetup

July 11, 2024

A group of Finnish neo-Nazis and a few international friends have convened once again in Finland’s picturesque lake district for a secretive summertime festival.

Last month, a campground about three-hours drive north of Finland’s capital Helsinki played host to the third edition of what the organisers call the ‘White Boy Summer Fest’, named after an [internet meme](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/07/01/white-boy-summer-nazi-memes-and-the-mainstreaming-of-white-supremacist-violence/) co-opted by the international far right.

Bellingcat first [investigated](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/08/31/saunas-and-swastikas-finlands-summertime-neo-nazi-meet-up/) Finland’s ‘White Boy Summer Fest’ (WBS) in 2023. With the help of Bellingcat’s Global Authentication Project and [Discord](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/03/how-bellingcat-gets-15000-people-on-discord-to-talk-about-investigative-journalism/) community, we geolocated the 2022 and 2023 WBS festivals to two separate rural campgrounds in the Kanta-Häme region in the southern lake district of Finland.

Observers [warn](https://www.amadeu-antonio-stiftung.de/en/address-to-the-council-of-europe-far-right-violence-is-a-transnational-phenomenon-and-a-global-danger-94927/) that neo-Nazi groups use events like these to network, recruit, radicalize and raise money. “WBS is…an essential part of neo-Nazi networks in Finland,” Tommi Kotonen, a political scientist at the University of Jyväskylä and a specialist on Finland’s far right told Bellingcat.

The most recent WBS event took place as [worries grow](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn33m112kneo) about far-right extremism and violence in Finland. It was organised by Tulenväki, a Finnish far-right group, along with far-right combat sports group Veren Laki (‘Law of Blood’).

Despite what appear to be considerable efforts by organisers to hide the exact location  of WBS 2024 — including editing and re-uploading a promotional video to blur out background details — Bellingcat was still able to geolocate the event to an island [campground](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6c6qtrHq2LdbJ2oR6) approximately 150 kilometres away from the locations of WBS 2023 and 2022.

The organisers of WBS 2024 did not respond to Bellingcat’s requests for comment.

## “A Weekend Full of Music and Fighting”

Organisers publicly announced WBS 2024 months in advance. Without sharing an exact location, they indicated it would take place in the Pirkanmaa region of Finland, a sprawling area surrounding/near the country’s third-largest city, Tampere. The Finnish lake districts are a popular summer tourism destination thanks to the region’s numerous lakeside resorts, cabins and campgrounds.

Similar to its predecessors in 2022 and 2023, WBS 2024 featured musical performances by a number of neo-Nazi bands. One of these bands was previously known as the ‘Hammer House Band,’ a regular performer at a venue affiliated with the Finnish branch of the Hammerskins; The band is also scheduled to perform at a Finnish Hammerskins’ annual event in July 2024.

As Bellingcat has [previously](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/18/from-pittsburgh-to-budapest-hungary-to-play-host-to-another-far-right-extremist-meetup/) [written](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/07/28/our-songs-are-manifestos-why-music-matters-for-belgiums-far-right/), the Hammerskins are an international neo-Nazi network whose German branch was [banned](https://apnews.com/article/germany-far-right-ban-hammerskins-59de56a737ae5b43297b3070e4c12bc2) by authorities in September last year. Other performers at WBS 2024, which included bands from Finland and Estonia, have also  taken part in [international](https://taz.de/Neonazi-Netzwerk-um-Hammerskins/%215075543/) [concerts](https://web.archive.org/web/20240704130640/https%3A//t.me/HammerHouseFinland/131) and [events](https://www.endstation-rechts.de/news/flak-im-hohen-norden) organised by the Hammerskins. According to a 2023 [report](https://yle.fi/a/74-20040325) by Finland’s public broadcaster, police documents suggest five men [arrested](https://poliisi.fi/en/-/terrorist-offences-under-investigation-by-southwestern-finland-police) in 2021 over suspicion of planning terrorist attacks were significantly influenced by Crew 38 Finland, a Hammerskins-affiliated group, and met frequently with some of its members.

The Hammerskins also have [documented connections](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/11/16/from-pixels-to-punches-geolocating-a-neo-nazi-and-white-nationalist-combat-event-in-los-angeles/) to the international Active Club movement. Founded in 2021 by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo, the decentralised movement [focuses](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6t2tx_oOMk/?hl=en) on using fashion, fitness and fighting to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalising far-right ideas and preparing them for physical violence against perceived enemies.

Active Clubs have emerged as prominent actors in the far-right network with many popping up across Finland including Helsinki, where Finnish Hammerskins and an affiliated group Active Helsinki, have been geolocated**.**

Representatives of Active Clubs were out in full force at WBS 2024. After a Friday night of performances from several neo-Nazi bands, Saturday featured combat sports in a makeshift outdoor ring, during which some participants displayed flags of their local group. Active Club Estonia posted on Telegram about the event, stating in English that “Finnish and Estonian Active Clubs met up for a weekend full of music and fighting.”
