## Arresting IT Administrators

This is one way of ensuring that IT [keeps up with patches](https://apnews.com/article/iran-europe-middle-east-albania-tirana-39fce9b5fe112a43f8b35a533b6d29e8):

> Albanian prosecutors on Wednesday asked for the house arrest of five public employees they blame for not protecting the country from a cyberattack by alleged Iranian hackers.
>
> Prosecutors said the five IT officials of the public administration department had failed to check the security of the system and update it with the most recent antivirus software.

The next step would be to arrest managers at software companies for not releasing patches fast enough. And maybe programmers for writing buggy code. I don‚Äôt know where this line of thinking ends.

Improving the reliability of software requires time and money.

The threat of prosecution will incentivize managers to invest resources to increase the reliability of their products.

I understand why the software security industry would be against these prosecutions. More reliable software would reduce the size of their market and their profitability.

Maybe this line of thinking ends where negligence laws end, with the reasonable person doctrine.

Arrest the police for not preventing crime, problem solved.

When microcomputers first appeared, those of us working on ‚Äòreal‚Äô computers laughed at how buggy some of the applications were.

As application usage became pervasive, users learned a norm for software reliability, i.e., what a reasonable person would expect.

Applications may slowly become more reliable, simply because the volume of new/modified code decreases and existing mistakes are fixed.

In the meantime, we continue to live through interesting times.

The affects of negligence seem similar to previous industries like public utilities or bridges.

It would be nice if there were impetus for business people to act selflessly. We‚Äôve made a huge amount of tech under the current impetus.

I don‚Äôt know how Albania does it, but I‚Äôd love to see some real product liability laws for software in the US, which developers can‚Äôt skirt around by exploiting ambiguities in the Uniform Commercial Code

So the initial access point for the attack was a Microsoft SharePoint vuln that had a patch in Feb 2019?

And the Albanian system [was accessed](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/aa22-264a-iranian-cyber-actors-conduct-cyber-operations-against-the-government-of-albania.pdf) through this vuln two years later, around May 2021? Which was still another 14 months before the July 2022 ransomware and wiper attacks?

Hmm. I hope we get more reporting as to why this occurred.

If I understand the charges correctly the five government IT admins are being held under Albania‚Äôs [Criminal Code](https://www.warnathgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Albania_CC_1995_am2015_en.pdf), Article 248 (a short paragraph).

Josephine Wolff has a well-researched and thoughtful analysis of this event. We are starting to see more criminal consequences for cybersecurity administrators emerge in the public sphere. There are many good reasons to have an ongoing dialogue about these types of decisions.

There‚Äôs not enough info in the article for me to really decide on whether or not this is bad.

I agree with @jbmartin6, this could very well fall under negligence. If they hadn‚Äôt done anything for months, I can completely understand them being charged. If it‚Äôs they‚Äôre a few days or a week or two behind, not particularly reasonable to charge.

Responsibility starts at the top, not the people at the bottom. If security is inadequate, the top executives failed to fund the necessary functions. In almost any organization, particularly in a government bureaucracy, the people who do the work have little or no freedom of independent thought. When they point out a flaw, such as a security exposure, the usual response is, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have the budget to deal with that.‚Äù On the other hand, if you want someone to blame, the folks near the bottom of the totem pole have the least ability to object.
