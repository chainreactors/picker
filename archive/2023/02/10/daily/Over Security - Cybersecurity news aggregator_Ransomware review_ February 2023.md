## Ransomware review: February 2023

February 8, 2023

Threat Intelligence Team

*This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes’ ransomware specialist, who builds a monthly picture of ransomware activity by monitoring the information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web leak sites. This information represents victims who were successfully attacked but opted not to pay a ransom.*

LockBit started off the new year just as it ended the last one, topping the charts once again as January’s most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). The Hive ransomware group meanwhile found itself shut down by the FBI.

It’s not all old news for Lockbit, however: Last month the gang was seen using a new Conti-based encryptor named ‘LockBit Green’. This latest ransomware version, the third from the gang after LockBit Red and LockBit Black, shares 89% of its code with Conti v3 ransomware and has already been used to attack at least five victims.

Considering the success of LockBit Black, it’s unusual (and unclear) why the gang is offering a new variant. One possible explanation is that it wants to attract affiliates who are more comfortable using Conti-based ransomware, such as ex-Conti members. Expanding marketing operations, so to speak.

A post on the Dark Web by LockBit (translated from the original Russian) suggests the group is supplementing the ransomware (“lockers”) it already sells, rather than replacing it:

> I have repeatedly said that I want to collect as many top lockers as possible in one panel, who have well-known and good sources lying around, write – I will buy. I don’t care what the reviewers think and say. It is important for me to expand the arsenal in my wonderful panel. Each advert decides for himself what to work with or combines several lockers in an attack on one company if time permits. Agree, it would be nice if I had some other Petya Ransomware or something else epic in my panel?

Known ransomware attacks by industry sector in January 2023

While LockBit was plowing through the new year, however, there was nothing but radio silence from another notorious ransomware player: BlackBasta. Ever since we started tracking them in April 2022, BlackBasta’s high placement every month among the ranks of other ransomware groups has been more or less a foregone conclusion. Their absence of activity in January therefore bears mentioning.

Apparent inactivity by ransomware gangs is complicated by the fact that their Dark Web leak sites only show companies that didn’t pay a ransom, so an extremely successful month for them also looks like an inactive month. A month where nobody refused to pay would be hugely unusual though.

Having said that, the Black Basta News Tor site, where it publishes new victims, has been down for several weeks. We saw that it was reactivated on January 22, but the next day it went down again. The backend to the site used to contact the victims seems to be down as well.
