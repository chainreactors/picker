On December 19, 2022, SAP released the next version of the Supply Chain for Secondary Distribution add-on (S4SCSD 3.0, feature pack #1 – developed by SAP’s partner, Implico), including Secondary Distribution Management (SDM) and Retail Fuel Network Operations (RFNO).

The new release will mainly provide the following new functions:

* Ability to automate logistics processes for cross-industry bulk products

* Flexible processing of detailed payment information in point-of-sales data

* Partial deliveries with integrated dispatch management

* Monitoring of the carbon footprint of bulk transports with integrated dispatch management

This latest functionality illustrates the willingness of SAP and Implico to offer solutions that enable our customers to control the environmental impact of their logistics operations around fuel distribution. Hereafter is an overview of the new content that is now available in this domain.

The Integrated Dispatch Management module (IDM, part of SDM) has been extended so that CO2 emissions can be calculated based on the vehicle type, the engine type in the vehicle, and the distance driven for each replenishment order. It stores the CO2 equivalent of the emissions calculated from the trips for later use and an interface has been added to connect to emissions calculation APIs of external suppliers.

Master data have been enhanced to store additional information including vehicle type, engine type, and fuel consumption. A new user interface (UI) is available to display the CO2 equivalent and selected emission values for a vehicle on a selected trip, with detailed information on:

* CO2 equivalent for the trip

* Distance driven

* Fuel consumption

* Engine type

* Emission class and details

Fleet emissions monitoring is possible with a cockpit-style overview page that displays all emission data for a fleet on one page.

These functions will be further enhanced in the feature pack #2 – more details will be available soon. We are planning to develop enhancements in the areas of:

* Displaying emissions for a defined time and a selected segment of a truck fleet

* Comparing emissions between different vehicle types per distance driven

* Monitoring emission changes after replacing lower emission vehicles of a fleet

* Comparing calculated emission data vs actual data from vehicle on board units
