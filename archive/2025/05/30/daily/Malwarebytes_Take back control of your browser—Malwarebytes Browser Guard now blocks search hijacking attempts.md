# Take back control of your browser—Malwarebytes Browser Guard now blocks search hijacking attempts

Posted: May 29, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

Search hijacking, often referred to as [browser hijacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/browser-hijacker), occurs when cybercriminals modify users’ browser settings without their consent. This often results in users being redirected to potentially malicious websites, such as fake customer service offerings.

Search hijacking commonly happens through free downloads, bundled software, or fake browser extensions that pose as helpful tools.

These attacks can be very stealthy and often go unnoticed until the victim sees unexpected changes in their browsing activity.

Hijacking attacks may involve adding fraudulent toolbars, redirecting users to websites that steal [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), or installing [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) on victims’ devices, forcing them to pay a ransom to regain access.

Malwarebytes Browser Guard already protects your browser by blocking malicious websites, credit card skimmers, and trackers. Now, it will actively monitor your search results for unauthorized modifications and alert you to potential scams, providing an essential layer of additional protection.
