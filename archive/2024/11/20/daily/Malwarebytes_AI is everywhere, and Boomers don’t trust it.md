# AI is everywhere, and Boomers don’t trust it

Posted: November 19, 2024
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

[Artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) tools like [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security), Claude, Google Gemini, and Meta [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) represent a stronger threat to data privacy than the social media juggernauts that cemented themselves in the past two decades, according to new research on the sentiments of older individuals from Malwarebytes.

A combined 54% of people between the ages of 60 and 78 told Malwarebytes that they “agree” or “strongly agree” that ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools “are more of a threat than social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter/X, etc.) concerning personal data misuse.” And an even larger share of 82% said they “agree” or “strongly agree” that they are “concerned with the security and privacy of my personal data and those I interact with when using AI tools.”

The findings arrive at an important time for consumers, as AI developers increasingly integrate their tools into everyday online life—from Meta suggesting that users lean on AI to write direct messages on Instagram to Google forcing users by default to receive “Gemini” results for basic searches. With little choice in the matter, consumers are responding with robust pushback.

For this research, Malwarebytes conducted a pulse survey of its newsletter readers in October via the Alchemer Survey Platform. In total, 851 people across the globe responded. Malwarebytes then focused its analysis on survey participants who belong to the Baby Boomer generation.

Malwarebytes found that:

* 35% of Baby Boomers said they know “just the names” of some of the largest generative AI products, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI.

* 71% of Baby Boomers said they have “never used” any generative AI tools—a seeming impossibility as Google search results, by default, now provide “AI overviews” powered by the company’s Gemini product.

* Only 12% of Baby Boomers believe that “generative AI tools are good for society.”

* More than 80% of Baby Boomers said that they worry about generative AI tools both improperly accessing their data and misusing their [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

* While more than 50% of Baby Boomers said they would feel more secure in using generative AI tools if the companies behind them provided regular security audits, a full 23% were unmoved by proposals in transparency or government regulation.

## **Distrust, concern, and unfamiliarity with AI**

Since San Francisco-based AI developer OpenAI released ChatGPT two years ago to the public, “generative” artificial intelligence has spread into nearly every corner of online life.

Countless companies have integrated the technology into their customer support services with the help of AI-powered chatbots (which caused a problem for one California car dealer when its own AI chat [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot) promised to [sell a customer a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for just $1](https://futurism.com/the-byte/car-dealership-ai)). Emotional support and mental health providers have toyed with having their clients speak directly with AI chatbots when experiencing a c...
