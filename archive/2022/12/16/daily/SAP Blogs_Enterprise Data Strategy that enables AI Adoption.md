Whether or not you are involved in Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning (AI/ML) empowered workflows in your business, you most likely have heard AI is transforming the way businesses run today.

The IDC FutureScape 2022 report predicts that AI penetration in business will be 65% by 2024.  For example, European organizations are increasingly investing in AI and AI powered technologies and platforms to build on them AI models and algorithms.

You certainly don’t want to be left behind in this transformation.  However, if you haven’t started adopting AI, or you started the journey but are struggling to realize the value of AI, what should be your next move?

Should you

* hire some data scientist and count on them to get the job done?

* shop around to get the coolest AI tool and call yourself an intelligent enterprise?

* copy what your top competitor is doing because they have already adopted AI?

None of the above is the right next step.  What you need is a creating a framework that fits your unique business status, that is centered around your own business data, and that brings you a systematic solution so you can implement it.  We call this framework the Enterprise Data Strategy.

### **What is Enterprise Data Strategy?**

A successful Enterprise Data Strategy is shaped like a triangle, which includes

* Data Business Strategy

* Data Operational Strategy

* Data Technical Strategy

Figure 1. The data strategy triangle

**1.1 Data Business Strategy**

What is the business outcome are you looking for?  What are your business priorities in the next 6-12 months?  You may say “I want to increase revenue and reduce cost”.    Sure, this sounds like a universally true business goal, but to get down to the “How” part of the strategy, you need to be more specific.

The way to think about it is defining a specific goal for your business and come up with a North Star metric to evaluate your success.  (*You could break down one key metric into few proxy metrics.  Such a discussion is out of scope of this article*.)

For example, you are in the manufacturing industry.  You produce computers and computer accessories.  Your main business challenge (and goal) for the next 6-12 month is finding and maintaining a proper level of inventory, so that your storage cost is low enough and you also won’t have a shortage of inventory that slows down your sales.  For this goal, you want to use Days Sales of Inventory (DSI) as a key metric to evaluate how successful you are.   “I’d like to reduce my DSI from 60 days to 45 days in 6 months”.

Defining your business goal and knowing how to measure it is the first step.  You then need to think about do you have the right people, and if the people have the right skills to implement the strategy.

On the business side, you should have roles like business analysts, controllers, power consumers (decision makers) who analyze, review data insights, and even make decisions.  On the technology side, you may already have application developers and admins, but you also need to have data steward, data engineers, and data scientists who know how to manage, process data, and run AI/ML jobs to generate insights.   Different people touch different stages of your workflow, but it is their collaboration that makes your strategy successful.

**1.2 Data Operational Strategy**

What does your business process look like?  If you touch purchasing, logistics, manufacturing, and sales, you certainly have multiple processes running.  Each process may need some data as input and generate some other data as output.

Hence, it reflects your business’ operational model

* Which business process generates what kind of data?

* Are these data relevant to your business goal?

* Are there data compliance requirements that you need to meet?

* How is the quality of your data, and do you have relevant process to control them?

* Who owns vs who consumes the data at each state of our business process?

Your operational strategy serves your business goal in the way that it helps you define all kinds of requirements for the data along your business processes.

**1.3 Data Technical Strategy**

Now it is the technical enablement part.

Don’t rush into buying and setting up some systems and tools.  Build your IT landscape with a proper data architecture in the solution first

Some typical questions to answer for this dimension includes (and is not limited to),

* What data need to be collected (including third party data if applicable)?

* How do you collect the data?

* Where do you store the data?

* What is the end-to-end data flow across your IT landscape?

* What kind of transformation is need for your data to be prepared for AI/ML jobs?

* Based on your business goal, do you have certain scalability and pe...
