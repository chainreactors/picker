In episode seven of The AI Fix, Alexa goes wild, Mark learns how to hang a towel on a Peloton for only $39.90 a month, Graham puts the news items in the wrong order, and a strawberry uses the internet.

Graham explains to Mark what bats argue about, our hosts ponder whether AI should always write in Comic Sans, and Mark tells Graham why AIs are like dolphins that smoke pufferfish.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
