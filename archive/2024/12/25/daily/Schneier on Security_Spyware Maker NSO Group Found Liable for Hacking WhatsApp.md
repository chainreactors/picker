## Spyware Maker NSO Group Found Liable for Hacking WhatsApp

A judge has found that NSO Group, maker of the Pegasus spyware, has [violated](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/20/whatsapp-pegasus-spyware-nso-group-hacking) the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by hacking WhatsApp in order to spy on people using it.

Jon Penney and I [wrote](https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Platforms-Encryption-and-the-CFAA-1.pdf) a legal paper on the case.

But, but … our TOS says you’ll pink-swear that you’ll do no evil with our software that facilitates evil. We’re the *good* guys selling digital Sarin gas.

The kind of people and organizations that can afford to use Pegasus aren’t going to care one way or the other.

Since Pegasus is not based in the USA, this legal finding is not going to affect them in any way.

So a few lawyers get paid, and nothing else changes. Even the tinfoil hat brigade thinks this is a waste of time.

@ JohnnyS777, ALL,

With regards,

> “Since Pegasus is not based in the USA, this legal finding is not going to affect them in any way.”

I disagree, even though the finding is not what we would like, and NSO are not a US organisation you have to consider several things.

Firstly the US can and has acted against non US companies that have not acted in US Jurisdiction.

The reason is that the US especially the State Dept consider their writ to be global (something that will continue to come back and bite).

The thing is that the US is far from impartial in such matters and whilst the NSO might only get a Tsk, tsk, any company from a range of countries will get hammered as “a matter of policy”. We’ve seen this already happen in other commercial areas in Europe for instance.

But Secondly, consider weak as it is it has in effect “set president” and thus is if you like

“The first step on the journey”.

I should imagine that several people are “spitting teeth” over it because of this alone, and as TechDirt note it’s almost entirely down to NSO defying the court,

<https://www.techdirt.com/2024/12/23/federal-judge-says-nso-group-violated-cfaa-holds-it-liable-for-malware-delivered-via-whatsapps-servers/>

When monetary damages are decided, then NSO can decide not to pay up. However there is a resolution process that falls under the Inter State Resolution. Which means that the government of the country NSO are formally resident in falls liable. And if pushed the process can make it eye-wateringly expensive for the Government concerned and oh so much easier for other Companies to go for that source of money from then on.

The fact that many suspect NSO is in effect a cut out or front for the government concerned is likely to increase the pain point.

@Clive Robinson

It ain’t gonna happen here. Consider who the other state is, and the US general attitude to international dispute resolution, and who will be pushing the buttons in two weeks time.

More likely is that NSO will find they hav standing to appeal this to a higher court. Whether the Supremes will interpret CFAA the same as Judge Hamilton is an interesting question.

This case reminds me of those toothless “indictments” of Russian hackers that will never come to more than a press release and a half day of a news cycle.

Like the International Criminal Court “arrest warrants” for Putin, Netanyahu, *et al*, it’s all just pointless bureaucratic posturing.

@Clive Robinson, JohnnyS777, ALL

NSO is not the only company looking to land contracts in the U.S. and abroad.

Exploiting grievances for fun and profit…

The tech lobby also wants to remove corporate oversight.

@Clive Robinson

A good example of what you are talking about comes from a case involving the AIPAC group.

Espionage law can be interpreted narrowly to suit particular interests…

What kind of access does AIPAC have?

There are no independent governments. Corporations write our legislation. They dictate the terms, fund the candidates, all the while neglecting safety and procedure. If your house burns down because of a wildfire, it is often corporate cost-cutting that has lead up to the chain of events th...
