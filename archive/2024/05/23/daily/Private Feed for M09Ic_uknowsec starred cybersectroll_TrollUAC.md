# TrollUAC

* .NET library that serves as a boilerplate to bypass UAC x64 using uiAccess
* Any\* process with the uiAccess flag enabled can "Send Keystrokes" to high integrity processes even from medium integrity
* We steal the token of On Screen Keyboard (uiAccess enabled) to spawn a new process that does GUI automation
* The GUI automation simply sends keystrokes to taskmgr (auto elevate) to spawn our new desired process in high integrity
* \*Refer to tiraniddo's article for requirements, although they can easily be conjured up
