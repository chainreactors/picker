Malware Trends Overview Report: 2024

2024 has been an eventful year in the world of cybersecurity, with new trends emerging and malware families evolving at an alarming rate. Our analysis highlights the most prevalent malware families, types, and TTPs of the year, giving you a snapshot of the changing threat landscape.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Review-2024-1024x379.jpg)

This report is based on the analysis of 4,001,036 public sessions conducted by ANY.RUN’s community inside the [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_report_2024&utm_term=160125&utm_content=linktolanding) over the last 12 months, which is 1 million more than the 2,991,551 sessions [in 2023](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-2023/). Of these, 790,549 were tagged as malicious and 211,517 as suspicious, reflecting a rise in suspicious activity compared to the 148,124 suspicious sessions identified in 2023.

ANY.RUN identified an astonishing 1,872,273,168 IOCs in 2024—nearly three times more than the 640,158,713 IOCs uncovered in 2023. This sharp growth highlights not only the expanding use of the platform but also the [improved threat coverage and detection capabilities of ANY.RUN](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/annual-report-2024/).

## Top Malware Types in 2024

In 2024, Stealers dominated with 51,291 detections, marking a significant rise compared to 2023, when they were in second place with just 18,290 detections. This highlights their growing popularity among attackers for data theft.

Loaders moved to second place in 2024 with 28,754 detections, a slight increase from their leading position in 2023, where they accounted for 24,136 detections. Despite the shift, Loaders remain a critical component in delivering malware payloads.

RATs (Remote Access Trojans) maintained their third position but saw an increase from 17,431 detections in 2023 to 24,430 detections in 2024, reflecting their continued importance in providing attackers remote control over compromised systems.
