## My TedXBillings Talk

Over the summer, I gave a talk about AI and democracy at TedXBillings. The recording is [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqC4nb7fLpY).

Please share. I‚Äôm hoping for more than 200 views‚Ä¶.

Hi, just a little heads up: the formatting on the post is a little off and the link to the talk got messed up.
Nevertheless, you already have 290 views when I write this. Mission accomplished! üôÇ

I smiled when you mentioned law advice becoming cheaper. I cannot see lawyers lowering costs just because they are using AI. They will need to be sued, like the Realtors, for price-fixing, but you need a lawyer for that. üôÇ
