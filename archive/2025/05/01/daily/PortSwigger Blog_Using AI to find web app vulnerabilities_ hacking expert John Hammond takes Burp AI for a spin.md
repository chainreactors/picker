### 1000s of pentesters are currently using Burp AI features to hack smarter by eliminating tedious tasks and delivering instant insights, right inside Burp Suite.

### Security Researcher John Hammond took Burp AI for a test drive - and [his new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-McepNOrTQ) is the perfect way to see what the buzz is all about.

In [this walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-McepNOrTQ), John explores how Burp AI brings a new level of intelligence to web application testing. He demonstrates Burp AI's ability to identify subtle vulnerabilities automatically, dramatically reduce false positives, and supercharge security assessments without replacing the human tester.

## Watch John Hammond’s walkthrough
