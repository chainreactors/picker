Not another password change! Isn’t one (1) extra-long password enough? As a former Incident Response, Identity and Access Control, and Education and Awareness guru, I can attest that password security and complexity requirement discussions occur frequently during National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assessments. Access Control is typically a top finding in most organizations, with the newest misconception being, “NIST just told us we don’t have to change our passwords as often and we don’t need to use MFA or special characters!” This is almost as scary as telling people to put their Post-it notes under the keyboard so they’re not in plain sight.

In an article Titled, ["NIST-proposes-barring-some-of-the-most-nonsensical-password-rules"](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/nist-proposes-barring-some-of-the-most-nonsensical-password-rules/), it was stated that NIST’s “. . . document is nearly impossible to read all the way through and just as hard to understand fully.” This is leading some in the IT field to reconsider or even change password policies, complexities, and access control guidelines without understanding the full NIST methodology.

This blog post will provide an understanding of the context and complexities of the NIST password guidance in addition to helping better guide organizations in safe password implementation guidance and awareness. No one wants to fall victim to unintended security malpractice when it comes to access control.

## Understanding the NIST Password Guidance in Context

The buzz around the NIST password guidance is frustrating because everyone seems to zoom right down to the section with the password rules and ignore the rest of the guidelines. The password rules are part of a much larger set of digital identity guidelines, and adopting the password rules without considering their context is counterproductive and potentially dangerous.

The Scope and Applicability section of the new NIST guidelines, formally known as NIST Special Publication 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines ([NIST SP 800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html)), states “*These guidelines primarily focus on organizational services that interact with external users, such as residents accessing public benefits or private-sector partners accessing collaboration spaces.*” In plain English: the guidance in NIST SP 800-63 is not intended for internal users’ accounts or sensitive internal systems, and organizations implementing the password rules on their internal systems are misusing the guidance.

For organizations that are planning to use this guidance to secure their external-facing service accounts, NIS...
