## [FAQ: The tragedy of low-level exploitation](?id=791)

faq

Obligatory FAQ note: Sometimes I get asked questions, e.g. on my Discord/IRC, via e-mail, or during my livestreams. And sometimes I get asked the same question repeatedly. To save myself some time and be able to give the same answer instead of conflicting ones, I decided to write up selected answers in separate blog posts. Please remember that these answers aren't necessarily authoritative - they are limited by my experience, my knowledge, and my opinions on things. Do look in the comment section as well - a lot of smart people read my blog and might have a different, and likely better, answer to the same question. If you disagree or just have something to add - by all means, please do comment.

**Q: I love low-level exploitation and exploit development! How can I make this my whole career?**
A: So to not bury the lead, the problem is that **low-level exploitation is rarely needed in cybersecurity**, and jobs where one works mostly on low-level exploitation are few and far between. Furthermore, these jobs are even more rare if one wants to stay away from the gray area of hacking and away from the black market. It's more common for low-level exploitation to be a small occasional part of another role.

DISCLAIMER: The goal of this post is not to discourage anyone from pursuing a career in low-level hacking, nor do I think that it isn't an important area of cybersecurity. Rather than that, the goal is to give folks enough information to think things through and plan their approach instead of walking into this blindly.

Let's start with a bit of background...

## Background

While the start of the path of learning hacking / cybersecurity changes from time to time, sooner or later it leads folks to try low-level security. This commonly starts with a bit of reverse code engineering – the one on binary / assembly level – paired up with getting to know how to use a debugger and learning the CPU architecture, and leads down the path to learning low-level vulnerability classes and eventually their successful exploitation. While a simple 1988-style stack-based buffer overflow is easy to learn, things get more and more complex as one progresses closer and closer to the newest developments. This is due to the neverending arms race between defensive and offensive sides, that results in new mitigations, as well as the inevitable new methods to bypass them or shifts in approaches.

As such, low-level exploitation is currently one of the most technically complex and challenging areas of cybersecurity. And given the pleasure one feels after successfully making a code execution exploit in a complicated and constrained scenario, it's also immensely gratifying and fulfilling.

Understandably a question like "how do I make this my job" is an obvious one.

## Jobs in low-level exploitation

Let's start by stating something obvious, which I still believe must be stated (even though we don't like to hear it): companies prefer to pay for things which they believe are useful and/or beneficial for the company. Pursuing further this point, we can ask the question: how can low-level exploitation, exploit development, and low-level exploits be useful for a company? Let's go through these one by one.

### Hacking into things

Starting with the obvious – fully "weaponized" exploits used for their natural purpose, i.e. to hack into things.

So who actually "hacks into things"? We have a couple of groups (in order from less to more... *ethically complex* if you will):

* pentesters,
* internal security teams (e.g. red teams, but also application security teams),
* law enforcement,
* military,
* intelligence and espionage agencies,
* and cybercriminals (and I'll skip this, since this isn't a legit career in the sense I'm using).

Let's consider **pentesters** first. And we have to be honest here: in the great majority of pentests folks use off-the-shelf exploits, ideally integrated into metasploit or readily available on exploit-db.com. There is just no time during a pentest to spend on making highly complex low-level exploits that operate in modern heavily-mitigated environments, which also commonly are in the prolonged "exploit superposition" state of "it may or may not work - we'll see" – especially that these can take even a week or more to make and require a lot of skill and obscure knowledge. Unless this truly was the goal of the pentest (not likely), no reasonable pentesting client would like to pay for this, given that the alternative cost is NOT spending this time on reviewing other parts of inf...
