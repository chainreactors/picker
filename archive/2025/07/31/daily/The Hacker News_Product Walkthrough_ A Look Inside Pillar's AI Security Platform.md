In this article, we will provide a brief overview of [Pillar Security's platform](https://www.pillar.security/) to better understand how they are tackling AI security challenges.

Pillar Security is building a platform to cover the entire software development and deployment lifecycle with the goal of providing trust in AI systems. Using its holistic approach, the platform introduces new ways of detecting AI threats, beginning at pre-planning stages and going all the way through runtime. Along the way, users gain visibility into the security posture of their applications while enabling safe AI execution.

Pillar is uniquely suited to the challenges inherent in AI security. Co-founder and CEO Dor Sarig comes from a cyber-offensive background, having spent a decade leading security operations for governmental and enterprise organizations. In contrast, co-founder and CTO Ziv Karlinger spent over ten years developing defensive techniques, securing against financial cybercrime and securing supply chains. Together, their red team-blue team approach forms the foundation of Pillar Security and is instrumental in mitigating threats.

## The Philosophy Behind the Approach

Before diving into the platform, it's important to understand the underlying approach taken by Pillar. Rather than developing a siloed system where each piece of the platform focuses on a single area, Pillar offers a holistic approach. Each component within the platform enriches the next, creating a closed feedback loop that enables security to adapt to each unique use case.

The detections found in the posture management section of the platform are enriched by data detected in the discovery section. Likewise, adaptive guardrails that are utilized during runtime are built on insights from threat modeling and red teaming. This dynamic feedback loop ensures that live defenses are optimized as new vulnerabilities are discovered. This approach creates a powerful, holistic and contextual-based defense against threats to AI systems - from build to runtime.

## AI Workbench: Threat Modeling Where AI Begins

The Pillar Security platform begins at what they call the AI workbench. Before any code is written, this secure playground for threat modeling allows security teams to experiment with AI use cases and proactively map potential threats. This stage is crucial to ensure that organizations align their AI systems with corporate policies and regulatory demands.

Developers and security teams are guided through a structured threat modeling process, generating potential attack scenarios specific to the application use case. Risks are aligned with the application's business context, and the process is aligned with established frameworks such as STRIDE, ISO, MITRE ATLAS, OWASP Top Ten for LLMs, and [Pillar's own SAIL framework](https://www.pillar.security/sail). The goal is to build security and trust into the design from day one.

## AI Discovery: Real-Time Visibility into AI Assets

[AI sprawl](https://www.pillar.security/blog/what-is-ai-assets-sprawl-causes-risks-and-control-strategies) is a complex challenge for security and governance teams. They lack visibility into how and where AI is being used within their development and production environments.

Pillar takes a unique approach to AI security that goes beyond the CI/CD pipeline and the traditional SDLC. By integrating directly with code repositories, data platforms, AI/ML frameworks, IdPs and local environments, it can automatically find and catalog every AI asset within the organization. The platform displays a full inventory of AI apps, including models, tools, datasets, MCP servers, coding agents, meta prompts, and more. This visibility guides teams, helping form the foundation of the organizational security policy and enabling a clear understanding of the business use case, including what the application does and how the organization uses it.

## AI-SPM: Mapping and Managing AI Risk

After identifying all AI assets, Pillar is able to understand the security posture by analyzing each of the assets. During this stage, the platform's AI Security Posture Management (AI-SPM) conducts a robust static and dynamic analysis of all AI assets and their interconnections.

By analyzing the AI assets, Pillar creates visual representations of the identified Agentic systems, their components and their associated attack surfaces. Furthermore, it identifies supply chain, data poisoning and model/prompt/tool level risks. These insights, which appear within the platform, enable teams to prioritize threats, as it show exactly how a threat actor may move through the system.
