[**Payatu Bandits**](https://payatu.com/bandits/) played the HackTheBox Business CTF 2023 and secured **1st rank in India,** but overall, we secured 31st by the end of the tournament. It was an exciting and excellent learning experience as all the team members collaborated and brainstormed on the challenges. Here, I am presenting the write-up of two of the challenges of easy level from the cryptography category. The first challenge was about breaking the Advanced Encryption System (AES-CTR mode) symmetric cryptography, where the encryption key was reused, and the second challenge was related to code analysis and Merkle Tree (related to Blockchain). The first challenge was solved by my colleague Modassir, and I solved the second challenge.
