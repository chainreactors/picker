=Why settle for a regular robot when you can have a robot coyote? That‚Äôs the innovative question the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is answering as they roll out robot coyotes for airfield wildlife control. These cybernetic prairie predators are a creative solution to a very real problem.

Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits, and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the US Civil Air Administration once built a ‚Äúchicken gun‚Äù to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.

Traditional deterrents, like drones, dogs, falcons, and even gas-powered cannons, have been used for years. But wildlife adapts quickly, and these methods don‚Äôt always keep animals away for long.

The idea is simple: most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?

four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.

The robot coyotes have already been tested at several military airfields, including Naval Air Station Pensacola, Fort Campbell, and Naval Air Station Whiting Field. These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.

Future versions may include programmed routes, exclusion zones, and the ability to identify specific species. Imagine a robot coyote that can recognize a flock of geese and adjust its tactics on the fly.

The ERDC and USDA-NWRC are continuing to refine these robot coyotes for airfield wildlife control.

> New features are on the horizon, including onboard computers, artificial intelligence, cameras, and sensors. The aim is to create a robust system that can operate autonomously, navigate tough terrain, and adapt to changing conditions. These advances could revolutionize how airfields, and perhaps even commercial airports, manage wildlife hazards.=

Earlier this week I came across an interesting article which to me made little sense and decided to share it with a security expert in the hope they would confirm my scepticism, instead I got a short reply as below

Good.

This led me to believe that I was not communicating with the person I thought i was as most of us here know it is impossible for Signal to share this information with the any government due to the application technical implications.

@Ismar

Government officials themselves use Signal so it presents them with a conundrum.

‚Äòhttps://ia.acs.org.au/article/2025/australian-officials-grilled-over-signal-messaging-app-use.html

The Australian government can order companies to place a backdoor in products so that messages can be intercepted. This is a measure that if implemented, would allow collection and deciphering of encrypted messages. Not only *can* it be done, it *has* been done previously with other products that promised secure, private and encrypted communication.

Of course such a move would break the security of the app, meaning that none of the government officials messages would be secure either ‚Äì and anyone else using Signal.

People will die as a result. (Though the government has no responsibility to the public.)

In order to accomplish the task would require re-engineering the design so that a copy of encrypted messages could be collected by interception, or that eavesdropping was introduced to gain access to the application when it is in operation, again breaking the security.

Rather like they do in Russia or China, where the government mandates ubiquitous surveillance of populations regardless of not committing a crime, or a victim of it.

If spies were using Signal for instance, that is what surveillance is for. There are plenty of crimes that people can be arrested for, or suspicion of, which can be used by the police to make an arrest. The government has many capabilities it can already deploy.

The police unfortunately are risk adverse. They would much rather see members of the public harmed by violent foreign actors than approach the scary spies with their two little police legs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be shot at like you,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúTheir spies!‚Äù üëÆüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:( Then the police rattle off a bunch of excuses about why they can‚Äôt arrest them for public shootings, stabbings, kidnapping, attempted murder, threats of murder or physical harm, or murder.

No, no, no. They would rather have some kind of remote evidence gathering. Where they can avoid personal confrontation or avoid having to appear in person in court to give evidence.
