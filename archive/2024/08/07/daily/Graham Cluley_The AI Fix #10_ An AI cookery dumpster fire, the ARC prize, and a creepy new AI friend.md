In episode ten of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast, Graham attempts to say ‚Äúquinoa‚Äù, Mark draws a line in the amper-sand, ChatGPT becomes an expert in solar panels and bomb disposal, and our hosts watch a terrifying trailer for a creepy new AI friend.

Graham discovers that the world of AI cookery is a soggy, limey mess, and learns an unusual trick for making a great mojito, while Mark pits his co-host against the cleverest AI brains in the world.
