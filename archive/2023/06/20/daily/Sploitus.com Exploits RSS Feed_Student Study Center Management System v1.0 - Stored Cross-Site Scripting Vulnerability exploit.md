Vulnerability Description -

    The Student Study Center Management System V1.0, developed by PHPGurukul, is susceptible to a critical security vulnerability known as Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed by the application. The underlying issue lies in the system's failure to adequately sanitize and validate user-provided input within the "Admin Name" field on the Admin Profile page, thereby allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

Steps to Reproduce -

    The following steps demonstrate how to exploit the Stored XSS vulnerability in the Student Study Center Management System V1.0:

        1.  Visit the Student Study Center Management System V1.0 application by accessing the URL: http://localhost/student-study-center-MS-PHP/sscms/index.php.

        2.  Click on the "Admin" button to navigate to the admin login page.

        3.  Login to the Admin account using the default credentials.
                - Username: admin
                - Password: Test@123

        4.  Proceed to the Admin Profile page.

        5.  Within the "Admin Name" field, inject the following XSS payload, enclosed in brackets: {"><script>alert("XSS")</script>}.

        6.  Click on the "Submit" button.

        7.  Refresh the page, and the injected payload will be executed.

As a result of successful exploitation, the injected JavaScript code will be stored in the application's database. Subsequently, whenever another user accesses the affected page, the injected code will execute, triggering an alert displaying the text "XSS." This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized actions.
