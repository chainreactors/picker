# Securing ways to share workplace passwords

Sponsored Feature When the first computer system passwords were set in 1961, few people needed to carry personal credentials to get through daily life. Nowadays, login credentials are ubiquitous across nearly every application, software and web service.

The results of a poll conducted on behalf of the [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/national-pet-day-password-advice) published in April 2021 found that 27 percent of its respondents had at least four more password-protected accounts than they did 12 months before – with 6 percent reporting they had added more than 10 new accounts. This proliferation is one of the reasons why passwords have become a primary attack vector for cybercriminals. In fact, 81 percent of all data breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords.

Having to remember – or try to remember – a dozen or so regularly-used logins during the course of each working day is now a commonly-cited bane of 21st century life for both password holders and password administrators.

Despite the wealth of guidance when it comes to best-practice, passwords are often haphazardly set and stored. Personal and other passwords are shared incautiously between friends and family using insecure channels...
