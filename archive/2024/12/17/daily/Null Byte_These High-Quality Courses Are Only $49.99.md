Project managers â and those hoping to become one â should rejoice at this killer deal. [The Project Manager's Essential Certification Bundle Ft. Scrum, Agile & PMP](https://shop.null-byte.com/sales/the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle?utm_source=null-byte.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle&utm_term=scsf-440948&utm_content=a0x1P000004YZ3WQAW&scsonar=1) usually runs for $1,990 but is only $49.99 for a limited time.

The bundle features training on all the essential tools highly efficient program managers should know. This includes Scrum, Agile, and PMP.

Scrum is most common in software development, but it also lends itself well to professionals in the marketing world. As for Agile, it's supposed to help keep you self-organized and find the proper solutions to serve your customer. PMP, meanwhile, is considered the gold standard of project management certification; it's a formal certification, and the courses in this bundle can help you secure it.

[The Project Manager's Essential Certification Bundle Ft. Scrum, Agile & PMP](https://shop.null-byte.com/sales/the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle?utm_source=null-byte.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle&utm_term=scsf-440948&utm_content=a0x1P000004YZ3WQAW&scsonar=1) comes with ten courses that include over 700 lessons. The courses cover a lot of ground, from training for certification to more advanced techniques.

For instance, the first course is "Scrum Advanced: Software Development & Program Management," which should prepare you to lead even the most complicated projects. However, the bundle even covers some of those soft skills, such as improving your memory. "Super Memory Essentials: Develop A Perfect Memory" teaches you how to retain all the important knowledge we find ourselves forgetting. You can even learn how to memorize other languages and random information, such as Greek mythology. If you're going to be a successful project manager, you've got to keep your memory sharp.

This 97% discount is sure not to disappoint. [The Project Manager's Essential Certification Bundle Ft. Scrum, Agile & PMP](https://shop.null-byte.com/sales/the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle?utm_source=null-byte.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-2020-advanced-scrum-master-agile-pmp-certification-prep-bundle&utm_term=scsf-440948&utm_content=a0x1P000004YZ3WQAW&scsonar=1) offers benefits to all types of professionals. Those in the software development space will definitely walk away with some more tools, but these skills are important to all of us in this digital age.
