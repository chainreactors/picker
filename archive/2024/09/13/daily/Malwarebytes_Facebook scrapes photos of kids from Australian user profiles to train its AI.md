# Facebook scrapes photos of kids from Australian user profiles to train its AI

Posted: September 12, 2024

Facebook has [admitted](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-11/facebook-scraping-photos-data-no-opt-out/104336170) that it scrapes the public photos, posts and other data from the accounts of Australian adult users to train its [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) models. Unlike citizens of the European Union (EU), Australians are not offered an opt-out option to refuse consent.

At an inquiry as to whether the social media giant was hoovering up the data of all Australians in order to build its generative [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) tools, senator Tony Sheldon asked whether Meta (Facebook’s owner) had used Australian posts from as far back as 2007 to feed its AI products.

At first Meta’s global privacy director Melinda Claybaugh denied this but senator David Shoebridge challenged her claim.

> “The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007, unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private. That’s the reality, isn’t it?”

Claybaugh said yes, but she added that accounts of people under 18 were not scraped. However, when Senator Sheldon asked Claybaugh whether public photos of his children on his own account would be scraped, Claybaugh acknowledged they would.

When asked whether the company scraped data from previous years of users who were now adults, but were under 18 when they created their accounts, the question remained unanswered.

It is not new that [Meta uses public Facebook and Instagram posts to train its AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/meta-is-using-your-public-facebook-and-instagram-posts-to-train-its-ai), and Meta is not the only social media platform that does this. European privacy watchdogs accused X [of unlawfully using personal data of 60 million+ users to train its AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/08/x-accused-of-unlawfully-using-the-personal-data-of-more-than-60-million-users-to-train-its-ai) Grok as well.

In June, the EU’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) reached an [agreement with Meta](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/latest-news/dpcs-engagement-meta-ai) to pause its plans to train its large language model using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram across the EU. This decision followed intensive engagement between the DPC and Meta.

Australia recently revealed plans to [set a minimum age limit for children to use social media](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/10/tech/australia-minimum-age-limit-social-media/index.html), citing concerns around mental and physical health.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government would run an age verification trial before introducing age minimum laws for social media this year. The Prime Minister didn’t specify an age but said it would likely be between 14 and 16.

The reasoning behind the age limit had nothing to do with data scraping. He stated:

> “I want to see kids off their devices and onto the footy fields and the swimming pools and the tennis courts. … We want them to have real experiences with real people because we know that social medi...
