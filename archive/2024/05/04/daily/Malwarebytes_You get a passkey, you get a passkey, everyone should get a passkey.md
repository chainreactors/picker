# You get a passkey, you get a passkey, everyone should get a passkey

Posted: May 3, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Microsoft is rolling out [passkey](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/passkey) support for all consumer accounts.

Passkeys are a very secure replacement for passwords that can’t be cracked, guessed or phished, and let you log in easily, without having to type a password every time.

After enabling them in Windows 11 last year, Microsoft account owners can now generate passkeys across multiple platforms including Windows, [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus), and iOS. You can create passkeys for your Microsoft account, and you can choose your face, fingerprint, PIN, or a security key to secure it.

## How to set up a passkey

To create a passkey for your Microsoft account, follow these steps on the device where you’d like to create a passkey:

* [Sign in to your Microsoft account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2250685).
* Navigate to **Security**  > **Advanced Security Options**.

![Advanced security options for a Microsoft account](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/1_advanced_security_options.jpg)

* Click on **Get started**.
* Choose **Add a new way to sign in or verify**.

Note: Under certain circumstances, somewhere along the way you may end up in this screen which basically offers you the same choices in a prompt.

![Add a new way to sign in or verify](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/sign-in_methods.jpg)

* To create a passkey: Select **Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key**.
* Follow the instructions on your device.
* During this process, you can choose to save the passkey to different devices like your Android, iPad, or iPhone, or a hardware key.
* You’ll be presented with a [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code) to scan with the selected device.
* On the selected device you’ll be asked to authenticate.
* When the procedure is successful, you’ll be asked to provide a name for the passkey. A good choice is to use a name that gives away the location where you stored the passkey.

Where is you passkey saved? Give this passkey a name to easily manage it later.

* After confirming the name you’ll see this confirmation.

Passkey added. You can now use this passkey to sign in to your account.

### Removing a passkey

Should you have second thoughts and want to remove a passkey, follow these steps:

* Visit the **Advanced Security Options**.
* From the list under **Ways to prove who you are**, select the passkey you’d like to remove.
* Choose **Remove**.
