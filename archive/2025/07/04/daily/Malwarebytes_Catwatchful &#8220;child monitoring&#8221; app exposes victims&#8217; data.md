# Catwatchful “child monitoring” app exposes victims’ data

Posted: July 3, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

If an app markets itself as being for “child monitoring”, a customer might expect that their data and those of the person you’re monitoring is handled with the utmost care and respect. However, as we’ve seen many times before, stalkerware (which is what monitoring software is known as) apps have a tendency to be low quality and lack security.

[Stalkerware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware) refers to apps and other monitoring software that enable someone to secretly spy on another person’s private life via their mobile device or computer. Many stalkerware apps market themselves as parental monitoring tools, but they can be—and often are—used to stalk and spy on a person. Sadly, the most common users of stalkerware are domestic violence abusers, who load these programs onto their partner’s device without their knowledge.

To prove our point about lacking security, researcher Eric Daigle found that an [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) app called Catwatchful has exposed the data of thousands of its customers, along with its administrator.

Catwatchful claims it is “invisible and cannot be detected”, and uploads the victim’s photos, messages, and real-time location data to a dashboard for the person monitoring to see. It also can remotely tap into audio recorded by the phone’s microphone, as well as access both front and rear phone cameras.

Make no mistake, this is nasty stuff.

And now it turns out that the data hasn’t been stored securely. The exposed database, which the researcher shared with [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/), contained the phone data from 26,000 victims’ devices as well as the email addresses and plain text passwords of more than 62,000 customers.

Stalkerware apps continue to pose a serious threat to privacy and security. Over the past years, several cases have revealed how these apps not only violate victims’ privacy but also expose sensitive data due to poor security practices. Recent leaks revealed that apps like [Spyzie, Cocospy, and Spyic](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/millions-of-stalkerware-users-exposed-again) exposed millions of victims’ private information, including messages, photos, and locations. The attackers also obtained the email addresses of more than three million customers. Because the flaw was so easy to [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits), researchers kept the details under wraps to prevent further damage. After the breach, these apps disappeared from the internet, likely trying to avoid legal consequences rather than fixing security.

Another case involved [Spyhide](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/07/60000-androids-have-stalkerware-type-app-spyhide-installed), where a security researcher uncovered a decade of surveillance on tens of thousands of [Android devices](https://www.malwarebytes.com/android-antivirus). The app’s poorly secured backend let attackers access call logs, messages, and location data from tens of thousands of victims.

The infamous [mSpy monitoring app has suffered multiple leaks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/07/dangerous-monitoring-tool-mspy-suffers-data-breach-exposes-customer-det...
