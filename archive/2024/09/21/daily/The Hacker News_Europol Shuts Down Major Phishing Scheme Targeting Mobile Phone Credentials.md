[![Phishing Scheme](data:image/png;base64... "Phishing Scheme")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiiWSXUGkBUwrVRNJipRjjFUxqQpiLeEE9L_YrP-KXYciCIPFgtIDfL_azFN0g05gL4DLvBMFR5lKXuRG12_kbEIxtPQEDjIUsLr9B76Jm2EvYQYZIIk_CM8tqXlS2DsDEfjburMZk6L4qCuoSBI-XVqHwRs58ETJ20sbsPnTKElX9oLhHvmWa4rvImO2N/s790-rw-e365/cybercrime.png)

Law enforcement authorities have announced the takedown of an international criminal network that leveraged a phishing platform to unlock stolen or lost mobile phones.

The phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform, called iServer, is estimated to have claimed more than 483,000 victims globally, led by Chile (77,000), Colombia (70,000), Ecuador (42,000), Peru (41,500), Spain (30,000), and Argentina (29,000).

"The victims are mainly Spanish-speaking nationals from European, North American and South American countries," Europol [said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/criminal-phishing-network-resulting-in-over-480-000-victims-worldwide-busted-in-spain-and-latin-america) in a press statement.

The action, dubbed Operation Kaerb, involved the participation of law enforcement and judicial agencies from Spain, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

Pursuant to the [joint exercise](https://www.policia.es/_es/comunicacion_prensa_detalle.php?ID=16319) that took place between September 10 and 17, an Argentinian national responsible for developing and running the PhaaS service since 2018 has been arrested.

In total, the operation led to 17 arrests, 28 searches, and the seizure of 921 items, including mobile phones, electronic devices, vehicles, and weapons. As many as 1.2 million mobile phones are believed to have been unlocked to date.

"While iServer was essentially an automated phishing platform, its specific focus on harvesting credentials to unlock stolen phones set it apart from typical phishing-as-a-service offerings," Group-IB [said](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/operation-kaerb/).

iServer, per the Singapore-based company, offered a web interface that enabled low-skilled criminals, known as "unlockers," to siphon device passwords, user credentials from cloud-based mobile platforms, essentially permitting them to bypass Lost Mode and unlock the devices.

The criminal syndicate's administrator advertised the access to these unlockers, who, in turn, used iServer to not only perform phishing unlocks, but also to sell their offerings to other third-parties, such as phone thieves.

The unlockers are also responsible for sending bogus messages to phone theft victims that aim to gather data allowing access to those devices. This is accomplished by sending SMS texts that urge the recipients to locate their lost phone by clicking on a link.

This triggers a redirection chain that ultimately takes the victim to a landing page prompting them to enter their credentials, device passcode, and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, which are then abused to gain illicit access to the device, turn off Lost Mode, and unlink the device from the owner's account.

"iServer automates the creation and delivery of phishing pages that imitate popular cloud-based mobile platforms, featuring several unique implementations that enhance its effectiveness as a cybercrime tool," Group-IB said.

## Ghost Platform Goes Down in Global Action

The development comes as Europol and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed the dismantling of an encrypted communications network called Ghost ("[www.ghostchat[.]net](https://web.archive.org/web/20240918091211/https%3A//www.ghostchat.net/)") that facilitated serious and organized crime across the world.

The platform, which came included in a custom Android smartphone for about $1,590 for a six-month subscription, was used to conduct a wide range of illegal activities, such as trafficking, money laundering, and even acts of extreme violence. It's just the latest addition to a [list](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/feds-secretly-ran-fake-encrypted-chat.html) of [similar services](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/encrypted-messaging-app-exclu-used-by.html) like Phantom Secure, EncroChat, Sky ECC, and Exclu that have been shut down on similar grounds.

"The solution used three encryption standards and offered the option to send a message followed by a specific code which would result in the self-destruction of all messages on the target phone," Europol [said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/global-coalition-takes-down-new-criminal-communication-platform). "This allowed criminal networks to communicate securely, evade detection, counter forensic measures, and coordinate their illegal operations across borders."

Several thousand people are thought to have used the platform, with around 1,000 messages exchanged over the service every day prior to its disruption.
