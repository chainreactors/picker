[Craig Newmark Philanthropies](https://craignewmarkphilanthropies.org) will match up to $30,000 for your entire first year as a new monthly or annual EFF Sustaining Donor! Many thanks to Craig Newmark—founder of craigslist and a persistent supporter of digital freedom— for making this possible. This generous matching challenge bolsters celebrations for EFF's 34th anniversary on July 10 as well as EFF's ongoing summer membership drive: [be a member for as little as $20](https://eff.org/r.gks) and get rare gifts featuring [The Encryptids (*including a Bigfoot enamel pin!*)](https://www.eff.org/Encryptids).
