# How to Improve Patient Engagement with Secure Communications

October 29th, 2024

As people demand more personalized experiences from their healthcare companies and providers, patient engagement is increasingly emerging as a top priority. With increasing demands for digital-first interactions and more connected healthcare journeys from their patients and customers, healthcare organizations must evolve their communication strategies to meet these new expectations. In fact, more than ever, today’s healthcare patients and customer expect the same efficient and personalized experiences that they have with other businesses, including retail and financial services.

In this article, we explore two key strategies for improving patient and customer engagement: employing a multi-channel approach and personalization. We’ll show you how each concept improves your communication strategy, while ensuring HIPAA compliance at the same time.

### **The Growing Importance of Patient Engagement**

Today’s healthcare industry is undergoing significant changes – some might even call it outright disruption. With new and varied services like Telehealth, Remote Care, In-Home Care, Connected Care, Value-Based Care, and more, clear and targeted communication has never been more vital for effectively improving patient engagement and driving greater levels of participation in an individual’s healthcare journey.

Another key thing to bear in mind is that today’s patients and customers *already* *have* increasing expectations for convenient, personalized, and secure interactions with their healthcare providers. According to [a report from McKinsey & Company, over 70% of patients prioritize the ability to communicate](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare/our-insights/reimagining-healthcare-industry-service-operations-in-the-age-of-ai) with their healthcare providers, payers and suppliers through their preferred channels. However, these preferences vary significantly across age groups, highlighting the importance of a multi-channel communication strategy; let’s explore those preferences now.

**Patient Engagement Preferences by Age Group**

The chart below, compiled from recent research findings, highlights the varying communication channel preferences by age group, helping healthcare companies craft their engagement strategies accordingly:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Channel** | **Gen Z (18-25)** | **Millennials (26-40)** | **Baby Boomers (57-75)** |
| Phone | 10% | 35% | 55% |
| Email | 20% | 35% | 45% |
| Text | 40% | 45% | 15% |
| Patient Portals | 30% | 45% | 25% |
| Face-to-Face | 15% | 25% | 60% |

By understanding these differences, healthcare organizations can implement and continually refine multi-channel marketing strategies that cater to the unique preferences of each demographic group. Key takeaways include:

* **Baby Boomers** **(57 – 75 years old)** still prefer phone calls (55%) and face-to-face interactions (60%), though there is preference in email (45%) for certain types of communication, such as appointment reminders and post-care instructions.
* **Millennials** **(26 – 40 years old)** tend to favor asynchronous methods that fit into their busy schedules, i.e., phone, text, and email. This age group is tech-savvy, with half also using patient portals for managing their healthcare options.
* As digital natives, **Gen Z** patients lean heavily toward digital channels, with text messaging (40%) and patient portals (30%) as top choices. They, more than any other group, expect fast, responsive communication, which makes secure, real-time digital options essential.

Catering to patients’ communication channel preferences ensures they feel better heard and, as a result, more valued. This will result in them becoming more involved in their healthcare journey, leading to higher rates of satisfaction, being more receptive to new services or products, and, most importantly, better health outcomes.

### **Multi-Channel Communication: Meeting Patients Where They Are**

Healthcare providers, payers and suppliers need a multi-channel strategy, that incorporates email, text, patient portals, and phone calls to match the different communication preferences of their diverse patient and customer bases.

A single-channel, or siloed, approach is far less effective, as each demographic interacts with healthcare providers in unique ways. In light of this, offering communication options across multiple channels makes it easier to reach patients – and for them to participate in their healthcare journeys on their preferred terms.

**Benefits of multi-channel communication include:**

* **Increased Engagement:** Patients and customer are more likely to respond and engage through their preferred communication method, whether that’s by text, email, portal or over the phone.
* **Improved Satisfaction:** receiving timely, personalized updates makes patients feel more connected and satisfied with care.
* **Better Adherence to Care Plans:** patients who receive reminders or follow-ups through their preferred channels are more likely to adhere to care plans, attend appointments, and follow medical advice.
* **Upselling and Cross-Selling Opportunities**: when healthcare providers and suppliers connect with patients and customers over the channel of their choice they are more likely to reach their target audience and attract qualified prospects for new services and products, as well as upgrades to existing ones.

### **Take Personalization Further by Using PHI in Communications**

After unprecedented numbers of people were forced to adapt to digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, personalization is no longer optional or “a nice to have” – but an expectation among patients and customers. The healthcare industry is no exception to this with personalized communications greatly enhancing efficiency and driving favorable outcomes.

Securely harnessing protected health information (PHI) is critical to effective personalization across a broad range of use cases, including care management, marketing and preventative care. It’s important to appreciate, however, that personalization in healthcare engagement goes beyond merely addressing patients by their names; it includes tailoring messages, reminders, renewals, recommendations, and offers based on their medical history, treatment plans, personal characteristics (age, gender, etc.), and ongoing health needs.

**Examples of PHI-driven personalization include:**

* **Appointment Reminders:** personalized reminders based on the patient’s treatment plan can reduce no-show rates.
* **Post-Procedure Follow-Ups:** securely sending follow-up instructions and health updates specific to the patient’s condition leads to better adherence and recovery rates.
* **Targeted Preventative Care Campaigns:** using patient data to create campaigns around vaccinations, screenings, annual tests, or chronic disease management helps address individual health needs.
* **Marketing campaigns:** delivering targeted campaigns to highly segmented groups of patients and customers, e.g., offers for the latest in-home blood pressure monitor for patients suffering from hypertension.

However, using PHI in communications requires strict adherence to HIPAA regulations and a broad set of data security safeguards and best practices. LuxSci’s Secure Healthcare Communications Suite enables healthcare organizations to safely use PHI in digital communications, ensuring compliance for email, text, marketing and data collection forms, while providing all the required functionality for personalizing your communications to create the desired impact.
