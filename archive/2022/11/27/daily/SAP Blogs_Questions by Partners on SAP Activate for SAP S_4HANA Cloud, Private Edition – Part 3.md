In our continuous endeavor to serve our SAP Partner & internal ecosystem, we from RISE Expertise Services Team are glad to share an abstract from a third session in the form of Community Live on 17th November 2022. This session was intended to provide our partners and internals an opportunity to have an open mic session directly with our experts on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition. This session was targeted for all those business technology enthusiasts from our partners and internal ecosystem who are interested and looking forward to help our customers together in their journey of [Business Transformation using the RISE with SAP package](https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html?video=26e7f3d3-ca7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff&source=social-Global-small-business-by-sap-LINKEDIN_COMPANY-MarketingCampaign-SME_GeneralBusiness-unspecified-risewithsap-spr-4497748622&campaigncode=CRM-MM21-MIM-MM21SOC) based on SAP’s implementation methodology – [SAP Activate](https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/) for [SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition](https://www.sap.com/india/products/s4hana-erp/technical-information/private-cloud.html). This blog-post caters as a Question-Answer transcript of the session conducted for which the recordings can be found on the [Partner Edge portal](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2022/sep/e_oe_te_w_samf_27264.html) (needs PartnerEdge login).

As we all know by now, that **[RISE with SAP](https://www.sap.com/india/products/rise.html#packages)** provides a seamless and easy path for transforming an organization from traditional and legacy ERP systems to a modern, cloud based and an intelligent suite of softwares which caters for next generation business operations for an Intelligent & Sustainable Enterprise. The focus of this session being an open discussion between partners, internals and SAP experts on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition for **new implementations**, we were able to get insights on variety of questions from our partners. Our speakers were also able to provide clarifications on their doubts and questions during the 60 mins session. We also use this forum to look into the challenges which our partners and internals face and try to feed it back into our product teams in order to further fine-tune the gaps if relevant.

To cater questions on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition – we called in experts from various areas like SAP Activate, Solution Management, Project Excellence, Partner Solution Center and Partner Engagement and Experience Center. The below slide shows the speakers of the sessions

Speakers for the community live 3rd session

Also due to the vastness of the topics in implementing SAP S/4HANA Cloud – Private Edition, we decided to confine this session only on topics which revolve around SAP Activate for **new implementation** scenarios and not around system conversions, migrations and selective data transitions. To make the 60 mins most relevant on the topic of SAP Activate for our audience we chose the topics around project management, project methodology, fit-to-standard project delivery, phases, deliverables & concepts, cloud mindset, organizational change management, transformation, tools, enablement and adoption. The deep dive topics which require in-depth techno-functional expertise were not in the focus of this session and we might plan to bring such topics in the future for our community live session going forward. Hence the below slide shows the guardrails which we put into our session to provide a precursor to our audience.

Having provided the information about the community live session, now let’s see the actual questions which were asked live during the session to our experts and their answers to them. Before I move into transcribing the answers, ***please make a note that the answers are just opinions and viewpoints from our experts from their own experience and expertise and hold no official/legal obligation whatsoever on the part of company or individual.***

**Answer** -> In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition you have full fledged access to SPRO-IMG to decide either to start the configurations from the scratch or leverage the SAP Best Practices already established.
