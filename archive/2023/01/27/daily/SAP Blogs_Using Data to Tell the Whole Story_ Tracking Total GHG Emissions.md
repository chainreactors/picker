Imagine a river. The Nile. The Yangtze. The Ganges. The Rio Grande. Take your pick. Now, what if you had to map the course of one of these vital tributaries knowing only its depth, width, and velocity of current? What if you had to plot the exact location of the river’s source and mouth based solely on the type of material making up the riverbed?

Like this perplexing introduction, for many businesses seeing the big picture of their total greenhouse gas emissions can be complicated. In addition, the [Greenhouse Gas Protocol](http://ghgprotocol.org) defines separate standards for product and corporate greenhouse gas reporting.

In this blog, we will examine the different standards of GHG protocols (corporate and product based) and how their relationship to one another is critical to assessing total emissions and achieving all carbon-related impact reporting requirements.

#### **Upstream or Downstream, Direct or Indirect**

Let’s begin with the [GHG Corporate Protocol](https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard). The GHG Corporate protocol mainly focuses on value chain emissions on a corporate level. This includes Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions, controlled by the company), Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from energy-related purchases), and Scope 3 emissions (other indirect emissions from across the entire end-to-end value chain). [Scope 3](https://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard) emissions can occur from upstream sources like purchased products, inbound transportation, and business travel, or downstream sources like the use of products, investment-related emissions, and leased-asset-related emissions.

**Product Standard**

The product lifecycle accounting and reporting standard (short Product Standard) (<https://ghgprotocol.org/product-standard>) defines a method for reporting the emission of individual products. Although companies might not be required to calculate emission data for individual products, corporate partnerships and the end consumers are now requiring this information in a growing demand for more transparency and sustainable best practices. In addition, new regulations, like the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism ( [CBAM](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/green-taxation-0/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en) ), imposing a tax on imports based on the greenhouse gases emitted in making them, will require companies to report product-specific emission data.

**A Bridge of Data**

Whether it is direct or indirect, corporate or product-specific emissions, these standards are not independent of one another. In fact, through data, their connection becomes closely interwoven. For example, Corporate Scope 3 reporting for purchased products requires the collection of emission data of the materials used to manufacture a finished product. This information could come directly from suppliers as a primary source or be estimated by using LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) databases. In any case, the data will be used for corporate Scope 3 reporting as well as provide input for calculating the carbon footprint of a finished product through its bill of material and manufacturing cycle. Other Scope 3 categories, like business travel or investments, are relevant only from a corporate level, but not on a product level (so-called non-attributable categories).

**Improve Competitiveness, Reduce Financial Liability**

The GHG Protocol’s Product Standard defines five life cycle stages: material acquisition and pre-processing, production, distribution and storage, product use, and product end-of-life. Any reporting entity should specify its processes along these stages and report the product-related footprint for each of the stages.

**Calculating the product-related carbon footprint allows a company to identify the main sources of the product’s carbon footprint and take action to reduce the footprint by switching materials, changing suppliers, or finding alternative manufacturing locations.**

Taking actions like these will improve the competitiveness of their products and ultimately, in the case of the carbon border tax, reduce financial liabilities.

 **Toothpaste**

When calculating the carbon footprint of a finished product, in addition to other contributing factors like transportation or direct emissions, the two main contributing variables are the ingredients and the manufacturing activities required to build the product. Let us take toothpaste as an example.

A toothpaste manufacturer would use a recipe or Bill of Material (BOM) describing all the raw materials (e.g., water, humectants, preservatives, flavorings) included in the product as well as their quantity ratios. Having the carbon emissions equivalents (CO2e) for each of the ingredients, as well as the quantities used, will allow for the calculation of the raw material-related part of the toothpaste's carbon footprint. From a corporate GHG reporting perspective (in this case purchased products, Scope 3 Category 1), the exact composition of the toothpaste is not relevant. Here only the footprint associated with the overall quantity of purchased products per pe...
