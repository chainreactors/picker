# WhatsApp fixes vulnerability used in zero-click attacks

Posted: September 1, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

WhatsApp [says it has issued an update](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/advisories/2025) to patch a vulnerability that has been used in conjunction with an [Apple vulnerability](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/all-apple-users-should-update-after-company-patches-zero-day-vulnerability-in-all-platforms) to target specific users and compromise their devices.

[Reportedly](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/29/whatsapp-fixes-zero-click-bug-used-to-hack-apple-users-with-spyware), attackers used this exploit against dozens of WhatsApp users, and WhatsApp has notified those affected:

![First part of notification sent to attacked WhatsApp users](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/notification1.jpg?w=1024)
> “Our investigation indicates that a malicious message may have been sent to you through WhatsApp and combined with other vulnerabilities in your device’s operating system to compromise your device and the data it contains, including messages.
>
> While we don’t know with certainty that your device has been compromised, we wanted to let you know out of an abundance of caution so you can take steps to secure your device and information.”

WhatsApp advised the affected users to perform a full factory reset of their phone in order to make sure they are rid of the malware.

> “We’ve made changes to prevent this specific attack from occurring through WhatsApp. However, your device’s operating system could remain compromised by the malware or targeted in other ways.
>
> To best protect yourself, we recommend a full device factory reset. We also strongly urge you to keep your devices updated to the latest version of the operating system, and ensure that your WhatsApp app is up to date.”

According to the [Amnesty International Security Lab](https://x.com/DonnchaC/status/1961444710620303653), the vulnerability was part of a zero-click attack against both iPhone and Android users. A zero-click attack is a type of attack which allows the cybercriminals to break into devices or apps without the victim needing to click, tap, or respond to anything. Unlike classic scams that rely on tricking someone into clicking a sketchy link, zero-click threats can land on a device simply because an app receives a message or notification crafted to exploit a hidden flaw.

## Technical details

The zero-click attack required two vulnerabilities.

For iOS and Mac users these vulnerabilities were tracked as [CVE-2025-43300](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-43300) and lie in the Image I/O framework, the part of macOS and iOS that an app needs to open or save a picture. The problem came from an out-of-bounds write. Apple stepped in and tightened the rules with better bounds checking, closing off the hole so attackers can no longer use it.

An out-of-bounds write vulnerability means that the attacker can manipulate parts of the device’s memory that should be out of their reach. Such a flaw in a program allows it to read or write outside the bounds the program sets, enabling attackers to manipulate other parts of the memory all...
