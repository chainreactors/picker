[![Facebook Ad Accounts](data:image/png;base64... "Facebook Ad Accounts")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjVTV8HrsjCYmK_dOhYib2ExXpEXmnBUbveLeinJTK9SybetOwRVTgvIstIVqCeEHFdns9VgBv7_IE1Sk3Pqr12SogecPKLC_nrweoeWUBNmxAaC3RslZkHoJzH5-yDTdP2WiNGKgZNQL6x22VymELAAEHoagzpfxIFOkePU-rku7CgwvSrXL75dYGs3lnA/s790-rw-e365/facebook.png)

Threat hunters are warning about an updated version of the Python-based **NodeStealer** that's now equipped to extract more information from victims' Facebook Ads Manager accounts and harvest credit card data stored in web browsers.

"They collect budget details of Facebook Ads Manager accounts of their victims, which might be a gateway for Facebook malvertisement," Netskope Threat Labs researcher Jan Michael Alcantara [said](https://www.netskope.com/blog/python-nodestealer-targets-facebook-ads-manager-with-new-techniques) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"New techniques used by NodeStealer include using [Windows Restart Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rstmgr/about-restart-manager) to unlock browser database files, adding junk code, and using a batch script to dynamically generate and execute the Python script."

[NodeStealer](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/nodestealer-malware-hijacking-facebook.html), first publicly documented by Meta in May 2023, started off as JavaScript malware before evolving into a Python stealer capable of gathering data related to Facebook accounts in order to facilitate their takeover.

It's assessed to be developed by Vietnamese threat actors, who have a history of [leveraging various malware families](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/vietnamese-hacker-group-deploys-new-pxa.html) that are centered around hijacking Facebook advertising and business accounts to fuel other malicious activities.

The latest analysis from Netskope shows that NodeStealer artifacts have begun to target Facebook Ads Manager accounts that are used to manage ad campaigns across Facebook and Instagram, in addition to striking Facebook Business accounts.

In doing so, it's suspected that the intention of the attackers is not just to take control of Facebook accounts, but to also weaponize them for [use in malvertising campaigns](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/malvertising-campaign-hijacks-facebook.html) that further propagate the malware under the guise of popular software or games.

"We recently found several Python NodeStealer samples that collect budget details of the account using Facebook Graph API," Michael Alcantara explained. "The samples initially generate an access token by logging into adsmanager.facebook[.]com using cookies collected on the victim's machine."

Aside from collecting the tokens and business-related information tied to those accounts, the malware includes a check that's explicitly designed to avoid infecting machines located in Vietnam as a way to evade law enforcement actions, further solidifying its origins.

On top of that, certain NodeStealer samples have been found to use the legitimate Windows Restart Manager program to unlock SQLite database files that are possibly being used by other processes. This is done so in an attempt to siphon credit card data from various web browsers.

Data exfiltration is achieved using Telegram, underscoring that the messaging platform still continues to be a [crucial vector for cybercriminals](https://cyberint.com/blog/research/telegram-changes-shake-cyber-criminals/) despite [recent changes](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/telegram-agrees-to-share-user-data-with.html) to its policy.

Malvertising via Facebook is a lucrative infection pathway, often impersonating trusted brands to disseminate all kinds of malware. This is evidenced by the emergence of a new campaign starting November 3, 2024, that has mimicked the Bitwarden password manager software through Facebook sponsored ads to install a rogue Google Chrome extension.

"The malware gathers personal data and targets Facebook business accounts, potentially leading to financial losses for individuals and businesses," Bitdefender [said](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/labs/inside-bitdefender-labs-investigation-of-a-malicious-facebook-ad-campaign-targeting-bitwarden-users) in a report published Monday. "Once again, this campaign highlights how threat actors exploit trusted platforms like Facebook to lure users into compromising their own security."

## Phishing Emails Distribute I2Parcae RAT via ClickFix Technique

The development comes as Cofense has alerted to new phishing campaigns that employ website contact forms and invoice-themed lures to deliver malware families like I2Parcae RAT and [PythonRatLoader](https://cofense.com/blog/pythonratloader-the-proprietor-of-xworm-and-friends), respectively, with the latter acting as a conduit to deploy AsyncRAT, DCRat, and Venom RAT.

I2Parcae is "notable for having several unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), such as Secure Email Gateway (SEG) evasion by p...
