A pro-Russian hacktivist group going by the name of **NoName057(16)** has carried out DDOS attacks against Ukrainian entities, NATO countries, and anyone who they deem as "anti-Russian."

The group emerged in March 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and according to early reports, they appear to have created a custom botnet named [Bobik](https://decoded.avast.io/martinchlumecky/bobik/) to launch their DDOS attacks.

Its initial DDOS activity was hit-and-miss and typically went under the radar, but NoName got more attention last fall after they launched DDosia, a project through which they offered to pay volunteers to download their DDosia app and participate in DDOS attacks against their targets.

Throughout the past year, the group has targeted countries and private companies that showed any kind of public support for Ukraine and its fight against Russia's invasion.

For example, the group targeted Finnish government websites shortly after the country announced its intention to join NATO and Lithuanian railways shortly after they blocked Russian goods transiting to Russia's Kaliningrad exclave.

Other targets included Ukrainian newspapers and schools, and entities across Norway, Estonia, and Poland.

According to reports published this week by [Avast](https://decoded.avast.io/martinchlumecky/ddosia-project/) and [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/), their more recent attacks targeted the [websites of the Polish government](https://www.gov.pl/web/special-services/russian-cyberattacks) in late December last year, [Danish banks](https://avisendanmark.dk/erhverv/seks-banker-har-mistet-kontakten-med-kunderne) earlier this week, and the websites of 2023 Czech presidential election candidates, attacks that are still ongoing.

NoName057(16) joins the ranks of KillNet and XakNet as one of today's most active pro-Russian hacktivists groups, although its classification as a "hacktivist group" remains in question, especially after previous reports have drawn connections between KillNet and XakNet activity and past Russia's intelligence services.

Currently, the group continues to orchestrate new attacks via their Telegram channel after being kicked off GitHub in mid-December.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Royal Mail cyber incident:** The Royal Mail postal and courier service halted international shipping services on Wednesday following a severe IT disruption that the company says was caused by a "[cyber incident](https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12556)." No details were provided about the nature of the attack, and Royal Mail has asked customers to stop sending letters and parcels to overseas destinations until it resolves the issue. Internal UK shipping was not affected, the company said.

**Twitter denies breach:** After almost three weeks of radio silence, Twitter has finally addressed rumors of two recent data breaches. The company says that claims that threat actors had collected details of [400 million users](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alon-gal-utb_data-gdpr-database-activity-7012389466937913344-zpMO/) and then leaked details for [235 million](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alon-gal-utb_twitter-database-breach-activity-7016314513406726145-15kV/) did not live up to reality and that they found "no evidence" that the information being sold and leaked online was the result of threat actors exploiting its systems. Instead, Twitter says the data is "likely a collection of data already publicly available online through different sources" and not something that originated from its own systems. HudsonRock researcher Alon Gal, who discovered both breaches, [responded](https://mastodon.social/%40underthebreach%40infosec.exchange/109675951221063074) to Twitter's statement claiming they stand by their assessment that the leaked data contained non-public information.

**Japan insurance companies leak:** A threat actor has breached a US company that provides IT services for two Japanese insurance providers and has stolen the personal details of more than two million Japanese citizens. The incident was discovered earlier this week after the threat actor posted the stolen data online. According to [Japanese](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGKKZO67463530Q3A110C2EE9000/) [media](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20230110-OYT1T50202/), affected insurance companies include Aflac and Zurich. Aflac says the information of 1.32 million cancer insurance policyholders was stolen, while Zurich says more than 750,000 automobile insurance policyholders had their data leaked online.

**SweepWizard leak:** SweepWizard, an app used by US law enforcement to coordinate multi-agency raids, exposed the exact location of upcoming raids along with sensitive details about both suspects and police officers alike. According to tech news outlet *[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/sweepwizard-police-raids-data-exposure/)*, data on 200 raids, 5,700 suspects, and hundreds of police officers, mainly from California, leaked via the app. Since the leak, ODIN, the company behind SweepWizard, has taken down the app's website and iOS and Android store listings.

> "[Ken Munro](https://www.pentestpartners.com/consultant/ken-munro/), an ethical hacker and founder of the UK-based security research firm Pen Test Partners, says that based on how we described being able to access SweepWizard data, the error was likely caused by a simple authorization oversight. While SweepWizard was taken down before he had a chance to examine the app, Munro says that, typically, when an individual logs in to a website or app, they are assigned an access token that gets checked by the app every time their device requests data from it. According to Munro, SweepWizard was likely not checking each request for these access tokens and was simply providing data to any device that asked."
