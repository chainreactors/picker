# Titles: Sandbox Escape in Microsoft Edge Renderer Process (Mojo IPC)
# Author: nu11secur1ty
# Date: 08/07/2025
# Vendor: Microsoft
# Software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11
# Reference: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49730
# CVE-2025-2783
## Description
This project contains a \*\*proof-of-concept (PoC)\*\* simulation for \*\*CVE-2025-2783\*\*, a sandbox escape and privilege escalation vulnerability affecting the Microsoft Mojo IPC subsystem on Windows 11 Pro.
The simulation demonstrates how a malicious renderer process could exploit a crafted IPC message to escape sandbox restrictions and escalate privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
---
## Disclaimer
\*\*This code is provided for educational and responsible disclosure purposes only.\*\*
Do NOT use it for unauthorized testing or attacks on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
The author(s) created this simulation in a controlled environment (virtual machine) to safely demonstrate the vulnerability before reporting it to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).
---
## Components
- `kur.py`: The main PoC Python script.
It can run as either:
- A phishing server hosting a malicious payload file
- An exploit client that downloads the payload, simulates IPC communication, and triggers the sandbox escape.
- `malicious\_input.mojopipe`: The generated malicious payload JSON file (created at runtime).
- `incident.log`: Log file recording actions and simulated system information captured during exploitation.
---
## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later on Windows 11 Pro (preferably in a VM for safety).
- Administrator privileges recommended for full information output.
### Steps
1. \*\*Start the phishing server\*\* (in one terminal):
```bash
python kur.py
```
Enter choice: `1`
This hosts the malicious payload file on `http://<your\_ip>:8080/`.
2. \*\*Run the exploit client\*\* (in another terminal on the same machine):
```bash
python kur.py
```
Enter choice: `2`
This downloads the payload, simulates the IPC communication, and attempts sandbox escape.
3. \*\*Observe logs\*\* in `incident.log` and console output for evidence of the simulated exploit.
---
## Technical Details
- The PoC simulates Mojo IPC message passing using Python's `multiprocessing.connection` module.
- The exploit payload contains a special handle value that triggers the sandbox escape simulation.
- When triggered, the PoC logs user and system info to demonstrate privilege escalation.
- The phishing server serves the malicious payload to mimic real-world attack vector.
---
## Responsible Disclosure
This simulation was developed to responsibly disclose the vulnerability to Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). Please coordinate with MSRC before any public release or use.
