# Pro-Israel hacktivist group claims responsibility for alleged Iranian bank hack

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

10:29 AM PDT · June 17, 2025

The pro-Israeli hacktivist group Predatory Sparrow claimed on Tuesday to have hacked and taken down Iran’s Bank Sepah.

The group, which is also known by its Persian name Gonjeshke Darande, [claimed responsibility for the hack on X](http://x.com/GonjeshkeDarand/status/1934883811327705166).

“We, ‘Gonjeshke Darande,’ conducted cyberattacks which destroyed the data of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ ‘Bank Sepah,’” the group wrote.

The group claimed Bank Sepah is an institution that “circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance the regime’s terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program and its military nuclear program.”

According to the independent news site [Iran International](http://iranintl.com/en/202506176243), there are reports of “widespread banking disruptions” across the country. Iran International said several Bank Sepah branches were closed on Tuesday, and customers told the publication that they were unable to access their accounts.

Ariel Oseran, a correspondent for i24NEWS, [posted pictures](https://x.com/ariel_oseran/status/1934912682076901501/photo/1) of ATMs in Iran displaying an error message.

TechCrunch could not independently verify the group’s alleged cyberattack. We reached out to two Bank Sepah Iranian email addresses, but the messages returned an error. Bank Sepah’s affiliates in the U.K. and Italy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Predatory Sparrow did not respond to a request for comment sent to their X account, and via Telegram.

The alleged cyberattack on Bank Sepah comes as Israel and Iran are bombing each other’s countries, a conflict that started after Israel began targeting nuclear energy facilities, military bases, and senior Iranian military officials on Friday.

It’s unclear who is behind Predatory Sparrow. The group clearly fashions itself as a pro-Israel or at least anti-Iran hacktivist group and [has targeted companies and organizations in Iran for years](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62072480). Cybersecurity researchers believe the group has had success in the past and made credible claims.

“Despite appearances this actor is not all bluster,” John Hultquist, the chief analyst at Google’s Mandiant, [wrote on X](https://x.com/JohnHultquist/status/1934916100694606004).

[According to Rob Joyce](https://x.com/RGB_Lights/status/1934944656175104159), who previously worked at the NSA and in the Biden administration, “Predatory Sparrow’s past cyber attacks on Iranian steel plants and gas stations have demonstrated tangible effects in Iran.”

Predatory Sparrow’s most eye-catching alleged hacks have been against a steel maker, which [allegedly caused an explosive fire](https://www.wired.com/story/predatory-sparrow-cyberattack-timeline/) in the plant, and [against Iran’s gas stations](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59062907), which caused disruptions to citizens trying to refill their vehicles’ gas tanks.
