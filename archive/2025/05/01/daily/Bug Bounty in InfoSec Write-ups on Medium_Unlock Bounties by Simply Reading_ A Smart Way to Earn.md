## **Overview**

*Companies often unintentionally expose files or documents on their public-facing servers, websites, or third-party services like GitHub or AWS S3 buckets. These files could include configuration files, source code, PDFs, text files, or other documents that might contain sensitive information that can help identify vulnerabilities. By analyzing these files carefully, you can uncover several types of security issues that could potentially lead to exploitation. Let’s break down each of these points in more detail:*

### 1. Sensitive Data Exposure

*Sometimes, files exposed online contain sensitive data like* ***API keys****,* ***credentials****, or* ***personally identifiable information (PII)****. These are critical pieces of information that could allow attackers to compromise an application, service, or even gain unauthorized access to sensitive accounts. For example, API keys left exposed can give an attacker access to a system’s back-end or third-party services. Exposed PII can lead to identity theft or privacy violations. It’s essential to scan through exposed files for these sensitive items to ensure they’re not inadvertently shared.*

### 2. Misconfigurations

*A common issue is* ***misconfigured servers or services****. This happens when systems are not properly set up, leaving them vulnerable to attack. Misconfigurations can involve incorrect permissions on storage services, publicly accessible database configurations, or open ports that shouldn’t be exposed. These flaws can be discovered by carefully analyzing the exposed files for any signs that the environment hasn’t been hardened. In many cases, a simple misconfiguration can give attackers the ability to escalate privileges or gain access to more sensitive parts of the system.*

### 3. Hidden Endpoints

*Exposed files can sometimes reveal* ***undocumented APIs*** *or* ***internal URLs*** *that were not meant to be publicly accessible. These “hidden” endpoints can provide attackers with a backdoor into the system, bypassing normal security checks or access controls. Finding these endpoints through careful inspection of source code or configuration files can provide a way to exploit the system and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or services. It’s important to be vigilant and spot these hidden endpoints, as they are often overlooked by developers.*

### 4. Business Logic Flaws

*In some cases, exposed documents or files can reveal flaws in the* ***business logic*** *of an application. These flaws can give you insights into how the application works, which can be used to manipulate the system or perform unauthorized actions. For example, a vulnerable payment system might accept requests with invalid data due to a weak business logic implementation. By carefully analyzing the files, you can identify patterns and weaknesses in the system’s design that could be leveraged for exploitation.*

### 5. Outdated Software

*Sometimes, exposed files contain references to* ***outdated libraries or systems*** *with known vulnerabilities. For example, an old version of a framework or library might be included in a configuration file or a piece of documentation. These outdated components can be exploited if attackers are aware of their vulnerabilities. Identifying these outdated systems or libraries early allows companies to patch them before they’re exploited in the wild.*

### **Why Manual Testing Matters:**

*While automated tools are incredibly useful for quickly scanning large amounts of data,* ***manual testing*** *plays a crucial role in finding these types of issues. Automated tools often focus on surface-level scans, but* ***manual testing*** *allows you to dig deeper, analyze context, and think like an attacker. By reading through the exposed files and understanding the underlying logic, you can identify subtle security weaknesses that automated tools might miss. Manual testing also allows you to adapt to complex scenarios and better understand how different components of a system interact, which is key for finding vulnerabilities.*

*By carefully analyzing exposed files and using manual testing techniques, you can uncover critical security flaws that could otherwise go unnoticed, helping companies improve their security posture and, in some cases, even earning rewards for your efforts.*

*This approach works really well because it takes advantage of information that’s already publicly available. As long as you stick to what’s allowed and don’t go beyond the boundaries, this kind of testing is typically within the scope of bug bounty programs.*

### Steps for Investigating Exposed Files in Bug Bounty Programs

### 1. Find Exposed Files and Documents

*The first step is to locate files or documents that a company may have unintentionally made public, either on their website or through third-party platforms. Here’s how you can go about it:*

**A. Google Dorking:**
 *Use advanced search queries to pinpoint specific file types or paths. Some useful examples include:*

* `site:*.target.com filetype:pdf`
* `site:target.com inurl:(config | backup | admin)`
* `site:target.com -inurl:(login | signup)` ***(to exclude common login or signup pages)***

**B. Wayback Machine:**
 *Check the Internet Archive at* [*archive.org*](https://archive.org) *to see past versions of the site. You might find files that have since been removed or were left exposed in ...
