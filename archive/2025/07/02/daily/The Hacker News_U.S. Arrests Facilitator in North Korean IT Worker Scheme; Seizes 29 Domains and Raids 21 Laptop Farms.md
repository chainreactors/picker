The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday announced sweeping actions targeting the North Korean information technology (IT) worker scheme, leading to the arrest of one individual and the seizure of 29 financial accounts, 21 fraudulent websites, and nearly 200 computers.

The coordinated action saw searches of 21 known or suspected "laptop farms" between June 10 and 17, 2025, across 14 states in the U.S. that were put to use by North Korean IT workers to remotely connect to victim networks via company-provided laptop computers.

"The North Korean actors were assisted by individuals in the United States, China, United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan, and successfully obtained employment with more than 100 U.S. companies," the DoJ [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-coordinated-nationwide-actions-combat-north-korean-remote).

The North Korean IT worker scheme has become one of the crucial cogs in the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea (DPRK) revenue generation machine in a manner that bypasses international sanctions. The fraudulent operation, described by cybersecurity company DTEX as a [state-sponsored crime syndicate](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/us-seizes-774m-in-crypto-tied-to-north.html), involves North Korean actors obtaining employment with U.S. companies as remote IT workers, using a mix of stolen and fictitious identities.

Once they land a job, the IT workers receive regular salary payments and gain access to proprietary employer information, including export controlled U.S. military technology and virtual currency. In one incident, the IT workers are alleged to have secured jobs at an unnamed Atlanta-based blockchain research and development company and stole over $900,000 in digital assets.

North Korean IT workers are a serious threat because not only do they generate illegal revenues for the Hermit Kingdom through "legitimate" work, but they also weaponize their insider access to harvest sensitive data, steal funds, and even [extort their employers](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/north-korean-it-workers-in-western.html) in exchange for not publicly disclosing their data.

"These schemes target and steal from U.S. companies and are designed to evade sanctions and fund the North Korean regime's illicit programs, including its weapons programs," said Assistant Attorney General John A. Eisenberg of the Department's National Security Division.

Last month, the DoJ said it had filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that targeted over $7.74 million in cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital assets linked to the global IT worker scheme.

"North Korea remains intent on funding its weapons programs by defrauding U.S. companies and exploiting American victims of identity theft," said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI Counterintelligence Division. "North Korean IT workers posing as U.S. citizens fraudulently obtained employment with American businesses so they could funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea's authoritarian regime."

Chief among the actions announced Monday includes the arrest of U.S. national Zhenxing "Danny" Wang of New Jersey, who has been accused of perpetrating a multi-year fraud scheme in collusion with co-conspirators to get remote IT work with U.S. companies, ultimately generating more than $5 million in revenue.

Other individuals who participated in the scheme include six Chinese and two Taiwanese nationals -

* Jing Bin Huang (靖斌 黄)
* Baoyu Zhou (周宝玉)
* Tong Yuze (佟雨泽)
* Yongzhe Xu (徐勇哲 and يونجزهي أكسو)
* Ziyou Yuan (زيو)
* Zhenbang Zhou (周震邦)
* Mengting Liu (劉 孟婷), and
* Enchia Liu (刘恩)

According to the indictment, the defendants and other co-conspirators compromised the identities of more than 80 U.S. individuals to obtain remote jobs at more than 100 U.S. companies between 2021 and October 2024. The overseas IT workers are believed to have been assisted by U.S.-based facilitators, Kejia "Tony" Wang, Zhenxing "Danny" Wang, and at least four others, with Kejia Wang even traveling to China in 2023 to meet overseas co-conspirators and IT workers and discuss the scheme.

To trick the companies into thinking that the remote workers are based in the U.S., Wang et al received and hosted the company-issued laptops at their residences, and enabled the North Korean threat actors to connect to these devices using [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch) (short for "keyboard-video-mouse") switches like PiKVM or TinyPilot.

"Kejia Wang and Zhenxing Wang also created shell companies with corresponding websites and financial accounts, including Hopana Tech LLC, Tony WKJ LLC, and Independent Lab LLC, to make it appear as though the overseas IT workers were affiliated with legitimate U.S. businesses," the DoJ said. "Kejia Wang and Zhenxing Wang established these and other financial accounts to receive money from victimized U.S. companies, much of which was subsequently transferred to overseas co‑conspirators."

In return for providing these services, Wang and his co-conspirators are estimated to have received no less than $696,000 from the IT workers.
