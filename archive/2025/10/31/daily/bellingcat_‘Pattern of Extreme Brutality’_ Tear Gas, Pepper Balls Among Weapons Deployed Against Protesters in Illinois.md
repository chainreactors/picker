Children in Chicago’s Old Irving Park neighbourhood were preparing for a Halloween parade on Oct. 25 when federal agents [reportedly deployed](https://apnews.com/article/chicago-immigration-trump-crackdown-school-children-c9a19835cac13c0fbbebcc9f4bf4f0a2) tear gas on the street to disperse protesters opposing immigration-related arrests in the neighbourhood.

“Those kids were tear gassed on their way to celebrate Halloween in their local school parking lot,” US District Judge Sara Ellis said in court on Tuesday, according to a [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/border-patrol-gregory-bovino-chicago-tear-gas-judge-sara-ellis/) report. “I can only imagine how terrified they were”.

Ellis was questioning US Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino over this and other incidents that protesters allege violate a [temporary restraining order (TRO)](https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/25-12173-Chicago-Headline-Club-v.-Noem-Final-TRO-Order.pdf) she issued earlier this month.

The Oct. 9 TRO was issued after a group of journalists, faith leaders and protesters filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over what they described as a “[pattern of extreme brutality](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71559589/1/chicago-headline-club-v-noem/)” by federal agents against peaceful protesters since [Operation Midway Blitz](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/03/secretary-noem-travels-chicago-operation-midway-blitz-reaches-more-1000-illegal) – a multi-agency operation against “criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois – began on Sept. 2.

When Judge Ellis asked Bovino to produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz by the end of Tuesday, Bovino said it [would be impossible](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/judge-orders-border-patrol-official-bovino-to-meet-with-her-daily-on-chicago-immigration-crackdown) because of the “sheer amount”. Ellis then ordered Bovino to turn over these reports, along with the accompanying body camera footage, [by the end of Friday](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/judge-demands-border-patrol-appear-daily-provide-use-of-force-reports/3844774/), Oct. 31.

The court order places restrictions on federal agents’ crowd-control measures within the state, including their use of “riot control weapons” such as tear gas and pepper spray, the use of force against individuals and requiring people to leave public spaces that they lawfully have the right to be in.

A subsequent court filing on Oct. 27 alleges that federal agents have violated the TRO “[almost every day](https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/TearGasBan.pdf)” since it was issued. “Immigration enforcement does not typically require the daily use of tear gas on civilians in residential areas,” the filing stated.

Bellingcat’s analysis of social media videos from 28 events in Illinois from Oct. 9 to Oct. 27 found multiple examples of force and riot control weapons being used.

In total, we found seven that appeared to show the use of riot control weapons when there was seemingly no apparent immediate threat by protesters and no audible warnings given. Nineteen showed use of force, such as tackling people to the ground when they were not visibly resisting. Another seven showed agents ordering or threatening people to leave public places. Some of the events identified showed incidents that appeared to fall into more than one of these categories.

It is important to note that the full context of an incident may be unclear from videos on social media alone. Bystanders often only begin filming when an arrest is already ongoing, for example, which can make it difficult to determine what happened in the moments before force was applied. Each of the events included in our dataset were verified to have taken place in Illinois in recent weeks with at least two sources – videos taken by different people, local reporting or statements from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The DHS – which oversees Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) as well as the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – has justified the use of force or riot control weapons by saying that protesters were threatening or attacking agents.

Bellingcat asked DHS whether it had any response to the TRO or allegations that agents had violated the TRO.

In a response received after the publication of this piece, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not directly address the TRO but said DHS officers “only use crowd control methods as a last resort when repeated warnings have been given”.

DHS also said, several times in its response, that its officers were “facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them”. This is a claim that the department has previously made when commenting on clashes with protesters during immigration operations in other cities such as [Los Angeles](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/31/law-enforcement-attacked-they-arrest-two-rioters-charged-assaulting-dhs-law) and [Portland](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/09/30/four-criminal-illegal-aliens-arrested-after-conducting-laser-strikes-helicopters). However, an [NPR analysis of court records](https:/...
