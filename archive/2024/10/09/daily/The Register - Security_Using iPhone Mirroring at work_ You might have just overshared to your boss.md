## What does IT glimpse but a dating app on your wee little screen

If you're using iPhone Mirroring at work: It's time to stop, lest you give your employer's IT department the capability to snoop through the list of apps you have on your phone — dating apps, those tracking medical conditions or sexual history, or any other NSFW apps that you might want to keep to yourself.

iPhone Mirroring is a feature that allows users to wirelessly use iPhones for viewing content on the device, using apps, and receiving notifications on a Mac. It [requires](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120421) macOS 15 Sequoia, iOS 18, and Apple Silicon to work.

It's great for home use, but presents a potential privacy risk between employers and employees using a work-issued Mac computer.
