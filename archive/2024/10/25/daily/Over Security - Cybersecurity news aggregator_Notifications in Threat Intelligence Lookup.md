Query Updates in Threat Intelligence Lookup

We are thrilled to announce a significant enhancement to [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) — Query Updates. The new functionality allows users to subscribe to real-time notifications for new results related to their specified queries.

Tracking [emerging and evolving](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/emerging-threats/) cyber threats has never been easier.

## What Are Lookup Query Updates?

Threat Intelligence Lookup’s Query Updates enable users to receive timely search updates on relevant [Indicators of Compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs), Indicators of Attack (IOAs), and Indicators of Behavior (IOBs) that matter to their organizations.

Previously, users needed to perform regular searches to receive new results, risking the chance of missing important updates.

With Query Updates, users can now subscribe to [specific queries](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-lookup-search-parameters/). When new results appear, a notification will be displayed in the dashboard — new results will be highlighted in green, making it easy to identify fresh information at a glance.

If the number of new results exceeds 1,000, the subscription will pause, alerting you to review the accumulated results before proceeding. This ensures that you stay informed without being overwhelmed by excessive data.
