# A day in the life of a privacy pro, with Ron de Jesus (Lock and Code S05E26)

Posted: December 16, 2024

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

Privacy is many things for many people.

For the teenager suffering from a bad breakup, privacy is the ability to stop sharing her location and to block her ex on social media. For the political dissident advocating against an oppressive government, privacy is the protection that comes from secure, digital communications. And for the California resident who wants to know exactly how they’re being included in so many targeted ads, privacy is the legal right to ask a marketing firm how they collect their data.

In all these situations, privacy is being provided to a person, often by a company or that company’s employees.

The decisions to disallow location sharing and block social media users are made—and implemented—by people. The engineering that goes into building a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging platform is done by people. Likewise, the response to someone’s legal request is completed by either a lawyer, a paralegal, or someone with a career in compliance.

In other words, privacy, for the people who spend their days with these companies, is *work*. It’s their expertise, their career, and their to-do list.

But what does that work actually entail?

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Transcend Field Chief Privacy Officer Ron de Jesus about the responsibilities of privacy professionals today and how experts balance the privacy of users with the goals of their companies.

De Jesus also explains how everyday people can meaningfully judge whether a company’s privacy “promises” have any merit by looking into what the companies provide, including a legible privacy policy and “just-in-time” notifications that ask for consent for any data collection as it happens.

> “When companies provide these really easy-to-use controls around my [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), that’s a really great trigger for me to say, hey, this company, really, is putting their money where their mouth is.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
