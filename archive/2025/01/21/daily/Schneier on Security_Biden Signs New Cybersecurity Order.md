## Biden Signs New Cybersecurity Order

President Biden has signed a [new cybersecurity order](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/). It has a bunch of provisions, most notably using the US government‚Äôs procurement power to improve cybersecurity practices industry-wide.

Some [details](https://www.wired.com/story/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-ai-and-more/):

> The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents¬≠‚Äînamely, the security failures of federal contractors.
>
> The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on [a mandate that debuted](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/M-22-18.pdf) in 2022 in response to [Biden‚Äôs first cyber executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would be tasked with double-checking these security attestations and working with vendors to fix any problems. To put some teeth behind the requirement, the White House‚Äôs Office of the National Cyber Director is ‚Äúencouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General‚Äù for potential investigation and prosecution.
>
> The order gives the Department of Commerce eight months to assess the most commonly used cyber practices in the business community and issue guidance based on them. Shortly thereafter, those practices would become mandatory for companies seeking to do business with the government. The directive also kicks off updates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology‚Äôs [secure software development guidance.](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ssdf)

Sure sounds like good news. I‚Äôm not one to ask for government meddling, would much prefer the industry fix these problems themselves. It has certainly become clear that the industry isn‚Äôt likely to change.

Maybe this will make my (ISC)2 CSSLP cert worth big bucks soon üòâ

@bw

This doesn‚Äôt seem like government meddling so much as a large customer updating a requirement.

I would think even the freest of free-market folks ought to appreciate the government‚Äôs right to require vendors to meet their spec.

More bureaucracy to make the process more ‚Äúefficient‚Äù!

What will happen is the already burdensome (because of over-regulation) process almost immovable and less functionally useful all while continuing to punish the companies who are actually trying to a point of not wanting to try.

It‚Äôs a ‚ÄúThe beatings will continue, until moral improves‚Äù regulation.

Please note that the link to the new ‚Äúcybersecurity order‚Äù should be

Everything from the Biden White House is now hosted at that new web site. This has been done with each change of administration for years now.

This order from Biden is just for show. With the new president and his advisor Musk this order wel be withdrawn immediately (or very soon). The new president has already told that he will withdraw most of the presidential orders from Biden.

Re section 2. Burden will be on the companies to ensure no 3rd party vulnerabilities are present in their software which would normally drive the software price up but in the short term this will not be the case as the government is not going to pay more for the‚Äòsame‚Äô software. It might ultimately cause some government software suppliers to look for alternative markets or go out of business altogether

@ Aaron,

Did you miss,

> *‚Äúan array of mandates for protecting **government networks**‚Äú*

As a customer ‚Äúputting out to tender‚Äù in a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù ‚ÄúCompetitive bidding process‚Äù the US Government is entitled to set a specification by which those who ‚Äúchose‚Äù to bid for and undertake work should comply with.

If companies chose not to ‚Äúbid‚Äù because they do not want to meet the specification that is their choice, nobody is forcing them to.

I get the feeling you don‚Äôt want to understand the basic facts of life.

In my memory, there are not many examples of *Industry Fixing a Health or Safety Problem* for consumers without government ‚Äúincentives‚Äù.

How come Biden signs an executive order right before leaving office that imposes a bunch of short deadlines on various government agencies to do things like plan for PQC?

Seems like a cynical political move to stymie the new administration much more than strengthening the US‚Äôs cyber posture. If it was so important to Biden, why wait till now?
