# Weekly Update 432

31 December 2024

There's a certain irony to the Bluesky situation where people are pushing back when I include links to X. Now, [where have we seen this sort of behaviour before?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-19/twitter-bans-linking-rival-social-media-websites-elon-musk/101786874?ref=troyhunt.com) ðŸ¤” When I'm relying on content that only appears on that platform to add context to a data breach in HIBP *and* that content is freely accessible from within the native Bluesky app (without needing an X account), we're out of reasonable excuses for the negativity. And if "because Elon" is the sole reason and someone is firm enough in their convictions on that, [there's a very easy solution](https://www.troyhunt.com/if-you-dont-want-guitar-lessons-stop-following-me/) ðŸ™‚
