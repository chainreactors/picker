Risk is real. To better understand cybersecurity risk, let’s compare cyber risks to risks in the natural world from hurricanes. We can learn lessons from hurricanes and unnamed storms in Florida and apply them to cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity risk management can be daunting. Sometimes, it can sound academic. Did you learn the standard formula?

**Cyber risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Consequence**

Cyber risk can be a dry subject, involving many ‘what ifs.’ It’s a topic often left to governance and compliance specialists in quiet offices, but cyber risk management should be obvious, active, and involve the whole organization.

### **Why Risk Management Matters**

It’s not dusty formulas; it’s dynamic, like the weather.

We did not expect three major storms in less than one month in Sarasota, County, Florida. The county of Sarasota, the city of Venice, and Florida Power and Light are proficient at categorizing and preparing for natural disasters. Good risk management saved lives and homes.

*We still check the weather every day in the Sunshine State. Do you evaluate your organization’s cybersecurity risks regularly?*

Below, I will discuss how to handle cyber risk and provide some tools to better manage cybersecurity risks.

### **Living with Risk**

We live with cybersecurity risks every day. No system is ever one hundred percent secure. Risk is always present. We can’t escape it. A breach, an incident, a misconfiguration is inevitable. We are human, after all.

#### What Can We Do with Risk?

**Transfer**Most organizations have some form of cyber insurance, but an organization may not really know what will be covered until there is an incident of profound significance. Or, when the \*\*\*t hits the fan. While your organization is transferring the risk to the insurance company, you as a risk professional will still need to take some action steps:

* Read your cyber insurance policy at least yearly. Understand which of your organization’s business units are responsible for actions defined in the cyber insurance policy.
* Know how to contact your insurance carrier (email, phone, chat) and which team member is responsible to contact the carrier.
* Have an offline copy of your policy and the phone numbers.

**Mitigate**Your organization can reduce risk through cyber hygiene practices including patch management and vulnerability management. You can reduce risk, but you really can’t completely mitigate it. As cybersecurity professionals, if we can get this one concept across to our senior leadership and boards of directors, we have served them greatly.

Cybersecurity is complex, and the message of cybersecurity risk sometimes gets lost in technical details. Let’s not lose the message to our senior leadership. We can’t completely prevent cyber-attacks, but we can greatly reduce our attack surface through cyber hygiene. To learn more about cybersecurity hygiene, see the CIS Controls for a deeper conversation ([www.cissecurity.org](http://www.cissecurity.org)).

**Accept and Prepare to the Best of Your Ability and Budget**

10 days after the storm struck, there were complete houses buried in sand, without water and power. Vehicles were trapped inside of garages; neighbors couldn’t even get open the garage doors without digging and removing inches of sand. The city and county didn’t expect that.

Does your organization’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans address cybersecurity incidents such as ransomware or distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS)? What happens when your data center is so badly damaged, you can’t get your domain controller up? How long can your company function without directory services?

**Prioritize** **Systems and Data** **Beforehand**

You can’t have it all. Your organization must prioritize systems and data before the storm—the ransomware attack. Has your organization...
