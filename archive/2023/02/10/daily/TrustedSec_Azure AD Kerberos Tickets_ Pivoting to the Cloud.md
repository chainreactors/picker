If you've ever been doing an Internal Penetration test where you've reached Domain Admin status and you have a cloud presence, your entire Azure cloud can still be compromised. In this blog, I'll take you through this scenario and show you the dangers of machine account SSO compromise. We will do so without extracting any user account hashes and will have the ability to impersonate any account without MFA to achieve full cloud dominance.

## **Scenario:**

While an Internal Penetration test was being conducted, a service account with backup privileges to a Domain Controller (DC) was compromised. The team conducting the test was able to achieve full internal domain compromise. Using [***SecretsDump***](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py), the team extracted the machine account, **AZUREADSSOACC$**. This indicates that Azure SSO may be enabled in the target tenant.

To confirm Azure SSO was in use in this hybrid environment, ***AADInternals*** was used to perform reconnaissance on the Azure environment as an outsider. ***AADInternals*** can be obtained from the PowerShell Gallery or from GitHub. We can perform reconnaissance with the following command:

`Invoke-AADIntReconAsOutsider -Domain domain.local | Format-Table`

Figure 2 - Initial Azure Tenant Enumeration With AADInternals

Now that we have confirmed that SSO is in use, we will need to do some initial reconnaissance of the Azure environment. First, we will need to pick out a user. Service accounts are preferred since they are normally not backed with any form of MFA. One common issue that occurs when an enterprise syncs Azure AD for the first time, is that they will sync all on-premises AD environment IDs to the cloud. Service accounts can easily be pulled from an internal foothold in an AD environment.

An easy way to manually confirm if an ID is synced to an Azure environment is to simply type the full [***UPN***](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52250.active-directory-user-principal-name.aspx) in the Azure portal, and see if it asks for a password. In the case below, we are prompted to enter a password. This is a good sign that we have an ID that can be used for initial reconnaissance.

Figure 3 - Manual User Enumeration

Going back to our foothold in the internal AD environment, usernames beginning with 'SVC' SIDs were exfiltrated using ***rpcclient***. Using ***rpcclient*** to query accounts directly from a DC does not produce any alerts from Defender for Identity.
