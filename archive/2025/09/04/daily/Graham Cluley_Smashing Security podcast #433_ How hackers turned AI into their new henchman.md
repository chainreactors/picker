Your AI reads the small print, and that‚Äôs a problem. This week in episode 433 of ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù we dig into LegalPwn ‚Äì malicious instructions tucked into code comments and disclaimers that sweet-talks AI into rubber-stamping dangerous payloads (or even pretending they‚Äôre a harmless calculator).

Meanwhile, new research from Anthropic reveals that hackers have already used AI agents to break into networks, steal passwords, sift through stolen data, and even write custom ransom notes. In other words, one hacker with an AI helper can work like an entire team of cybercriminals.

Plus: a joyous geek detour into keyboard history, and the most diabolically annoying, fully functional AI-generated CAPTCHA that you will love to inflict on your friends.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast with computer security veteran Graham Cluley, joined this week by Mark Stockley.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
