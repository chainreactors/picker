Last week we welcomed 2500 of our customers to Ignite 22, our first in-person customer conference since 2019. It was refreshing to connect in person, learn together, debate, discuss and have some fun too.

We were delighted to welcome Hasan Minhaj for a second year hosting our general sessions. We kicked off with a keynote from CEO Nikesh Aora, highlighted by a fireside chat between Nikesh and Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. The two leaders announced an extended partnership from Google Cloud and Prisma Access to bring customers ZTNA 2.0. This partnership will provide hybrid users secure and seamless access to all applications from any device.

Wendi Whitmore, Senior Vice President of Unit 42, is a consistent hit with cybersecurity audiences. She gave an insider’s perspective on the cybersecurity threat landscape. Wendi analyzed the impact of high-profile breaches over the past year and how we can learn for the future.

In one of the most anticipated keynote sessions, Chief Product Officer Lee Klarich highlighted new Palo Alto Networks product innovations, emphasizing how Zero Trust is only possible with a robust platform. Lee unveiled the Next Gen Platforms and Services featuring new enhancements of Prisma Cloud to create greater customer confidence in application security from cloud to code. Best-of-breed, Cortex Solutions announcements included XSIAM going cloud-native in its latest release; Cortex XSOAR 8.0 will be re-architected for better performance, reliability and scalability; and, Cortex XSIAM is completely reimagining how the SOC works, transforming the SOC to an autonomous security platform.

We continued to inform and inspire attendees with an interactive keynote from SVP & Chief Marketing Officer, Zeynep Ozdemir, sharing recent data collected from 1300 global cybersecurity executives: 96% of executives said they experienced at least one breach in the past 12 months, 57% said they experienced three or more. 77% of all executives interviewed are actively trying to consolidate their portfolio of products to achieve better security outcomes. Explore the [What’s Next in Cyber report](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/whats-next-in-cyber-report?utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin-tma-global-cxo&utm_campaign=wnic_fy23q2&utm_content=static&sfdcid=7014u000001VQAEAA4) for more key data and insights.

An intriguing discussion between President BJ Jenkins and Scott Moser, CISO from Sabre Corporation, highlighted what is possible when cybersecurity is seen, not as a barrier, but as a powerful accelerator of bold business goals.

When Palo Alto Networks founder and CTO, Nir Zuk, took the stage, he boldly predicted in five years, everything we’re working on will be done by AI. In more good news, he guarantees we’ll be working on many more interesting things!
