# USB bombs sent to news organizations

Posted: March 24, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

We’ve warned about the possible dangers arising from plugging in unknown USB sticks before, but the dangers we’re concerned with are normally confined to your data.

However, this week we learned a far more serious threat. No fewer than five different news agencies in Ecuador were [sent parcels containing a USB stick](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-65026522). In the one instance where a stick was plugged into a PC by a journalist, the device exploded, injuring a presenter in the news room. At least one of the devices had been loaded with a “[military type explosive](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/news-stations-letter-bombs-ecuador-one-explodes-clear-message-to-silence-journalists/)“.

Law enforcement is currently investigating, but for now we have to hope that no additional devices were sent out, just waiting to be inserted into a PC. While this scenario is almost guaranteed to be one that you will not face, that doesn’t mean there aren’t USB stick related perils out there in the wild.

## A sticky malware threat

[Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) authors are big fans of sending out infected USB sticks to potential victims. Just last year, slick looking Microsoft boxes supposedly containing Office 365 loaded onto USB sticks were s[ent out by tech support scammers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/tech-support-scammers-target-microsoft-users-with-fake-office-365-usb-sticks). When inserted into a PC, a phone number would appear and callers would find themselves asked to install remote access tools on their devices. Elsewhere, infected USB Sticks came [bearing the gift of ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/01/attackers-are-mailing-usb-sticks-to-drop-ransomware-on-victims-computers).

USB sticks are also easy to lose: Sometimes people find them lying around in the street, full of [potentially sensitive data](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/06/city-worker-loses-usb-stick-containing-data-on-every-resident-after-day-of-drinking), as opposed some kind of horrible malware.

Our willingness to insert sticks into computers is helped along by USB sticks being a commonplace giveaway at events, conferences, and even a staple of certain [performance art pieces](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2015/02/get-the-drop-on-dead-drops). If you have children, your school may well hand out digital copies of school photographs on USB sticks. Many people will insert those sticks into their computer without a second thought because they’re from a trusted source, the school. Even so, the stick is actually from a totally unrelated third party photographer. Can we guarantee that the photographer is following safety rules, if they even exist?

We never really know for sure, and that can be a problem. However, there are a few things you can do to help keep yourself safe from USB harm.

## Tips for USB security

* **Don’t autorun files**. If Autorun is enabled on your device, it’s time to consider turning it off.
* **Restrict access**. If people in your workplace don’t need to use USB sticks, turn off USB access on their devices and block the USB ports.
* **Occasional access**. For times when someone needs to use a USB stick, consider using those sticks on a non-networked PC running a virtual machine.
* **Fire up those security tools**. Always [scan the contents of a USB stick](https...
