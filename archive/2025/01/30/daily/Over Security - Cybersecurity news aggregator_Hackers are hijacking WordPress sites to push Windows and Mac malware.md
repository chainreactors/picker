# Hackers are hijacking WordPress sites to push Windows and Mac malware

Hackers are exploiting outdated versions of WordPress and plug-ins to alter thousands of websites in an attempt to trick visitors to download and install malware, security researchers have found.

The hacking campaign is still “very much live,” Simon Wijckmans, the founder and CEO of web security company c/side, which discovered the attacks, told TechCrunch on Tuesday.

The hackers’ goal is to spread malware capable of stealing passwords and other personal information from both Windows and Mac users. Some of the hacked websites are ranked among the most popular sites on the internet, according to c/side.

“This is a widespread and very commercialized attack,” Himanshu Anand, who wrote [up the company’s findings](https://cside.dev/blog/10-000-wordpress-websites-found-delivering-macos-and-microsoft-malware), told TechCrunch. Anand said the campaign is a “spray and pray” attack that aims to compromise anyone who visits these websites rather than targeting a specific person or group of people.

When the hacked WordPress sites load in a user’s browser, the content quickly changes to display a fake Chrome browser update page, requesting the website visitor download and install an update in order to view the website, the researchers found. If a visitor accepts the update, the hacked website will prompt the visitor to download a specific malicious file masquerading as the update, depending on whether the visitor is on a Windows PC or a Mac.

Wijckmans said that they alerted Automattic, the company that develops and distributes WordPress.com, about the hacking campaign and sent them the list of malicious domains, and that their contact at the company acknowledged receipt of their email.

When reached by TechCrunch prior to publication, Megan Fox, a spokesperson for Automattic, did not comment by press time. After publication, Automattic said that security of third-party plugins are ultimately the responsibility of WordPress plugin developers.

“There are specific guidelines that plugin authors must consult and adhere to ensure the overall quality of their plugins and the safety of their users. In addition, they have at their disposal a Plugin Handbook that covers numerous security topics, including best practices and managing plugins’ security,” the spokesperson said.

C/side said it identified over 10,000 websites that appear to have been compromised as part of this hacking campaign. Wijckmans said the company detected malicious scripts on several domains by crawling the internet, and performing a reverse DNS lookup, a technique to find domains and websites associated with a certain IP address, which revealed more domains hosting the malicious scripts.

TechCrunch could not confirm the accuracy of c/side’s figures, but we saw one hacked WordPress website that was still displaying the malicious content on Tuesday.

## **From WordPress to infostealing malware**

The two types of malware that are being pushed on the malicious websites are known as Amos (or Amos Atomic Stealer), which targets macOS users; and SocGholish, which targets Windows users.

In May 2023, cybersecurity firm SentinelOne [published a report](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/atomic-stealer-threat-actor-spawns-second-variant-of-macos-malware-sold-on-telegram/?ref=content.cside.dev) on Amos, classifying the malware as an [infostealer](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#infostealers), a type of malware designed to infect computers and steal as many usernames and passwords, session cookies, crypto wallets, and other sensitive data that allows the hackers to further break into the victim’s accounts and steal their digital currency. [Cybersecurity firm Cyble reported](http://cyble.com/blog/threat-actor-selling-new-atomic-macos-amos-stealer-on-telegram/?ref=content.cside.dev) at the time that it had found that hackers were selling access to the Amos malware on Telegram.

Patrick Wardle, a macOS security expert and co-founder of [Apple-focused cybersecurity startup DoubleYou](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/ex-nsa-ex-apple-researcher-doubleyou/), told TechCrunch that Amos is “definitively the most prolific stealer on macOS,” and was created with the malware-as-a-service business model, meaning the developers and owners of the malware sell it to the hackers who then deploy it.

Wardle also noted that for someone ...
