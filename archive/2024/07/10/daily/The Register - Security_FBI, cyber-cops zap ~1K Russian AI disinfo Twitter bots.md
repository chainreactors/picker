The FBI and cybersecurity agencies in Canada and the Netherlands say they have taken down an almost 1,000-strong Twitter bot farm set up by Russian state-run RT News that used generative AI to spread disinformation to Americans and others.

The international crime busters seized two web domains and 968 X accounts that were integral parts of the bot farm, the US Department of Justice said in a [statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-leads-efforts-among-federal-international-and-private-sector-partners) Tuesday.

We're told the X accounts were used to "sow discord in the United States and elsewhere," in hope of causing people to squabble among themselves and distrust one another, which would suit the Kremlin.
