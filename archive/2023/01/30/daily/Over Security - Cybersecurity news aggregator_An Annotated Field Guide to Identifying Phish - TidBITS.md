# An Annotated Field Guide to Identifying Phish

Do you like phish? Not the band, not tasty seafood dishes, and not the pretty tropical variety. I refer instead to the intellectual challenge of identifying phishing emails that attempt to get you to reveal personal information, often including login credentials or financial details, or entice you to call a phone number where trained operators will attempt to separate you from your money.

Phishing is a big deal, with a [State of Phishing report](https://venturebeat.com/security/report-phishing-attacks-jump-61-in-2022-with-255m-attacks-detected/) from security firm SlashNext claiming that there were more than 255 million phishing attacks in 2022, a 61% increase from the year before. The [Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report](https://www.phishingbox.com/downloads/Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report-DBIR-2022.pdf) for 2022 says that only 2.9% of employees click through from phishing emails, but with billions of email addresses available to target, the raw numbers are still high.

Even before the LastPass breach (see ‚Äú[LastPass Shares Details of Security Breach](https://tidbits.com/2022/12/24/lastpass-shares-details-of-connected-security-breaches/),‚Äù 24 December 2022) and the news about a [data leak containing email addresses of over 200 million Twitter users](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/200-million-twitter-users-email-addresses-allegedly-leaked-online/), I had been noticing more phishing attempts evading Gmail‚Äôs generally effective spam filters. I don‚Äôt entirely blame Gmail for this‚Äîin many cases, I can see how the messages would be hard to catch.

In the past, many phishing attempts were obviously fake, and intentionally so. That‚Äôs because they only had to sucker people who were sufficiently inexperienced, credulous, or easily deceived that they would continue to go along with the scam. Now, however, I‚Äôm seeing phishing attempts that are more sophisticated and harder to identify quickly.

I‚Äôve been examining phishing attempts for so long that it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine what might fool someone else, so I wanted to share some recent attempts that slipped past Gmail‚Äôs filters. For each message, I‚Äôve called out some of the ways I identified it as phishing. I suspect that most of you will assume that you would also easily have identified the message as fake, but remember, many people move rapidly through their email without reading carefully. Perhaps my calling out of some of the hallmarks of phishing attempts can help you or the people to whom you forward this article avoid being drawn in.

## Password Reset

This phishing attempt purports to come from a system administrator in charge of my email domain and tries to lure me into clicking a button. The text isn‚Äôt very good, but the buttons are, and it‚Äôs easy to imagine someone who‚Äôs scanning too quickly clicking the button without even reading the text. But that would be a mistake!

[![Phishing email](https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/01/Password-Reset-phishing.png)](https://tidbits.com/wp/../uploads/2023/01/Password-Reset-phishing.png)

1. The Subject line for this message is glaring to me because I know how tidbits.com is managed‚ÄîI do it! So this one wasn‚Äôt going to fool me, but I could imagine someone getting a similar message that identified their domain and thinking it was from the IT department. Putting the email address in the Subject might get some people to click because it feels personalized.
2. It feels weird to me that the From line of the message is also tidbits.com. Even if an administrator had to email users about a required password reset, I would expect a name or a role to appear here.
3. The body of the message is a giveaway. The phisher clearly doesn‚Äôt know my name and is thus addressing it to my username. With additional data being leaked all the time, however, there‚Äôs no guarantee that phishers won‚Äôt start personalizing messages more thoroughly. The other problem with this text is that it doesn‚Äôt sound like it was written by a native speaker of English. There‚Äôs a difference between someone who‚Äôs just a weak writer and someone who doesn‚Äôt think in English, and the phrase ‚Äúplease kindly reconfirm Password‚Äù screams ‚Äúnon-native speaker.‚Äù (I presume that phishing attempts are localized into other languages for people in other countries, so replace ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù with whatever your native language is.)
4. These buttons are pretty good‚Äîthey ...
