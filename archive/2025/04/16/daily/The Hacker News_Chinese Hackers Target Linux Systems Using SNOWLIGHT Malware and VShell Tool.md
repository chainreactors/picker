[![Chinese Hackers Target Linux](data:image/png;base64... "Chinese Hackers Target Linux")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVwcaYeCYgHPgvHh00NL6MRo5ONZUCqiExrptRPTSt7pkU1klxcdKhiSysw0jCmzeQspZswu8zkBl_2hzSOvUjR4TXLEv9D8xUpXt0HmpiQERmdb_I9GQW645n5K8nWvUVFV_QQZSZbod-GRnGUCOWUs6OfVS0xaSwdTuZ57NjAAxodb8pIwPSS9Kqalru/s790-rw-e365/v-main.jpg)

The China-linked threat actor known as UNC5174 has been attributed to a new campaign that leverages a variant of a known malware dubbed SNOWLIGHT and a new open-source tool called VShell to infect Linux systems.

"Threat actors are increasingly using open source tools in their arsenals for cost-effectiveness and obfuscation to save money and, in this case, plausibly blend in with the pool of non-state-sponsored and often less technical adversaries (e.g., script kiddies), thereby making attribution even more difficult," Sysdig researcher Alessandra Rizzo [said](https://sysdig.com/blog/unc5174-chinese-threat-actor-vshell) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"This seems to hold especially true for this particular [threat actor](https://medium.com/%40simone.kraus/chinese-cyber-operations-targeting-critical-infrastructure-6f0500510a60), who has been under the radar for the last year since being affiliated with the Chinese government."

UNC5174, also referred to as Uteus (or Uetus), was [previously documented](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/china-linked-group-breaches-networks.html) by Google-owned Mandiant as exploiting security flaws in Connectwise ScreenConnect and F5 BIG-IP software to deliver a C-based ELF downloader named SNOWLIGHT, which is designed to fetch a Golang tunneler dubbed GOHEAVY from infrastructure tied to a publicly available command-and-control (C2) framework known as SUPERSHELL.

Also deployed in the attacks was GOREVERSE, a publicly available reverse shell backdoor written in Golang that operates over Secure Shell (SSH).

The French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), in its [Cyber Threat Overview report](https://cyber.gouv.fr/en/actualites/cyber-threat-overview-2024-mobilization-and-vigilance-against-attackers) for 2024 published last month, said it observed an attacker employing similar tradecraft as that of UNC5174 to weaponize security flaws in Ivanti Cloud Service Appliance (CSA) such as [CVE-2024-8963](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/critical-ivanti-cloud-appliance.html), [CVE-2024-9380](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/zero-day-alert-three-critical-ivanti.html), and [CVE-2024-8190](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/ivanti-warns-of-active-exploitation-of.html) to gain control and execute arbitrary code.

"Moderately sophisticated and discreet, this intrusion set is characterized by the use of intrusion tools largely available as open source and by the – already publicly reported – use of a rootkit code," the ANSSI said.

It's worth noting that both SNOWLIGHT and VShell are capable of [targeting Apple macOS systems](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x7D.html), with the latter distributed as a fake Cloudflare authenticator application as part of an as-yet-undetermined attack chain, according to an [analysis of artifacts](https://www.kandji.io/blog/fake-cloudflare-authenticator) uploaded to VirusTotal from China in October 2024.

In the attack chain observed by Sysdig in late January 2025, the SNOWLIGHT malware acts as a dropper for a fileless, in-memory payload called [VShell](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cisa-warns-of-active-exploitation-in.html), a remote access trojan (RAT) widely used by Chinese-speaking cybercriminals. The initial access vector used for the attack is presently unknown.

Specifically, the initial access is used to execute a malicious bash script ("download\_backd.sh") that deploys two binaries associated with SNOWLIGHT (dnsloger) and [Sliver](https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/threat-actors-turn-to-sliver-as-open.html) (system\_worker), both of which are used to set up persistence and establish communications with a C2 server.

The final stage of the attack delivers [VShell](https://www.libaisec.com/169.html) via SNOWLIGHT by means of a specially crafted request to the C2 server, thereby enabling remote control and further post-compromise exploitation.

"[VShell] acts as a RAT (Remote Access Trojan), allowing its abusers to execute arbitrary commands and download or upload files," Rizzo said. "SNOWLIGHT and VShell pose a significant risk to organizations due to their stealthy and sophisticated techniques," Sysdig said. "This is evidenced by the employment of WebSockets for command-and-control, as well as the fileless VShell payload."

The disclosure comes as TeamT5 [revealed](https://teamt5.org/en/posts/china-nexus-apt-exploits-ivanti-connect-secure-vpn-vulnerability-to-infiltrate-multiple-entities/) that a China-nexus hacking group likely exploited security flaws in Ivanti appliances ([CVE-2025-0282](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/ivanti-flaw-cve-2025-0282-actively.html) and [CVE-2025-22457](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/critical-ivanti-flaw-actively-exploited.html)) to gain initial access and deploy the [SPAWNCHIMERA](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/resurge-malware-exploits-ivanti-flaw.html) malware.
