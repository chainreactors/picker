# 23andMe and its customers’ genetic data bought by a pharmaceutical org

Posted: May 20, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The [bankrupt genetic testing company 23andMe](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/23andme-bankruptcy-how-to-delete-your-data-and-stay-safe-from-the-2023-breach) has been scooped up by drug producer Regeneron Pharmaceuticals for $256 million dollars.

But why would a pharmaceutical company like Regeneron buy a bankrupt genetics testing company like 23andMe for such a large amount of money?

Well, Regeneron is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops, and monetizes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. So, it seems obvious that Regeneron’s primary interest lies in the genetic data collected by 23andMe, and the situation raises complex ethical, privacy, and security concerns that customers should understand and address.

Regeneron has pledged to uphold data privacy and security, working closely with a court-appointed Customer Privacy Ombudsman, acknowledging the importance of customer data protection and the ethical use of genetic information.

Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s president, said in a statement:

> “We believe we can help 23andMe deliver and build upon its mission to help people learn about their own DNA and how to improve their personal health, while furthering Regeneron’s efforts to improve the health and wellness of many.”

However, the scenario is less grim than the fears uttered by Senator Cassidy, chair of the US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who [expressed concerns about foreign adversaries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/04/your-23andme-genetic-data-could-be-bought-by-china-senator-warns), including the Chinese Communist Party, acquiring the sensitive genetic data of millions of Americans through 23andMe.

Regeneron already manages genetic data from [nearly three million people](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2872805/regeneron-enters-into-asset-purchase-agreement-to-acquire-23andme-for-256-million-plans-to-maintain-consumer-genetics-business-and-advance-shared-goals-of-improving-human-health-and-wellness-regn), so 23andMe’s 15 million customers significantly expand this resource. Besides the genetic data itself, Regeneron likely values the consumer genetics business infrastructure and research services that 23andMe built, which can complement Regeneron’s pharmaceutical pipeline and personalized medicine efforts.

Genetic data is uniquely sensitive because it contains deeply [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) about an individual’s health risks, ancestry, and even family relationships. Unlike traditional medical records protected under HIPAA, 23andMe’s genetic data is covered primarily by consumer privacy laws, which offer weaker protections.

## What can consumers do to protect their data?

Customers should actively manage their data on 23andMe by reviewing policies, deleting data if desired, and staying vigilant about how their sensitive genetic information is used.

People that have submitted samples to 23andMe have three different options, each providing a different level of privacy.

### **1. Delete your genetic data from 23andMe**
