## Upcoming Book on AI and Democracy

If you’ve been reading my blog, you’ve noticed that I have written a lot about AI and democracy, mostly with my co-author Nathan Sanders. I am pleased to announce that we’re writing a book on the topic.

This isn’t a book about deep fakes, or misinformation. This is a book about what happens when AI writes laws, adjudicates disputes, audits bureaucratic actions, assists in political strategy, and advises citizens on what candidates and issues to support. It’s a book that tries to look into what an AI-assisted democratic system might look like, and then at how to best ensure that we make use of the good parts while avoiding the bad parts.

This is what I talked about in my RSA Conference speech last month, which you can both [watch](https://www.rsaconference.com/Library/presentation/usa/2024/what%20matters%20most%202024%20edition) and [read](https://cyberscoop.com/how-ai-will-change-democracy/). (You can also [read](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2023/11/ten-ways-ai-will-change-democracy.html) [earlier](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2023/11/ten-ways-ai-will-change-democracy.html) [attempts](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2023/06/ai-could-shore-up-democracy-heres-one-way.html) at this idea.)

The book will be published by MIT Press sometime in fall 2025, with an open-access digital version available a year after that. (It really can’t be published earlier. Nothing published this year will rise above the noise of the US presidential election, and anything published next spring will have to go to press without knowing the results of that election.)

Right now, the organization of the book is in six parts:

> AI-Assisted Politicians

It’s too early to share a more detailed table of contents, but I would like help thinking about titles. Below are my current list of brainstorming ideas: both titles and subtitles.

Anyone who knows what the book/author is about will obtain the book regardless of the title.
To have wider appeal (sales), I’d keep it really simple – two large letters “AI” taking up most of the cover, with a very small subtitle of your choice, chosen to be non-technical and not off-putting.

AI is a hoax. Respected cryptographer has turned into a snake oil man. Go and book your place in a nuthouse you lunatic.

@Sten:

“AI is a hoax. Respected cryptographer has turned into a snake oil man. Go and book your place in a nuthouse you lunatic.”

There’s certainly a lot of hype around it, but I wouldn’t call it a hoax. Crop circles are a hoax. Paul McCartney dying was a hoax. Aside: Wikipedia’s list of hoaxes is surprisingly interesting: <https://en.w...
