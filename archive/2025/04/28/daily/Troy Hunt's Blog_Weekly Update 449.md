# Weekly Update 449

27 April 2025

Today, I arrived at my PC first thing in the morning to find the UPS dead (battery was cactus) and the PC obviously without power. So, I tracked down a powerboard and some IEC C14 to mains cable adaptors and powered back up. On boot, neither the Bluetooth mouse nor keyboard worked. So, I tracked down a wired version of each, logged on, didn't find anything weird in the Device Manager, then gave it a reboot, which resulted in the machine not getting past the Lenovo splash screen. So, I rebooted and the same thing happened, unplugged the new USB devices, rebooted again and ended up on the Bitlocker key entry screen. So, on my spare PC I went to my Microsoft account, retrieved the correct key for the disk in question, rebooted and ended up on the recovery screen. So, I ran the recovery process and, much to my surprise, got straight back into Windows.

That's what trying to work out the login / log in / log on / sign in thing was like this week; incrementally [shaving the yak](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving?ref=troyhunt.com) until things work and make sense!
