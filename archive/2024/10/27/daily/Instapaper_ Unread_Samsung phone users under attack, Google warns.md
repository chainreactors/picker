A nasty bug in Samsung's mobile chips is being exploited by miscreants as part of an exploit chain to escalate privileges and then remotely execute arbitrary code, according to Google security researchers.

The use-after-free vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-44068, and it affects Samsung Exynos mobile processors versions 9820, 9825, 980, 990, 850, and W920. It received an 8.1 out of 10 CVSS severity rating, and Samsung, in its [very brief security advisory](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/quality-support/product-security-updates/cve-2024-44068/), describes it as a high-severity flaw. The vendor patched the hole on October 7.

While the advisory doesn't make any mention of attackers abusing the vulnerability, according to Googlers Xingyu Jin and Clement Lecigene, someone(s) has already chained the flaw with other CVEs (those aren't listed) as part of an attack to execute code on people's phones.
