[![Vulnerability in Linear eMerge E3 Systems](data:image/png;base64... "Vulnerability in Linear eMerge E3 Systems")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt84Eoa3rKvtAwE1JaWUsl1mAAnoKKz6kkf6F8zIthBNNTpe_58DJndJi8TjEBe2DtcBnwq6WBTNF7mfbclgBCxtNFJlaoQu7mNFqkg5EXf-tZVD1d4bsTIs7llj_P7q5_55M5Hz6AjOk025VDOOdMPOB2jfGDXO-sW2pDEtWjvYaqT73G6GJb3mGSE06W/s790-rw-e365/lock.png)

Cybersecurity researchers are warning about an unpatched vulnerability in Nice Linear eMerge E3 access controller systems that could allow for the execution of arbitrary operating system (OS) commands.

The flaw, assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2024-9441](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9441), carries a CVSS score of 9.8 out of a maximum of 10.0, [according to VulnCheck](https://vulncheck.com/blog/flax-typhoon-linear-merge).

"A vulnerability in the Nortek Linear eMerge E3 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to cause the device to execute arbitrary command," SSD Disclosure [said](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-nortek-linear-emerge-e3-pre-auth-rce/) in an advisory for the flaw released late last month, stating the vendor has yet to provide a fix or a workaround.

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

The flaw impacts the following versions of Nortek Linear eMerge E3 Access Control: 0.32-03i, 0.32-04m, 0.32-05p, 0.32-05z, 0.32-07p, 0.32-07e, 0.32-08e, 0.32-08f, 0.32-09c, 1.00.05, and 1.00.07.

Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for the flaw have been released following public disclosure, raising concerns that it could be exploited by threat actors.

It's worth noting that another critical flaw impacting E3, CVE-2019-7256 (CVSS score: 10.0), was [exploited](https://vulncheck.com/blog/flax-typhoon-botnet) by a threat actor known as [Flax Typhoon](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/new-raptor-train-iot-botnet-compromises.html) to recruit susceptible devices into the now-dismantled Raptor Train botnet.

Although originally disclosed in May 2019, the shortcoming wasn't [addressed](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-065-01) by the company until [earlier this March](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/cisa-alerts-on-active-exploitation-of.html).

"But given the vendor's slow response to the previous CVE-2019-7256, we don't expect a patch for CVE-2024-9441 any time soon," VulnCheck's Jacob Baines said. "Organizations using the Linear Emerge E3 series should act quickly to take these devices offline or isolate them."

In a statement shared with SSD Disclosure, Nice is recommending customers to follow security best practices, including enforcing network segmentation, restricting access to the product from the internet, and placing it behind a network firewall.
