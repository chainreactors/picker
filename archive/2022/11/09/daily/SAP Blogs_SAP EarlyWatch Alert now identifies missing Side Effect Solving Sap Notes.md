![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/287567_GettyImages-1194852020_medium_jpg.jpg)Have you implemented a lot of SAP Notes for fixing issues in your system? Do you already think there could be any side effects or unsure if your business process is impacted? Then, this blog is for you.

Sometimes we see that SAP Notes cause unwanted side effects, and these can lead to a lot of problems. The SAP EarlyWatch Alert Tool can now help you to identify situations where your system is affected by such an already known side effect.

**Why this Check?**

Our goal for this development is to pro-actively alert customers via the SAP EarlyWatch Alert, when they implemented an SAP Note causing a known side effect in the past.

**What is Offered?**

We have established an automated process between SAP Notes and the SAP EarlyWatch Alert. Therefore, it always has the latest information on SAP Notes which solve side effects. Equipped with this information it can check if you implemented SAP Note on your system that causes a known side effect and raise an alert if you didn’t implement the solving SAP Note.

When alerted you get the list of the causing SAP Notes that are implemented in your system along with the corresponding missing solving SAP Notes.

The functionality is currently offered for the following areas:

1. Extended Warehouse Management (SCM-EWM-\*)
2. Transportation Management (TM\*)
3. Production Planning (PP-\*)
4. Plant Maintenance (PM-\*)
5. Finance (Components FI-\* and FIN-\*)
6. Controlling (CO-\*)
7. Materials Management (MM-\*)
8. Logistics General (LO-\*)
9. Advanced Planning and Optimization (SCM-APO-\*)
10. Supplier Relationship Management (SRM-\*)
11. Payroll (PY-\*)
12. Logistics Execution (LE-\*)
13. Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC-\*)
14. SAP Environment Health and Safety Management (EHS\*)
15. Supply Chain Management (SCM-\*)
16. Cross Applications (CA-\*)
17. SAP Business Warehouse (BW-\*)
18. SAP Industry Solutions (IS-\*)
19. SAP Real Estate Management (RE-\*)
20. SAP Global Trade Services (FT\* and SLL\* )

We plan to extend this to other application areas as well in the future.

**Customer Benefits**

With this check, customers can detect already at a very early stage the issues existing in their system and ensure stability.

The list of missing SAP Notes helps to prioritize the implementation of SAP Notes for business-critical areas that are impacted.
