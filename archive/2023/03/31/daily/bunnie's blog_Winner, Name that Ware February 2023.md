## Winner, Name that Ware February 2023

The Ware for February 2023 is just a tiny portion of a Pioneer DDJ-400. Still enough for wrm to guess it exactly! Congrats, email me for your prize. It is the case that Pioneer gear has a very distinctive design style to it. I wonder if their PCB design software isn’t some in-house tool, or at least a tool with a niche client list.

Just for completeness, here’s the larger context image I would have added to the post if just the tightly cropped image with the bearing turned out to be a stumper:

   I thought the bearing was one of the things that helped nail it down.
