![What is a 403 error and how to fix it](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/23-BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_403-Error-820x386.jpg)

**Error 403 – Forbidden** can be a frustrating interruption to anyone’s day. This common error can lead to exasperated website visitors, even resulting to lost traffic and website revenue depending on which page of your site is affected. When you (or your site visitors) encounter an unexpected **error 403** message, it’s important to assess the issue promptly just in case it’s a symptom of a more serious issue on your site.

You might run into a **403 forbidden error** when visiting a website directory or page with restricted permissions, as most websites are set up to disallow directory browsing to protect sensitive files. But in some cases, 403’s can be an indicator of compromise — stemming from by or faulty malware, or a damaged .htaccess file on your website.

In this article, we will dive into the different types of **HTTP 403** errors, their possible causes, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to troubleshoot and resolve these errors to get your website back online.

## What is error 403?

The HTTP **Error 403** response status code is a client-side error that signifies the server has received and understood the request but is unable to authorize it.

A **403 Forbidden: you don’t have permission to access this resource** error typically occurs when a user does not have the necessary permission to access a specific web page or resource on a web server. This error is usually an issue with the website itself — rather than a problem on the user’s side.

Example of a 403 error.

400 error messages can come in all sorts of flavors, but they all mean the same thing. Here are a few variations of 400 errors you might encounter in your browser:

* 403 Forbidden
* Error 403
* HTTP 403
* Error 403 – Forbidden
* HTTP Error 403 – Forbidden
* Forbidden: You don’t have permission to access [directory] on this server
* Forbidden

These are only a handful of the possible messages you might find when encountering a 403 error. In fact, some websites even have their own custom 403’s.

## How are 403 errors different from other 4xx errors?

To help you understand the difference between generic 400 errors and other types of client-side errors, we’ve outlined some of the common types of 4xx responses you might encounter on your site.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Client Error** | **Description** |
| 400: Bad Request | This indicates that the server was unable to process the request due to malformed syntax or invalid data provided by the client. |
| 401: Unauthorized | This means the request requires authentication, and the client has not provided valid credentials or has insufficient access rights. |
| 402: Payment Required | Although not widely used, this error code indicates that the requested resource requires payment before it can be accessed. |
| 403: Forbidden | The client does not have the necessary permissions to access the requested resource, even if they are authenticated. |
| 404: Not found | [The requested resource is not found](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/08/what-is-error-404-how-to-fix-it-on-your-site.html) on the server, usually because the URL is incorrect or the resource has been removed. |
| 405: Method Not Allowed | The HTTP method used in the request is not supported for the specified resource. |
| 406: Not Acceptable | The server cannot produce a response that matches the criteria specified by the client in the request headers. |
| 407: Proxy Authentication Required | This is similar to a 401 error, but it indicates that the client must authenticate itself with the proxy server before accessing. |
| 408: Request Timeout | The server did not receive a complete request from the client within the allotted time frame. |
| 409: Conflict | The requested operation could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. |
