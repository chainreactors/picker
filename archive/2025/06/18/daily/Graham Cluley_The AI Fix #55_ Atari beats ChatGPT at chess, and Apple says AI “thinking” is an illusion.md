In episode 55 of The AI Fix, Gemini thinks a little meth won‚Äôt hurt, Mark realises what a terrifying 45mph ‚Äúrobot bird‚Äù is really for, Graham finds a surprising number of TikTokers in the bible, an AI discovers dust on Mars, Google forgets what year it is, and Apple finally enters the AI chat.

Graham finds out what happened when ChatGPT took on 1979‚Äôs Atari Video Chess at his favourite ‚Äúsport‚Äù, and Mark explains why Apple has been raining on the AI reasoning parade.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
