SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that provides a suite of integrated and end-to-end business applications for various industries, including sales, procurement, manufacturing, transportation, and integration with other cloud systems such as Ariba, DMC, etc. In this blog post, we will explore an end-to-end make-to-stock (MTS) scenario that organizations can implement with SAP S/4HANA Cloud to streamline their logistic operations and drive business growth.

A make-to-stock scenario is a production strategy where an organization produces goods in advance of customer demand. This scenario is typically used when an organization has a high demand for a product and wants to ensure that they have stock on hand to meet that demand.

Let’s have a quick look at how efficiently end to end logistic process runs in the S/4HANA Cloud:

There was a small manufacturing company that produced high-quality bikes. They had a loyal customer base and a steady demand for their bikes, but the company struggled to keep up with the demand. They often ran out of stock and had to turn away customers, which impacted their reputation and bottom line.

The company knew it needed a better way to manage its operations and decided to invest in SAP S/4HANA Cloud. With this powerful ERP system, they could implement an end-to-end make-to-stock scenario that helped them streamline their operations and drive business growth.

The first step was to create a production plan based on forecasted demand for their bikes. SAP S/4HANA Cloud allowed them to set production targets, determine required resources, and schedule production runs. They were also able to perform what-if simulations to optimize the production plan.

Next, the Plant manager performed material requirement planning (MRP) to determine the materials and components required to produce the bikes. With SAP S/4HANA Cloud, they were able to perform MRP in real-time, ensuring that the necessary materials were on hand when needed.

With the MRP run, they came to know that some of the components of BOMs were out of stock and needed to be procured immediately to start the production process.

They immediately triggered sourcing & procurement operations to get the necessary components stock. Now purchase managers were able to manage their various procurement operations like subcontracting, sourcing from the Ariba network, etc, including the creation and management of purchase orders, tracking of goods receipts and invoices, and managing supplier relationships.

S/4Hana Cloud integration with Ariba enables companies to streamline their sourcing and procurement processes. With Ariba, companies can manage their supplier relationships more effectively, automate their sourcing and procurement processes, and gain real-time visibility into their spending and supplier performance.

Once all required components were in stock, then they created production orders and tracked their progress through the production process. SAP S/4HANA Cloud allowed them to track materials consumption, monitor production costs, and manage quality control.
