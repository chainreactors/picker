# Tor anonymity compromised by law enforcement. Is it still safe to use?

Posted: September 19, 2024

Despite people generally considering the Tor network as an essential tool for anonymous browsing, german law enforcement agencies have managed to de-anonymize Tor users after putting surveillance on Tor servers for months.

Before we go into the what the agencies did, let’s take a look at some basics of Tor.

## How Tor works

On a daily basis, millions of people use the Tor network to browse privately and visit websites on the [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/07/explained-dark-web). Tor enhances privacy by directing internet traffic through a minimum of three randomly chosen routers, or nodes. During this process user data is encrypted before it reaches the destination via the exit node, ensuring a user’s activities and [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) remain confidential and secure.

Here’s a closer look at how this mechanism works:

* **Entry node:** When you start browsing with Tor, your connection is first directed to an entry node, also known as a guard node. This is where your internet traffic enters the Tor network, with your [IP address](https:///www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ip-address) only visible to this node.
* **Middle nodes:** After entering the Tor network, your traffic passes through one or more middle nodes. These nodes are randomly selected, and each one knows only the IP address of the previous relay and the next relay. This prevents any single relay from knowing the complete path of your internet activity.
* **Exit node:** The last relay in the chain is the exit node. It decrypts the information from the middle relays and sends it out to the destination. Importantly, the exit node strips away layers of encryption to communicate with the target server but does not know the origin of the traffic, ensuring that your IP address remains hidden.

This layered security model, like peeling an onion, is where Tor gets its name. Tor is an acronym for The Onion Router. Each layer ensures that none of the nodes in the path knows where the traffic came from and where it is going, significantly increasing the user’s anonymity and making it exceedingly difficult for anyone to trace the full path of the data.

Although many researchers [theoretically](https://thesecmaster.com/blog/4-types-of-attacks-on-the-tor-network-to-de-anonymize-tor-users) considered that de-anonymization was possible, in general it was thought practically unfeasible if a user followed all the necessary security measures.

## How did the de-anonymization work?

German news outlet NDR [reports](https://www.ndr.de/fernsehen/sendungen/panorama/aktuell/Investigations-in-the-so-called-darknet-Law-enforcement-agencies-undermine-Tor-anonymisation%2Ctoreng100.html) that law enforcement agencies got hold of data while performing server surveillance which was processed in such a way that it completely cancelled Tor anonymity. The reporters saw documents that showed four successful measures in just one investigation.

After following up on a [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/19benkx/operation_liberty_lane_le_running_gaurd_and/) and two years of investigation, the reporters came to the conclusion that Tor users can be de-anonymized by correlating the timing patterns of network traffic enter...
