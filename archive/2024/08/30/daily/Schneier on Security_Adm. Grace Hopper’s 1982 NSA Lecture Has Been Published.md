## Adm. Grace Hopper’s 1982 NSA Lecture Has Been Published

The “[long lost lecture](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/07/the-nsa-has-a-long-lost-lecture-by-adm-grace-hopper.html)” by Adm. Grace Hopper [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9iqF5uTFk) [been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW7ZHpKuqZg) published by the NSA. (Note that there are two parts.)

It’s a wonderful talk: funny, engaging, wise, prescient. Remember that talk was given in 1982, less than a year before the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP and the internet went operational. She was a remarkable person.

Listening to it, and thinking about the audience of NSA engineers, I wonder how much of what she’s talking about as the future of computing—miniaturization, parallelization—was being done in the present and in secret.

I still distinctly remember when Grace Hopper gave a presentation at the little community college I was attending my first class in COBOL.

She held up a piece of copper wire and asked us all what it was. After few scattered incorrect guesses she told us, “This is how far electricity travels in a nanosecond.”

And with that the entire auditorium hung on every word she said and thanked her with a standing ovation that lasted until she left the stage.

What an amazing person…

I was fortunate enough to attend one of her famous nanosecond speeches around the ’85-86 range. The ~30cm wire is still somewhere in the house.

One might wonder what the process of removing “undocumented features” from code would be called if it weren’t for that moth.

Rest in Peace admirable Admiral Hopper!

Great news! Thank you for the links. I am glad someone persisted.

Regarding the nanosecond example above. It is true that signals propagate through 30 cm of free space in a nanosecond. however, in the same nanosecond electrical signals propagate only around 20 cm along a cable, e.g., coax or twisted pair. Propagation speed through an optical fiber is similar. If you can believe it this has led to a market in free space optical and microwave networking for high-frequency traders. I guess every ns counts for those guys.

On PCB traces propagation can be slower still, maybe 15 cm per nanosecond. Signal propagation speed through a wire in the metal layers of an ASIC can be very slow indeed, less than 3 cm per ns in some cases.

Unfortunately, yt-dlp seems to not work: “ERROR: [youtube] si9iqF5uTFk: Sign in to confirm you’re not a bot. This helps protect our community. Learn more”

Does anyone have a workaround or mirror? I don’t have or want a Youtube account.

Given the public interest and the assistance from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), I’m sure it will soon be published in the raw format on a government website (or at least available in a digital format for cost) rather than only on youtube with whatever quality they decide to serve

Miniaturization was already well under way at that point, microprocessors; the IVM PC was already under development but not yet released). Parallel computing, too. I did some work for USN that used systolic array processing only 3 years later, and I doubt that was the earliest.

My perception before I read Bruce’s comment was that the parallelization and miniaturization comments from Hopper reflected the implications of the rise of then low cost commodity (PC) computers in 1982, which weren’t secret at all, but were quite striking to anyone in the field. Apple IIs had been around for five years penetrating the technical upper middle class and the IBM PC one year.

But I wouldn’t put it past someone attempting highly parallel DES ASIC crackers or similar back then in secret too. DES was introduced in 1974…

I do wonder if you can back into the price tag of such a device to figure out how many bits NSA could crack for what budget level and assess whether they likely created such a machine and how it might have affected DES bit length arguments and subsequent decisions.

c.becker – This is coming from a person that only uses a mirror when he shaves…

When I come across a YT video in my default browser that I actually want to watch, I copy the link and drop it into the DuckDuckGo browser. DDG removes all the advertising, comments, the entire right sidebar with dancing YT suggestions. You are left with just the YT video you wanted to see.

So far I have yet to find a YT video it doesn’t work with, including the “published” link at the bottom of Bruce’s post.

Give it a try and let me (us) know if it works for you!

One of my biggest regrets during college in the early eighties was not attending a lecture by Adm. Hopper when she was on campus.

@c.becker
Update your yt-dl: I used ClipGrab 3.9.7 on Debian here no problem.
