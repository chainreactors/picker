[SAP Tech Night](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/bengaluru-blog-posts/announcing-sap-tech-night-bengaluru-25th-nov-2022/ba-p/125799) was held yesterday at the Bangalore site of [SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about/labs-india.html). Let me give you a quick overview of SAP Tech Night before I discuss my experience as a speaker.

Taking place locally, SAP Tech Night is an in-person community gathering organized by SAP Community members. In this edition, the event was hosted at SAP Labs Bengaluru, I really thank them for encouraging SAP community events in India. This event differs from others in that community members are responsible for setting the agenda and format.

Yesterday, In its first installment, curious community members with a common belief in sharing knowledge and continuous learning, joined at the Bangalore office to learn about SAP Cloud Application Lifecycle Management, SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), and SAP Master Data Integration.

I participated as a speaker for the first time at this event, which was really significant to me. I was initially reluctant to say yes when I was asked if I would be interested in taking a session on SAP CAP. I think it's because I had never done it. However, persuaded myself to view this as a learning.

Despite my session being at 6 o'clock, I got at the workplace where the event was scheduled around 4 o'clock. You can thus imagine my nervousness. To my amazement, a few people had already arrived there and were chit-chatting. I actively introduced myself and jump right into their conversation. I had quite a lot of insightful conversations, particularly regarding SAP BTP. I felt a little more at ease after these conversations.

I was no longer anxious when the time came because by that time I had some knowledge about my audience. That made it easier for me to adapt my presentation to the audience's needs. My very first lesson was this. Knowing your audience will help you tailor your story for maximum impact. In this presentation, I gave a brief explanation of CAP and how it integrates with SAP Fiori Elements, along with a brief live demonstration. I learned another lesson after the session. It's acceptable to feel anxious or afraid. But occasionally, a simple "yes" is all that is required. I would thus urge community members to participate in such activities, to share their knowledge, and to also learn from others.

After the seminar, additional insightful conversations about CAP as well as the future of BTP and how to move from conventional ABAP programming to cloud development ensued. The eagerness among community members to learn about SAP BTP was undoubtedly motivating.

All in all, there was a lot of conversation, inquiries, new faces, and pictures.

Here are a few images from the occasion:

Last but not least, I'd want to express my gratitude to the organizers maheshkumar.palavalli, vijay.simha pavankumarjagadeesh89, and lalitmohan7443 for taking time out of their busy schedules and putting so much effort to make this happen. Also, thanks to [Sonal Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonal-kumar-a292946/) and syambabu.allu , who spoke along with me and explained SAP Cloud ALM and SAP MDI, respectively.

I am hopeful to see a bigger turnout at our upcoming community activities.
