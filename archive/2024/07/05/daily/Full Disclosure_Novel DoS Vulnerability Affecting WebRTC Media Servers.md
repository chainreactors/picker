Dear Colleagues,

We have published a new blog post discussing a novel Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability affecting WebRTC media
servers.

## Executive summary (TL;DR)

A critical denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability has been identified in media servers that process WebRTC’s DTLS-SRTP,
specifically in their handling of ClientHello messages. This vulnerability arises from a race condition between ICE and
DTLS traffic and can be exploited to disrupt media sessions, compromising the availability of real-time communication
services. Mitigations include filtering packets based on ICE-validated IP and port combinations. The article also
indicates safe testing methods and strategies for detecting the attack.
