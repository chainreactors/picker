# Weekly Update 320

04 November 2022

I feel like life is finally complete: I have beaches, sunshine *and* fast internet! (Yes, and of course an amazing wife, but that goes without saying ðŸ˜Š) For the folks asking via various channels, the speed is not exactly symmetrical at 1000/400 and I'm honestly not sure why that's the case here in Australia. I also had to shell out quite a bit extra to go from 50 up to a "business" plan of 400 up, but with the volumes of data I ship around it'll make a pretty big difference to the way I work over time. Also this week, much more on the work we're doing with HIBP from pricing the annual plans to a proper support system via Zendesk. I'm really hoping that by next week's update we'll have shipped the new rate limits too, stay tuned for that but for now, here's number 320:
