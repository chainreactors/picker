As threats grow and attack surfaces get more complex, companies continue to struggle with the multitude of tools they utilize to handle endpoint security and management. This can leave gaps in an enterprise's ability to identify devices that are accessing the network and in ensuring that those devices are compliant with security policies. These gaps are often seen in outdated spreadsheets that are used to track and manage asset inventory, configurations, vulnerabilities, and more. Ultimately, this increases organizational risk while stifling efficiency and productivity.

That's why unified security and endpoint management has gained ground, as noted in [Gartner's Hype Cycle for Endpoint Security, 2022](https://www.gartner.com/document/4022305). As part of the market's need to gain a clearer, real-time picture of their devices and security posture, Syxsense launched its Enterprise platform last year to address the three key elements of endpoint management and security: vulnerabilities, patch, and compliance. According to Syxsense, unified security and endpoint management (USEM) is the answer to enabling teams to gain control over the widespread use of personal devices and the increasing mobility of company-owned devices on the network.

With that in mind, they developed support of mobile devices in addition to traditional devices like desktops and laptops, based on a Zero Trust framework for user and device-based access to resources that's easy to use. This gives teams the ability handle endpoint management and security operations from a single platform.

We recently took a closer look at the Syxsense Enterprise platform.

## **First things first**

[Syxsense's platform](https://www.syxsense.com/gc-demo-syxsense): What you need to know before diving in:

* A 14-day free trial is available and trial users have access to Syxsense Enterprise, with features like Zero Trust and MDM available that you can test with your own devices.
* Cortex automation engine: While many other solutions offer methods for detecting vulnerabilities, Syxsense Enterprise offers automatic remediation of those vulnerabilities. The automation is through a drag and drop interface that doesn't require any coding and supports task and workflow sequencing and policy implementation. A number of common workflows have already been built out and you can run them on your devices without having to set up the automation on your own.

To facilitate this product review, the team at Syxsense gave us access to the latest version of their platform. Here's what we found:

## **Getting Started**

Using the Syxsense platform, security teams can gain visibility into their environment and discover the endpoints communicating over the network. Let's say I'm a system administrator interested in trying the service. This is the first screen I see. In the corner it shows where I can easily Add Devices so I know where to start and I can see the dashboards where information on the devices I add will display.

When I go to add a device, it shows me the supported device types and the downloadable agent for each type. I also see the Discovery Agent where I can find and add multiple devices that have the agent downloaded already.

Using the devices I just added to my inventory, I can test what the platform can offer.

The 'Devices' button on the left side panel shows you all the devices that have already been added to your inventory.

What caught my attention was the little circle next to the device name. The green, orange, or red color of the circle indicates the current health of the device based on patch status and active vulnerabilities so you can see the health of your devices at a glance.

By right clicking "Queries", you can now access the Query Designer and filter your devices with different attributes you select.

For a sample, I ran a query for all devices running Windows OS. After you run the query, you can perform tasks on the devices returned from your selection.
