The UK government is warning that Russia's APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear or Forest Blizzard) has been deploying previously unknown malware to harvest Microsoft email credentials and steal access to compromised accounts.

Both the UK and the US have previously said APT28 is part of Russia's General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) military unit [26165](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/21/russias_fancy_bear_alert/). Friday's malware revelations - dubbed Authentic Antics by the UK - came just hours after the British government [sanctioned](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/profile-gru-cyber-and-hybrid-threat-operations/profile-gru-cyber-and-hybrid-threat-operations) three GRU units (26165, 29155, and 74455) and several individual spies, accused of "conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity over many years."

Authentic Antics was initially discovered following a 2023 breach investigated by Microsoft and NCC Group, but today is the first time that the government has attributed it to the Russian military crew.
