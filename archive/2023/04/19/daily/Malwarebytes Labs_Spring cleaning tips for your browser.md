# Spring cleaning tips for your browser

Posted: April 18, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

When you are resting up from the physical part of your spring cleaning and you’re sitting behind your laptop or swiping left on your phone, why don’t you speed up your browsing experience with a few simple actions?

Let’s start with your browser, as that usually has the most impact on your perception of how “fast” your device is. In this post we will focus on the settings for Chrome since that is the browser with the biggest market share, but many browsers (like Edge) will have the same settings because they are based on the same Chromium codebase or they will have very similar settings (Firefox). We’ll also mention where you can find similar or the same settings in Safari, if available. These will be shown in red.

There may be slight differences in the methodology and screenshots, based on the type of device, the operating system, your language settings, and maybe even the manufacturer of your device, but the basics should be pretty much the same as the Windows-based methods and screenshots shown in this post.

## Backups

Before we start let’s take some precautions to minimize the chance of having regrets about our actions afterwards.

1. Backup your currently open bookmarks: More (three dots) > **Bookmarks** > **Bookmark all tabs…** [(Safari](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-bookmark-all-tabs-in-safari-iphone-mac/): In the Menu bar > select **Bookmarks** > then choose **Add Bookmarks for these {number of open} Tabs**.)

![bookmark all open tabs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/easset_upload_file34343_262858_e.png)

This will create a Set of bookmarks of the currently open tabs.

You will see a prompt where you can provide a name for this set of bookmarks. Something with the date in it would make it easier to find if you plan to do this more often.

Name that set and save it by clicking the **Save** button.

![type a name for the set of bookmarks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/easset_upload_file67772_262858_e.png)

2. Exporting your data can be used to synchronize your browser between devices, but it can also be used as a backup for your data.

To create a backup click on More (three dots) > **Settings** > **Turn on sync…**Then [log in to your Google account](https://myaccount.google.com) and access sync settings by clicking on Settings:

![turn on synchronization](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/easset_upload_file33980_262858_e.jpg)

[(Safari](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/back-up-safari-bookmarks-passwords-76647.html): click the Apple menu in the top left corner of your screen. Then click **System Preferences** > Click **iCloud** > select the checkbox next to **Safari**.)

Then select **Manage what you sync** and turn on **Sync everything** if it’s disabled, or make a custom selection of what you want to back up.

Once you’ve decided what to sync, it’s all automatically available across devices, as long as you sign in with the same Google account. When push comes to shove you can use this as a backup to restore your browser. If you were not using sync between devices before you started, you may want to turn it off once you ar...
