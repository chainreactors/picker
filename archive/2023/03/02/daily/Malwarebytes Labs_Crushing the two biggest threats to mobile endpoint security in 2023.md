## Crushing the two biggest threats to mobile endpoint security in 2023

March 1, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Don’t let their small size fool you: mobile devices can have a [big impact on your security posture](https://www.threatdown.com/glossary/what-is-mobile-device-security/). It’s easy to see why, considering that almost [**half of organizations**](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/mobile-security-index/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ps:psao:na:8884610289&utm_term=verizon%20mobile%20security%20index&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=PublicSector&utm_content=PublicSector&ds_cid=71700000081860229&ds_cid=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2-2eBhClARIsAGLQ2Rm41kGZ6p6awmxhLrM-0cT_OJQiegxTZD3bRCFjkZ-VKLqCcql7IfoaAhryEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) said they suffered a mobile-related compromise in 2022.

Malware and phishing are two particular mobile threats that you need to defend against in 2023. Just check out the following stats from last year:

* **18 percent of clicked phishing emails** in 2022 came from a mobile device. (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2022)
* **46 percent organizations** that had suffered a mobile-related security breach in 2022 said that **app threats were a contributing factor**. (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2022)
* 9 percent of organizations suffered a**mobile malware attack** in 2022. (Check Point 2023 Cyber Security Report)

In addition, according to Malwarebytes research, 45 percent of schools reported that at least one cybersecurity incident last year started with Chromebooks or other mobile devices.

In this post, we’ll talk about the threat that phishing and malware pose to mobile endpoint security and how to crush them.

## Mobile devices have a huge target on their backs

Mobile devices are a key part of today’s modern business: [56 percent of employees](https://www.zimperium.com/global-mobile-threat-report/) rely on at least four to eight enterprise applications on their mobile device.

But wherever sensitive data exists, threat actors are out there trying to get their hands on it.

The explosion of bring-your-devices (BYOD) policies during and after the pandemic created a large, new attack surface. **Employees love mobile devices for their convenient access to corporate data systems; attackers love them for the same reason**.

## According to the latest data…\*

* **18 percent of clicked phishing attacks** came from a mobile device. (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2022)
* **58 percent of company mobile devices** that had at least one malicious URL clicked. (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2022)
* 16 percent of company mobile devices had at least one malware or riskware app installed. (Verizon Mobile Security Index 2022)

## Malware on Android

First things first, malware is a much bigger threat to Android devices than it is to iOS devices, as iOS malware is extremely rare.

Malware on mobile Android devices comes in many forms, including adware, ransomware, trojan-banker (aka ‘bankers’), and trojan-dropper (aka ‘droppers’). Droppers, considered the “most Trojan of Trojans,” disguise themselves as innocent apps to steal personal and financial data. Droppers can install copies of themselves, and because they can drop software that downloads other malware, they can be used to establish a permanent gateway into a smartphone, and then into a business

[In our recently published 2023 State of Malware Report](https://try.threatdown.com/2024-state-of-malware/), Malwarebytes found that droppers accounted for 14 percent of detections on Android. Other malware is more widespread, but **droppers pose the greatest danger to organizations**.
