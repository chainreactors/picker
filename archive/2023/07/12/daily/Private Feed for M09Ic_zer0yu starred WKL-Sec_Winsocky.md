# Winsocky

Winsocket implementation for Cobalt Strike. Used to communicate with the victim using winsockets instead of the traditional ways.

## Blog Post

[Developing Winsock Communication in Malware](https://whiteknightlabs.com/2023/07/06/developing-winsock-communication-in-malware/)

## Usage

### client.c

Is the client which receives the command from the server, executes the command in a child process, parse its output and send it back to the server.
Open the solution (.sln) file to compile the code with Visual Studio.

### server.c

The BOF script which is loaded to Cobalt Strike. It connects to the client's Winsocket's server, thus sending the command and receiving back the response.

To compile it, use `make`:

```
cd Server && make
```

Then load `socket.cna` to Cobalt Strike. To use it, run the following command:

```
socky <command>
```

**Note:** Commands with whiteline spaces (e.x.: `whoami /all`) must be wrapped in "".
