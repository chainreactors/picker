# Phishing evolves beyond email to become latest Android app threat

Posted: February 11, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

There are plenty of phish in the sea, and the latest ones have little interest in your email inbox.

In 2024, Malwarebytes detected more than 22,800 phishing apps on [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus), according to the recent [2025 State of Malware report](https://www.threatdown.com/dl-state-of-malware-2025/). Of those malicious apps, 5,200 could subvert one of the strongest security practices available today, called “multifactor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication),” by prying into basic text messages sent to a device. Another 4,800 could even read information from an Android device’s “Notifications” bar to obtain the same info.

These “Android phishing apps” may sound high-tech, but they are not. They don’t crack into [password managers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) or spy on passwords entered for separate apps. Instead, they present a modern wrapper on a classic form of theft: Phishing.

By disguising themselves as legitimate apps—including for services like TikTok, Spotify, and WhatsApp—Android phishing apps can trick victims into typing in their real usernames and passwords on bogus login screens that are controlled entirely by cybercriminals. If enough victims unwittingly send their passwords, the cyber thieves may even bundle the login credentials for sale on the [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web). Once the passwords are sold, the new, malicious owners will attempt to use individual passwords for a variety of common online accounts—testing whether, say, an email account password is the same one used for a victim’s online banking system, their mortgage payment platform, or their Social Security portal.

The volume of these apps and their capabilities underscore the importance of securing yourself and your devices. With vigilance, safe behavior, and some extra support, you can avoid Android phishing apps and protect your accounts from cybercriminals.

## **Same trick, new delivery**

For more than a decade, phishing was often understood as an email threat. Cybercriminals would send emails disguised as legitimate communications from major businesses, such as Netflix, Uber, Instagram, Google, and more. These emails would frequently warn recipients about a problem with their accounts—a password needed to be updated, or a policy change required a login.

But when victims followed the links within these [malicious emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/phishing-email), they’d be brought to a website that, while appearing genuine, would actually be in complete control of cybercriminals. Fooled by similar color schemes, company logos, and familiar layouts, victims would “log in” to their account by entering their username and password. In reality, those usernames and passwords would just be delivered to cybercriminals on the other side of the website.

There never was a problem with a user’s account, and there never was a real request for information from the company. Instead, the entire back-and-forth was a charade.

Over time, [phishing emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) have advanced—cybercriminals...
