Partner Content In today's highly connected and technology-driven world, digital resilience is not just a competitive advantage for banks - it is a necessity.

The financial sector, with its vast repositories of sensitive data and critical payment systems, is a prime target for cyberattacks. Breaches, outages, and disruptions can erode customer trust, cause reputational damage, and lead to significant financial losses. For example, ransomware attacks on financial institutions have caused multi-day outages, crippling operations and leaving customers stranded. Similarly, supply chain vulnerabilities - such as compromised third-party software - can expose banks to cascading failures, as seen in high-profile incidents like the SolarWinds hack.

Human errors, too, can lead to significant disruptions. From accidental misconfigurations to delays in patching vulnerabilities, small oversights often snowball into large-scale issues. These examples underscore why banks must not only prevent and mitigate disruptions but also prepare to recover swiftly when they occur. Digital resilience is about ensuring continuity and trust even in the face of inevitable challenges.

**What digital resilience means for banks**

Digital resilience is far more than operational continuity; it is the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to digital disruptions. For banks, this extends to maintaining service availability during cyberattacks, ensuring data integrity, and safeguarding customer trust in a dynamic threat landscape. It requires robust architectures that span multi-cloud environments, secure data pipelines, and adaptive operational workflows.

Banks must embrace a proactive approach that goes beyond the traditional "prevent, detect, and respond" framework. While significant investments have been made in this area, the reality is that outages will happen, whether due to cyber threats, system failures, or human errors. Digital resilience demands a holistic strategy that integrates prevention with recovery, ensuring banks can rebound quickly with minimal impact on operations and customers.

The focus on prevention, detection, and response has served the banking sector well, but it is not sufficien...
