In 2022, Black Duck commissioned the SANS Institute to investigate how firms are aligning their development, security, and operations teams with the organizational values, practices, and tools that compose the secure DevOps, or DevSecOps, approach.

In this series of blog posts, we'll look at what the [SANS study](/resources/analyst-reports/sans-devsecops-survey.html) can teach us about how implementing effective [DevSecOps](/blog/devsecops-best-practices.html) can help organizations institute secure coding without sacrificing development velocity, institute policies and testing to automate security, and help those involved with triage and remediation work more efficiently.

Let's start by looking at what the SANS study reveals about automating security testing and remediation, and setting policies as code.

## Identifying important aspects of DevSecOps

When asked which elements they thought were crucial to their security programs, respondents identified shared security ownership as the most important. Increasing communication between the development, operations, and security teams was highlighted as a key to success by 56% of respondents, up from 51% in the 2021 results. Accordingly, 52% of respondents said ensuring developer buy-in was crucial, while 48% identified training developers on secure coding practices as vital to their program.

Effective DevSecOps depends on contributors owning their role in security, so developers who have a recognized role in an organization's security risk posture help ensure that a DevSecOps program does not underperform and an organization's risk does not rise.
