Next month, AMC+ is premiering a new series about furries that tracked down sexual abusers hiding within the furry fandom. It’s called, *The Furry Detectives: Unmasking A Monster*.

You can watch the trailer for this below. And I do recommend watching the trailer before reading the rest of this blog post.

Done?

Okay.

## Bad Takes

Almost immediately as soon as this was posted online, Twitter does what Twitter does and bad takes like this began to circulate.

(Screenshots of said tweet even percolated into other platforms, which is ultimately where I saw it.)

![Tweet from @lessyfreaky: "This is going to set us back DECADES"  Included is the YouTube thumbnail for the above trailer for The Furry Detectives: Unmasking A Monster.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png?resize=587%2C637&ssl=1)

Twitter remains a bad take factory.

I’ve seen two reactions to this tweet, from reasonable people:

1. No, it won’t. The actual crimes themselves caused irreparable harm to our community, but the best thing for a community to do when there’s a problem is to **take out the fucking trash**. And we did. And that documentary is all about us doing exactly that. It’s a good thing to talk about this.
2. Regardless of the facts, because of the ongoing misinformation campaigns (litterbox hoaxes that amount to nothing more than thinly-veiled queerphobia, bills being proposed to solve the virtually nonexistent problem of furries in public school, etc.), this will add fuel to the ragebaiting headlines and outright lies about the furry fandom.

Not to mince words, reaction number 2 is a valid fucking concern, and I have no rebuttal to offer. Only time will tell how it plays out.

But *unreasonable* people aren’t posting either of those two reactions online. Instead, they’re insisting that we should all be *shutting up*.

The replies to that tweet are full of unreasonable people.

![@fuffat replies:  FUCCCK I HATE IT  There has to be a way to talk about the furry community without portraying it like that episode of CSI ](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=594%2C669&ssl=1)

Narrator: This is nothing like “that episode of CSI”.

And, predictably, the quote tweets were similarly misguided:

![@cosmocolliee quote tweets to add:  Y’know what this is your own damn faults, if you didn’t excuse borderline zoophilic behaviour every single time and blame it on purity culture when you get backlash. Yes joking about Pokémon like that is a problem….](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=587%2C230&ssl=1)

Sigh.

I could include several more examples of bad takes, but I think we have enough of them to make my point. Just know that *a lot* of reactions to *The Furry Detectives* followed the same formula.

### Why Are We Even Talking About Bad Takes On Social Media?

While I doubt these twits would agree with each other in a social media discussion, it’s pretty easy to see a **common narrative structure** that underlies many of their arguments.

> If anyone thinks I’m cherry-picking, I invite you to go to the original tweet and punish your curiosity on the other bad takes.

The argument implied by their position goes like this:

1. Aesthetics, optics, and purity are held higher than all else.
2. Talking about bad or shameful things is to be discouraged.
3. If you talk to the media about the bad things, or tolerate something that isn’t bad but *a moron might superficially get confused and think it bad*, then **you deserve social consequences**.

Naturally, I disagree with all of these points.

1. Good actions are more important than good optics. Since aesthetics are largely subjective, aesthetic similarities are not evidence of equivalence. Sexuality isn’t inherently evil (but consent is absolutely necessary).
2. Talking about bad or shameful things is essential to having a healthy community.
3. If **I** talk to the media [recklessly](https://soatok.blog/2023/06/06/on-furries-and-the-media/), **you** do not *deserve* the collateral damage caused by my recklessness. And vice versa.

But I’m not here to offer mere *disagreement*.

The worldviews that follow the flawed structure I outlined above have observable downsides to the communities that perpetuate them.

For starters, perpetuating negative peace (sweeping bad actors under the rug instead of dealing with them transparently) is how you get [missing stairs](https://www.blackburncenter.org/post/the-missing-stair-theory-and-gender-based-violence).

Refusing to openly act against (let alone *discuss*) bad actors is what gives abusers cover to hide and operate within our community.

I’ve said it before, more eloquently, but it didn’t stick. So here’s a bullet point list intead:

* The darkest period in the furry fandom’s history *wasn’t* the zoosadist abuse coming to light.
* The revelation was the *end* of the dark period.
* The dark period was all the time that the abuse was happening, and the people who knew did nothing to stop it, and the rest of us didn’t know about it.

People who cannot digest this simple concept have no business in the discussion. They’re simply not qualified to be taken seriously.

> Quick aside:
>
> One common thread from the more puritanical arguments made by younger furries is they seem to be coming from a place of, “If my parents find out about [bad thing], I won’t be allowed to participate in [group].”
>
> That is the incentive structure that most reliably explains their talking points and decisionmaking, anyway.
>
> There may be more going on than that, but they don’t explain their positions very well.

To wrap up this section, the existence of bad takes was always a certainty. In that regard, the ones I shared in this blog post aren’t really novel. But understanding the assumptions and the framework that the arguments arise from is useful.

## Actions Speak Louder Than Words

As valuable as talking about the bad is, actually fucking doing something about it is way more impactful.

Sometimes, that means identifying and ousting abusers from your community.

Sometimes, that just means walking away from a discussion group when you raise concerns about someone defending sexual abuse and [they trivialize your concern as mere “drama”](https://bsky.app/profile/soatok.bsky.social/post/3lrbb26qcoc2w).
