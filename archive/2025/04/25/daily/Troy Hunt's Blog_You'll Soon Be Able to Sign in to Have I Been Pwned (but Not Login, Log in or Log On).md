# You'll Soon Be Able to Sign in to Have I Been Pwned (but Not Login, Log in or Log On)

24 April 2025

How do seemingly little things manage to consume so much time?! [We had a suggestion this week that instead of being able to login to the new HIBP website, you should instead be able to log in](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/ux-rebuild/issues/99?ref=troyhunt.com#issuecomment-2822423150). This initially confused me because I've been used to logging on to things for decades:

So, I went and signed in (yep, different again) to X and asked the masses what the correct term was:

> When accessing your [@haveibeenpwned](https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=troyhunt.com) dashboard, which of the following should you do? Preview screen for reference: [https://t.co/9gqfr8hZrY](https://t.co/9gqfr8hZrY?ref=troyhunt.com)

Which didn't result in a conclusive victor, so, I started browsing around.

[Cloudflare's Zero Trust docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/login-page/?ref=troyhunt.com) contain information about customising the login page, which I assume you can do once you log in:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-11.png)

Another, uh, "popular" site prompts you to log in:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-8.png)

After which you're invited to sign in:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-9.png)

You can log in to Canva, which is clearly indicated by the HTML title, which suggests you're on the login page:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-12.png)

You can log on to the Commonwealth Bank down here in Australia:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-13.png)

But the login page for ANZ bank requires to log in, unless you've forgotten your login details:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-15.png)

Ah, but many of these are just the difference between the noun "login" (the page is a thing) and the verb "log in" (when you perform an action), right? Well... depends who you bank with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-16.png)

And maybe you don't log in or login at all:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-17.png)

Finally, from the darkness of seemingly interchangeable terms that may or may not violate principles of English language, emerged a pattern. You also sign in to Google:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-18.png)

And Microsoft:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-19.png)

And Amazon:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-20.png)

And Yahoo:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-22.png)

And, as I mentioned earlier, X:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/image-21.png)

And now, Have I Been Pwned:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/04/IMG_3333.jpg)

There are some notable exceptions (Facebook and ChatGPT, for example), but "sign in" did emerge as the frontrunner among the world's most popular sites. If I really start to overthink it, I do feel that "log[whatever]" implies something different to why we authenticate to systems today and is more a remnant of a bygone era. But frankly, that argument is probably no more valid than whether you're doing a verb thing or a noun thing.
