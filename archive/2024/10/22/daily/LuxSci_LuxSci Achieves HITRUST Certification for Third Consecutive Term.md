# LuxSci Achieves HITRUST Certification for Third Consecutive Term

October 21st, 2024

We’re thrilled to announce our latest data security achievements here at LuxSci! Once again, LuxSci has achieved [HITRUST CSF® certification](https://hitrustalliance.net/), following a multi-step process that includes a deep assessment, validation, and quality assurance analysis for a company and its products. Our 2024-26 certification marks the third consecutive time that LuxSci has received the 2-year HITRUST certification, meeting the rigorous standards set by the HITRUST CSF framework.

In related news, LuxSci, which is GDPR compliant, has also renewed its US-EU Data Privacy Framework ([DPF](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/)) certification for the next 12 months. According to the certification, U.S. companies that participate in the DPF provide adequate levels of security for personal data transfers received from the EU within the scope of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This renewal enables us to support customers in Europe, while ensuring we meet the highest data protection standards for cross-border data transfers. For customers that do business in the EU and UK, LuxSci ensures data privacy is upheld in compliance with regulations.

Our latest security certifications are a testament to our continuous and unrelenting commitment to delivering the highest levels of data protection for healthcare communications. This includes securing email, marketing, text, forms and hosting—while also improving patient engagement and outcomes with the use of protected health information (PHI) in communications.

### **Why HITRUST Certification Matters in Healthcare**

In the healthcare industry, protecting sensitive patient data is not just a legal requirement—it’s an ethical responsibility and an imperative for any company or organization in existence today. While HIPAA compliance establishes a strong baseline for safeguarding patient information, HITRUST certification takes data protection a step further. The [HITRUST Common Security Framework](https://hitrustalliance.net/hitrust-framework) (CSF) integrates multiple regulatory standards, including HIPAA, to provide a comprehensive approach to information security, privacy, and risk management.

For healthcare organizations—and larger companies and enterprises, in particular—partnering with a HITRUST-certified provider like LuxSci provides peace of mind. You can trust that our security controls not only meet HIPAA standards but also go beyond them to address the latest industry challenges and emerging threats—we do this constantly, year after year.

### **How HITRUST Enhances Data Security Beyond HIPAA**

HIPAA establishes the essential requirements for securing protected health information (PHI), putting a solid, but basic foundation in place. HITRUST certification is recognized for going beyond the basics. Here’s how:

* **Comprehensive Approach to Risk Management:** HITRUST CSF combines various security, privacy, and regulatory standards such as NIST, ISO, and PCI-DSS, providing a more robust framework for managing risks in healthcare.
* **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** HITRUST requires organizations to continuously monitor and improve their security measures, ensuring that their defenses evolve alongside new threats and new technologies.
* **Tailored Security Controls:** HITRUST’s framework scales based on the size, complexity, and nature of the organization, offering flexibility while maintaining a high standard of security.
* **Third-Party Validation:** Achieving HITRUST certification involves rigorous third-party audits, which demonstrate that an organization’s security practices are not only in place but have been thoroughly validated.

### **The Benefits of HITRUST Certification for Healthcare**

For healthcare providers, payers, and suppliers, the advantages of partnering with a HITRUST-certified organization like LuxSci are clear:

* **Streamlined Compliance:** HITRUST certification simplifies compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks, reducing the burden of managing multiple audits and certifications.
* **Enhanced** **Patient and Customer** **Trust:** By choosing a HITRUST-certified partner, you show patients, partners, and regulators that your organization prioritizes the highest levels of security.
* **Future-Proofing:** HITRUST ensures that you’re not just up to date with today’s standards but prepared for future regulatory requirements and security challenges as they arise.

At LuxSci, we remain committed to delivering secure, scalable, and flexible HIPAA-compliant healthcare communications solutions that our clients can depend on for the highest levels of data protection.
