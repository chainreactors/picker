# GMDSOFT Tech Letter Vol14.Data Analysis Using WhatsApp Backup Feature

WhatsApp is one of the most widely used mobile messaging applications globally, with over 2 billion users across 180 countries. It protects user communications with end-to-end encryption to prevent third parties from reading them, and offers convenient features that allow users to automatically backup their data regularly or store end-to-end encrypted backups.

In particular, WhatsApp’s chat backup feature can be used to collect chat data when the app data area is inaccessible on a mobile device. The backup files generated via this chat backup feature are stored in the media area, making them easier to obtain. These files may also contain deleted records by the user, which can serve as crucial evidence in investigations.

This article aims to explain WhatsApp’s built-in backup features, compare the original DB and backup DB, and highlight the available information in the backup file. It is based on data extracted from WhatsApp v2.25.12.74 for Android.

## WhatsApp Backup Feature

WhatsApp provides two different methods for backup: the **Automatic Backup** feature, which generates a chat backup at a specified interval, and the **End-to-End Encrypted Backup** feature, which applies end-to-end encryption when generating a chat backup.

#### Automatic Backup

You can select the time interval for backup: daily, weekly, monthly, or only when you tap ‘Automatic backups’ to initiate backup.

1. Select the **three-dot menu icon** and go to ‘Settings’ > ‘Chats’.
