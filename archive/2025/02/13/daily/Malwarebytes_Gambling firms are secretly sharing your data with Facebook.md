# Gambling firms are secretly sharing your data with Facebook

Posted: February 12, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

While you might think you’re hitting the jackpot, whether you’ve consented to it or not, online gambling sites are playing with your data. Users’ data, including details of webpages they visited and buttons they clicked, are being shared with Meta, Facebook’s parent company.

[The Observer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/08/gambling-firms-secretly-shared-users-data-with-facebook-without-permission) reports that over 150 UK gambling websites have been extracting visitor data through a hidden embedded tracking tool, and then sending that data to Meta in order to profile people as gamblers and flood them with Facebook ads for casinos and betting sites.

The gambling websites used and shared data for marketing purposes—without obtaining explicit permission from the users—in an apparent breach of data protection laws. The websites include popular sites like Hollywoodbets, Sporting Index, Lottoland, and Bwin.

Of the 150 websites that were tested, 52 used a tracking tool called Meta Pixel to share data directly and without explicit consent. This data was automatically transferred when loading the webpage, before users could even accept or decline the use of their data.

The data collection resulted in the reporter—who said they never once agreed to the use of their data for marketing purposes— being inundated with ads for gambling websites. In one browsing session, the reporter encountered ads from 49 different brands, including from betting companies which were not involved in the data collection and had been using Meta Pixel within the rules.

Wolfie Christl, a data privacy expert investigating the ad tech industry commented:

> “Sharing data with Meta is highly problematic, even with consent, but doing so without explicit informed consent shows a blatant disregard for the law. Meta is complicit and must be held accountable”

This isn’t the first time that gambling sites have been caught [unlawfully selling off user data](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/sky-betting-and-gaming-users-data-ico-online-gambling), and comes amid calls for a wider investigation into the targeting of gamblers, as well as the need for more protective measures.

## Don’t gamble away your data and stay protected

Here are some ways to protect your data while using gambling (or any other) sites online:

* Use a [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn), especially on public Wi-Fi networks
* Use privacy-focused browsers and search engines, such as Brave
* Clear your browsing data when closing your browser
* Review the permissions of all your apps. Only grant them permission to access things they absolutely need.
* Disable location tracking for as many apps as possible
* Disable personalized ads as much as you can
* Keep your devices up-to-date. This protects you from vulnerabilities that cybercriminals might try to [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits)
* Install [Malwarebytes Browser Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard)—our free tool that protects against ad tracking.
