When we look at an organization’s defensive strategy, we often see a common theme — unauthorized or *excessive* access to commonly abused administrative utilities.

Organizations tend to focus a significant amount of their efforts on external threats, such as phishing and ransomware, but they often overlook one of the most dangerous attack vectors on their internal networks.

Many built-in tools are essential for IT operations and troubleshooting, so naturally, permissions have to be granted in order for the right people to use them. But when those permissions aren’t groomed or are left to their default settings, they become exposed and unmanaged liabilities that are easily weaponized by an attacker who gains a foothold on a system in your environment. Attackers today spend less time relying on custom malware and exploits, and more time abusing these trusted administrative utilities that are *built into* the operating system to execute their attacks. This is especially true on Windows-based systems. As a defender, it’s crucial that you understand how these utilities can be used against you and the risks associated with improper management of them.

## What Are Administrative Utilities?

Simply put, administrative utilities are tools that are built into the operating system. Their intended purpose is to enable a system administrator to perform tasks related to system configuration, automation, or remote management of a system.

You’ll notice that I said, “intended purpose”! These utilities are trusted components of the operating system, and they’re essential for legitimate system administration. That (unfortunately) means that they’re rarely flagged by antivirus software or endpoint detection solutions. This allows their usage to blend in with normal day-to-day system activity and makes them a prime target for abuse by attackers trying to perform reconnaissance, execute malicious code, move laterally across systems, and establish persistence without relying on traditional malware.

Now that we’ve touched on what administrative utilities are, let’s look at some of the most used (and often mis-managed) utilities on a Microsoft Windows based system.

First up is **PowerShell**, a built-in command-line shell and scripting language that is used primarily by system admins to perform tasks like automation or configuration management. Because it provides such deep access to the internals of the Windows operating system, PowerShell is extremely useful for legitimate tasks. But beware: the same capabilities that make PowerShell valuable to an admin also make it a prime target for abuse by an attacker.

**PowerShell ISE** is a GUI for PowerShell that offers some extra features that you don’t get with basic PowerShell. Multiline editing is one example.

The **Windows command prompt (cmd.exe)** is alegacy shell used to run batch scripts and system commands. Although it’s largely been replaced by PowerShell, it’s deeply integrated into every current version of Microsoft Windows and remains a common utility for executing system-level tasks. Much like PowerShell, its capabilities can be exploited by attackers during various phases of an attack.

**Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)** is a framework that allows an admin to query and modify system settings, manage services, and gather information about various system components. It also enables remote management capabilities, making it a frequent target for lateral movement by attackers. Because of its stealth, power, and versatility, WMI is a commonly abused tool, enabling nearly invisible system interaction and lateral movement without dropping any new fi...
