SAP Fiori provides a great user experience for SAP S/4HANA and is the go-to user interface for SAP S/4HANA. Customers should implement SAP Fiori to get the most from the innovations available in SAP S/4HANA. For this reason, SAP has created a dedicated Expert Guided Implementation training session to empower customers on SAP Fiori configuration.

This Expert Guided Implementation will cover SAP Fiori configuration relevant for SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud Edition versions including; Rapid Activation, role configuration, custom role creation, Spaces and Pages and SAP Build Work Zone on SAP Business Technology Platform. We will highlight tools and best practices for SAP Fiori configuration.
