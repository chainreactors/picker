We're a little over halfway through the year! Which... could be good or bad depending on your outlook... but nevermind thatâ€”EFF is here to keep you updated on the latest digital rights news, and we've got you covered with an [all-new EFFector](https://eff.org/effector)!

With [issue 37.8](https://eff.org/effector/37/8), we're covering a recent EFF investigation into [AI-generated police reports](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency), a secret deal to [sell flight passenger data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/data-brokers-are-selling-your-flight-information-cbp-and-ice) to the feds (thanks data brokers), and why [mass surveillance cannot be fixed](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/flock-safetys-feature-updates-cannot-make-automated-license-plate-readers-safe) with a software patch.

Don't forget to also check out our audio companion to EFFector as well! We're interviewing staff about some of the important work that they're doing. This time, EFF's Associate Director of Activism Sarah Hamid explains the harms caused by ALPRs and what you can do to fight back. Listen now on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/v-lqDAi4elY) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.8_20250716).
