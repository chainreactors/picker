[![RansomHub Went Dark](data:image/png;base64... "RansomHub Went Dark")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAbs_bF6VwahmJc_AXGQUO1uScFxrQuocXxBNFzsbyHf6EFSOauRaq2o8_RvP1yXd480jf9OoqMVaqkNZTnPzDdZ36UcGf87J4a2gcVO8YWi7eQgAKq1xFpF0DFU6d57c7FQJw7lR5NO1VzZQ-b94OU4VGG2jQF_eqmauhYzhh_Koln-8QLKjyTo_DwqyL/s790-rw-e365/ransomhub.jpg)

Cybersecurity researchers have revealed that [RansomHub](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/ransomhub-ransomware-group-targets-210.html)'s online infrastructure has "inexplicably" gone offline as of April 1, 2025, prompting concerns among affiliates of the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation.

Singaporean cybersecurity company Group-IB [said](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/ransomware-debris/) that this may have caused affiliates to migrate to Qilin, given that "disclosures on its DLS [data leak site] have doubled since February."

RansomHub, which first emerged in February 2024, is estimated to have stolen data from over 200 victims. It replaced two high-profile RaaS groups, LockBit and BlackCat, to become a frontrunner, courting their affiliates, including [Scattered Spider](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/scattered-spider-adopts-ransomhub-and.html) and [Evil Corp](https://blog.bushidotoken.net/2025/04/tracking-adversaries-evilcorp-ransomhub.html), with lucrative payment splits.

"Following a possible acquisition of the web application and ransomware source code of Knight (formerly Cyclops), RansomHub quickly rose in the ransomware scene, thanks to the dynamic features of its multi-platform encryptor and an aggressive, affiliate-friendly model offering substantial financial incentives," Group-IB said in a report.

RansomHub's ransomware is designed to work on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and ESXi as well as on x86, x64, and ARM architectures, while avoiding attacking companies located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Cuba, North Korea, and China. It can also encrypt local and remote file systems via SMB and SFTP.

The affiliate panel, which is used to configure the ransomware via a web interface, features a dedicated "Members" section where members of the affiliate group are given the option to create their own accounts on the device.

Affiliates have also been provided with a "Killer" module as of at least June 2024 to terminate and bypass security software using known vulnerable drivers ([BYOVD](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/researchers-uncover-malware-using-byovd.html)). However, the tool has since been discontinued owing to high detection rates.

Per [eSentire](https://www.esentire.com/blog/socket-puppet-how-ransomhub-affiliates-pull-the-strings) and [Trend Micro](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/vanhelsing-raas-launch-3-victims-5k.html), cyber-attacks have also been observed leveraging a JavaScript malware known as SocGholish (aka FakeUpdates) via compromised WordPress sites to deploy a Python-based backdoor connected to RansomHub affiliates.

"On November 25, the group's operators released a new note on their affiliate panel announcing that any attack against any government institution is strictly forbidden," the company said. "All affiliates were therefore invited to refrain from such acts because of the high risk and unprofitable 'return of investment.'"

The chain of events in the aftermath of the downtime of RansomHub infrastructure, per GuidePoint Security, has led to an "affiliate unrest," with rival RaaS group DragonForce claiming on the RAMP forum that RansomHub "decided to move to our infrastructure" under a new "DragonForce Ransomware Cartel."

It's worth noting that another RaaS actor called BlackLock is also [assessed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/blacklock-ransomware-exposed-after.html) to have started collaborating with DragonForce after the latter defaced its data leak site in late March 2025.

"These discussions on the RAMP forums highlight the uncertain environment that RansomHub affiliates appear to be in at the moment, seemingly unaware of the group's status and their own status amidst a potential 'Takeover,'" GuidePoint Security [said](https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/blog/ransomsnub-ransomhubs-affiliate-confusion/).

"It remains to be seen whether this instability will spell the beginning of the end for RansomHub, though we cannot help but note that the group that rose to prominence by promising stability and security for affiliates may now have failed or betrayed affiliates on both counts."

Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU), which has also tracked DragonForce's rebrand as a "cartel," said the effort is part of a new business model designed to attract affiliates and increase profits by allowing affiliates to create their own "brands."

This is different from a traditional RaaS scheme where the core developers set up the dark web infrastructure and recruit affiliates from the cybercrime underground, who then conduct the attacks after procuring access to target networks from an initial access broker (IAB) in exchange for 70% of the ransom payment.

"In this model, DragonForce provides its infrastructure and tools but doesn't require affiliates to deploy its ransomware," the Sophos-owned company [said](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ransomware-groups-evolve-affiliate-models).
