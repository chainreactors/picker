Automation is a key component of the secure DevOps, or [DevSecOps](/glossary/what-is-devsecops.html), approach. Automation is how organizations establish security gates, and it can be used to prioritize findings and triage their remediation response. In 2022, Synopsys commissioned the SANS Institute to examine how improvements in security posture and operational effectiveness can be achieved by aligning development, security, and operations teams around the cultural ideals, practices, and tools of secure DevOps.

In this blog series, we’ve examined what the [2022 SANS DevSecOps Survey](/content/dam/black-duck/en-us/reports/SANS-Survey_DevSecOps-2022_Synopsys.pdf)can teach us about how implementing DevSecOps practices can help organizations [institute secure coding](/blog/take-pressure-off-coding-code-sight.html) without sacrificing development velocity, [establish policies and testing](/blog/take-pressure-off-sans.html) to automate security, and help those involved with triage and remediation work more efficiently.

In this blog post, let’s look at the lessons we can draw from the SANS study about using automation and integrations to ensure that prioritization and triage leads to rapid remediation. Prioritization means implementing automation on the front end to detect the vulnerabilities you’ve identified as important to your business needs, whereas triage means implementing automation on the back end to alert project owners, development engineers, or security personnel who can remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

## Automation for DevSecOps
