## Most of 2023’s Top Exploited Vulnerabilities Were Zero-Days

Zero-day vulnerabilities are [more commonly used](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a), according to the Five Eyes:

> **Key Findings**
>
> In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.
>
> Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities.

This is actually a nice comprehensive list of hardening

I realise the term “zero day” has controversial meaning but it does
bug me when people talk of 2 year old “zero days”. More nuanced
language might be useful in highlighting that there is a market in
unused and used exploits whose value reflects their freshness.

@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards,

> *“In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day”*

This is actually not very usefull because it is,

“An observed effect, not a testable cause or indicator of mitigation.”

The increase in the use of Zero Days with respect to other attack vectors could be due to many things.

Such as,

“The quality of software development is tanking.”

Or even the highly unlikely

“The use of prompt injection attacks on LLM’s is enabling zero days to be easily found/exploited.”

But as an observation it has the “disincentive downside” issue.

If a person is responsible for allocating budget or other resources to “security” in an organisation, they could very easily take a mindset of,

“There is no way to protect against zero days, so why bother…”

Thus resources end up in other places such as with pushing more rapid development. Which is one of the major causes of zero day vulnerabilities…

It’s all very well for CISA to recommend
“Implement appropriate mitigations to eliminate [identified] classes of vulnerability.”
and
“Ensure business leaders are responsible for security.”
but so long as post-facto patches are cheaper than Secure by Design, we’ll continue to get zero-days followed by band-aids.

Anyhow, how do you ensure business leaders are responsible? Apart from the corporate veil, punishment doesn’t seem appropriate. When more money goes into marketing than security, even “the market” won’t punish by shunning faulty products.

@Clive

“There is no way to protect against zero days, so why bother”

Although I think learned helplessness *is* the objective of certain
actors, there is also; “There is no way to protect against zero days,
so what are we going to do about that now?”. I’ve heard a lot of talk
at meetings nowadays about moving to response rather than detection or
prevention. I don’t personally subscribe to that “right of bang”
thinking, but there’s more of it about.

Software engineering doesn’t have to get any worse (can it?). There’s
a red-queen’s race such that in just maintaining the present standard,
things will get worse as systems are being rolled out exponentially.

There are other ways to fight rearguard. My counsel is heavily on
reducing attack surface, taking away as much as you can. I think a
missing mindset in computer security is that “there is nothing
dishonourable in retreat if the battle demands it”. What stops that is
the IT industry demand for growth, growth , growth!

@ Cybershow,

With regards moving forward.

Like you I’m aware of the effect of exponentially numbers of vulnerabilities.

At the very root of the issue is that,

“Being vulnerable is the natural state of all simple things.”

That is our building blocks are vulnerable to those that can get at them unless we arrange them correctly so that security gets built up.

There are two basic points there,

1, Mitigation by segregation.
2, Carefully engineer security in as you build.

No matter how vulnerable a system is if an attacker can not reach it then they can not exploit the vulnerability. Most living organisms do this from the cellular level up so could be called the natural model.

That is, inefficient as it might be most of the function of a living organism is to encase in protection a vulnerability that is also a benefit to the organism. Something like more than 9/10ths of an organic system of any size is in effect for “security not function” and as a result a secondary function often arises in that the grid like nature of cells implicitly gives not just structural strength but rigidity. Which as it’s highly desirable outside of a buoyant environment arises by transforming from a security layer into a structural layer on which an organism can build increasing useful function.

At some point the structural function in turn becomes a new type of security function and thus enables further complexity to develop on it. And unsurprisingly as such the cycle continues as the organism increases complexity.

There is as they say,

“A lesson to be learned here.”

And in the physical world we appear t...
