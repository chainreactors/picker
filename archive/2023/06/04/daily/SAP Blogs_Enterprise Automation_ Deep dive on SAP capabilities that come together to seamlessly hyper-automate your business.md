If you attended one of our SAP Sapphire in last weeks, in person or online, you might have heard about our announcement in the space of [Enterprise Automation](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/enterprise-automation.html). Indeed, this new and prominent topic was brought on stage by our CMSO Julia White during the [opening keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDJV0GIXmkw&t=4231s), and by Juergen Mueller and Thomas Saueressig in the [Future-Proof Innovation keynote](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapsapphire/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sapsapphire23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1680720145150001FCtw). It has been introduced by JG Chirapurath in a [news article](https://news.sap.com/2023/05/innovating-with-sap-btp/) as well as by Angela Harvey in a [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/17/introducing-new-capabilities-for-enterprise-automation/). And we had a crowded audience at our demo stations, where people were eager to discover SAP’s enterprise automation and low-code portfolio.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/06/SAP-Sapphire-2023-photo-mashup.jpg)

For us, working in the Application Development, Automation and Integration area of SAP Business Technology Platform, Enterprise Automation does not come out of the blue, it is part of a strong vision SAP has had years ago: In spring 2018 we started working on a RPA product at SAP, and [SAP Intelligent RPA](https://blog.asug.com/hubfs/2019%20AC%20Slide%20Decks%20Thursday/ASUG82350%20-%20SAP%20Intelligent%20Robotic%20Process%20Automation%20The%20Automation%20%28RPA%29%20Our%20Customers%20Deserve.pdf) was launched at SAP Sapphire 2019. Then, we added a low-code experience made available Fall 2020 in [SAP Intelligent RPA 2.0](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/11/unveiling-sap-intelligent-rpa-2.0-hyperautomation-for-everyone/). We also integrated [BPM capabilities](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/27/business-process-management-and-robotic-process-automation-2-sides-of-the-same-automation-coin/) from SAP Workflow to launch [SAP Process Automation at TechEd 2021](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/17/achieving-hyperautomation-with-sap-process-automation/). And last year at TechEd we launched our [SAP Build portfolio of low-code tools](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/16/sap-build-is-out/) for creating apps, automating processes, and building business sites.

This Process Automation journey is a key part of SAP’s history, which started a half-century ago, when 5 engineers considered that business processes would be better run with computers and software than with pens and paper. Over 50 years later, SAP’s vision remains the same. We want to make the world run better and improve people’s lives, and there are still many improvements we can make. Enterprise Automation is the latest, but certainly not the last!

## **Why?**

Because in an intelligent sustainable enterprise, business processes are quite complex and pretty intricate:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/06/Connected-Business-Processes.png)

Our aim is to deliver capabilities that seamlessly connect customers, partners, suppliers, and employees across each end-to-end process, through intelligent experiences, agile processes, and bespoke targeted solutions. Our customers expect SAP to help them derive a competitive advantage and improve stakeholder satisfaction with optimal performance.

In order to truly achieve greater efficiency, our customers need to better understand how their business processes are executed today, where they’re still inefficient, and to find out how they can be improved.
This is where **SAP Signavio** comes to play, providing powerful, integrated platform that helps you quickly realign your organization and bring changes to life at an accelerated rate.

Once this is understood, our customers then have to implement efficiency gains through seamless integration of diverse capabilities available in complex IT landscapes.
This is where **SAP Build Process Automation** and *...
