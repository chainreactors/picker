In an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, traditional security models are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive data and critical assets. Enter Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) — a revolutionary approach that assumes no entity, inside or outside the network, is inherently trustworthy. By continuously verifying every user and device, regardless of their location, ZTA provides a robust defense against modern cyberattacks. This infographic outlines ten essential steps to successfully implement a Zero Trust Architecture, offering practical guidance to help cybersecurity practitioners effectively adopt this model in their organizations.
