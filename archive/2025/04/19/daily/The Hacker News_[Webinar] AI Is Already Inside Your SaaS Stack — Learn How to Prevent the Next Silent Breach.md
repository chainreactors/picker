Your employees didn't mean to expose sensitive data. They just wanted to move faster. So they used ChatGPT to summarize a deal. Uploaded a spreadsheet to an AI-enhanced tool. Integrated a chatbot into Salesforce. No big deal‚Äîuntil it is.

If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Most security teams are already behind in detecting how AI tools are quietly reshaping their SaaS environments. And by the time an alert is triggered‚Äîif it even exists‚Äîdamage may already be done.

## This Isn't a Hypothetical Problem. It's Happening Now.

AI adoption inside organizations is no longer strategic. It's spontaneous.

Employees are experimenting, connecting, automating‚Äîand bypassing security while doing it. AI systems are becoming embedded in your SaaS stack without visibility or oversight. And it's creating a new class of shadow integrations‚Äîones that don't show up in traditional threat models.

If your current defenses rely on manual tracking, policy enforcement, or user education alone, you're not keeping up.

## Learn How to Adapt‚ÄîBefore Your Next Blind Spot Becomes a Breach

Join Dvir Sasson, Director of Security Research at Reco, for "[Your AI is Outrunning Your Security. Here's How to Keep Up](https://thehacker.news/untracked-ai-tools?source=article)" ‚Äî an unfiltered session on what it really takes to maintain AI Security Readiness.

You'll walk away with:

* Clarity on **emerging AI-driven threats** inside SaaS tools you already use
* **Real examples of breaches** caused by unmonitored AI integrations
* **Actionable detection and response strategies** that forward-thinking companies are using right now

AI is no longer just a tool‚Äîit's a moving part of your operational fabric. The more decentralized and dynamic it becomes, the less your traditional security playbook applies. If you're not accounting for AI's growing presence across your SaaS apps, you're not seeing the full risk surface.

And when a breach hits your CRM, your boardroom doesn't care how it happened. Just that you didn't see it coming.

**Save Your Seat:** This session is for security leaders, IT owners, and SaaS risk managers who want to evolve beyond reactive security‚Äîand take proactive control in an AI-powered world.
