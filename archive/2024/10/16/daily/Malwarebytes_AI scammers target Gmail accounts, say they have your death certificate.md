# AI scammers target Gmail accounts, say they have your death certificate

Posted: October 15, 2024

Several reputable sources are warning about a very sophisticated [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) supported type of scam that is bound to trick a lot of people into compromising their Gmail account.

The most recent warning comes from CEO of Y Combinator Garry Tan who [posted on X](https://x.com/garrytan/status/1844526882592784634), saying the scammers using AI voices tell you someone has issued a death certificate for you and is trying to recover your account.

The scammers claim to be checking that you are alive and whether they should disregard a filed death certificate. If you click “Yes, it’s me” on the fake account recovery screen then you’ll likely lose access to your Google account.

In another recent example, Windows expert Sam Mitrovic was targeted by a very similar [AI recovery scam](https://sammitrovic.com/infosec/gmail-account-takeover-super-realistic-ai-scam-call/).

He explained how the scam unfolds: It starts when he receives a notification of an alleged Gmail account recovery attempt, followed 40 minutes later by a call. The first time Sam misses the call, but when they try the same thing a week later, Sam answers.

In both cases, the notifications come from the US but the calls show “Google Sydney” as the caller. A polite American voice claims there’s been suspicious activity on Sam’s Gmail account and asks whether Sam was travelling.

The caller says there’s been a login attempt from Germany which raises suspicions, given that Sam is at home in the US. The caller says the login has been successful, and that an attacker has had access to Sam’s account for a week and downloaded account data.

Sam remembers the email and missed call from last week, and has the presence of mind to quickly check the caller ID. It looks like a legitimate [Google Assistant](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7690269?hl=en) number.

But knowing how easy it is to [spoof](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing) a telephone number and pretend to be calling from that number, Sam asks for an email to confirm that the caller actually works for Google. Some typing against the typical background noises of a call center and soon enough the email arrives.

The email looks convincing. It comes from a Google domain, has a case number, claims to be from the Google Account Security Team, and it confirms the phone number and the name the caller is using.

While Sam reviews the email, the caller repeatedly says “Hello”. From the pronuncia...
