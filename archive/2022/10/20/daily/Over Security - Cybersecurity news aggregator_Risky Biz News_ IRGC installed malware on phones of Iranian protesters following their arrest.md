BSI, the German cybersecurity agency, took down this week a web server used to control malware deployed by the Iranian government to spy on participants of [recent anti-government protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests).

The server was identified over the weekend by [Hamid Kashfi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamidkashfi/), a security engineer at Trail Of Bits, who confirmed a [tip](https://twitter.com/anonymousopiran/status/1580559650583236608) that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a branch of the Iranian military, was manually installing malware on the devices of detained anti-government protesters.

As of two days ago I managed to confirm (can't say how) that the case is a work of IRGC's Intelligence branch, which then justified immediate reaction. Confirmed samples were also obtained. The C2 is now down, thanks to Germany's BSI.

There are rumors about an Android malware being installed on Iran protests detainees phones. I managed to find a sample & respective live C2. Problem is I still don’t have any samples confirmed to be extracted from such phones.

Kashfi obtained multiple copies of the malware—which he later identified as a version of the [L3MON](https://github.com/D3VL/L3MON) Android remote access trojan—and found that all samples were communicating with a VPS server based in Germany, on which the BSI acted this week.

The researcher is now warning that even if this server is now down, the danger to protesters continues, as IRGC operators are most likely to set up a new one for subsequent deployments.

Iranians detained by the IRCG are advised to reset their smartphones as [Kashfi says](https://twitter.com/hkashfi/status/1582447118773411841) that the L3MON RAT has no advanced persistence capabilities, and this will remove it from compromised devices.

### Breaches and hacks

**Parlor leak:** Woorkweek CEO Adam Ryan revealed this week that right-wing social media site Parler accidentally revealed the personal email addresses of more than 300 of its verified users in a marketing email this week. This is your typical case of confusing CC and BCC fields.

Adam Ryan 🤝 @AdamRy\_n

Today's media operations fail:
Parler sent an email to all users with 300+ of their verified users CC'd instead of BCC'd
Now hundreds of people are replying and everyone has access to the personal emails of many verified users and Parler investors

**Stimme Mediengruppe ransomware attack:** German news agency Stimme Mediengruppe published an e-version of their newspapers this week after a [ransomware attack last Friday](https://www.stimme-mediengruppe.de/Cyberangriff/) crippled the company's ability to print its daily newspaper

**Verizon discloses SIM swapping attack:** Verizon notified some of its customers this week that their accounts were targeted during a recent wave of SIM swapping attacks that took place between October 4 and 10. The company said it reversed the SIM card changes and found no evidence of new attacks. [Additional coverage in *[BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verizon-notifies-prepaid-customers-their-accounts-were-breached/)*]

**BitKeep hack:** Cryptocurrency wallet application BitKeep said an attacker exploited a bug in its platform to steal roughly $1 million worth of crypto from its customers. The company said it would reimburse all users who lost funds.

**Mango Markets exploiter comes forward:** In a series of tweets over the weekend, an individual named Avraham Eisenberg took credit for the [attack on Mango Markets](https://twitter.com/mangomarkets/status/1579979342423396352) following which he walked away with $114 million worth of cryptocurrency. Eisenberg came clean after he was [publicly identified](https://karlstack.substack.com/p/exclusive-the-man-who-may-have-milked) as the attacker last week and after the Mango Markets community [voted](https://dao.mango.markets/dao/MNGO/proposal/GYhczJdNZAhG24dkkymWE9SUZv8xC4g8s9U8VF5Yprne) to allow him to keep $47 million of the exploited funds if he returned $67 million back to the platform, so it and all the other projects that depended on it could avoid insolvency.
