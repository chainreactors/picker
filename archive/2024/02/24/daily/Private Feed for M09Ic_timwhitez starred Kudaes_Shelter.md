# Shelter

Shelter is a completely weaponized sleep obfuscation technique that allows to fully encrypt your in-memory payload making an extensive use of ROP.

This crate comes with the following characteristics:

* AES-128 encryption.
* Whole PE encryption capability.
* Removal of execution permission during sleep time.
* No APC/HWBP/Timers used, exclusive use of ROP to achieve the obfuscation.
* Use of [Unwinder](https://github.com/Kudaes/Unwinder) to achieve call stack spoofing before executing the ROP chain.
* Different methods of execution to adapt to various circumstances.
* Other OPSEC considerations: [DInvoke\_rs](https://github.com/Kudaes/DInvoke_rs), indirect syscalls, string l...
