# LinkedIn introduces new security features to combat fake accounts

Posted: November 1, 2022
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

LinkedIn knows it has a problem with bots and fake accounts, and has acknowledged this on more than one occasion. For years, it has been aware of spam, fake job offers, [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing), fraudulent investments, and (at times) [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), and has been trying to combat those issues.

In 2018, LinkedIn rolled out [a way to automatically detect](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/09/automated-fake-account-detection-at-linkedin) fake accounts. It also gave users an inside look into what’s going on behind the scenes: A dedicated team constantly analyzing abusive behavior, risk signals, and patterns of abuse; tools that are continuously improving; and the company investing in [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) technologies aimed at detecting communities of fake accounts.

Now, LinkedIn is rolling out new security features to support its cause further. As Oscar Rodriguez said in his [post](https://blog.linkedin.com/2022/october/25/new-linkedin-profile-features-help-verify-identity--detect-and-r) on the LinkedIn blog:

> “I am eager to share that as part of our ongoing commitment to keeping LinkedIn a trusted professional community, we are rolling out new features and systems to help you make more informed decisions about members that you are interacting with and enhancing our automated systems that keep inauthentic profiles and activity off our platform. Whether you are deciding to accept an invitation, learning more about a business opportunity, or exchanging contact information, we want you to be empowered to make decisions having more signals about the authenticity of accounts.”

## What’s new?

**The “About this profile” feature.** This new section in a LinkedIn profile will contain information about when the profile was first created, when it was updated last, and indications of whether the account is associated with a verified phone number or work email address. This feature has already been rolled out.

**Tech that analyzes profile pictures.** As AI-based synthetic image generation technology—often called deepfake—has grown in sophistication, tech has become indispensable in helping us filter genuine profile photos from AI creations. LinkedIn’s deep-learning tech looks for subtle image artifacts, which may be invisible to the naked eye, associated with images created using AI. Accounts with positive detections will be removed before they can be used to reach out to members.

**Flags that alert users of suspicious behavior.** One known tactic of those with ill intent is encouraging their potential victim to continue their conversation away from the social platform they first met in favor of another communication medium, usually via email or IM. Scammers and fraudsters have employed this same tactic on LinkedIn. The platform now warns potential targets when the person they’re talking to suggests they move elsewhere.
