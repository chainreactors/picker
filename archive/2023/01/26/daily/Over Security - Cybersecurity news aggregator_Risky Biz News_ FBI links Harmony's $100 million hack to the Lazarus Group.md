The FBI has formally attributed the hack of the Harmony cryptocurrency bridge platform to Lazarus, a cyber-espionage group working for the North Korean government.

The Harmony crypto-heist took place [on June 23, 2022](https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmonys-horizon-bridge-hack-1e8d283b6d66), and resulted in the theft of $100 million in cryptocurrency assets.

Less than a week after the incident, blockchain tracking company Elliptic [linked](https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/the-100-million-horizon-hack-following-the-trail-through-tornado-cash-to-north-korea/) the hack to Lazarus operators by tracking how the funds moved to wallets previously associated with the group.

The funds remained untouched until earlier this month when the Lazarus gang used the [RAILGUN](https://www.railgun.org/#/) privacy protocol to move and launder [$63.5 million](https://archive.ph/3MmaZ) of the stolen Harmony assets. Some of the laundered funds were frozen in Binance and Huobi accounts, but the bulk still remain under Lazarus' control.

This week's [announcement](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-confirms-lazarus-group-apt38-cyber-actors-responsible-for-harmonys-horizon-bridge-currency-theft) marks the second time that the FBI has formally linked a cryptocurrency heist to the Lazarus Group in such a public fashion.

The FBI previously linked the theft of $620 million worth of cryptocurrency assets from the Ronin Bridge to the same Lazarus group [back in April 2022](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-attribution-of-malicious-cyber-activity-posed-by-the-democratic-peoples-republic-of-korea).

The FBI says that in both intrusions, the Lazarus gang used a form of malware known as [TraderTraitor](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-108a) to compromise employee systems. US officials and security experts say the malware is typically delivered via emails or private messages sent to a company's employees disguised as high-paying job offers.

The malware is written in cross-platform JavaScript code that runs inside an Electron app, which can deploy different second-stage payloads for both Windows and macOS, depending on the compromised employee's platform. Besides cryptocurrency platforms, Lazarus has used the same malware to go after gaming and financial sector companies.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Riot Games extorted:** Riot Games [says](https://archive.ph/ObJ7V) it received a ransom demand via email from the threat actor who hacked one of its employees and then gained access to one of its game development environments. Riot says the hacker is asking the company to pay a ransom demand, or they will release the source code for the League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics games and the source code of a legacy anti-cheat platform. The company says it does not intend to pay the ransom and expects the leaked source code to "increase the likelihood of new cheats emerging."

**GoTo breach update:** GoTo, the company that owns LastPass, [updated](https://www.goto.com/blog/our-response-to-a-recent-security-incident) a data breach notification it published last year when it said that some of its cloud hosting services were also impacted as part of the LastPass intrusion. GoTo says a recent investigation has found that the intruders managed to steal encrypted backups from its cloud storage. The backups contained data, including user information, for GoTo products such as Central, Pro, join.me, Hamachi, and RemotelyAnywhere. The company said the backups were encrypted, but the threat actor also stole an encryption key that would allow them to decrypt "a portion of the encrypted backups."

**FanDuel breach:**Sports-betting platform FanDuel [emailed](https://archive.ph/VpEVU) customers last week to let them know that their names and email addresses were stolen from the company's Mailchimp account. FanDuel joins e-commerce service [WooCommerce](https://archive.ph/5OvzK) as the second major company known to be affected by MailChimp's breach. Mailchimp, an email and newsletter platform, disclosed a [security breach](https://mailchimp.com/january-2023-security-incident/) two weeks ago when it said that a threat actor hacked one of its employees and stole data from 133 Mailchimp customers.

**Hacked Wormhole funds move:** The threat actor behind that hack of the Wormhole cryptocurrency platform has moved $155 million worth of assets they stole from the company, according to blockchain analysis platform [CertiK](https://archive.ph/ahiys). The funds represent almost half of the $321 million that Wormhole reported stolen in February of last year. Once it saw the stolen funds move, Wormhole reiterated its intention to pay a $10 million reward if the funds were returned to its wallets, the *[CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/wormhole-hacker-moves-155m-in-biggest-shift-of-stolen-funds-in-months)* reported.

**Election campaign BEC incident:** The office of Republican Kansas Senator Jerry Moran says it lost $690,000 last November after a cybercriminal tricked its accounting firm into transferring the funds to the wrong account. In a letter to the US Federal Election Commission, Moran's campaign said one of its banks managed to recover more than $168,000 from the stolen funds, but the vast majority remains under the criminal's control. The incident is what security researchers call a "business email compromise," or BEC fraud, a type of crime that has topped the FBI cybercrime statistics for the past five years, responsible for tens of billions of US dollars in losses.

### **General tech and privacy**

**FB Messenger E2EE:** Meta says that it plans to [onboard more users](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/expanding-features-for-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/) on the end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) version of its Facebook Messenger app over the next few months. The company says users will be chosen at random, and users will be notified when their private conversations will be upgraded to the E2EE version. In addition, the ...
