## Introducing Malwarebytes Managed Detection and Response (MDR)

October 13, 2022

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

With our [Managed Detection and Response (MDR)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/press/2022/10/12/malwarebytes-launches-managed-detection-and-response-solution-to-reinforce-security-operations-of-resource-limited-organizations) service now generally available for businesses and MSPs, you may be wondering: What is MDR, how does Malwarebytes MDR work, and do I need it?

Underpinned by [our award-winning EDR technology](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/business/2023/02/malwarebytes-recognized-as-endpoint-security-leader-by-g2), Malwarebytes MDR offers powerful and affordable threat prevention and remediation services, provided by a team of cybersecurity experts that remotely monitors your network 24/7 to detect, analyze, and prioritize threats.

## Malwarebytes MDR

MDR is a service that provides proactive, purpose-built threat hunting, monitoring, and response capabilities powered by a team of advanced cybersecurity technicians, combined with the analysis of robust correlated data. It takes the guesswork out of your most complex cybersecurity threats by delivering 24/7 threat detection, rapid alerts, prevention, and remediation.

Malwarebytes MDR defends your network every day and all night, safeguarding your data, reputation, and finances with always-on dedicated protection.

While it’s technically possible for SMBs to build out their own MDR program in-house, doing so is a time, expense, and effort equivalent to starting an entirely new IT security department. You’ll need to build out your own SOC facilities, hire a minimum of five full-time employees to provide 24/7 coverage, and so on. That’s why many SMBs opt to outsource their MDR to a service provider.

Our experts are your experts: With Malwarebytes MDR, our team of cybersecurity professionals acts as an extension to your security team, ensuring that you have the staff, skill, and experience you need to maximize your cybersecurity posture on a 24/7 basis.

## Malwarebytes MDR workflow

To recap, the basic workflow for Malwarebytes MDR goes like this:

1. The Malwarebytes MDR team monitors and analyzes your system, checking for IOCs and threat hunting, and finds something malicious.
2. Our MDR team sends you an email alerting you to the threat and asking you to go to the MDR portal in Nebula.
3. You log into Nebula and click on the MDR portal in the upper-righthand corner.
4. In the main portal view you can see a basic log of everything that the analysts have done on that specific system. Click “Go to Case” for more details on specific threats.
5. Clicking “**Go to Case**” will bring you back to Nebula for whatever suspicious activity or alert that the MDR team needs you to remediate.
6. You do the remediation, go back to the MDR portal, and tell the MDR team that you’ve completed it.
7. The MDR team closes out the alert.

## How it works

![Malwarebytes MDR](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file10440_241144_e.png)

It all starts with contextual enrichments. EDR alerts are enriched with context from threat intelligence feeds:

1. **Customer telemetry data from all deployed Malwarebytes products ingested.**

   1. EDR (including Brute Force Protection) and Cloud Security Modules
2. **Threat intelligence feeds from multiple sources ingested**

   1. Premium external threat feeds
   2. Internal Malwarebytes feeds including crowd-sourced intelligence from the enti...
