To cope with increasingly costly pay-outs, providers are redefining the terms of cyber insurance to reduce their exposure. The implications could spell myriad changes for the cyber security industry. Whatever the outcome, it’s time for organisations to re-evaluate whether their policy will cover them against the attacks they are most susceptible to.

### TL:DR

JUMPSEC explores the current state of cyber insurance, and whether its potentially diminished role presents a problem or an opportunity for organisations looking to reduce their cyber risk exposure.

* Cyber insurance loss ratios are now consistently above 60%, presenting an existential threat to the insurance industry and making cyber risk unprofitable to the extent that it may become uninsurable.
* Cyber insurance premiums have risen by over 94% from 2019 to 2022, in large part due to the rise of ransomware over that period. While cyber-insurance appears to be growing sustainably, this is predominantly due to premium costs, not increased take-up rates or expanded coverage.
* The Merck and Mondelez insurance settlements of $1.4b and up to $100m (stemming from the Russian NotPetya attacks in 2017) have prompted insurers to tighten terminology on ‘state actor’ attacks to further limit their risk exposure, whilst simultaneously raising premiums.
* Less than 1% of UK organisations have claimed on their cyber-insurance policy. Faced with inflated premiums, increasingly demanding compliance requirements, and doubts surrounding the payment of legitimate claims, organisations are now forced to reconsider the value of cyber insurance.

### Making the market

AIG first took cyber insurance to market in 1997 in a bid to gain market share despite any actuarial data to inform policies or premiums – making it completely unknown territory. Whilst more established today, cyber insurance is still a highly unpredictable landscape compared to other forms of insurance cover.

Before 2016/17 [cyber insurance](https://www.howdengroup.com/uk-en/sector/technology) was still an emerging market and was generally seen as an optional add on for organisations with heightened IT security risks, with less legal ramifications for data breaches (i.e. GDPR requirements) and far less knowledge or awareness of cyber threats generally.

Taking Lloyds (the world’s largest insurance marketplace) as an example, the UK-based insurer referred to cyber in its pre-2016 annual report as a “newer or less well understood sector”, mentioned in the same breath as “nuclear, chemical, biological and radiological (NCBR) threats” at that time. The cyber market was predominantly mentioned as part of its plans for “thought leadership” and “innovation”, with Lloyds noting that “many insured [were] first-time buyers”.

However, the cost and frequency of cyber-attacks have risen enormously over the past five years.

* 2016-17: Total attack figures rose as did the notoriety and scale of incidents with the emergence of notorious malware such as WannaCry and NotPetya, and a number of high-profile private sector companies falling victim such as Uber and Equifax.
* 2018: The introduction of new GDPR laws and additional high-profile cases (i.e. British Airways, Facebook, Marriott) further increased demand for cyber insura...
