# Affirm says Evolve Bank data breach also compromised some of its customers

Posted: July 3, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

‘Buy now, pay later’ payment specialist Affirm has warned that holders of its payment cards had their personal information exposed after a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) and [data breach at Evolve Bank & Trust](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/federal-reserve-breached-data-may-actually-belong-to-evolve-bank).

In a [form 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000182095324000027/afrm-20240625.htm), submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Affirm states:

> “Because the Company [Affirm Holdings, Inc] shares the Personal Information of Affirm Card users with Evolve to facilitate the issuance and servicing of Affirm Cards, the Company believes that the Personal Information of Affirm Card users was compromised as part of Evolve’s cybersecurity incident.”

[According to Evolve](https://www.getevolved.com/about/news/cybersecurity-incident/), the attack started after “an employee inadvertently clicked on a malicious internet link.” Evolve refused to pay the ransom, and so the attackers leaked the data they downloaded.

Affirm isn’t the only fintech company affected by the Evolve breach. Business bank [Mercury also notified customers](https://x.com/mercury/status/1806060971909149151?s=46&t=_Gt0IOxUX1g5SQKIEpM78Q) that the data stolen from Evolve Bank & Trust included some account numbers, deposit balances, business owner names, and emails associated with Mercury and other fintech accounts.

> “Affected Mercury customers have been notified of the breach and the preventative steps we are taking to keep customer funds secure.”

Money transfer service and payment platform builder Wise also published a [statement on its website](https://wise.com/help/articles/1Tyvn34K9tp08aZ0y0Hqe0/data-breach-at-evolve-bank-trust-in-the-us), informing customers it had shared full names, addresses, contact details, [Social Security numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web), and other [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) with Evolve as part of a partnership between 2020 and 2023.

So, it’s entirely possible that other financials may come forward with similar notifications. [Reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/affirm-says-cardholders-impacted-by-evolve-bank-data-breach/), Evolve has active partnerships with multiple fintech companies, including Shopify, Bilt, Plaid, and Stripe.

Keep your eyes and ears open and be wary of [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts related to these breaches.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/...
