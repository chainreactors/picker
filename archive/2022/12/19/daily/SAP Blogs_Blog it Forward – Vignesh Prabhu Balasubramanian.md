Hi All,

I was going through the currently [available Missions and Badges in SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/resources/missions-badges) and was excited to see #BlogItForward mission which is all about expressing our personal thoughts and having chit-chats through blogs & nominating other SAP fellas.

For example, I follow a set of SAP people, fellow ALM consultants to know about their professional achievements, lessons learnt through their technical blogs, Q&A, Comments. This particular mission #BlogItForward allows us to express our personal thoughts and can even insist fellow people here to write about themself by nominating them.

Okay, now let's go. It's my turn.!

**About me:**

I'm Vignesh Prabhu from Chennai, India and I work as SAP Solution Manager specialist with 8 years of experience in various Solution Manager functionalities.

Maldives Vacation in 2021

As a passion, I started restoring old cars and eventually became a passionate restorer who is fond of cars from 90's and I own 1992 Fiat Padmini (Italian Fiat), which was restored completely in 2021 and 1993 Tata Sierra which is currently been restored.

I wish to have some more cars added in my garage especially Mercedes Benz W123 & W124, Hindustan Contessa, Skoda Octavia first generation.

**Why Blog It Forward Challenge now?**

I wanted to talk about the product and Technology that has given me a professional life and recognition. Yes, it is SAP Solution Manager.

Just like every Software Trainee, I started my IT career in SQL, JAVA and dot NET trainings from the organization but eventually I was put in SAP Project as a junior Solution Manager consultant in 2014 with no SAP knowledge.

The product inspired me to learn and push my limits every day, even this second, I am writing about the same product, that gave life to me.

So, after 8 years of gaining experience with SAP Solution Manager, I thought of giving back whatever I learnt and gained from this product to fellow people and then I started my journey in SAP Community.

I started writing blogs on topics I learnt from April 2022, or I got inspired to learn and share my experience, I try to answer to questions posted by others which in a way I learn and have a forethought when that situation arises to me at any point.

Earlier I had written a [blog on CBTA](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/07/15/all-about-cbta-how-to-create-test-scripts-sdc-and-tce-how-test-script-runs/) which was well recognized using my other SCN ID.

SAP Community gave me so much, I am trying to give back whatever I can.

I got featured in SAP Community for the month of September 2022 and got a Badge for November 2022.
