## Product Updates

### New Sandbox Onboarding Tutorial

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1024x557.png)

Whether you’re brand new to ANY.RUN or just want a quick refresher, the new onboarding tutorial in the sandbox has you covered. It walks you through each step of the analysis process, from uploading a sample to making sense of the process tree, network activity, and [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/iocs-iobs-ioas-explained/).

It’s a great starting point for new analysts or anyone looking to get more comfortable with the platform.

You can find it in the **FAQ** section [under the **Tutorials** tab](https://app.any.run/docs/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_may_25&utm_term=050625&utm_content=linktoservice); just click on **Quick Sandbox Tutorial** and you’re good to go.

### TAXII Protocol Now Supported for TI Feeds

TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a widely used protocol for sharing threat intelligence in a fast, secure, and standardized way. It’s designed to make integrating threat data with your existing tools, like SIEMs, EDRs, or TIPs, smooth and efficient.

Now, ANY.RUN’s **Threat Intelligence Feeds** fully support TAXII, making it even easier to bring high-quality threat data directly into your security stack.

Here’s what you get with ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds + TAXII integration:

* **Actionable, real-world threat indicators:** The feeds pull data from threats seen across 15,000+ companies worldwide. You’ll get fresh, high-confidence IOCs sourced from dynamic malware analysis and enriched with context from ANY.RUN’s sandbox.

* **Minimal false positives:** Every indicator is pre-processed and vetted before it reaches your system, so you get clean, reliable data that won’t overload your analysts or flood your alerts.

* **Boosted detection and response automation:** Use TI Feeds to automatically block malicious IPs, flag risky logs, enrich alerts, or trigger playbooks, saving your team time and cutting response delays.

### How It Works

If you’re on a paid plan, you can now set up ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds as a TAXII endpoint in your existing system, whether it’s a SIEM, EDR/XDR, NGFW, or TIP platform.

Once connected to our TAXII server, your tools will start receiving fresh threat intel automatically. Want to see what the feeds look like? You can [preview a sample](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_may_25&utm_term=050625&utm_content=linktofeeds) in **STIX** or **MISP** format.
