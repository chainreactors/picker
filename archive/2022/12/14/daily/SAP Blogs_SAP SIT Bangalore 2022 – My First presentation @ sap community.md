Hi Community buddies,

Hope you all are doing great!

I'm very excited to share that, I have taken part in **SAP Track Inside Bengaluru** on 1st October 2022, at SAP Labs, Bengaluru campus, as a speaker on **Ariba Intelligent Spend**. It has been a great learning journey since 2020 SAP SIT where i participated as Delegate.

It was a fabulous event by SAP Labs India and the most amazing part of the day was to meet Sindhu Gangadharan SVP & MD SAP Labs India. [Click here to learn more about the event](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/15/experience-sap-inside-track-bangalore-2022-with-visual-impressions/)

Opening Key note was delivered by sindhu.gangadharan shared her inspiring thoughts to all the SAP enthusiast which helps to boost their confidence and encourages to think out of the box and achieve their goals. Also shared some of the interesting topics on SAP BTP extension suite, bringing profit and planet together with SAP cloud for sustainable enterprises, many more.

It felt good to connect in-person with many talented SAP folks from ***[SAP Community](https://community.sap.com/)***  hailing from various organizations with different tech concepts. It was a productive day by sharing the knowledge and receiving at the same time.

SAP SIT Bengaluru concluded with 8 different sessions on various topics such as SAP Ariba Strategic and Smart procurement with Intelligent Spend, Migration cockpit in SAP S/4 HANA, etc. [You can explore all the sessions here](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/14/sap-inside-track-bengaluru-2022-meet-the-speakers-and-get-their-presentations/)
