# Protecting against tomorrowâs threats, today

### Our story

Weâre more than a tech company - weâre a team of cybersecurity pioneers. Founded by alumni of the Polytechnic of Milan, Cleafy was built to outpace fraud by thinking differently. Our roots are in the real-world challenges banks face every day. From protecting institutions against digital threats to anticipating what comes next, weâve turned hard-earned experience into actionable solutions.

Weâve stood shoulder to shoulder with financial leaders through their toughest moments, proving that preparation beats reaction.**Fraudsters donât wait, and neither do we.**
