# Weekly Update 435

21 January 2025

If I'm honest, I was in two minds about adding additional stealer logs to HIBP. Even with the new feature to include the domains an email address appears against in the logs, my concern was that I'd get a barrage of "that's useless information" messages like I normally do when I load stealer logs! Instead, the feedback was resoundingly positive. This week I'm talking more about the logic behind this, some of the challenges we faced with it and what we might see in the future. Stay tuned, because I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of this in HIBP.
