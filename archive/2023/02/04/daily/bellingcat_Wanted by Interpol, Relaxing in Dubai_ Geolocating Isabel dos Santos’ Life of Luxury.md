On 24 November 2022 DW Africa published an [interview with Isabel dos Santos](https://www.dw.com/pt-002/isabel-dos-santos-em-exclusivo-%C3%A0-dw-ganhei-muitos-inimigos/video-63867002) – once Africa’s richest woman and the daughter of former Angolan President José dos Santos. She wore a distinctive pink blouse and sat in front of a nondescript, semi-transparent curtain.

Towards the end of the interview dos Santos was asked “Where are you currently at?” to which she replied, after a brief hesitation, “I’m at home”.

She repeated this answer to all further queries about her location.

It was not entirely clear where home was – dos Santos has multiple properties including in [London, Lisbon and Dubai](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/what-are-the-luanda-leaks) – recently, she’s been [reported](https://issafrica.org/iss-today/the-noose-closes-on-angolas-isabel-dos-santos) to spend much of her time in Dubai and she [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/world/africa/angola-isabel-dos-santos-arrest-warrant.html) The New York Times in November that she was living in London.

Her whereabouts were of significance at the time of the DW interview as Interpol had [reportedly](https://www.icij.org/investigations/luanda-leaks/interpol-arrest-warrant-issued-for-angolan-billionaire-isabel-dos-santos/) issued a [Red Notice](https://www.interpol.int/en/How-we-work/Notices/About-Red-Notices) requesting global law enforcement locate and provisionally arrest her. Interpol [confirmed this](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/interpol-confirms-red-notice-angolan-billionaire-isabel-dos-santos-2022-11-30/) a week later.

Dos Santos is the central figure in the Luanda Leaks – a trove of leaked documents – that [exposed decades of confidential business dealings](https://www.icij.org/investigations/luanda-leaks/how-africas-richest-woman-exploited-family-ties-shell-companies-and-inside-deals-to-build-an-empire/) and resulted in [accusations of embezzlement and fraud](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51218501) by Angolan prosecutors, as well as the freezing of more than a billion dollars worth in assets worldwide. Dos Santos maintains she made her money through legitimate business endeavours and denies accusations of fraud and embezzlement. She has described the Luanda Leaks as “[without substance](https://www.icij.org/investigations/luanda-leaks/isabel-dos-santos-claims-justice-denied-after-rejection-of-assets-appeal/)” and described the government’s charges as a political “witch hunt”.

At time of publication on 03 February 2023, dos Santos was yet to be provisionally detained.

But she is by no means in hiding. Dos Santos continues to regularly post on her social media channels, detailing visits to high-end restaurants and nights out – something [she alluded to](https://www.dw.com/en/angola-ex-presidents-daughter-isabel-dos-santos-not-hiding/a-63872365) in her DW interview when she insisted she was not disguising her whereabouts.

As Bellingcat discovered, those posts reveal very precise information about Isabel dos Santos’ movements over the past three months and show which of her properties she now appears to call home.

Dining and Dancing

When speaking to DW, Isabel Dos Santos denied she was in hiding, [stating](https://www.dw.com/en/angola-ex-presidents-daughter-isabel-dos-santos-not-hiding/a-63872365): “I’m on social media every day. My whereabouts and place of residence are known”.

One look at Dos Santos’ social media accounts confirms that she is indeed online most days. Dos Santos maintains verified [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/isabel_dos_santos.me/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/oficialmente.me/) accounts. She has not posted on Facebook since August of last year, but posts regularly on Instagram. She also appears to maintain [Twitter](https://twitter.com/isabelaangola) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/%40isabel_dos.santos) accounts. Although not verified, we observed on several occasions posts appearing on the TikTok account a few minutes before they appeared on her verified Instagram account, indicating likely ownership by dos Santos.

Among other things, what these accounts show is that dos Santos continues to enjoy a life of luxury.

Here’s a post from [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/%40isabel_dos.santos/video/7173273421067996422) dated December 4, geolocated to the pool of Dubai’s [Bulgari Yacht Club](https://goo.gl/maps/A4VU9cp77shAzhYN6).

Still from a TikTok featuring Isabel dos Santos, posted on 4 December 2022, that we geolocated to Dubai’s Bulgari Yacht Club, after matching it with [this image](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d13141282-Reviews-Bulgari_Hotel_Resorts_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html%23/media/13141282/406767302:p/?albumid%3D101%26type%3D0%26category%3D101&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1675419656929814&usg=AOvVaw1ttj87XnVCUi-o2PPRZTii) from Tripadvisor.

Imagery on Tripadvisor shows a [2019 photo](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g295424-d13141282-Reviews-Bulgari_Hotel_Resorts_Dubai-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html#/media/13141282/406767302:p/?albumid=101&type=0&category=101) with a near identical perspective to the video from 2022. We also checked [where the sun would have been](https://www.suncalc.org/#/25.2106,55.2333,19/2023.12.04/16:49/20/0) at that location on the day the video was posted and found the sun azimuth is consistent with the day and hour of post – within a range of five minutes.

In another instance, dos Santos’ was tagged by a friend in an Instagram post on 27 December 2022, where she can be seen enjoying a meal at Nusr-Et Steakhouse Dubai. She briefly featured in another friend’s post from the restaurant that day and [reviews](https://www.opentable.com/nusret-dubai) of the [restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nusr-Et%2BSteakhouse%2BDubai/%4025.2022847%2C55.2405328%2C21z/data%3D%214m5%213m4%211s0x0%3A0xe00fdb11bda3cc8a%218m2%213d25.2023247%214d55.2404668) point to Nusret Gökçe – also known as Salt Bae –  presence at his Dubai outlet in the final week of December 2022.
