This entry is part 4 in the series of improving your Ransomware readiness

Continuing our series of blog posts on Ransomware and Incident Response ([Part1](https://blog.nviso.eu/2024/12/03/building-cyber-resilience-against-ransomware-attacks/), [Part2](https://blog.nviso.eu/2024/12/10/your-playbook-to-a-better-incident-response-plan/), [Part3](https://lnkd.in/enqjQVme)) and following up on the recent discussion about top management preparation ([ManagementPreparation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johannes-holzer-a5612416_executive-management-how-to-help-in-ransomware-activity-7283209405607632896-yaQm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABaNqfsB3C-77T3dNFD7eNTgqTgEb72Gm5Y)), its time to consider having an effective Crisis Management process in place.

At NVISO we like to think of Crisis Management as the Beacon whose purpose is to guide you through difficult/challenging times, for that is what Crisis essentially is. But let‚Äôs set some ground rules and consider what we mean by Crisis and Crisis Management.

*Crisis Management: A beacon in the storm*

# Fundamentals of Crisis Management

When talking about Crisis, everyone should realize that we are dealing with an abnormal situation that is beyond the scope of normal business operations and which may threaten the immediate safety, the operations, or the reputation of the company. A Crisis needs to be dealt with immediately with the outmost importance and decisions need to be made at the highest level. Failure to react swiftly could possibly lead to huge impact and losses for the company. But how would you achieve this? How would you have the right people leave their daily tasks and focus their attention on the management of a ‚Äúnew‚Äù situation that they know little about? The answer lies in swift and effective communication amongst the right people.

*Managing a Crisis requires immediate attention*

Corporate Crisis management process has improved dramatically over the last decades. Not only as a result of malware and ransomware attacks but also because of climate change and weather phenomena becoming more and more frequent all over the world. Corporations are, and if they are not, they should be, prepared for crises by setting up a Crisis Management team and properly preparing the organisation to respond in a timely and effective manner.

However, as stated above, communication remains a major element of an effective Crisis Managment process.¬† In times of Crisis, accurate and timely provision of information ensures that all stakeholders are well informed and can act accordingly to reduce impact and loss to the company. Please note that by Stakeholders, we mean both the internal ones (employees, top management, 1st responders) and the external ones (General Public, authorities and regulators). Information should be transparent because you need to build trust and credibility towards all stakeholders. The value of accurate information is of the outmost importance. It is not uncommon that during a Crisis situation, organisations tend to enter a defensive mode, by withholding information from other parties. However, stakeholders who are not adequately informed may be unable to take appropriate actions, potentially leading to greater harm or disruption. In the following lines, we will present guidelines for effective communication during an incident.

**Crisis management process**

Upon declaration of a Crisis event, the Crisis Management Team (CMT) is responsible for managing all communications to internal and external Stakeholders. CMT is usually comprised by CEO + appointed executives but some corporations can also appoint a dedicated CMT separated from the mgmt. team. Please refer to the following schematic which illustrates the main attributes of this process:

*Crisis Management Lifecycle*

**Initial Notification / Crisis Declaration:** A Crisis situation has to be declared. Most organizations, face minor incidents frequently, some even on a daily basis. However, when you are dealing with an incident that becomes major threat to your operations, you need to inform everyone immediately. The necessary escalations need to take place and Crisis Management is invoked. Notify all stakeholders by using communication channels that are established within your organization. Use effective methods: email, SMS notifications or other media and make sure you attract the proper attention.

**Regular updates are required****:** Time is of the essence. Make swift moves and provide regular updates in the form of detailed reports. Make sure to address all parties and provide the information that is required in each case. Incident responders for example, who manage recovery procedures, will need precise technical information in order to address the incident in the most efficient way possible. On the other hand, if you need to communicate with the public, a different approach may be required. Adjust your communication style in order to be more appealing and understood by the broader audience.

**Transparency****:**Remember to be honest. No BS. Build trust with all parties such as the local authorities (offline/private comms) and/or the public (via press releases). Withheld information eventually gets out and is very likely to back-fire. Show that you are taking the strongest possible action and that you are determined to resolve this situation with the least possible impact for your corporation and for all stakeholders involved.

**Stakeholder engagement****/** **communication strategy****:**Did you include all internal and external stakeholders? Do you know who your stakeholders are? Carefully identify them. Make sure you did not miss any important contact points, either internal or external. In fact, it is a great practice to maintain lists of all stakeholders regardless of the type of Crisis. Make sure to engage stakeholders and ...
