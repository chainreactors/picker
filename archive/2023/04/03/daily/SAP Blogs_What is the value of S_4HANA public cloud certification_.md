**Why is it important to have an S/4HANA Cloud certification?**

The S/4HANA Cloud certification is important for professionals working with SAP systems, especially those involved in implementation or support projects for S/4HANA Cloud. The certification is a way to demonstrate that the professional has the necessary knowledge to work with S/4HANA Cloud, one of SAP's most advanced solutions for enterprise management.

To this end, I present here on this **blog** and through the [**video**](https://youtu.be/Xr4Q5U0-9uM) above, my main points for professionals to seek S/4HANA Cloud certification as a way to implement a better systemic solution, as well as position themselves as expert professional in the latest SAP technologies.

**SAP ERP experience is not sufficient.**

To work as a S/4HANA Cloud consultant, specific skills and knowledge are required that are not necessarily covered in SAP ERP experience. SAP S/4HANA is a new generation of enterprise software that offers advanced features such as process automation, artificial intelligence, and real-time data analytics. As a result, S/4HANA Cloud consultants need to have specific knowledge in cloud technologies, system architecture, application integration, and configuration and customization features of SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

In addition, SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a constantly evolving platform, with updates and new features being added regularly. This means that consultants need to stay up-to-date with the latest news and trends of SAP S/4HANA Cloud to provide customers with the best possible solutions and experiences. Therefore, having a certification in S/4HANA Cloud is important, as it demonstrates to customers that the consultant has the necessary skills to work with the latest technology and provide effective and efficient solutions.

**Unique components for Public Cloud**

There are some exclusive components in S/4HANA Cloud that are not available in SAP ERP. Some examples include:

+ SAP Fiori: it is a modern user interface that was created for S/4HANA Cloud. It provides a more intuitive and user-friendly user experience, allowing users to access relevant information more quickly and easily.

+ SAP Activate: it is an agile implementation methodology that was specifically designed for S/4HANA Cloud. It helps companies to implement S/4HANA Cloud more efficiently and effectively, reducing the time and costs associated with the project.

+ SAP S/4HANA Cloud Studio: it is an integrated development platform (IDE) that allows developers to create and customize S/4HANA Cloud applications. It offers powerful modeling and development tools that allow developers to create customized solutions that meet the specific needs of their clients.

+ SAP S/4HANA Cloud Analytics: it is an integrated analytical solution that provides real-time insights into the business. It allows companies to monitor and analyze their data in real-time, so they can make more informed and data-driven decisions.

These unique components help companies to make the most of S/4HANA Cloud, providing a more intuitive user experience, more efficient and effective implementation, powerful development tools, and real-time business analytics.

**The certification is more comprehensive in content**

The SAP S/4HANA Cloud certification is more comprehensive in content than other certifications for other SAP versions. This is because S/4HANA Cloud is a more recent software solution and its architecture is based on more advanced technologies that support real-time processing and real-time data analysis. The SAP S/4HANA Cloud certification also includes additional topics related to new features and specific functionalities of S/4HANA Cloud, such as finance management, project management, materials management, sales management, among others. Therefore, it is important for consultants who wish to work with S/4HANA Cloud to have specific and up-to-date knowledge about this solution, acquired through certification.

**What is S/4HANA Public Cloud?**

SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, where SAP is responsible for all infrastructure, maintenance, and software updates. This means that the client does not have to worry about servers or software updates, as everything is managed by SAP. This option is more suitable for companies that want to quickly implement a standard and scalable solution without worrying about infrastructure or customizations.

On the other hand, SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud is a more customizable option in terms of infrastructure and services. In this case, the client has more control over the cloud environment, being able to choose the infrastructure on which the software will run and customize the software according to their specific needs. This option is more suitable for companies that want greater flexibility and control over their solution, but still want to enjoy the benefits of the cloud. While SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud is more suitable for companies that want a ready-made and scalable solution, SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud is more suitable for companies that want more control and customization over thei...
