AI-generated voices are weaponised by online trolls, how ChatGPT reflects who we are as a society, and social media is in the firing line again.

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by The Cyberwire‚Äôs Dave Bittner.
