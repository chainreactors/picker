# Matthew Green

I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

One of the things I like to do on this blog is write about new research that has a practical angle. Most of the time ([I](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/08/12/attack-of-the-week-voice-calls-in-lte/) [s](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2019/02/11/attack-of-the-week-searchable-encryption-and-the-ever-expanding-leakage-function/)[w](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/01/10/attack-of-the-week-group-messaging-in-whatsapp-and-signal/)[e](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/08/24/attack-of-week-64-bit-ciphers-in-tls/)[a](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/01/attack-of-week-drown/)[r](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/04/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles/)) this involves writing about *other folks’ research*: it’s not that often that I write about work that comes out of my own lab. Today I’m going make an exception to talk about a [new paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1257) that will be appearing at TCC ’22. This is joint work with my colleagues Abhishek Jain and Aarushi Goel along with our students Harry Eldridge and Max Zinkus.

This paper is fun for three reasons: (1) it addresses a cool problem, (2) writing about it gives me a chance to cover a bunch of useful, general background that fits the scope of this blog [indeed, our actual research won’t show up until late in the post!], and most critically (3) *I want people to figure out how to do it better*, since I think it would be neat to make these ideas more practical. (Note, if you will, that TCC stands for *Theory* of Cryptography conference, which is kind of a weird fit.)

Our work is about realizing a cryptographic primitive called the *One-Time Program* (OTP). This is a specific kind of cryptographically [obfuscated](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/02/21/cryptographic-obfuscation-and/) computer program — that is, a program that is “encrypted” but that you can mail (literally) to someone who can run it on any untrusted computer, using input that the executing party provides. This ability to send “secure, unhackable” software to people is all by itself of a holy grail of cryptography, since it would solve so many problems both theoretical and practical. One-time programs extend these ideas with a specific property that is foreshadowed by the name: *the executing computer can only run a OTP once*.

OTPs are one of the cooler ideas to pop out of our field, since they facilitate so many useful things. Aside from the obvious dark-side implications (perfect [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management)! scary [malware](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2017/02/28/the-future-of-ransomware/)!) they’re useful for many constructive applications. Want to send a file encrypted under a weak password, but ensure nobody can just [brute-force the thing](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/10/04/why-cant-apple-decrypt-your-iphone/)? Just send a OTP that checks the password and outputs the file. Want to send a pile of sensitive data and let u...
