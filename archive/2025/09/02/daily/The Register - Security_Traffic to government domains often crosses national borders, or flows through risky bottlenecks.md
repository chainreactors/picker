Internet traffic to government domains often flows across borders, relies on a worryingly small number of network connections, or does not require encryption, according to new research.

PhD student Rashna Kumar reached the conclusions above after mapping paths for traffic to government websites in 58 countries, research conducted under an Internet Society Pulse Research Fellowship.

Kumar found that plenty of data destined for government websites or services crosses borders, or uses offshore internet exchange points (IXPs). 23 to 43 percent of paths to government services in countries such as Malaysia, Norway, South Africa, and Thailand routed through exchange points in third-country jurisdictions. Data destined for New Zealand government sites, she told *The Register*, often visits Australia on the way.
