**Background: -**

AI- Artificial Intelligence and ML- Machine Learning are often used interchangeably, but machine learning is a subset of the broader category of AI.

AI refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data.

Machine learning is a pathway to artificial intelligence and uses algorithms to automatically learn insights and recognize patterns from data, applying that learning to make increasingly better decisions.

Organizations in every industry must be able to transform their data into actionable insight giving organizations the advantage of automating a variety of manual processes involving data and decision making. Incorporating AI and machine learning into their strategic plans and systems, business leaders can understand and act on data-driven insights with greater speed and efficiency.

**Transformative Intelligence of SAP AI**

Artificial Intelligence is built to transform every aspect of the business.

Bar for the business has risen and so have expectations, demands and competition. Transformative intelligence and adaptable innovations equip you rise to the challenge and optimize every aspect of business.

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are often associated with enterprise-level applications.

* Automating purchase orders – More and more companies have been automating purchase orders using AI for quite some time. This minimizes human errors and frees employees from manual and repetitive work.

* Predicting the better supplier –Finding the most suitable suppliers is probably one of the biggest challenges faced by companies in the procurement and supply niche. To solve this issue, machine learning techniques can be used to create prediction models in selecting a supplier.

* AI chatbot support – Chatbot support has plenty of applications in the procurement and supply chain business. For example, it can be used to:

* Automate goods pick-up process in warehouses.

* Answer customer queries

* Track shipment coming from suppliers.

* Integrate GPS functionalities in delivery vehicles so managers can keep track of progress and send in new dispatch orders.

However, the possibilities of AI and ML usage are infinite and still evolving.

Below are some great examples of operations-level applications of AI:-

* Driverless trucks can add to the safety of workers, especially for underground mines.

* AI-driven crop monitoring, soil monitoring and greenhouse management.

* Predictive equipment maintenance.

* Prediction of stocks in transit – With predictive analysis, companies delivering and receiving stocks get to address crucial issues before they happen. It can help minimize expenses and schedule disruptions.

AI in business processes supported by SAP software help organizations to become intelligent enterprise and enable the delivery of the following business outcomes.

* Accelerate time to value.

* Deliver agile and flexible processes.

* Enable data-driven decisions.

* Future proof IT solutions.

* Comply with regulatory requirements.

* Reduce IT costs.

Machine Learning with S/4 HANA has delivered several released use cases to help the digitization enablers for all process streams i.e.

* Lead to Cash

* Design to Operate

* Source to Pay

* Recruit to Retire

However, in this blog, we will outline on Source to Pay use cases for ML/AI and iRPA. Details for each scenario can be further searched on SAP portal.

Use of Artificial Intelligence turns sourcing into competitive advantage. Use of SAP AI transforms Source to Pay processes and takes complexity out of finding, negotiating, and procuring supplies. AI usage enables procurement professionals to simplify sourcing, discover quality suppliers with intelligent filtering, optimizing purchasing with automated assistance and handle invoices with automatic processing.

Intelligent Technologies help the operational purchaser.

 1QR |
 Contract Consumption |
 The Purchaser can analyze a high-level overview of important information, such as expiring contracts, overdue purchase orders or urgent purchase requisitions, as well as an overview of different procurement KPIs. The Buyer can use this information to predict full consumption of a contract based on factors such as a historical data, other available influencing parameters, and so on. |

 Proposed Creation of New Catalog Items |
 During purchase requisition creation, free text item entry can be interpreted as a catalog item, due to recommendations from the Machine Learning algorithm. |

|
 2XX |
 Payment Block- Cash Discount at Risk |
 When a supplier has a quantity blocking reason at the item level, the cash discount may be at risk. Utilizing the predictive modeling integration, you can predict the goods receipt delay and thus meet the cash discounts. |
