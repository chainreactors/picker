**SAP is proud to announce its partnership with the****Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)**

SAP believes strongly in the power of collective action, especially when it comes to the security of our people, products, assets and our hundreds of thousands of customers. For decades, SAP has invested in public - private partnerships as an essential component of building a strong defensive capacity.

We also believe in the power of technology to transform society.  SAP’s mission is to help the world run better and improve people’s lives with sustainability at its core.  We engineer solutions to fuel innovation, foster equality and spread opportunity across borders and cultures.  Nonetheless, we recognize that inherent in the power of technology is the danger that malicious actors will co-opt innovative solutions for their own nefarious purposes. Thus, ensuring our solutions are secure and inspiring trust in our customers is critical to the mission of SAP.

As threat landscapes rapidly evolve in response to innovation, it is incumbent upon network defenders to adapt security models and address constantly shifting and aggressive threat vectors. Given the interconnected nature of modern digital networks and supply chains, information sharing and operational coordination with partners across government, industry and academia is more important than ever in keeping pace with emerging threats and acting quickly to secure and protect society.

**SAP Joins JCDC**

Effective today, SAP is pleased to join with multiple government and private sector entities in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC). The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) established JCDC in August 2021 to transform traditional public-private partnerships into real-time private-public operational collaboration and shift the paradigm from reacting to threats and vulnerabilities to proactively planning and taking steps to mitigate them. JCDC combines the visibility, insight, and innovation of the private sector with the capabilities and authorities of the federal cyber ecosystem to collectively drive down cyber risk to the nation at scale.

SAP looks forward to contributing actively to this powerful network of cyber defenders to collect, share and widely distribute timely actionable, cyber threat information and collaborate on operational strategies to better secure the global digital ecosystem.
