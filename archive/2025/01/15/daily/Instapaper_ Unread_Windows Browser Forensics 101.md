# Windows Browser Forensics with Belkasoft X

![](/images/articles/windows-browser-forensics-101/browser-forensics-cover.jpg)

Web browsers generate a wide range of artifacts, such as log files, cache data, and cookies, as they process user activity, from entering a URL to establishing a network connection. Users may also interact with forms, enter personal information, save passwords, or store credit card details, which browsers often retain for convenience.

Read on to learn how to locate, extract, and analyze browser artifacts effectively with Belkasoft X.

## Major browser types and their data locations

The specific location of browser data can vary depending on the operating system, browser version, and user settings. However, on Windows systems, most browsers typically store their data in either the **%AppData%** or **%LocalAppData%** folders.

Standard PATH values are:

* **%AppData%** = **C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming**
* **%LocalAppData%** = **C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local**

Folders in the main browser directory for multiple browser profiles—for example, Default, Profile 1, Profile 2—represent individual profiles.

## Chromium-based browsers

This category encompasses some of the most popular browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and QQ Browser. These browsers share a common foundation—the Chromium engine. The forensic analysis of such browsers can be approached similarly, as they often keep data in comparable formats and directories.

Chromium-based browsers commonly store their data in the **%LocalAppData%** folder—for example, Chrome's main directory: **C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming**.

### Gecko-based browsers

Mozilla Firefox, Waterfox, and Pale Moon are prominent examples of Gecko-based browsers. Renowned for their strong emphasis on user privacy, customization, and open-source development, these browsers provide a robust developer console, advanced privacy settings, and a wide range of extensions.

Most Gecko-based browsers use the **%AppData%** folder for their data. Thus, Firefox's main path will be **%AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles**.

Tor Browser, also built upon the Gecko platform, stores data in its installation folder.

### Legacy browsers

The term "legacy browsers" refers to older browsers built on outdated engines such as Trident, EdgeHTML, Presto, KHTML, and others. Internet Explorer and older versions of Microsoft Edge are prime examples. While these browsers may still be used in specific enterprise environments to be compatible with legacy web applications or for nostalgic sentiments, they generally lack support for modern web standards and security features.

## Challenges in browser forensics

Summarizing all the above, you can outline the main challenges in browser forensics:

* **Data complexity**: Browser artifacts are scattered across various formats ([SQLite](/sqlite), JSON, proprietary) and locations.
* **Encryption:** Sensitive information like passwords and credit card details often requires decryption for access.
* **Privacy modes:** Incognito and private browsing modes leave minimal traces, reducing available artifacts.

On top of these challenges, the increasing reliance on cloud-based data complicates local artifact recovery. Investigators may need access to the cloud environment to retrieve this data, requiring authorization credentials or legal permissions.

## Where to look for browser artifacts

You can find browser artifacts in several Windows system locations:

* **Local storages** typically contain main browser data, such as history, cache, and cookies.
* **Memory dumps** may reveal active browsing sessions, open tabs, and other volatile data not stored on the drive.
* **Hibernation and page files** may contain data such as open tabs or active browsing history just before the system entered sleep or hibernation mode.

The latter two are especially valuable for pinpointing webmail traces and capturing private browsing artifacts. To learn about real-world scenarios for using memory dumps to determine the initial attack vector, read the [Hunting for Initial Infection Vector with Belkasoft](/whitepaper_hunting_initial_infection) whitepaper.

## Chrome browser forensics: Data of interest

While specific locations may vary by browser, operating system, and user settings, Chromium browsers work similarly when it comes to data storage and artifact generation.

Google Chrome allows users to create multiple profiles, each with its own set of data, such as browsing history, bookmarks, passwords, cookies, and sync settings. Profiles are stored as separate folders within the browser's data directory. The **Default** profile is the primary profile automatically created during Chrome's installation. If additional profiles ...
