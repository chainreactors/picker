The first quarter of 2025 has been a battlefield in the world of cybersecurity. Cybercriminals continued launching aggressive new campaigns and refining their attack methods.

Below is an overview of five notable malware families, accompanied by analyses conducted in controlled environments.

## NetSupport RAT Exploiting the ClickFix Technique

In early 2025, threat actors began exploiting a technique known as ClickFix to distribute the NetSupport Remote Access Trojan (RAT).

This method involves injecting fake CAPTCHA pages into compromised websites, prompting users to execute malicious PowerShell commands that download and run the NetSupport RAT.

Once installed, this RAT grants attackers full control over the victim's system, allowing activities such as real-time screen monitoring, file manipulation, and execution of arbitrary commands.

### **Main technical characteristics of NetSupport RAT**

* Attackers can view and control the victim's screen in real time.
* Uploads, downloads, modifies, and deletes files on the infected system.
* Runs system commands and PowerShell scripts remotely.
* Captures copied text, including passwords and sensitive data.
* Records user keystrokes for credential theft.
* Starts, stops, and modifies system processes and services.
* Installs itself in startup folders, registry keys, or scheduled tasks to survive reboots.
* Uses process injection and code obfuscation to evade detection.
* Maintains a stealthy connection with attackers using encrypted traffic.

After running the NetSupport RAT payload inside [ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5_malware_campaigns&utm_content=landing&utm_term=250225), we can see several activities.

When NetSupport RAT infects a system, it immediately establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C2) server, allowing attackers to operate the compromised machine remotely.

Through this connection, attackers can execute system commands, deploy additional malware, and modify system settings.

NetSupport RAT employs multiple Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to maintain persistence, evade detection, and gather system data. Key TTPs include:

* Persistence & Execution: Modifies registry startup keys, executes scripts via wscript.exe.
* Discovery: Reads computer name, checks system language, and accesses environment variables.
* Defense Evasion & C2 Communication: Drops legitimate Windows executables, creates internet connection objects for remote control.

These techniques demonstrate how NetSupport RAT establishes control while avoiding detection, all of which are visible in ANY.RUN's ATT&CK mapping.

## Lynx Ransomware

The Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group is known as a highly organized entity, offering a structured affiliate program and robust encryption methods. Building upon the foundation of the earlier INC ransomware, Lynx has enhanced its capabilities and expanded its reach, targeting a diverse range of industries across multiple countries.

Lynx's affiliate panel allows its affiliates to configure victim profiles, generate custom ransomware samples, and manage data-leak schedules within a user-friendly interface. Because of its structured approach, it becomes one of the most accessible ransomware even for those with limited technical expertise.

To incentivize participation, Lynx offers affiliates an 80% share of ransom proceeds. The group maintains a leak site where stolen data is published if victims fail to pay the ransom.

### **Major attacks of Lynx in Q1**

In the first quarter of 2025, the Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group has intensified its operations, targeting various industries with sophisticated attacks.

Particularly, in February 2025, Lynx claimed responsibility for breaching Brown and Hurley, a prominent Australian truck dealership. The group alleged the theft of approximately 170 gigabytes of sens...
