The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said it has filed a civil forfeiture complaint in federal court that targets over $7.74 million in cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other digital assets allegedly linked to a [global IT worker scheme](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/ottercookie-v4-adds-vm-detection-and.html) orchestrated by North Korea.

"For years, North Korea has exploited global remote IT contracting and cryptocurrency ecosystems to evade U.S. sanctions and bankroll its weapons programs," [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-files-civil-forfeiture-complaint-against-over-774m-laundered-behalf-north-korean) Sue J. Bai, Head of the Justice Department's National Security Division.

The Justice Department said the funds were [originally restrained](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/north-korean-foreign-trade-bank-rep-charged-role-two-crypto-laundering-conspiracies) in connection with an April 2023 indictment against Sim Hyon-Sop, a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) representative who is believed to have conspired with the IT workers.

The IT workers, the department added, gained employment at U.S. cryptocurrency companies using fake identities and then laundered their ill-gotten gains through Sim to further Pyongyang's strategic objectives in violation of the sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the United Nations.

The fraudulent scheme has [evolved](https://cside.dev/blog/malicious-north-korean-actors-attempting-to-infiltrate-technology-companies) into a [massive operation](https://nisos.com/research/saja-dprk-employment-scam/) since its origins way back in 2017. The illegal employment operation leverages a combination of stolen and fictitious identities, aided with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools like [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/openai-bans-chatgpt-accounts-used-by.html), to bypass due diligence checks and secure freelance jobs.

Tracked under the monikers Wagemole and UNC5267, the activity is assessed to be affiliated with the Workers' Party of Korea and is viewed as a methodically engineered strategy to embed IT workers inside legitimate companies to draw a steady source of revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Besides misrepresenting identities and locations, a core aspect of the operation involves recruiting facilitators to run laptop farms across the world, enable video interview stages, as well as launder the proceeds back through various accounts.

One such laptop farm facilitator was [Christina Marie Chapman](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-hackers-exploit-powershell.html), who pleaded guilty earlier this February for her involvement in the illicit revenue regeneration scheme. In a report published last month, The Wall Street Journal [revealed](https://www.wsj.com/business/north-korea-remote-jobs-e4daa727) how a LinkedIn message in March 2020 drew Chapman, a former waitress and massage therapist with over 100,000 followers on TikTok, into the intricate scam. She is scheduled to be sentenced on July 16.

"After laundering these funds, the North Korean IT workers allegedly sent them back to the North Korean government, at times via Sim and Kim Sang Man," the DoJ said. "Kim is a North Korean national who is the chief executive officer of 'Chinyong,' also known as 'Jinyong IT Cooperation Company.'"

An analysis of Sim's cryptocurrency wallet by TRM Labs has revealed that it has received more than $24 million in cryptocurrency from August 2021 to March 2023.

"Most of these funds were traced back to Kim's accounts, which were opened using forged Russian identity documents and accessed from Korean-language devices operating from the U.A.E. and Russia," TRM Labs [said](https://www.trmlabs.com/resources/blog/doj-seeks-forfeiture-of-7-7-million-in-cryptocurrency-tied-to-north-korean-it-worker-laundering-network). "Sim, a North Korean official, operated out of Dubai and maintained a self-hosted wallet that received laundered funds from dozens of sources."

Kim, from his base in Vladivostok, Russia, acted as an intermediary between the IT workers and FTB, using two accounts to collect funds from them and re-distribute the proceeds to Sim and to other wallets connected to North Korea.

Cybersecurity company DTEX has [characterized](https://www.dtexsystems.com/exposing-dprk) the IT worker threat as a state-sponsored crime syndicate that's mainly geared towards sanctions evasion and generating profits, with the threat actors gradually shifting from laptop farms to using their own machines as part of companies' Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies.

"Opportunity is really their only tactic and everything is treated as a tool of some sort," Michael Barnhart, DTEX Principal i3 Insider Risk Investigator at DTEX Systems, told The Hacker News.

"If the focus is on laptop farms, which has been very good in getting that word out there, then naturally this opportunistic nation wants to gravitate ...
