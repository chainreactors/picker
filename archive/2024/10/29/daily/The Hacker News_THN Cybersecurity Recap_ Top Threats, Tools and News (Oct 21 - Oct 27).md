## üîî Top News

* **Severe Cryptographic Flaws in 5 Cloud Storage Providers:** Cybersecurity researchers have discovered [severe cryptographic issues in end-to-end encrypted](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/researchers-discover-severe-security.html) (E2EE) cloud storage platforms Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit that could be exploited to inject files, tamper with file data, and even gain direct access to plaintext. The attacks, however, hinge on an attacker gaining access to a server in order to pull them off.
* **Lazarus Exploits Chrome Flaw:** The North Korean threat actor known as Lazarus Group has been attributed to the zero-day exploitation of a now-patched [security flaw in Google Chrome](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/lazarus-group-exploits-google-chrome.html) (CVE-2024-4947) to seize control of infected devices. The vulnerability was addressed by Google in mid-May 2024. The campaign, which is said to have commenced in February 2024, involved tricking users into visiting a website advertising a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) tank game, but incorporated malicious JavaScript to trigger the exploit and grant attackers remote access to the machines. The website was also used to deliver a fully-functional game, but packed in code to deliver additional payloads. In May 2024, Microsoft attributed the activity to a cluster it tracks as Moonstone Sleet.
* **AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) Account Takeover Flaw Fixed:** A now-patched security flaw impacting Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Development Kit (CDK) could have [allowed an attacker to gain administrative access to a target AWS account](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/aws-cloud-development-kit-vulnerability.html), resulting in a full account takeover. Following responsible disclosure on June 27, 2024, the issue was addressed by Amazon in CDK version 2.149.0 released in July 2024.
* **SEC Fines 4 Companies for Misleading SolarWinds Disclosures:** The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged four public companies, Avaya, Check Point, Mimecast, and Unisys, for making "[materially misleading disclosures](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/sec-charges-4-companies-over-misleading.html)" related to the large-scale cyber attack that stemmed from the hack of SolarWinds in 2020. The federal agency accused the companies of downplaying the severity of the breach in their public statements.
* **4 REvil Members Sentenced in Russia:** Four members of the now-defunct [REvil ransomware operation](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/four-revil-ransomware-members-sentenced.html), Artem Zaets, Alexei Malozemov, Daniil Puzyrevsky, and Ruslan Khansvyarov, have been sentenced to several years in prison in Russia. They were originally arrested in January 2022 following a law enforcement operation by Russian authorities.
