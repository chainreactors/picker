## New Windows IPv6 Zero-Click Vulnerability

The press is [reporting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/zero-click-windows-tcp-ip-rce-impacts-all-systems-with-ipv6-enabled-patch-now/) a critical Windows vulnerability affecting IPv6.

> As Microsoft explained in its Tuesday advisory, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the flaw remotely in low-complexity attacks by repeatedly sending IPv6 packets that include specially crafted packets.
>
> Microsoft also shared its exploitability assessment for this critical vulnerability, tagging it with an “exploitation more likely” label, which means that threat actors could create exploit code to “consistently exploit the flaw in attacks.”

Details are being withheld at the moment. Microsoft strongly recommends [patching now](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38063).

@ ALL,

Whilst various people such as the security researcher are saying,

> *“Considering its harm, I will not disclose more details in the short term*

It’s already effectively disclosed by the patch, that almost certainly has been reversed engineered by now.

So I suspect attacks are either “in progress” or “will be soon”.

The problem is that Microsoft has a long history of “patches with problems” so there is justifiable hesitancy around “Mission Critical Systems”.

Knowing the history of Microsoft and it’s acquired network code and subsequent additions I suspect that there is a reasonable probability this goes back a ways in time…

Thus those running “nolonger supported” MS OS’s might find they are going to get bitten.

For various reasons people should think about getting experience of proficiency of “segregation by layers”.

One such is run a \*nix as the base OS and run MS OS’s in VM’s on it and then run your apps there.

If that will help as a mitigation in this case is “unknown” untill we “know more” but I doubt that it will make things worse.

Ultimately “pulling the plug” on external communications will be an effective mitigation. But from an “MBA in Management” perspective that will potentially be against the business being agile etc.

Hopefully enough people will patch or mitigate to prevent this popping up on the “Top Ten Most Unwanted” worms/malware but I guess we will have to wait and see.

@ ALL,

Oh I forgot to mention “The Register” in,

<https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/14/august_patch_tuesday_ipv6/>

Call this vulnerability,

> ***“Holy grail security flaw”***

In their usual cheerful way before saying,

> *“It’s pretty bad; it’s a 9.8-out-of-10 on the CVSS severity scale.”*

So… Yeh as they say in “Guzz under” land in that droll way,

“No worries mate, it needs no fan.”

Then they go on to say there is another 9.8 on the CVSS severity scale…

Then go on to mention another couple of critical RCE’s…

Now I know that the first couple of weeks of August are known as the “silly season” in MSM circles because generally it’s a quiet time so news reporters are scratching around for anything that will “space fill” so even mention “Grand Ma’s Chocolate Cake” winning the local church fair, even if it does not poison the judges…

But Microsoft’s cake appears to have blown that out of the water… with something that although brown and squidgy, is probably not chocolate frosting…

So say after me,

“What is the actual business case for that computer to have external communications?”

And if the reply is,

“To stop Win11 barfing up”

Then guess what…

With the Crowdstrike snafu only a couple of weeks ago
Windows users are going to be conflicted. Don’t patch and be exposed to malice,
or run an update and risk incompetence bricking your system?

It’s more than the infuriating logic of Heller’s Catch 22,
It is about facing the absurd.

Is that like entering your PIN number at an ATM machine?

@ , ALL,

Re : CyberStrike SNAFU.

As you note,

> “With the Crowdstrike snafu only a couple of weeks ago Windows users are going to be conflicted.”

But CrowdStrike is just the latest in a long stream of such patch and update issues.

Which is why the traditional advice was have a “lab” separate to your live systems where you did a

“Cautious add and test deeply before deployment.”

Which in general non adversarial or opponent with agency scenarios is the sensible way to proceed.

But now opponents with agency are apparently able to turn an update / patch release into a working attack or get an attack out within an hour or less of patch release things have changed somewhat.

It can be argued quite reasonably from a technical aspect the sensible thing is still to “use a test lab”, only now you use a “hard mitigation” of “Go off line” untill the tests are completed.

However that plays merry hell with the availability figures, and the way things are going currently with malware etc your systems would be unavailable for ever increasing periods and possibly upto half the time already…

One partial solution to the frequency of hard mitigations is to significantly reduce complexity of the hosts.

However as far as commercial / consumer OS and Apps are concerned the Software Industry want’s to needlessly drive up complexity for shall we call it “Marketing Reasons”.

Thus we get a game of “Russian Roulette” played on mass virtually every day with the not unexpected result that “sometimes the hammer drops and a scream in the night is heard”.

Thus people are actively asking at one end of the scale,

How to reduce complexity and ...
