After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/06/1-15-november-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/19/16-30-november-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of November 2022 where I have collected and analyzed 272 events, a value slightly lower than October, but in line with the latest months, which confirms the overall high level of cyber activity that is characterizing the end of this 2022.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, and the soar in ransomware attacks push its percentage to **86%** from 79.5% in October. The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** drop to **6.3%** from 9.7%. **Hacktivism** showed a light decrease to **5.1%** from 5.6% and is back to the values of September. Events motivated by **Cyber Warfare** got a tiny **1.5%**, down from 1.5% of the previous month.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, and once again the growing number of ransomware attacks push its percentage to **43.8%** from 34.7%, ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers**, down to **14%** from 22.8%, and **Targeted Attacks** that reduced their percentage of nearly a half, to **4.4%** from 8.2%. Nearly the same value of **Vulnerabilities** that went down to **4%** from 6.7%.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, up to **19.1%** from 16.8% of October, ahead of campaigns against individuals (**17.3%** vs. 9% in October) and **Healthcare**, which takes the third place with **11%** vs 13.4% and confirms to be a top target, nearly the same value of **Governments** (**10.7%**, slightly down from 11.6%).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cyber-Attacks-Statistics-IG-November-2022-R.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
