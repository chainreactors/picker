# Weekly Update 451

11 May 2025

The Have I Been Pwned Alpine Grand Tour is upon us! I've often joked that work is always either sitting at my desk at home in isolation or on the other side of the world, and so it is with this trip. As we've done with recent travel to the US and colder parts of Europe, we've booked to travel to places we know have lots of people we're interested in seeing then we'll fill in the itinerary. Since the blog post last week, we've lined up folks in Leichtenstein, Zurich (which will be a publicly event I'll announce soon), Bern, Geneva and Lyon. I'm still trying to make contact with the folks at CERT-MC in Monaco, and same with the Italian equivalent in Rome. I've planned a bit more time at the latter and would like to try and line up another event like we'll be doing in Zurich so if you're over that way and run a user group or similar, I'd love to hear from you.
