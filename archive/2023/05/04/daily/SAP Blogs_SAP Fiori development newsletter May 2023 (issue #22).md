It’s hard to believe we are already in May. SAP Sapphire is coming soon, so expect to see some exciting announcements. While much of the focus will be on new low-code / no-code capabilities, there will also be some pro-code goodies on display. We have some updates below and stay tuned for more information in the next issue.

If you want to meet with fellow developers and the SAP engineers who build our professional development tools, I encourage you to join our monthly SAP Fiori elements and SAP Fiori tools roundtable group.

We publish the SAP Fiori development newsletter every other month to share new information with developers in the SAP ecosystem about SAPUI5, SAP Fiori elements, SAP Fiori tools, and SAP Business Application Studio.

## Development News

**News on SAPUI5 adaptation projects in SAP Business Application Studio**

Creating an adaptation project allows customers/partners to extend a standard SAP app. Using the new application descriptor editor for manifest changes, developers can now also add components, OData services, and local annotation files. See the details in [https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-sap-fiori-app-in-sap-business-application-studio/adding-app...](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-sap-fiori-app-in-sap-business-application-studio/adding-app-descriptor-changes)

To offer the full deployment experience also for an extended app, adaptation projects now also support the command line interface for deploying. See the [documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/help/bcbb716c051b427cbe8ec7fe8362c9e5/420da4b6a7f047eea57608b0d37037ab.html).

**UI5 and TypeScript: how to generate types for OData services**

Andreas Kunz explains how to generate type definitions in UI5 apps written in TypeScript.

<https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/13/ui5-and-typescript-how-to-generate-types-for-odata-services/>

**OData V4 is the new OData V2**

Hansi Richstein discusses some of the benefits of using SAP Fiori elements for OData V4, including draft handling, the flexible programming model, and reuse components.

<https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/30/odata-v4-is-the-new-odata-v2/>

Caspar van Tergouw describes how you can apply deep filtering in your SAPUI5 application, using CAP and OData V4.

<https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/05/sapui5-filtering-on-expanded-entities-using-odatav4/>

**SAP Fiori elements: implement visual filters in an analytical list page**

Akash Jagga explains how to use annotations to implement visual filters in an SAP Fiori elements analytical list page.

<https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/06/fiori-elements-implement-visual-filters-in-analytic-list-page-alp/>

**New value help examples in the Flexible Programming Model explorer**

The SAP Fiori elements flexible programming model explorer is the best source of information about how to build SAP Fiori apps using OData V4. We have added some new examples including [documentation and code samples](https://latest.testapp.sapfe.c.eu-de-2.cloud.sap/test-resources/sap/fe/core/fpmExplorer/index.html#/advancedFeatures/guidance/guidanceValueHelp) on how to use value helps for different types of controls.

**SAPUI5 concepts: custom libraries and test automation**

Marian Zeis created a series of blog posts in the SAP Community on a UI5 custom control for Excel upload. In this context, he highlights topics like creating a custom UI5 library with versioning using a multi-version namespace and also automating UI5 testing with GitHub Actions and wdi5.

**SAP Fiori elements using the RAP model**

Jhodel Cailan set out to create an application that relies on pure CDS and annotations, without additional ABAP code or JavaScript for the UI side. The main idea is to use the standard functionalities of RAP and SAP Fiori elements as much as possible.
