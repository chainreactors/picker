As a vCISO, you are responsible for your client's cybersecurity strategy and risk governance. This incorporates multiple disciplines, from research to execution to reporting. Recently, we published a comprehensive playbook for vCISOs, ["Your First 100 Days as a vCISO – 5 Steps to Success"](https://cynomi.com/first-100-days-vciso-steps-to-success/?utm_source=article&utm_medium=THN&utm_campaign=IncreaseCustomerEngagementThroughReporting), which covers all the phases entailed in launching a successful vCISO engagement, along with recommended actions to take, and step-by-step examples.

Following the success of the playbook and the requests that have come in from the MSP/MSSP community, we decided to drill down into specific parts of vCISO reporting and provide more color and examples. In this article, we focus on how to create compelling narratives within a report, which has a significant impact on the overall MSP/MSSP value proposition.

This article brings the highlights of a recent [guided workshop](https://cynomi.com/webinar-lunch-learn-increase-engagemnet-your-cybersecurity-clients?utm_source=article&utm_medium=THN&utm_campaign=IncreaseCustomerEngagementThroughReporting) we held, covering what makes a successful report and how it can be used to enhance engagement with your cyber security clients.

The workshop was delivered in partnership with Jesse Miller, co-author of the First 100 Days playbook, and founder of [PowerPSA Consulting and the PowerGRYD](https://powerpsa.com/powergryd/?utm_source=hackernews&utm_campaign=4-sections-vciso). Jesse is a long-time CISO/vCISO and infosec strategist who has made it his mission to help service providers crack the code for premium vCISO profits. You can watch the entire webinar, with more details and real-world examples [here](https://cynomi.com/webinar-lunch-learn-increase-engagemnet-your-cybersecurity-clients?utm_source=article&utm_medium=THN&utm_campaign=IncreaseCustomerEngagementThroughReporting).

## The Hidden Value in Reporting

According to Miller, "It's one thing to do a great job, it's quite another for your client to see it that way." This is where reporting should focus. A tight reporting process is the cherry on top of a connected journey for the client in a successful vCISO program.

However, as Miller reveals, reporting is not primarily for the purpose of demonstrating the activities the vCISO performs for the client, which is a common misconception. Rather, the real value lies in making the client the hero of their security journey. Therefore, vCISO reports should focus on the client and their organization's goals, not the vCISO's activities. The ultimate goal of any report is to enable a business strategy discussion that revolves around security.

### vCISO Reporting Benefits

Drilling down into the aforementioned purpose, vCISO reporting provides multiple benefits for both the vCISO and the client:

For the vCISO -

* Ensuring the vCISO is aligned with client expectations
* Ensuring the client understands their security and compliance posture
* Creating a shared vision between the vCISO and the client
* Build consensus on an improvement path (rather than solely pushing recommendations one-sidedly)
* Anchoring initiatives into business outcomes
* Driving retention and sales

For the client -

* Controlling their security destiny
* Designing their security journey based on business outcomes and allowing them to own the risk associated with their decisions and actions
* Simplified decision-making
* Noise reduction
* Bandwidth and scale
* Getting easy buttons and resources for tactical execution
* Ensuring they perceive the high ROI being provided for their vCISO investment

## 4 Essential Sections of a vCISO Report

To uncover all the benefits listed above, it is recommended to create a report that covers four sections:

* **Section 1: General Recap -** The summary, top-level metrics and any "hot stove" items.
* **Section 2: Tactical Review -** How controls perform, data "stories" and setting the stage for the recommendations and initiatives to come in the following sections.
* **Section 3: Strategic Review -** A roadmap review, holding a business-led discussion, recommendations and mapping the RCT (Resource, Commitment, Time) for the next steps.
* **Section 4: Future Initiatives -** Current work in progress, protecting from risk and building up the sales funnel.

Now let's dive into each one.

## Section 1: General Recap

The first section of the report provides an overview and summary, teasers for the rest of the report and high-level metrics. It is also where "hot-stove" items can be addressed. For example, informing about an attacker foothold and answering any open questions.

By providing a brief initial section focused on the outcomes, vCISOs can concisely share the story they are telling. It also allows Executives and Business Leaders to join the first part of the report for an overview, leaving the practitioners to dig into the granular details later on.

For example, in this sample report by Cynomi, we can see the first part of the general recap, showing the posture score, together with a brief explanation about what it means and alluding to the risk.
