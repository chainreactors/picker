# Zero-day attacks on browsers and smartphones drop, says Google

Posted: May 1, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

Cybercriminals are having less success targeting end-user technology with zero-day attacks, said Google’s security team this week. While most attacks do still target personal technology like smartphones and browsers, the focus is moving increasingly to enterprise tech.

Zero-day vulnerabilities are those that are exploited before vendors have a chance to patch them – and often before they even know about them. Attackers using these flaws to compromise systems are still primarily espionage groups, says the Google Threat Intelligence Group in its [annual analysis](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends) of zero-day [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits).

Government-backed groups and customers of commercial surveillance vendors (that’s sanitized corporate-speak for [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware)) were responsible for over half the attacks that the researchers were able to attribute. Spyware continues to be a much bigger factor in zero-day exploits today than it was before 2023.

The Chinese government exploited five zero-day flaws that Google knows of, while for the first time North Korea equaled that number. Spyware customers used eight zero-day exploits.

But state and private espionage-focused attackers aren’t the only ones using zero-days. Google also sees crime groups using them to come after your data. However, as it points out, some of these groups involved in cybercrime also maintain strong links to the Russian government.

While the number of zero-day exploits that Google identified dipped to 75 from last year’s 98, the trend is still moving slowly upward, the company says. In 2022, it found 63 zero-day exploits, and the year before that it was 95, but 2019 and 2020 both showed just 31 zero-day exploits each.

Vendors are also doing better at protecting at least some of their products, found the research. Google said attackers are having less success targeting browsers and mobile operating systems. Attackers traditionally use these technologies to get at consumer users.

Perhaps that increased protection is one reason behind another key fact: The proportion of zero-day exploits targeting end-user technologies was lower this year at 56% than those targeting enterprise tech. That’s a consistently falling number; 90.32% of zero-day exploits targeted end-user tech in 2019, followed by 70.97%, 74.74%, 63.49%, and 63.27% respectively through 2023.

In particular, exploitation of browsers and mobile devices was far lower this year than last. Browsers saw a third fewer zero-day exploits than last year, with most targeting Chrome due to its popularity, while mobile device zero-day attacks halved.

This doesn’t mean attackers won’t continue trying their best to infiltrate end-user products. “Phones and browsers will almost certainly remain popular targets, although enterprise software and appliances will likely see a continued rise in zero-day exploitation,” Google said.

When spyware attackers do target mobile devices, they will chain together multiple vulnerabilities in complex attacks on mobile devices to get around mobile vendors’ security practices.

As Google points out, it’s difficult to separate attacks against enterprise and end-user technology because enterprises often use these technologies too. Nevertheless, it has seen a 9% rise in zero-day attack...
