The game of conkers is an odd one and untill mobile phones came along sort of confined to bored school boys mainly in England.

Yes the ‚Äúconker‚Äù is a cheastnut, but not of the ‚Äúsweet cheastnuts‚Äù eaten at Xmas since long before Dickensian times.

To win you need a hard conker of high density preferably with a non uniform shape so as to give a higher impact energy. But it also should not be too dry as they become brittle.

Many many years ago a friend was in France and there the conkers just fall on the ground and mainly rot. My friend collected around two shopping bags full to bring back and the French just thought my friend was shall we say ‚Äúone acorn short of an oak tree‚Äù üòâ

The reason for gathering them my friend helped run a ‚ÄúScout pack‚Äù and they used the conkers as a meetup activity.

Also when they are fresh, you can stick cocktail sticks in them fairly easily so you can do that weird model making like that chemistry students are said to use to visualise molecules.

Who guards the guardians?

As mentioned a bit more clearly at <https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2024/10/15/foul-play-alleged-at-world-conker-championships-as-mens-winner-found-with-steel-chestnut/>

As an apparently long time judge, he would have had a lot of time and experience to think through cheating loopholes. Would one or more of the other four fellow judges who watched him be sympathetic to him winning one glorious game in his final years?

‚ÄúSay it ain‚Äôt so, Joe!‚Äù

It seems inadvisable for the Chief Judge of a competition to also be one of the contestants. Hopefully, the sport of Conkers can recover from this setback.

Thanks, Bruce. Second funniest thing I‚Äôve seen all week.

Why would someone be allowed to be heavily involved in the preparation and judging AND be allowed to compete? It seems like he had means, motive, and opportunity, but that‚Äôs only because that‚Äôs not the right way to have a competition.

I have never heard of ‚ÄúConkers‚Äù before, but it seems odd that:
1) this guy was both Chief Judge AND a contestant
2) he would have the steel conker in his pocket.

Also, I‚Äôm a bit confused who actually won given this:

‚ÄúKelci Banschbach, 34, from Indianapolis, defeated the men‚Äôs champion in the grand final to become the first American to win the competition.‚Äù

Well, you know what they say, Bruce.

Divide and conker.

Cheating at conkers in nothing new. I‚Äôd argue conkers is about the cheating. When I was a kid in the 1970s people would reinforce their chesnut with epoxy resin.

Update: King Conker has been declared innocent and the accuser has backpedaled.

How to win at Conkers.

Others are censoring themselves‚Ä¶

How political donors polarise.
<https://phys.org/news/2020-10-big-money-donors-political-average-voter.html>

*‚ÄúDecades of social science research has also shown that when the priorities of wealthy donors conflict with those of most voters, donor priorities tend to win out, if for no other reason than because elected officials are more exposed to what donors think.‚Äù*

They shake your hand and they smile
And they buy you a drink
They say, we‚Äôll be your friends
We‚Äôll stick with you till the end
Ah, but everybody‚Äôs only looking out for themselves
And you say, well, who can you trust
I‚Äôll tell you, it‚Äôs just nobody else‚Äôs money

‚ÄúMoney changes everything.‚Äù ~ Cyndi Lauper

No more Conkers? üôÅ

At least 16,425 of the 47,282 tree species studied could soon die out forever.

The ripple effect of the extinction of a single species can affect countless others, disrupting vital ecological functions.
