# Update your Apple devices to fix dozens of vulnerabilities

Posted: September 16, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Apple has released security updates for iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, and Macs as well as for Safari, and Xcode to fix dozens of vulnerabilities which could give cybercriminals access to sensitive data.

## How to update your devices

### **How to update your iPhone or iPad**

For iOS and iPadOS users, you can check if you’re using the latest software version, go to **Settings > General > Software Update**. It’s also worth turning on Automatic Updates if you haven’t already. You can do that on the same screen.

### **How to update macOS on any version**

To update macOS on any supported Mac, use the Software Update feature, which Apple designed to work consistently across all recent versions. Here are the steps:

* Click the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
* Choose **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older versions).
* Select **General** in the sidebar, then click **Software Update** on the right. On older macOS, just look for **Software Update** directly.
* Your Mac will check for updates automatically. If updates are available, click **Update Now** (or **Upgrade Now** for major new versions) and follow the on-screen instructions. Before you upgrade to macOS Tahoe 26, please read these [instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122727).
* Enter your administrator password if prompted, then let your Mac finish the update (it might need to restart during this process).
* Make sure your Mac stays plugged in and connected to the internet until the update is done.

### **How to update Apple Watch**

* Ensure your iPhone is paired with your Apple Watch and connected to Wi-Fi.
* Keep your Apple Watch on its charger and close to your iPhone.
* Open the Watch app on your iPhone.
* Tap **General > Software Update**.
* If an update appears, tap **Download and Install**.
* Enter your iPhone passcode or Apple ID password if prompted.

Your Apple Watch will automatically restart during the update process. Make sure it remains near your iPhone and on charge until the update completes.

### **How to update Apple TV**

* Turn on your Apple TV and make sure it’s connected to the internet.
* Open the Settings app on Apple TV.
* Navigate **to System > Software Updates**.
* Select **Update Software**.
* If an update appears, select **Download and Install**.

The Apple TV will download the update and restart as needed. Keep your device connected to power and Wi-Fi until the process finishes.

## Updates for your particular device

[Apple has today released version 26](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/new-versions-of-apples-software-platforms-are-available-today) for all its software platforms. This new version brings in a new “Liquid Glass” design, expanded Apple Intelligence, and new features. You can choose to update to that version, or just update to fix the vulnerabilities:
