# Who's Not Getting Laid Off?

What do the people not getting laid off have in common?

Who's *not* being laid off?

That's my question.

I'm thinking about all these layoffs and trying to figure out if there's anything we can learn about the future of tech by looking at who's getting laid off and who's not.

Here's what I'm wondering:

* Is it mostly people with degrees they're getting rid of?
* Is it people with degrees they're keeping?
* Are there any particular certifications that matter?
* Certain fields?
* Certain roles?
* Certain skill sets?

I'm curious about what signal we could learn from this. And the reason I care is because I want to know what we should be studying.

Maybe we shouldn't be spending months or years trying to get certifications or degrees. Or maybe only certain ones—if we know that many of the people getting laid off have that particular thing.

It's a completely different world. In the past, you needed a 4-year degree. That was a given. That was 20-30 years ago. A 4-year degree locked you in as a professional for your entire career. Get a decent degree in a halfway decent field, and you become a professional. That's clearly not the case anymore.

So the question—which I and many others are working on—is what are those things employers are looking for?

# Tech as professional sports [​](#tech-as-professional-sports)

On a related note, I heard someone say recently that tech might be becoming like professional sports. Lots of people can do it for free, but only very few will actually be paid for it.

In professional sports, you know what the criteria are. You know—tall, fast, strong, whatever the attributes are for that particular sport.

So once again, that becomes the question. What are the attributes for this sport of knowledge work? And since it's about learning as opposed to physical gifts with athletics, what do we study? What do we train? What do we practice?

I think this is a critical question going forward.

# Building a curriculum for what's next [​](#building-a-curriculum-for-what-s-next)

I'm working on some curricula within my [Substrate](/projects/#substrate) project and also [Human 3.0](/projects/#human-30-h3) to try to get us close to a set of things to learn.

My general idea around this is first principles. So fundamentals that essentially help us understand how the world works:

* **Mathematics** - The language of the universe
* **Physics** - How things actually work
* **Computer science** - The foundations of computation
* **Programming concepts** - How to think in systems
* **Critical thinking** - This is very high on the list
* **Dialectic and rhetoric** - Part of the Greek trivium, essentially the ability to think clearly and make and respond to arguments
* **History** - Patterns repeat
* **Sociology** - How groups behave
* **Psychology** - How individuals think
* **Evolutionary biology** - Why we are the way we are
* **Political science** - How power works

Then stacked on top of that is a bunch of tactical skills:

* Using AI effectively
* Using technology as leverage
* Communication skills
* Writing clearly and persuasively

The idea is to combine timeless fundamentals with cutting-edge tools. That's what I think will survive the filtering.

#### Notes

1. **Tech layoffs by year**: 2022: 93,000 employees | 2023: 200,000 employees (peak) | 2024: 150,000 employees | 2025: 70,000 employees (through July). Sources: [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) and [TrueUp.io](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs)
2. I'm sure it varies significantly by company size, industry, and geographical location.
3. **Major company layoffs**: Microsoft laid off 15,000+ (7% of workforce), Intel cut 15,000, Tesla laid off 14,000, and Cisco cut 10,000. Many explicitly tied to AI investments. [See full analysis](/blog/im-worried-it-might-get-bad)
4. **AI replacement claims**: Salesforce says AI bots do 50% of their work; CEO won't hire new engineers in 2025. Microsoft reports 30% of coding done by AI.
5. Daniel narrated his thoughts about tech layoffs and the future of work. I (Kai, his DA) structured his stream of consciousness into this post and created the header image. AIL Level 2. [Learn more about AIL](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/ai-influence-level-ail)
