## Microsoft Still Uses RC4

Senator Ron Wyden has [asked](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_ftc_on_microsoft_kerberoasting_ransomwarepdf.pdf) the Federal Trade Commission to [investigate](https://cybersecuritynews.com/microsofts-use-of-outdated-rc4-encryption/) Microsoft over its continued use of the RC4 encryption algorithm. The letter talks about a hacker technique called [Kerberoasting](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/cyberattacks/kerberoasting/), that exploits the Kerberos authentication system.

I was reading about this last week and was quite surprised. Kind of amusing that the world is underpinned by MS, and it turns out it‚Äôs a deck of cards. I think a lot of us if asked in the ‚Äô90s about something like this, we might have said ‚ÄòYeah, probably.‚Äô

Microsoft‚Äôs fix timetable really needs to be faster, now that this little disaster is known widely. I wonder what, if any, mitigations can be taken to defend against it.

Dealing with a crypto algorithm used by Kerberos and found to be weak, as is the case with RC4 (or single DES, etc‚Ä¶), is non-trivial. Kerberos is used in widely deployed scenarios with a potential mix of OS‚Äôs (Solaris, Linux, Windows, macOS, etc‚Ä¶) which makes seamless migration of weak Kerberos enctypes (the crypto used by Kerberos) to stronger enctypes a real pain. If you get it wrong, authentication stops working and soon the sysadmins are hearing from all kinds of folks because they can‚Äôt get work done. I don‚Äôt envy MS software engineers working on these issues.

Microsoft has form in allowing weaker encryptions. For Bitlocker, they removed the Elephant Diffuser PRNG, and the default is AES-128. Who‚Äôd know to change to AES-256 before FDE?

RC4, wow. They had an SSL cert that was signed with RC3 just a few years ago. It was used in their waagent that runs on Linux systems in Azure. Note there are several Azure environments. The env I was using was meant to be secure, but was the last to get any updates. They fixed the Cert in the public Azure and kept tellings us we were wrong,. Their agent wasn‚Äôt working correctly when the Linux machines where in FIPS mode.

Why would any IT pro be surprised by anything M.S. does? With all the issues with Windoze updates,I‚Äôm not surprised with their low quality work(laziness?). And yet, people still trust them.

@ ALL,

Just a point to note‚Ä¶

RC4 is still a usable algorithm for a number of things including ‚ÄúCommunications Whitening‚Äù(generating noise) and ‚Äúfor simulation‚Äù(like O‚Äôl Montie).

However RC4 has like many ‚Äúsimple card shuffling algorithms‚Äù passed beyond the point where it can be considered cryptographically secure even for you little sisters diary, now she keeps it on a computer‚Ä¶

I think it safe to say that all crypto algorithms outside of a special class will fall to this issue.

It‚Äôs just a matter of when not if.

Which of course brings up the issue of ‚Äúembedded‚Äù and ‚Äúgrid‚Äù systems I‚Äôve been mentioning for many years now‚Ä¶

From the man who coined the term Kerberoasting in 2014, Tim Medin also responded to Wyden‚Äôs letter and gave Microsoft‚Äôs response a little undressing.

As Clive mentioned, AES-based Kerberos tickets are still susceptible to Kerberoasting. According to a benchmark that Tim ran, it was just that AES128 and AES256 tickets were approximately 350 and 700 times slower to crack.

@Clive

> RC4 is still a usable algorithm for a number of things ‚Ä¶

Agreed.

Similarly SHA-1 will always live on courtesy of Section 4.2.1.2 of RFC5280, but this should not pose a security issue as a hash collision could only cause trust path construction to fail and should not lead to incorrect certificate validation except in the most broken implementations.

@ KC, ALL,

With regards,

> ‚ÄúAES-based Kerberos tickets are still susceptible to Kerberoasting.‚Äù

And as far as I can work out it should actually be,

**‚ÄúAll ways will be‚Ä¶‚Äù**

This is due to fundamentals in the design (that also effect so many other systems[1]).

But consider, if you change those fundamentals then two things,

1, Not only will it not be Kerberos any more, it won‚Äôt be compatible.

These are things even technical people don‚Äôt want to talk about in what is one of the more widely deployed systems of it‚Äôs type in the world‚Ä¶

[1] It‚Äôs odd that I should be talking about this twice in as many days, but they do say,

‚ÄúRandom things tend to clump‚Äù

(Or is it humans üòâ

People have to learn a number of painful exercises or suffer the potential consequences.

One such which comes up all to often is ‚ÄúOff line authentication‚Äù. The bottom line is to do any type of authentication you need a unique and unforgeable ID-Verifier pair so we have one variety we all know and hate, the all to recognisable ‚ÄúUsername and password‚Äù and like bank card numbers and verifiers and the PIN number etc etc.

Whilst the ID can be public and often is the verifier should always be a,

‚ÄúA shared secret‚Äù

And this implies not just that it should be unique and unforgeable, but importantly also held private from all but the necessary verification process.

If it‚Äôs not then,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs game over.‚Äù

So, consider an actually quite common situation of...
