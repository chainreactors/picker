Hunter Plan: Fast and Private Threat Analysis for Solo Malware Researchers

*Editor’s note: The current article was originally published on November 26, 2020, and updated on August 12, 2025.*

If you’re an independent malware analyst or threat researcher, you need a solution that works as hard as you do; one that’s flexible, private, and built for deep, hands-on investigations.

**Hunter** puts that power in your hands. With **70% of** [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=hunter_plan&utm_term=120825&utm_content=linktolanding) capabilities, you can dive into advanced investigations, expose hidden threats, and keep every detail locked down.

Let’s look at why so many solo analysts make Hunter their plan of choice.

## Keep Your Analyses Secure

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-1-1024x438.png)

The Hunter plan gives analysts the [privacy](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/privacy-features/) they need to work with sensitive samples confidently.

You decide who can access your submissions, whether you want to keep them completely private, share with a trusted contact, or display them in a controlled presentation mode.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image2-1024x544.png)

This control is backed by strong security measures that protect your data at every stage:

* Our SOC 2 Type 1 certification is backed by independent assessments, verifying that we have robust controls in place to protect user data, private malware analyses, and system integrity

* Data is encrypted at rest with AES-256, ensuring stored files remain secure against unauthorized access.

## Identify Malicious Files and URLs Faster

Hunter enables rapid, controlled analysis of suspicious files and URLs across a range of environments, from [**Windows 7, 10, and 11 to Linux and Android**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-android-malware-targets-businesses/). In most investigations, the sandbox delivers a reliable verdict in **under 40 seconds**, allowing analysts to act without delay.

By fully detonating each attack and interacting with it at every stage, you can observe its complete execution chain, including those steps designed to evade automated tools. **[Detonation actions](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/detonation-actions/)** and environment fine-tuning work together to make threat identification both precise and efficient, even when dealing with multi-layered or highly evasive malware.

The intuitive interface makes it easy to navigate complex analyses, while helping analysts of all experience levels deepen their expertise with every investigation.

### Real-World Example of Phishing Attack

One real-world case shows exactly why this capability matters.

A phishing email arrived with an SVG attachment and a password hidden in the message body. Opening the SVG in the sandbox revealed a fake document containing a link to download a PDF. Clicking that link triggered the download of a ZIP archive; one that could only be extracted by manually entering the earlier password.
