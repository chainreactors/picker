Cybercriminals are actively exploiting two vulnerabilities in Mitel MiCollab, including a zero-day flaw – and a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Oracle WebLogic Server that has been abused for at least five years.

Here are the three, all of which the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) based on evidence of active exploitation:

* [CVE-2024-41713](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41713) Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability: Patch available, data leakage or deletion possible by unauthenticated users
* [CVE-2024-55550](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55550) Mitel MiCollab Path Traversal Vulnerability: Patch not available, data leakage to authenticated admin users
* [CVE-2020-2883](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-2883) Oracle WebLogic Server Unspecified Vulnerability: Patch available, remote-code execution through deserialization

Two of the three – Mitel's CVE-2024-41713, and Oracle's CVE-2020-2883 – have been fixed by the respective vendors, while CVE-2024-55550 remains in flux; security researchers...
