# That ticking noise is your end users‚Äô laptops

*Graham Cluley Security News is sponsored this week by the folks at **Kolide**. Thanks to the great team there for their support!*

Here‚Äôs an uncomfortable fact: at most companies, employees can download sensitive company data onto any device, keep it there forever, and never even know that they‚Äôre doing something wrong.

Kolide‚Äôs new report, [‚ÄúThe State of Sensitive Data‚Äù](https://l.kolide.co/3XhTg1c), shines a light on an area of security that is often ignored, but is nevertheless a massive hole in many companies‚Äô Zero Trust fortress.

![Kolide chart](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kolide-chart.jpeg)

These findings are particularly alarming given the overall state of device security. IT teams routinely struggle to enforce timely OS updates and patch management, meaning that end users are storing your most sensitive data‚Äìthings like customer records, confidential IP, and plain-text access credentials‚Äìon devices that are vulnerable to attack.

This problem has gone unaddressed because until now there hasn‚Äôt been a good solution for it. [MDM solutions are too blunt an instrument](https://l.kolide.co/3RYZ2nv) for dealing with sensitive data, and [DLP tools are too extreme and invasive](https://l.kolide.co/3jFSz41) for most companies. After all, you‚Äôre not trying to ban downloads together, nor regard every download as suspicious. You‚Äôre just trying to make sure employees aren‚Äôt keeping data for longer than they need or keeping it on an unmanaged or unsecure device.

Kolide offers a more nuanced approach to setting and enforcing sensitive data policies.

**Our premise is simple: if an employee‚Äôs device is out of compliance, it can‚Äôt access your apps.**

Kolide lets admins run queries to detect sensitive data, flag devices that have violated policies, and enforce OS and browser updates so vulnerable devices aren‚Äôt accessing data.

Our unique approach makes device compliance part of the authentication process. If a device isn‚Äôt compliant, users can‚Äôt log in to their cloud apps until they‚Äôve fixed the problem. But instead of creating more work for IT, Kolide provides instructions so users can get unblocked on their own.
