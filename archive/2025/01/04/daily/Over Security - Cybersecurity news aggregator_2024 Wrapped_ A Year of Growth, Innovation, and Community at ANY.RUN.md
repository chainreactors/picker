2024 Wrapped: A Year of Growth, Innovation, and Community at ANY.RUN

As we wrap up 2024, let’s take a moment to reflect on what an incredible year it’s been for [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=annual-report-2024&utm_term=080125&utm_content=linktolanding). Together, we’ve achieved so much: breaking barriers, improving tools, and working side by side with you, our amazing community of cybersecurity heroes.

From big product launches to small tweaks that make a huge difference, everything we’ve done this year has been with one goal in mind: to make your fight against cyber threats easier, smarter, and faster.

Let’s take a look back at some of the highlights that made this year unforgettable!

## Interactive Sandbox

This year, we took significant strides to enhance your experience with the ANY.RUN sandbox, introducing new features and upgrades to help you combat cyber threats more effectively.

### Linux OS Support for In-Depth Malware Analysis

For the first time, our sandbox [extended its capabilities beyond Windows](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/linux-malware-analysis-sandbox/), making it possible for malware analysts, SOC teams, and DFIR experts to analyze Linux-based samples in a secure and interactive cloud environment.

With real-time monitoring of suspicious activities, detailed reports featuring the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix, Process Graphs, and IOCs, you can now uncover threats on Linux systems with the same precision and speed you’ve come to expect from ANY.RUN.

### Universal Windows 10 x64 Access

In 2024, we [made Windows 10 (64-bit) VMs available to all users](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows-10-sandbox/), including those on the Community plan!

Everyone can analyze malware and phishing threats in a modern Windows environment, leveling the playing field for cybersecurity investigations.

This update ensures everyone can access powerful threat analysis tools and helps improve threat detection for the entire ANY.RUN community.

### Automated Interactivity: Smarter and Faster Malware Detonation

With [Stage 2 Automated Interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity-stage-two/), ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox now handles even more complex malware and phishing scenarios automatically. From extracting URLs in QR codes to detonating payloads in email attachments and navigating long redirect chains, it’s all done without user input.

Our analyst team continuously adds new attack scenarios, ensuring your sandbox stays one step ahead of evolving threats!

### A New Look at Network Threats: Redesigned Details Window

IIn 2024, we [revamped the Threat details window](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/new-threat-details-window/) to give you a clearer view of malware activity. Now, you can access all key intel, like source data, IP addresses, ports, and protocols, in one streamlined view.

And for Hunter and Enterprise users, the new [*Suricata rule* tab](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/detection-with-suricata-ids/) opens the door to the signatures behind the detections.

### PowerShell Support in Script Tracer

This year, we supercharged our Script Tracer by [adding PowerShell support](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/powershell-script-tracer/) to its arsenal, alongside JScript, VB Script, VBA, and Macro 4.0.
