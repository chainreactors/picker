It is an exploit module/toolkit targeting Apache path traversal vulnerability. The primary CVE ID is CVE-2021-41773. The target product/service is Apache, and the vulnerability class/vector is path traversal. The probable entry point is the `poc` function in the `get` module. Notable dependencies/tooling include the `argparse` library for command-line argument parsing. The execution context is a Python CLI application. The run method is typically invoked by executing the `main.py` file with the required command-line arguments. Preconditions include a vulnerable Apache version or configuration. The expected impact is remote code execution. Observable network artifacts include the exploitation of the path traversal vulnerability, which may result in unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories.
