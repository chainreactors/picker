I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

Two weeks ago, the Washington Post reported that the [U.K. government had issued a secret order to Apple](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/) demanding that the company include a “backdoor” into the company’s [end-to-end encrypted iCloud Backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756) feature. From the [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/):

> The British government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies. Its application would mark a significant defeat for tech companies in their decades-long battle to avoid being wielded as government tools against their users, the people said, speaking under the condition of anonymity to discuss legally and politically sensitive issues.

That same report predicted that Apple would soon be disabling their end-to-end encrypted iCloud backup feature (called [Advanced Data Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756)) for all U.K. users. On Friday, [this prediction was confirmed:](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo)

Apple’s decision to disable their encrypted cloud backup feature has triggered many reactions, including a few angry [takes by Apple critics](https://x.com/timsweeneyepic), accusing Apple of selling out its users:

With all this in mind, I think it’s time to take a sober look at what might really happening here. This will require some speculation and educated guesswork. But I think that exercise will be a lot more helpful to us if we want to find out what’s really going on.

### Question 1: does Apple really care about encryption?

Encryption is a tool that protects user data by processing it using a key, so that only the holder of the appropriate key can read it. A variant called *end-to-end encryption* (E2EE) uses keys that only the user (or *users*) knows. The benefit of this approach is that data is protected from many threats that face centralized repositories: theft, cyber attacks, and even access by [sophisticated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Typhoon) [state-sponsored attackers.](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/russia-targeting-signal-messenger) One downside of this encryption is that it can also block [governments and law enforcement agencies from accessing the same data](https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course).

Navigating this tradeoff has been a thorny problem for Apple. Nevertheless, Apple has *mostly* opted to err on the side of aggressive deployment of (end-...
