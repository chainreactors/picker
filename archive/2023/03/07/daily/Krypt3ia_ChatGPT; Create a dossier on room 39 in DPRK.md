Room 39 is a secretive organization within the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) that is believed to be involved in illegal activities, including money laundering, arms smuggling, and counterfeiting. Here is a dossier on Room 39, detailing its history, operations, and significance.

The exact location of Room 39 within the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is unknown, as the organization operates under a high level of secrecy and its members are believed to be highly skilled at concealing their activities and avoiding detection.

However, it is widely believed that Room 39 is headquartered in the capital city of Pyongyang, and that it has branch offices and operational centers throughout the country. The organization is thought to operate under the direct authority of the North Korean leadership, and to have close ties to the country’s ruling elite.

Despite its secretive nature, Room 39 has been the subject of intense scrutiny by international organizations and governments, as its illicit activities are seen as a major challenge to regional stability and security. Efforts to track the organization’s activities and disrupt its operations have been ongoing for many years, but progress has been limited by the organization’s secrecy and the support it enjoys from the North Korean regime.

The exact amount of money that flows through Room 39 is difficult to estimate due to the secretive nature of the organization and its operations. However, some estimates suggest that the organization generates billions of dollars in revenue each year, largely through illicit activities such as money laundering, counterfeiting, and smuggling.

It is widely believed that a significant portion of the revenue generated by Room 39 is used to fund the North Korean regime’s military and nuclear programs. However, it is unclear how much of this revenue is directly funneled into the accounts of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for three generations.

While there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that the Kim family directly benefits from Room 39’s activities, some reports suggest that members of the family have used the organization to acquire luxury goods and other items that are subject to international restrictions. For example, a 2017 report by the United Nations suggested that Kim Jong Un had used front companies associated with Room 39 to acquire luxury yachts, musical instruments, and other items.

**History**

Room 39 was established in the late 1970s by Kim Jong Il, the former Supreme Leader of North Korea and the father of current leader Kim Jong Un. The organization is believed to have been created to provide a source of foreign currency for the North Korean regime, which has been subject to international sanctions and trade restrictions.

One of the key tactics used by Room 39 in its illicit operations is the use of grey markets. Grey markets are informal networks of traders and middlemen who operate outside of formal channels of commerce, often in the context of goods that are subject to sanctions or trade restrictions.

Room 39 is believed to be involved in a wide range of grey market activities, including the smuggling of goods and the evasion of international sanctions. The organization is thought to use a network of front companies and intermediaries to transfer funds and goods, and to conceal its activities from international authorities.

For example, Room 39 has been linked to the smuggling of minerals, such as coal and iron ore, which are subject to international sanctions. The organization is believed to use a network of traders and middlemen to transfer these goods across borders, often using deceptive practices such as mislabeling or transshipment to avoid detection.

Room 39 has also been linked to the smuggling of luxury goods, such as high-end automobiles, watches, and liquor. These goods are subject to international restrictions, as they are believed to provide a source of revenue and prestige for the North Korean regime. Room 39 is thought to use a range of tactics to evade these restrictions, such as the use of front companies and the exploitation of loopholes in international regulations.

In addition to its grey market activities, Room 39 is also believed to be involved in a range of other illicit activities, including money laundering, counterfeiting, and the production of illegal drugs. The organization’s operations are highly secretive, and it is notoriously difficult to identify its members or track its activities. Nevertheless, Room 39 is widely believed to be a significant source of revenue for the North Korean regime, and its activities are seen as a major challenge to international efforts to promote stability and security in the region.

**Operations**

Room 39 is believed to be involved in a wide range of illegal activities, including:

* Money laundering: Room 39 is thought to be involved in laundering money from drug trafficking, smuggling, and other illicit activities. The organization is believed to operate several front companies in China and other countries to facilitate the transfer of funds. According to a report by the US Department of the Treasury, Room 39 has used these companies to conduct transactions worth millions of dollars.
* Counterfeiting: Room 39 is believed to be involved in the production of counterfeit US dollars and other currencies. The organization is reported to have sophisticated facilities and printing equipment, and to use advanced techniques to avoid detection. In 2019, a Hong Kong-based news outlet reported that North Korea was using its embassy in Beijing as a base for its counterfeiting operations, with Room 39 reportedly involved in the scheme.
* Trading: Room 39 is also believed to engage in legitimate business activities, such as trading in minerals, metals, and other commodities. These activities are believed to provide cover for its illegal operations and to generate revenue for the regime. According to a report by the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, Room 39 has been involved in the export of coal, iron ore, and other minerals to China and other countries.
* Arms smuggling: Room 39 is believed to be involved in the smuggling of weapons and military equipment, including missiles and nuclear components. According to a report by the US Department of State, the organization has been involved in arms smuggling to countries in the Middle East and Africa, and has also provided military training and support to non-state actors.

**Cyber Operations**

North Korea has been linked to a number of cyber operations in recent years, many of which are believed to be conducted by the country’s military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). These operations include attacks on financial institutions, cyber espionage, and the theft of cryptocurrency.

While the exact role of Room 39 in these cyber operations is unclear, it is believed that the organization plays a key role in generating revenue for the regime from cybercrime. For example, Room 39 is believed to be involved in the theft of cryptocurrency, which is then used to fund the regime’s military and nuclear programs. In addition, the organization is thought to be involved in the development of advanced cyber capabilities, which are use...
