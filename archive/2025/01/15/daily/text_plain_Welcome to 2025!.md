*I‚Äôd intended to write this post weeks ago, but I‚Äôve been rather unproductive.*

I ran the Dallas Half Marathon with an out-of-town friend on December 15th. It was a hard and very slow trek, but I managed to get back to a run in the last mile and I didn‚Äôt get hurt, so I‚Äôm counting it as a win.

The boys and I went to see the Ravens play the Texans in Houston on Christmas Day.

The game itself was a miserable 31-2 blowout‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but the (surprise?) halftime artist was neat. Beyonce put on an impressive show, even from our nose-bleed seats.

We spent the night in Houston, and two days later flew to Miami for a seven-night cruise.

We had a *pleasant-if-expensive* overnight (Miami holiday hotels are $$$!). We first Uber‚Äôd to Coral Gables‚Äô Hampton Inn, then experimented with the very convenient light-rail across the street to get to dinner. Noah loved the food at Bocas Grill and Nate and I both liked it too.

Insane dessert milkshake

We easily made our way to the cruise terminal the next morning, again by Uber because the light-rail doesn‚Äôt go out to the piers. Alas, once we arrived it was impossible to really appreciate the enormity of the ship from the terminal.

I was worried that Royal‚Äôs [Icon of the Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_of_the_Seas) was going to be much too big for my taste, but it really wasn‚Äôt‚Äì the layout was awesome, and there was so much to do.

Our balcony room was not nearly as large as the suite on our summer cruise, but it was still very nice; the Icon is less than a year old and most of the updates (e.g. USB ports all over) were very convenient.

We brought 110 rubber ducks to hide on the boat, and Nate and I had a good time finding spots for them.

For our first excursion, we took a smaller ferry boat from [St. Kitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Kitts) to the adjacent Nevis to the sound of a steel drum player:

Once we arrived, Nate and I went in the ocean and he played in the sand, while Noah hung out in the adjacent beach restaurant and watched football.

The ferry‚Äôs engine broke down on the way back, but the music played on and the bar stayed open. As the last day of 2024 before the start of Dry January, I took full advantage. Nate and Noah enjoyed endless cups of fruit punch and a dozen varieties of Cheetos. *(Who knew there were so many?!?)*

Nate does not allow pictures

Nate entertained himself on the trip back (and much of the rest of the cruise) chatting up teen girls, most of whom he met after getting into staring contests with them ü§£. Noah found some kids his own age to hang out with.

After an entertaining tow back to the ship, dinner that night included celebratory hats and noisemakers, and Nate took full advantage.

A massive balloon drop marked the start of the new year. Nate was amongst the revellers, and I took pictures through the skylight from the park above:

Nate brought some of the balloons back to the room:

The following morning we were in St. Thomas. A very short bus ride took us to a beach where Nate lazed under an umbrella and Noah and I took a rented jet ski out for a half hour trip. He whooped wildly as we flew across the water, maxing it out at 77kph. He wanted to move on to one of the two cars (think of a jetski with seating for four with a shell like a sports car), but they were dramatically more expensive ($350 vs. $80) so we didn‚Äôt try them. He also was interested in trying the awesome-looking ‚Äúwater jetpack‚Äù ([Flyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Bm3cs9TFo)) but we didn‚Äôt manage to figure out where to rent one.

Noah spent the rest of the excursion tossing the football in the water as I tracked down lunch (apparently nobody starts cooking until noon in the US Virgin Islands).

After rushing to finish burgers before our early-afternoon departure, we ran through a souvenir shop and reboarded the Icon. We had the early dinner slot and Noah was happy to again enjoy his ‚ÄúSurf-and-Turf‚Äù:

The kids passed time on sea days and in the evenings playing miniature golf, games on the sport court, watching NFL games, and chatting with other kids they met on the trip. *(Surprisingly, one of Noah...
