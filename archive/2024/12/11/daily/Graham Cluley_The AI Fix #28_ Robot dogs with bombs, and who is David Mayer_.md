In episode 28 of The AI Fix, the new version of ChatGPT does a surprisingly good job of telling Mark how to defend himself from a flame thrower-wielding robot dog in his living room, Graham loses 30,000 robots on the head of a pin, our hosts meet a human washing machine from the fifties, and Dr Who finds a new way to get worse.

Graham wonders if teaching robot dogs to drop bombs is a good idea, and Mark meets ChatGPT‚Äôs answer to Voldemort: David Mayer.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
