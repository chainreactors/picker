# Using threat modeling to get your priorities right

## State actors - what reactors?

Webinar How does your security team prioritize work? When a new attack from a state actor hits the news, do you know if your team should drop everything to hunt for IOCs? Do you understand your security control coverage for the threat actors that might target your organization? Recently, the Red Canary corporate security team asked itself these questions when it was creating its own threat model.

You can find out the answers by [joining our Regcast](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/17643/use-threat-modelling-to-get-your-priorities-right?td=promo) on January 13, 2023, 5 pm GMT/ 12 pm ET/ 9 am PT, in which Aaron Tekippe of Red Canary tells The Reg's Tim Phillips what they learned from experience, and how to improve your effectiveness by implementing your threat model. They will be discussing:

* How a model helps your team to prioritize the threats that matter.
* A proven approach for creating a threat model.
* The lessons Red Canary learned from experience.

Register [here](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/17643/use-threat-modelling-to-get-your-priorities-right) and we will send you a reminder.

*Sponsored by Red Canary.*
