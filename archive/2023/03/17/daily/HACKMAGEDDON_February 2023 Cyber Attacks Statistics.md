After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/02/27/1-15-february-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/03/14/16-28-february-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of February 2023 where I have collected and analyzed 325 events, the new record in terms of events. The new year did not look good and it’s confirming the trend.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, once again above 80% with a value slightly higher than the previous month (**83.7%** vs **82.2%**). The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** are up **9.2%** from **6.8%**. **Hacktivism** slides to **4%** from **6.4%** and **Cyber Warfare** plummets to **1.2%** from **2.1%**.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, with **40%** from **44.8%** ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers**, up to **20.9%** from **12.5%** and **Targeted** Attacks with **8%** from **4.3%** and **Vulnerabilities** at **7.4%**from **8,2%**.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, with **25.5%** from **23.5%**, ahead of **Healthcare** with **10.5%** (it was **10.1%** in January) and **Tech** companies.

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Infographic-Feb-2023-scaled.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
