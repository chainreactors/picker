**As one of the only EU-based Cyber Security companies, NVISO successfully participated in a first-of-its-kind, MITRE-led, evaluation of Managed Security Services (MSS).**

During this evaluation, NVISO was tested on its ability to detect and report advanced attacks that were executed by the MITRE team.

“The tests were simulating real-life scenarios in which only detection and reporting was evaluated – we were not allowed to block or respond to any attacks”, says Erik Van Buggenhout, Partner, responsible for Managed Security Services at NVISO. A test environment was set up in which participants would deploy their tools and detection services.

“NVISO chose to deploy Palo Alto’s Cortex XDR – an XDR tool that integrates seamlessly into our service and client environments. The combination of XDR with our NITRO automation platform and NVISO world-class expertise ensures that our Managed Detection and Response service is top notch and future-proof. While we have always believed in our own strategy, we are excited and proud to receive MITRE’s external and independent validation of the outstanding quality of our services.”, Erik says.

NVISO was one of the only EU-based Cyber Security companies participating in this elite evaluation. “NVISO is a true European Cyber Security company, which is reflected well in its mission: to safeguard the foundations of European society from cyber attacks”, says Maxim Deweerdt, head of MSS presales at NVISO.

NVISO was founded in 2013 in Belgium, has since offered services to large and mid-sized customers in almost 20 countries, mostly in Europe. NVISO has offices in Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Athens. “The way NVISO approaches Managed Detection and Response is typical for our company: we challenge the status-quo and provide an innovative approach driven by our expertise and long experience in cyber defense”, Maxim says, “This evaluation has highlighted and validated our approach, and confirms the positive feedback we receive from customers”.
