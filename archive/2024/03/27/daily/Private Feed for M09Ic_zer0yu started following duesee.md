# Hello üêà

I'm a software engineer and IT security researcher interested in email security, network protocols, and applied cryptography.
I believe in public software, open access to knowledge, and a world with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Rustacean. He/Him.

## Freelancing

I recently started a journey as a freelancing software engineer to work on projects and with clients that share my passion for open-source software.

My core strengths encompass email protocols, applied cryptography, public-key infrastructures, and diligent software design in Rust.
Generally, I enjoy writing parsers for complex protocols and designing usable, misuse-resistant APIs.
Still, I am inquisitive and would love to work with geo-information and embedded systems to enter the renewable energy sector.

I co-authored several research papers on end-to-end encrypted email (IMF, MIME, S/MIME, OpenPGP, ‚Ä¶), transport encryption (TLS, X.509, ‚Ä¶), and web security (ALPN, SOP, ‚Ä¶) that uncovered numerous security issues, leading to protocol revisions in Internet standards such as S/MIME, OpenPGP, and the IMAP protocol.

Beyond my technical expertise, I can translate complex technical topics into accessible, engaging content for a broader audience to promote projects effectively.

I am particularly drawn to projects promoting open-source software, secure commun...
