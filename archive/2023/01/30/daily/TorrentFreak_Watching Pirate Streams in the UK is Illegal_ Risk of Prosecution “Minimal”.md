# Watching Pirate Streams in the UK is Illegal: Risk of Prosecution “Minimal”

This month millions of people read that two UK men had been sentenced to 16 months in prison "for watching unauthorized streams." Since the actual risk of prosecution was never explained, today we'll reveal the information that everyone should've been told from the start. Context is indeed everything.

[![football](https://torrentfreak.com/images/oldball.jpg)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/oldball.jpg)As outlined again [only this month](https://torrentfreak.com/370-pirate-iptv-sellers-faced-legal-action-after-cjeu-filmspeler-ruling-230110/), people who simply watch pirate streams break UK law. If the content comes from an illegal source, it’s illegal to consume it under copyright law. That is a fact – there is no debate.

The problem for rightsholders is that copyright cases are complex, difficult to prove, and won’t end in a prison sentence under civil law. A stronger, *criminal* angle might prove more persuasive.

The Federation Against Copyright Theft, which acts for the Premier League, SKY, and BT Sport, came up with a solution – [Section 11 of the Fraud Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/notes/division/5/11#:~:text=Section%2011%3A%20Obtaining%20services%20dishonestly&text=Section%2011%20makes%20it%20an,or%20that%20they%20might%20be.), which criminalizes the act of obtaining any kind of service dishonestly.

With a potential crime now part of the equation, the logical conclusion for Joe Public is that people risk being arrested in their own homes for watching an unlicensed stream. Of course, people also need to be persuaded that an underfunded police force doesn’t have bigger fish to fry.

## Press Hysteria

Early January, FACT sent out a press release titled “Police visit homes across the UK to issue warnings to subscribers of illegal sports streaming services.” The image below shows the first two paragraphs;

[![para2-fact](https://torrentfreak.com/images/para2-fact.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/para2-fact.png)

We’ll return to the first paragraph shortly, but as anyone can see, there are two distinct statements. One says that FACT and police will be visiting homes. The second says that 1,000 people were identified after a raid on a streaming service. Nowhere does it say that FACT and police will be visiting the homes of 1,000 people.

[![1000homes](https://torrentfreak.com/images/1000homes.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/1000homes.png)

Dozens of articles just like these perpetuated the idea of a massive crackdown but the truth is more mundane. Some people will indeed get a personal visit, but the rest will be contacted by email, as confirmed by FACT when TorrentFreak questioned the volume.

## Prison “For Watching Unauthorized Streams”

Let’s get this absolutely clear. While it is illegal under both civil and criminal law, nobody has ever gone to prison for simply watching an unauthorized stream in the UK. That doesn’t mean it won’t eventually happen, but the snippet (below) from FACT’s press release shouldn’t have been reported in isolation.

[![prisonwatchiptv](https://torrentfreak.com/images/prisonwatchiptv.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/prisonwatchiptv.png)

Important and relevant information about these men was made available by FACT at the same time but given no weight in popular media. That led to widespread misinformation that could’ve been avoided.

The prospect of ordinary people going to prison for simply viewing an unlicensed stream is an extraordinary claim and it’s a journalist’s job to investigate extraordinary claims. If it’s true that simply viewing unlicensed streams will put UK internet users in prison for months, millions of families face the prospect of seeing loved ones behind bars.

That’s the bigger story that needed to be investigated, and it would’ve been ridiculously easy too. Simply scrolling to the bottom of the FACT press release reveals that both jailed men were operators of illegal streaming services and both pleaded guilty to multiple copyright and fraud offenses.

The prosecution *in Millington’s trial alone* estimated damages running to **well over £10 million**. Instead, the ‘news’ that two men were arrested and sent to jail for 16 months for *simply watching streams* went all around the world, almost completely unchallenged.

[![photo-grid](https://torrentfreak.com/images/photo-grid.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/photo-grid.png)

As the snippets above show, news outlets in Brazil, Russia, Poland, China, Greece, Italy, Thailand, Spain, Indonesia and beyond, not only repeated the statement without any context, but helped to make it an established and uncontested ‘fact’ around the world.

Now here’s what actually happened, to set the record straight.

## No Ordinary Pirate Stream Watcher

The details in Millington’s case reveal that the opportunity for a “watching streams” conviction came gift-wrapped and tied up in gold ribbon.

The most serious charges against him related to his Kodi-based ‘stephen-builds’ software packages, which included the ‘Supremacy’ and ‘Supremacy Sports’ addons that provided his users with free access to illegal streams.

For context, Supremacy was one of the most-used pirate addons on the entire planet and, according to the lawyer who prosecuted Millington, was responsible for causing more than £10 million in damages to rightsholders.

[![supremacy kodi](https://torrentfreak.com/images/image-70.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/image-70.png)

Millington pleaded guilty to charges under [Section 7](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35/section/7) of the Fraud Act (making or supplying articles for use in fraud) and under the Copyright Act for distributing movies and other content via a Plex server.

He also pleaded guilty to **watching illegal streams** under **Section 11 of the Fraud Act** (obtaining a service dishonestly) but the background shows this was no ordinary case.

For several months after his home was raided, Millington’s defense was that the software and equipment he had accumulated existed for his own personal use. He was a keen gamer but also admitted that he used the equipment for viewing pirate streams via software he developed.

Millington later changed his plea to guilty but there was a pivotal moment: To advertise his Kodi-related products online, Millington recorded a video of himself as he used his own pirate software to access illegal streams.

That video was found on his phone during the investigation. The prosecution then took the opportunity to add a charge of viewing illegal streams to a case where the defendant ultimately had no choice but to plead guilty, due to a mountain of evidence. It’s still a conviction for watching unlicensed streams but in this case, context is everything.

The source of this information is vitally important too.
