![Is my website hacked? 13 signs and symptoms of a compromised site.](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/23-BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_Is-my-site-hacked-820x386.jpg)

Symptoms of a hack can vary wildly. A concerning security alert from Google, a browser warning when you visit your site, or even a notice from your hosting provider that they’ve taken down your website — all of these events may indicate that your site has been hacked.

Fortunately, there are a number of quick (and free) ways you can check and find out if your website has been compromised.

In this post, we’ll discuss some of the obvious symptoms of a hacked site. We’ll also outline the steps you can take to confirm and identify a compromise in your environment.

## Common signs of a hacked site

Some of the most common signs of a hacked website include:

* [Spam keywords in Google search results.](#spam-keywords)
* [Strange JavaScript in your website files.](#strange-javascript)
* [Browser warnings whenever you visit your site.](#browser-warnings)
* [Unexpected redirects from your site.](#unexpected-redirects)
* [Unwanted ads or pop-ups on your web pages.](#unwanted-ads)
* [Search results show “This site may be hacked”.](#site-may-be-hacked)
* [Hosting alerts suggest a hack.](#hosting-alerts)
* [Unfamiliar pages are indexed.](#unfamiliar-pages)
* [Customer complaints about fraud or stolen credit cards.](#fraud)
* [Unexpected error messages in server logs.](#erorrs-logs)
* [New FTP or admin users on your site.](#new-ftp-admins)
* [Changes to core system files, plugins, or themes.](#file-changes)
* [Modifications to your .htaccess file.](#changes-htaccess)

Let’s dive into the details of these symptoms.

### 1. Your Google search results contain spam keywords.

SEO spam infections can end up polluting search results with spam keywords for escort services, pharmaceutical drugs, or even knock-off designer brands.

![Example of pharmaceutical spam in Google search results after a website is hacked](https://sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/polluted_search_results.png)

Pharmaceutical spam in Google search results.

If you Google your website and your search results suddenly contain keywords for pharmaceuticals, essay writing services, or adult services, you may have been the victim of [spamdexing](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/02/spamdexing-seo-spam.html). When left unaddressed, this blatant attempt by hackers to manipulate search engine rankings can have a serious impact on your website’s organic traffic and search rankings.

### 2. You find strange JavaScript in your website files.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s used extensively across web pages, CMS’s and other major web applications.

Since it’s executed at the browser level, attackers often attach malicious code to the web pages of a hacked website which tricks the browser into executing the malware whenever the browser is reloaded. This allows a hacker to easily modify a web pages’ behavior and perform background requests.

Malicious JavaScript injections can be used to serve [credit card stealers on ecommerce websites](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/manually-identifying-an-x-cart-credit-card-skimmer.html), deliver [cross-site scripting attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-cross-site-scripting/), perform malicious actions, or even [redirect site visitors to unwanted spam content](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/massive-wordpress-javascript-injection-campaign-redirects-to-ads.html).

In fact, in the past year our research and remediation teams have seen an influx in the number of website infections related to [SocGholish](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html) — a JavaScript malware framework known to serve remote access trojans and information stealers to unsuspecting victims.
