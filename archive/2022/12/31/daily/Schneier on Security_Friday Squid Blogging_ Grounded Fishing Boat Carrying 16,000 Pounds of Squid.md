## Friday Squid Blogging: Grounded Fishing Boat Carrying 16,000 Pounds of Squid

Rough seas are hampering efforts to [salvage the boat](https://www.noozhawk.com/rough-sea-conditions-hamper-efforts-to-salvage-fishing-boat-at-santa-cruz-island/):

> The Speranza Marie, carrying 16,000 pounds of squid and some 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel, hit the shoreline near Chinese Harbor at about 2 a.m. on Dec. 15.
>
> Six crew members were on board, and all were rescued without injury by another fishing boat.
>
> […]
>
> However, large swells caused by the recent storm caused the Speranza Marie to pull loose from it anchored position and drift about 100 yards from from its original grounded location in Chinese Harbor, according to the Coast Guard.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Blog article in German from Chaos Computer Club at <https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2022/afghanistan-biometrie>

CCC captures US military biometrics database

The U.S. military has used masses of devices to biometrically enroll people in Afghanistan. Some devices were left behind during the hasty withdrawal of NATO troops. CCC researchers have found large amounts of biometric and other personal data in analyses of such devices. In the wrong hands, this data means danger to the lives of people in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The biometrics devices were used to identify people, including at checkpoints when searching for wanted persons, or to control access for local forces. On used U.S. military equipment, we discovered, among other things, an unprotected biometrics database containing names, fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs of more than 2,600 Afghans and Iraqis.

@ Beatrix Willius, ALL,

Re : Left behind bio-metrics

> “The U.S. military has used masses of devices to biometrically enroll people in Afghanistan. Some devices were left behind during the hasty withdrawal of NATO troops.”

Actually it was the US “Inteligence Community”(IC) masquerading as soldiers “being under flag” in uniform, which gained them the protection of the “Geneva Convention” their actuall activities should not have entitled them to.

The fact the US IC left behind such large quantaties of data “is to be expected” as they have a very long history of doing exactly this from WWII onwards. Much to the detriment of those left behind on almost all occasions.

After all do those who grab such records realy care if you were “co-operating” with US IC willingly or under significant duress?

Nope as far as they are concerned you were a traitor and more than likely as not treat you as such. And in quite a few cases “not worth a bullet” just a stab with a knife, or public beheading or hanging as a warning to others. Look back over what happened with the fall of the Shar of Persia, in what we now call Iran.

Just think back to the “underpants bomb” plot, US politicians were more than happy to “burn the source” who was an asset from another country that had taken years to get into place. Then there was the work of the Dutch Inteligence service, using the cameras in laptops to identify Russian and other hackers working for the Russian Government. Again US politicians and US IC blabed it all out thus “burning the method”.

But more recently the truely appaling lack of security of agent handling via a very insecure Internet based system. That Iran and China used to identify and interrogate / torture / exocute dozens if not potebtially hundreds of people.

@All

“end-to-end encryption” now means (Apple) encrypted data through a derivative of a password, so essentially weak secret key symmetric encryption.

“zero knowledge” now means (LastPass) that some data are in plain text (or Base64!) and totally exposed.

What’s the next concept to be abused by PR people and their companies?!?

Your political party affiliation can influence your life expectancy, at least it has done so in the previous 2 years.

But we can also conclude that gullibility is a deadly mental condition. But we already knew that.

New cars and trucks are to get kill switches operable by law enforcement and able to notice whether the driver is impaired, the switches to be mandatorily installed by vehicle manufacturers under recent Federal law, with enforcement delayed by 5 years, according to [Motorious](https://www.motorious.com/articles/features-3/kill-switches-new-cars/) (as accessed yesterday).

@Beatrix Willius, @Clive Robinson:

It would nice to get some kind of response from appropriate US officials. This is great from one standpoint: there are plenty of researchers who look into this sort of thing.

Researchers of voting machines in the US were getting drowned out by voices who did not respect the work of researchers. Anybody who does this kind of research ought to be acknowledged. Good job, “Chaos”; “Control” is watching out for you!

But why?

In theory, it is not their problem.
