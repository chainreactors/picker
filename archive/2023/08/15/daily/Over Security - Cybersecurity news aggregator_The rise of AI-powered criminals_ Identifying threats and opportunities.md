[On The Radar](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/on-the-radar/)

* AI’s influence is growing across the security space, bringing with it major implications for cybercriminals and defenders.
* The recent adoption of AI has raised significant concerns for cybersecurity due to the many ways that criminals can use AI for disruption and profit.
* Defenders and law enforcement can use AI to strengthen cybersecurity and counteract illicit activities.

The past decade has seen a massive adoption in machine learning and artificial intelligence. An increasing number of organizations have been leveraging such technologies to automate their operations and make their products and services better.

Despite the extensive use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) by organizations for some time now, many users have first interacted with such technologies over the past few months in the form of generative AI helping users to generate text, code, images and other digital assets with the provision of limited input. The [likes of ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) have brought AI to the top of the public’s mind, fueling an intensive race for AI development.

As with any innovation, the use of AI is expected to have positive and negative effects on global culture as we know it, but I suspect that cybercrime will be one of the areas most affected. On the negative side, AI can help streamline criminals' operations, making them more efficient, sophisticated, and scalable while allowing them to evade detection and attribution. Concerning the positive impact of AI on cybersecurity, defenders, and law enforcement, can use AI to counteract advancements in illicit activity by developing new tools, tactics and strategies to automate data analysis, perform predictive detection of illicit activity and perform more effective attribution of criminal activity.

It is important to acknowledge that the AI use cases discussed in this blog encompass a range of varying complexities to achieve for both criminals and defenders. Certain use cases can be accomplished using readily available AI-enabled tools, while others demand advanced technical skills, costly infrastructure, and considerable time investments.

## Empowering cybercrime

Cybercriminals are expected to benefit in many ways from advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

A major area of impact of AI tools in cybercrime is the reduced need for human involvement in certain aspects of cybercriminal organizations, such as software development, scamming, extortions, etc., which in turn will decrease the need to recruit new members and lower operational costs due to the reduced need for headcount. While crime-related "job" postings typically find their way onto dark web forums and other anonymous channels, striving to ensure author anonymity, this practice carries significant risks as it could potentially unveil the identities and operations of criminals to whistleblowers and undercover law enforcement agents.

AI presents another avenue for cybercriminals to exploit by utilizing it to analyze enormous amounts of information, including leaked data. This analysis empowers them to identify vulnerabilities or high-value targets, enabling more precise and effective attacks that could potentially yield greater financial gains. Big data analytics is a complex undertaking necessitating significant processing power and thereby limiting its application to potentially large criminal organizations and state-sponsored actors capable of harvesting such power.

Another area of criminal activity that can thrive with AI is the development of more sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks. This includes the creation of remarkably realistic deepfakes, deceitful websites, disinformation campaigns, fraudulent social media profiles and AI-powered scam bots. To illustrate the impact, consider an incident from 2020 wherein an [AI-powered voice cloning attack](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2019/09/03/a-voice-deepfake-was-used-to-scam-a-ceo-out-of-243000/?sh=5532b1f32241) successfully impersonated a CEO, resulting in the theft of more than $240,000 from a UK-based energy company. Similarly, in India criminals employed a machine learning model to analyze and [mimic the writing style](https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-transforms-hacker-arsenal-1510763929) of a victim's email contacts to create highly personalized and persuasive phishing emails.

The utilization of AI is anticipated to also be prevalent among state-sponsored actors and prominent criminal organizations, to propagate disinformation and manipulate the public. Such tactics involve the creation and dissemination of deceptive content, including deep fakes, voice cloning, and the deployment of bots. Evidence of such practices already exists by a cybercriminal group employing AI for social media manipulation and [spreading disinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/technology/ai-chatbots-disinformation.html). This campaign relied on machine learning to identify emerging trends and generate highly convincing fake news articles.

The advancement of malware can also be impacted by allowing authors to streamline the process with the help of AI, enabling the creation of sophisticated and more adaptable malware. Allowing AI-powered malware to employ advanced techniques to evade detection by security solutions, utilizing "self-metamorphic" mechanisms rendering them capable of changing their operations based on the environment they operate in. Furthermore, criminals can potentially harness A...
