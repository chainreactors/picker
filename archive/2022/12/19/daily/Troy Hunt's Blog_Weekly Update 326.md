# Weekly Update 326

18 December 2022

Despite having both my tripod and mic in the wrong suitcase in the wrong place, Scott and I still pulled together a weekly vid from the Norwegian mountains. Much of this week is a combination of our travels here, responses to my tweets around cookie warnings and reactions to Elon's various decisions (and undecisions) on Twitter. Plus, there's the CoinTracker and Gemini breaches which appear to have stemmed from the SendGrid breach, the connection to that incident having been made by CoinTracker just after we had a friendly exchange about the description in HIBP üôÇ

I'll leave you with some epic pics we snapped a few hours after this video, what a sight to behold, especially whilst sitting in the hot tub with good friends and cold beer üòä
