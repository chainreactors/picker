# Weekly Update 465

17 August 2025

How much tech stuff do I have sitting there in progress, literally just within arm's reach? I kick off this week's video going through it, and it's kinda nuts. Doing runeos and house build doesn't help, but it means there's just a constant distraction of "things" commanding my attention. I couldn't even go through writing this very short blog post without feeling the need to see if I could pair that smoke alarm directly to ZHA on Home Assistant without needing the Clipsal hub; I couldn't, so now I have one more thing to troubleshoot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe it all says more about my attention span than anything...
