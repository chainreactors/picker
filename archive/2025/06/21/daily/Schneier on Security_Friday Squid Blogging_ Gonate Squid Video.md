## Friday Squid Blogging: Gonate Squid Video

This is the [first ever](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/antarctic-squid-filmed-alive-first-video) video of the Antarctic Gonate Squid.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce, ALL,

This may be worth looking into,

<https://smex.org/open-letter-to-samsung-end-forced-israeli-app-installations-in-the-wana-region/>

Apparently Samsung have “factory installed” spy-ware on phones sold into certain parts of Asia and Africa that form MENA (covering current regional potential war zones and surrounding areas that might form a supply chain).

With the Spy-Ware originating from an Israeli company that is now owed in the US. As such it is illegal in several MENA states as it’s Israeli in origin even though now “cut out fronted” by a US company (exactly the same behaviour the US has recently accused China of doing).

It appears this “direct install” at the factory end of the supply chain, is to obviate an issue where the spyware has been previously detected,

<https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/adware-installcore>

Worryingly Samsung are one of the major suppliers of phones in the MENA area. Thus this represents a serious security threat by what many countries in the region via as a “Hostile enemy combatant Nation” –Israel– that is actively attacking other nations and assassinating political and other leaders.

This can not end well…

@Clive Robinson, ALL

So Samsung has joined the club, what took them so long?

Ever since Huawei got kicked out of the Google shakedown, they have operated a “Huawei Cloud” offering storage and email, and a “Huawei App-market”, because users demanded it. I have not found any reports linking this with any obligation Huawei may or may not have to the PRC govt. This Cloud and Appstore are now available to users of the peeled off brand “Honor”.

We all know about Google, even resorting to bribery now, e.g, a new Lenovo tablet set up with minimal PII inputs, and liberal use of the “Skip” button, now whenever it goes online pops up a full screen panel:

I’m in the market for a new phone, and a little voice has been nagging me, “Not Samsung.” Now I know why, they’re in the snakepit.

@Clive – do you know did Samsung install similar surveillance technology (microphones and cameras)on their other products: smart TVs, tablets which sold in US and other Western countries and activated/accessed without knowledge of the consumer by known culprits?

=However, AI hallucinations present a problem when it comes to delivering accurate and correct information, especially if users take the information at face value without any
checks or oversight.

“This is especially problematic in domains where decisions depend on factual precision,
like medicine, law or finance,” Watson said. “While more advanced models may reduce the frequency of obvious factual mistakes, the issue persists in more subtle forms. Over time, confabulation erodes the perception of AI systems as trustworthy instruments and can
produce material harms when unverified content is acted upon.”

And this problem looks to be exacerbated as AI advances. “As model capabilities improve,
errors often become less overt but more difficult to detect,” Watson noted. “Fabricated content is increasingly embedded within plausible narratives and coherent reasoning chains.

This introduces a particular risk: users may be unaware that errors are present and may treat outputs as definitive when they are not. The problem shifts from filtering out crude errors to identifying subtle distortions that may only reveal themselves under close scrutiny.”

The situation is further complicated because it can be very difficult to ascertain how LLMs come up with their answers; a parallel could be drawn here with how we still don’t really know, comprehensively, how a human brain works.

> the CEO of AI company Anthropic, highlighted a lack of understanding in how AIs come up
> with answers and information. “When a generative AI system does something, like summarize a financial document, we have no idea, at a specific or precise level, why it makes the choices it does — why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate,” he wrote.

“Another approach involves introducing structure into the model’s reasoning. By prompting it to check its own outputs, compare different perspectives, or follow logical steps, scaffolded reasoning frameworks reduce the risk of unconstrained speculation and improve consistency,” Watson, noting this could be aided by training to shape a model to prioritize accuracy, and reinforcement training from human or AI evaluators to encourage an LLM to deliver more disciplined, grounded responses.

“Finally, systems can be designed to recognize their own uncertainty. Rather than
defaulting to confident answers, models can be taught to flag when they’re unsure or to
defer to human judgment when appropriate,” Watson added. “While these strategies don’t
eliminate the risk of confabulation entirely, they offer a practical path forward to make
AI outputs more reliable.”

ultimately the information that LLMs produce will need to be treated with the “same
skepticism we reserve for human counterparts.”=

@ lurker, not important, ALL,

With regards,

> “So Samsung has joined the club, what took them so long?”

Honestly I don’t know, but I can make some guesses.

For instance does Samsung know it’s very probably an Israeli Operation?

Rather than say a US Operation…

We’ve know for years every mobile device manufacture will “touch their toes” to protect their market...
