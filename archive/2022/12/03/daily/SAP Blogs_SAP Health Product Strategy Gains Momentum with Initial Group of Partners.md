SAP is committed to providing our healthcare customers a wide array of options for building a modular healthcare system landscape that includes many different deployment and integration options. We encourage all partners to engage in building a modular healthcare system landscape based on the established technical integration options with SAP S/4HANA, as well as the newly announced HL7® FHIR® based services as outlined by Thorsten Kampp in his recent [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/28/building-the-path-for-managing-health-data-and-foster-healthcare-interoperability-along-business-processes/). Doing this will allow broad, end-to-end coverage and intelligent support of use cases in categories such as accounting, analytics, clinical supply chain management, sourcing and procurement, human capital management as well as customer experience management.

CompuGroup Medical just announced our intended collaboration to define and enable a deep integration of CGM Clinical and their new Revenue Cycle Management with SAP solutions. Now, we are pleased to announce that the following additional partners have declared their intention to work with SAP:

* ATSP GmbH

* Common Management Solutions S.L.

* Dedalus S.p.A.

* GITG AG

* T-Systems Austria GesmbH

They plan to partner with us either as part of their existing SAP partner engagement models or to join the SAP PartnerEdge program to provide components of hybrid, modular healthcare system landscapes. We are looking forward to expanding our collaboration globally with additional existing partners as well as new prospective partners.

It is our aim to let Healthcare providers benefit from SAP solutions and platforms, as well as the deep and diverse capabilities and geographical coverage of our open ecosystem. The available and intended choice of hospital information system modules, integrations options and services gives our customers the options they need based on current requirements, as well as guidance for their future digital transformation plans.

The use of the SAP Patient Management in a side-by-side setup with SAP S/4HANA is an increasingly adopted and proven approach to start the journey towards a new modular healthcare information system.

SAP invites all interested current and prospective partners to join the SAP Healthcare ecosystem to maximize the business value for our mutual SAP customers.

We are excited about this new development and would love to hear your thoughts on how we can expand our ecosystem’s reach in the healthcare industry. Feel free to share your comments and questions below.
