Security, trust, and stability ‚Äî once the pillars of our digital world ‚Äî are now the tools attackers turn against us. From stolen accounts to fake job offers, cybercriminals keep finding new ways to exploit both system flaws and human behavior.

Each new breach proves a harsh truth: in cybersecurity, feeling safe can be far more dangerous than being alert.

Here's how that false sense of security was broken again this week.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Newly Patched Critical Microsoft WSUS Flaw Comes Under Attack](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/microsoft-issues-emergency-patch-for.html)** ‚Äî Microsoft released out-of-band security updates to patch a critical-severity Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) vulnerability that has since come under active exploitation in the wild. The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-59287 (CVSS score: 9.8), a remote code execution flaw in WSUS that was originally fixed by the tech giant as part of its Patch Tuesday update published last week. According to Eye Security and Huntress, the security flaw is being weaponized to drop a .NET executable and Base64-encoded PowerShell payload to run arbitrary commands on infected hosts.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[YouTube Ghost Network Delivers Stealer Malware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/3000-youtube-videos-exposed-as-malware.html)** ‚Äî A malicious network of YouTube accounts has been observed publishing and promoting videos that lead to malware downloads. Active since 2021, the network has published more than 3,000 malicious videos to date, with the volume of such videos tripling since the start of the year. The campaign leverages hacked accounts and replaces their content with "malicious" videos that are centred around pirated software and Roblox game cheats to infect unsuspecting users searching for them with stealer malware. Some of the videos have amassed hundreds of thousands of views.
* **[N. Korea's Dream Job Campaign Targets Defense Sector](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/north-korean-hackers-lure-defense.html)** ‚Äî Threat actors with ties to North Korea have been attributed to a new wave of attacks targeting European companies active in the defense industry as part of a long-running campaign known as Operation Dream Job. In the observed activity, the Lazarus group sends malware-laced emails purporting to be from recruiters at top companies, ultimately tricking recipients into infecting their own machines with malware such as ScoringMathTea. ESET noted that the attacks singled out companies that supply military equipment, some of which are currently deployed in Ukraine. One of the targeted companies is involved in the production of at least two unmanned aerial vehicles currently used in Ukraine.
* **[MuddyWater Targets 100+ Organisations in Global Espionage Campaign](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/iran-linked-muddywater-targets-100.html)** ‚Äî The Iranian nation-state group known as MuddyWater has been attributed to a new campaign that has leveraged a compromised email account to distribute a backdoor called Phoenix to various organizations across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including over 100 government entities. The end goal of the campaign is to infiltrate high-value targets and facilitate intelligence gathering using a backdoor called Phoenix that's distributed via spear-phishing emails. MuddyWater, also called Boggy Serpens, Cobalt Ulster, Earth Vetala, Mango Sandstorm (formerly Mercury), Seedworm, Static Kitten, TA450, TEMP.Zagros, and Yellow Nix, is assessed to be affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).
* **[Meta Launches New Tools to Protect WhatsApp and Messenger Users from Scams](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/meta-rolls-out-new-tools-to-protect.html)** ‚Äî Meta said it is launching new tools to protect Messenger and WhatsApp users from potential scams. This includes introducing new warnings on WhatsApp when users attempt to share their screen with an unknown contact during a video call. On Messenger, users can opt to enable a setting called "Scam detection" by navigating to Privacy & safety settings. Once it's turned on, users are alerted when they receive a potentially suspicious message from an unknown connection that may contain signs of a scam. The social media giant also said it detected and disrupted close to 8 million accounts on Facebook and Instagram since the start of the year that are associated with criminal scam centers targeting people, including the elderly, across the world through messaging, dating apps, social media, crypto, and other apps. According to Graphika, the illicit money-making schemes target older adults and victims of previous scams. "The scammers use major social media platforms to attract their targets, then redirect them to fraudulent websites or private messages to divulge finan...
