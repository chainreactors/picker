# Exploit Title: Invision Community <= 4.7.20 (calendar/view.php) - SQL Injection
# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 23 July 2025
# Exploit Author: Egidio Romano
# LinkedIn: N/A
# Vendor Homepage: https://invisioncommunity.com
# Software Link: https://invisioncommunity.com
# Version: Certain 4.x versions before 4.7.21
# Tested on: Invision Community <= 4.7.20
# CVE: CVE-2025-48932

## Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability is located within the `/applications/calendar/modules/front/calendar/view.php` script. Specifically, in the `IPS\calendar\modules\front\calendar\view::search()` method, user input passed through the `location` request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to, for example, read sensitive data from the database through boolean-based SQL Injection attacks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the "calendar" application to be installed and a "GeoLocation feature" (like Google Maps) to be configured.

**NOTE:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities in Invision Community 4.x might lead to admin account takeover and RCE attacks, by resetting the admin's password. However, starting from version 4.7.18, a new security encryption key has been introduced within the password reset mechanism. As such, this attack vector won't work anymore with versions >= 4.7.18.

## Proof of Concept

https://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2025-48932.php

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed ...
