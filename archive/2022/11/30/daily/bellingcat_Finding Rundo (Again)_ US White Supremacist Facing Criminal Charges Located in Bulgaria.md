# Finding Rundo (Again): US White Supremacist Facing Criminal Charges Located in Bulgaria

November 29, 2022

Imagine you’re the US far-right extremist Rob Rundo. You don’t want anyone, especially not law enforcement or a pesky researcher from Bellingcat, to know where you are. You’re somewhere in Europe, facing up to ten years in prison if convicted on charges of rioting and conspiracy in a trial due to start next spring in Los Angeles.

But you’ve got a far-right fashion brand to promote and a tough-guy image to project. You need to constantly post on your multiple Telegram channels without coughing up evidence of where you are. And the photos you posted on one of your Telegram channels on 31 October 2022, modelling a new jacket, are perfect — no one could possibly figure out where you are from looking at them. Or so you think.

*Photos posted on Rob Rundo’s fashion brand website on 31 October 2022 (Bellingcat has obscured the logo and text on the jacket here, and in all instances below, to avoid promoting this far-right brand).*

Initially, these pictures appear almost impossible to geolocate. They’re portraits that show no cityscapes, signs or identifiable features in the background — avoiding mistakes Rundo made the first time we at Bellingcat pieced together his whereabouts in our 2020 [investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/11/18/an-american-white-supremacists-new-home-in-serbia/).

There’s no graffiti on the wall that would enable quick identification of the city or neighbourhood, as we were able to do in our 2021 [investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/12/02/on-the-run-again-has-us-white-supremacist-rob-rundo-returned-to-serbia/). All we have to work with is one single stripe of red paint and a wall that looks like it could be almost anywhere. Even the background of the photos is deliberately blurred; Rundo said on a US far-right podcast in November 2022 that, in photos and videos he puts out, “we have to edit so that you can’t tell location.”

The thing is, you *can* tell the location here. And it took us less than ten minutes.

![Image shows a blank wall. Two grates and grey concrete make up the bottom half of the wall and the top half of the wall is off-white colour. There is one distinctive small vertical red line of paint on the wall where the off-white half meets the grey half.](https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2022/11/image4-3-1200x643.jpg)

*A photograph taken by Bellingcat’s reporter at the same location on 13 November 2022*.

Using Google Street View, we discovered that the wall is that of an apartment building in [Plovdiv](https://goo.gl/maps/g89qEYoxNJQ4FZb69), the second-largest city in Bulgaria. The single red stripe was the only clue we needed. We knew where to look because we had geolocated a photo posted on Instagram by a close associate of Rundo. We then assumed, correctly, that this photo was taken nearby.

He certainly didn’t plan to do so, but Rob Rundo — a far-right extremist with a [history of violence](https://www.propublica.org/article/white-hate-group-campaign-of-menace-rise-above-movement) facing up to ten years in prison — has given us an unintended lesson on the real power of open source research methods. By thinking laterally and relationally, forming hypotheses based on a subject’s past behaviour, and piecing together seemingly disparate bits of user-generated content into a coherent narrative, even the hardest nut can be cracked.

## Why Rundo, again?

The co-founder of the Rise Above Movement (RAM), a now-defunct American white supremacist gang, the 32-year-old Rundo was charged in 2018 in relation to violent clashes at several rallies in California in 2017. In June 2019 his case was [dismissed](https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-hb-ram-charges-dropped-20190604-story.html) by a California judge on the grounds that the Anti-Riot Act under which Rundo was charged was unconstitutional. At some point after this, Rundo left the United States a free man and headed to Europe. Rundo declined to comment for this article but when speaking to supporters and followers on various podcasts since he was first charged in 2018, Rundo has claimed he was acting in self-defence.

In November 2020 Bellingcat [revealed](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/11/18/an-american-white-supremacists-new-home-in-serbia/) how Rundo, awaiting the result of a federal appeal against the dismissal of his case, was building a new base for himself and his activities in Belgrade, Serbia. Less than three months after we published our investigation, Serbian media [reported](https://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/saznajemo-americki-neonacista-i-osnivac-zloglasnog-ekstremnog-pokreta-proteran-iz/zelg118) that Belgrade had expelled Rundo from the country.

But as we later [discovered](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2021/12/02/on-the-run-again-has-us-white-supremacist-rob-rundo-returned-to-serbia/), by November 2021, Rundo was back in Serbia. By this time a US federal appeals court had [overturned](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-race-and-ethnicity-san-bernardino-riots-california-dd1dbf5bb9d2648b51acb1c48c1e24ec) the dismissal of Rundo’s charges. However, his hopes for a successful appeal weren’t yet lost; as his lawyer had petitioned the United States Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the ruling.

Unlike the previous two times we’ve written about Rundo, this time something is different. All Rundo’s appeals have been lost — the Supreme Court [rejected](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011822zor_5iel.pdf) his petition for appeal in January 2022. His trial is scheduled to begin in a Los Angeles federal courtroom in April 2023. Rundo is being charged on two counts under the federal Anti-Riot Act ([aiding and abetting a riot](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2101) and [conspiracy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371) to violate the Anti-Riot Act), each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. One of his three co-defendants was booked on the same charges in May 2022 and is being held in pre-trial detention. His other two co-defendants are free on bail, with conditions that include surrendering passports and confining travel to southern California.

Rundo is not known to have participated in any of his court he...
