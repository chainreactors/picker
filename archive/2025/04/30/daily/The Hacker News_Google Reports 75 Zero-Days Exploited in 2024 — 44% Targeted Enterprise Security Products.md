Google has revealed that it observed 75 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in the wild in 2024, down from 98 in 2023 but an increase from 63 the year before.

Of the 75 zero-days, 44% of them targeted enterprise products. As many as 20 flaws were identified in security software and appliances.

"Zero-day exploitation of browsers and mobile devices fell drastically, decreasing by about a third for browsers and by about half for mobile devices compared to what we observed last year," the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) [said](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends) in a report shared with The Hacker news.

"Exploit chains made up of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities continue to be almost exclusively (~90%) used to target mobile devices."

While Microsoft Windows accounted for 22 of the zero-day flaws exploited in 2024, Apple's Safari had three, iOS had two, Android had seven, Chrome had seven, and Mozilla Firefox had one flaw that were abused during the same period. Three of the seven zero-days exploited in Android were found in third-party components.

Among the exploited 33 zero-days in enterprise software and appliances, 20 of them targeted security and network products, such as those from Ivanti, Palo Alto Networks, and Cisco.

"Security and network tools and devices are designed to connect widespread systems and devices with high permissions required to manage the products and their services, making them highly valuable targets for threat actors seeking efficient access into enterprise networks," GTIG researchers noted.

In all, a total of 18 unique enterprise vendors were targeted in 2024, in comparison to 12 in 2021, 17 in 2022, and 22 in 2023. The companies with the most targeted zero-days were Microsoft (26), Google (11), Ivanti (7), and Apple (5).

Google, which defines zero-days as vulnerabilities exploited in the wild before a patch is made publicly available, said state-backed cyber espionage was still the leading motivation behind the exploitation of a significant chunk of the bugs. The zero-day exploitation of 34 of the 75 flaws have been attributed to six broad threat activity clusters -

* State-sponsored espionage (10), led by China (5), Russia (1), and South Korea (1) (e.g., [CVE-2023-46805](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/researchers-identify-multiple-china.html), [CVE-2024-21887](https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/chinese-hackers-exploit-zero-day-flaws.html))
* Commercial surveillance vendors (8) (e.g., [CVE-2024-53104](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/google-patches-47-android-security.html), [CVE-2024-32896](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/google-confirms-cve-2024-32896.html), [CVE-2024-29745, CVE-2024-29748](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/google-warns-android-zero-day-flaws-in.html))
* Non-state financially motivated groups (5) (e.g., [CVE-2024-55956](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/cleo-file-transfer-vulnerability-under.html))
* State-sponsored espionage and financially motivated groups (5), all from North Korea (e.g., [CVE-2024-21338](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/lazarus-hackers-exploited-windows.html), [CVE-2024-38178](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/north-korean-scarcruft-exploits-windows.html))
* Non-state financially motivated groups also conducting espionage (2), all from Russia (e.g. [CVE-2024-9680, CVE-2024-49039](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/romcom-exploits-zero-day-firefox-and.html))

Google said it discovered in November 2024 a malicious JavaScript inject on the website of the Diplomatic Academy of Ukraine (online.da.mfa.gov[.]ua), which triggered an exploit for [CVE-2024-44308](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/apple-releases-urgent-updates-to-patch.html), resulting in arbitrary code execution.

This was then chained with [CVE-2024-44309](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/apple-releases-urgent-updates-to-patch.html), a cookie management vulnerability in WebKit, to launch a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack and ultimately collect users' cookies in order to unauthorized access to login.microsoftonline[.]com.

The tech giant further noted that it independently discovered an exploit chain for Firefox and Tor browsers that leveraged a combination of CVE-2024-9680 and CVE-2024-49039 to break out of the Firefox sandbox and execute malicious code with elevated privileges, thereby paving the way for the deployment of RomCom RAT.

The activity, previously [flagged](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/romcom-exploits-zero-day-firefox-and.html) by ESET, has been attributed to a threat actor called RomCom (aka Storm-0978, Tropical Scorpius, UAC-0180, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu). Google is tracking the dual financial- and espionage-motivated threat group under the name CIGAR.
