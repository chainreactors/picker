# The Empire’s Threat Modeling

Get one fourth off for May the fourth!

In Andor, Imperial Security Bureau supervisor Dedra Meero spends a
lot of time thinking about how she’d steal highly sensitive
Imperial hardware and explaining how she’d never “climb the same
fence twice.” But her analyses don’t convince her fellow ISB
officers.

Trying to get into your opponents head is tricky... but frankly,
the problem is: For the show to work, she has to lose. So we
shouldn’t get obsessed with her techniques or their many flaws.

If you want to learn how to threat model convincingly — today —
take one of our self-pace courses, Threat Modeling Essentials or Threat
Modeling Intensive. And to celebrate Star Wars day, we’re offering
one fourth off each.

At [courses.shostack.org](https://courses.shostack.org) use code “Andor”, and the fourth will be
with you. But not always. Just until Andor’s final episode
drops.
