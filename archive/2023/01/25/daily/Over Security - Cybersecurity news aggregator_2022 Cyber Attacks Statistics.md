And finally I have aggregated all the data collected in 2022 from the cyber attacks [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/). In the past year I have collected **3074** events, a 21% increase compared to the **2539** events collected over the course of 2021. The war in Ukraine had an impact in the cyberspace, but the effects were visible starting from the Spring and during the Summer until the end of the year.

**Cyber crime** continues to lead the **Motivations** chart with **76.8%**, down from **84.1%** of 2021. The impact of the war in Ukraine is visible in the percentage of **Cyber Espionage**, jumping at number two, exactly the same value of 2021 (**10.4%**), and even more in **Hacktivism** that soared to **7.1%**from **1.3%**. And obviously even the events motivated by **Cyber Warfare** doubled their percentage to **3.5%** from **1.6%** in 2021.

**Malware** continues to lead the **Attack Techniques** chart with **34.7%**, apparently down from **39.4%** of 2021. This apparent decrease is compensated by the growth of events with unknown origin (from **18.7%** to **22.2%**) and this has a clear explanation: in most cases  when a ransomware attack is experienced, the victim organization does not disclose clearly the reason of the attack, but mentions generically a network disruption that I track as “Unknown.” Phishing attacks moved **Account Takeovers** to **15.5%** from **13%**and the **Targeted Attacks** primarily against Ukraine, accounted for **8%** from **6.3%**, at expense of the exploitation of **Vulnerabilities** down to **7.8%** from **10.7%** during 2021. Finally, the operations carried out by the Hacktivists pushed the **DDoS** attacks to **3.8%** from **1.7%**.

Once again, **multiple industries** lead the **Target Distribution**chart with **22.3%** from **20.7%**. The **Healthcare** sector remains the preferred target of ransomware gangs, and this explains the second place, for two years in a row, with **12.5%**, substantially in line with  **11.9%** recorded over the course of 2021. **Governments** jumped at number three with **11.8%** from **10.4%.**

The statistics are also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-IGRH.jpeg), so enjoy the read and spread my work to raise awareness!

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.

The sample used for the statistics is available below:

### [Q4 2023 Cyber Attacks Statistics](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2024/03/21/q4-2023-cyber-attacks-statistics/)

In Q4 2023, cyber attack events decreased by 7.1% to 1029 compared to the previous quarter. Cybercrime remains the primary motive, although slightly reduced, while malware tops attack techniques, increasing from the last quarter. Multiple industries and healthcare are the most targeted sectors. These statistics represent only public source data and should be considered as an overview of the cyber threat landscape. The statistics are summarized in an infographic, and the author encourages following their work on social media and supporting it through donations.
