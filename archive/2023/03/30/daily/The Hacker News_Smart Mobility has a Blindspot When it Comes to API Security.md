[![Automotive Security](data:image/png;base64... "Automotive Security")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTwC-kDpyJD61jNSUCAyN-PNFXYec0UGXUSvH1rldni1zps21G6EFeDrKsT81-6sdWhXBs8_4OlTCcMxWH146bwuRbRCcRS7rTgaE6PXSxhMU__OTSaNGuPfTXh4Yi4Wai_5kezaTyb-VjZbS5zfOQPjBBNN4Hh_TjTPcS6ccyd_64WafhDHMvNMkW/s790-rw-e365/auto.png)

The emergence of smart mobility services and applications has led to a sharp increase in the use of APIs in the automotive industry. However, this increased reliance on APIs has also made them one of the most common attack vectors. According to Gartner, APIs account for 90% of the web application attack surface areas.

With no surprise, similar trends are emerging also in the smart mobility space. A recent [**Automotive and Smart Mobility Cybersecurity Report**](https://upstream.auto/reports/global-automotive-cybersecurity-report/?utm_campaign=API%20Security&utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=api-security&utm_content=blog) by **Upstream Security** indicates that the automotive and smart mobility ecosystem has seen a 380% increase in API-based incidents in 2022, compared to 2021. Additionally, APIs accounted for 12% of total cyber incidents in 2022, up from only 2% in 2021.

When examining smart mobility applications and services, Upstream's threat intelligence team reported that black-hat actors were found to be behind 53% of incidents, indicating malicious intent as the driving force of the majority of API-related attacks. The impact of these incidents goes well beyond data and PII breaches, often causing service disruptions, fraudulent activities, trust concerns and potential revenue loss.

## **Data-driven mobility services reshape traditional automotive revenue models**

In recent years, vehicle connectivity has grown dramatically, introducing innovative data-driven revenue opportunities for traditional automotive stakeholders as well as new players. Mobility overall has become more connected, with ridesharing, car rental services, and even fleet management services all utilizing mobile applications to provide easy access and enhanced experience to consumers. Modern data use cases offer continuous monitoring and help stakeholders introduce new features and opportunities. According to research by McKinsey, 30% of automotive revenue will be attributed to data-driven and smart mobility services by 2030. But unlike IT-based applications, these innovative and data-driven applications heavily utilize APIs that have a direct impact on vehicles on the road.

## **Massive traffic jams caused by manipulated API transactions**

In 2022, we saw an increasingly sophisticated use of APIs in automotive and smart mobility cyberattacks. As an attack vector, APIs draw the attention of researchers and malicious actors as they require a relatively low threshold of know-how and automotive expertise. Essentially reducing the barrier of entry of threat actors to a minimum. A single vulnerability in an API can pose a direct impact on millions of vehicles, across various fleets. A strong example of the ease of attack and the significant impact can be found in a recent incident in Europe: back in mid-2022 central Moscow was gridlocked when a ride-hailing service was maliciously manipulated to send all available taxis to a single location, causing hours-long traffic jams, impeding people's freedom of movement, and putting public infrastructure and safety at risk. In this case, attackers didn't need any understanding of how vehicles operate or function, all they needed to do was to identify API vulnerabilities and exploit them.

## **WAF is not (always) enough: developing a contextual framework for smart mobility API security**

Smart mobility services have always been monitoring and securing API transactions to avoid revenue loss due to fraud, service downtime, and compromising organizational or users private data. But, traditional API security solutions have a significant "blindspot" when it comes to smart mobility. They often fail to detect sophisticated attacks that impact mobility applications, assets, and consumers due to the lack of contextual analysis of the impact of API transactions on moving vehicles.

Ensuring a strong cybersecurity posture in the smart mobility ecosystem requires expanding the scope to include a contextual analysis of the [**real-life impact of APIs on mobility assets**](https://upstream.auto/securing-automotive-and-smart-mobility-apis/?utm_campaign=API%20Security&utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=api-security&utm_content=blog), including vehicles on the road. API security is gradually evolving to also integrate OT (Operational Technology) aspects that correlate between API traffic, transactions, and the contextual state of mobility assets to provide a strong cybersecurity posture. The goal is to layer API discovery, profiling and monitoring with deep analysis of the behavior of mobility assets and the impact of the specific API transaction on safety. When you take into account how OT assets behave differently to IT assets, be it their ignition status, location, or speed, you can begin to approach securing them in a contextual manner.

Smart mobility players are adopting a new approach to securing smart mobility API transactions, which includes four key steps:

* Map the potential attack surface
* Continuously monitor API traffic
* Apply contextual anomaly detection
* Mitigate and respond to cyber threats

The first step is to understand the p...
