## First Wap: A Surveillance Computer You’ve Never Heard Of

*Mother Jones* has a [long article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/10/firstwap-altamides-phone-tracking-surveillance-secrets-assad-erik-prince-jared-leto-anne-wojcicki/) on surveillance arms manufacturers, their wares, and how they avoid export control laws:

> Operating from their base in Jakarta, where permissive export laws have allowed their surveillance business to flourish, First Wap’s European founders and executives have quietly built a phone-tracking empire, with a footprint extending from the Vatican to the Middle East to Silicon Valley.
>
> It calls its proprietary system Altamides, which it describes in promotional materials as “a unified platform to covertly locate the whereabouts of single or multiple suspects in real-time, to detect movement patterns, and to detect whether suspects are in close vicinity with each other.”
>
> Altamides leaves no trace on the phones it targets, unlike spyware such as Pegasus. Nor does it require a target to click on a malicious link or show any of the telltale signs (such as overheating or a short battery life) of remote monitoring.
>
> Its secret is shrewd use of the antiquated telecom language Signaling System No. 7, known as SS7, that phone carriers use to route calls and text messages. Any entity with SS7 access can send queries requesting information about which cell tower a phone subscriber is nearest to, an essential first step to sending a text message or making a call to that subscriber. But First Wap’s technology uses SS7 to zero in on phone numbers and trace the location of their users.

The video in the Mother Jones & Lighthouse Reports articles is really worth watching (16 mins total).

Sections: [Intro](https://youtu.be/xfWyU5iXJ3I?si=EjLQaS6TKIoHVVDx&t=0) | [A Deep Web Discovery](https://youtu.be/xfWyU5iXJ3I?si=EjLQaS6TKIoHVVDx&t=39) | [“Clusters” and Killers](https://youtu.be/xfWyU5iXJ3I?si=bEUkQnbUTu68MZxP&t=356) | [Going Undercover](https://youtu.be/xfWyU5iXJ3I?si=UCH1hzsGfHglAUcG&t=425)

Hopefully no one here has received a call letting them know they were in these files.

> We made more than 100 cold calls. Each one began the same way: “You’ve been targeted by government-grade surveillance tech.”

Asking for a Friend: does it work for the suspects that always leave their phones at home? Oh, wait, they have drones for that. Or your neighbor’s cameras connected to the police department…

It would be nice to warn every number on that dataset but I would even go to the length of publishing all the numbers without names attached so that people could be aware of. Does anyone knows where the leak was published?

@ ALL,

**KCS is just one failure of Stuart Anthony POOLE-ROBB**

It’s a company mentioned in the article. When you chased it up, it gives some fairly curious half truths at best,

<https://kcsgroup.com/about-us/>

Stuart Anthony Poole-Robb, started out being a “Mod-Plod” equivalent in the UK Royal Air force and due to rapid changes in the world got pulled up the ladder as his body was in the right place at the right time…

But back around the early 1970’s it appears he added attempted removal / assassination of Greek Cypriot leader Archbishop Makarios to his CV…

As far as I can gather it was because of his previous involvement with a “Special Branch”[1] operation where Makarios was effectively kidnapped, held unlawfully, and shipped around the globe,

<http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/9/newsid_3745000/3745505.stm>

And that is not the least of things.

But what of his supposedly successful business life?

Well have a look at the multitude of companies and what happened to them,

<https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/ff9HIVtZCPUWG2TLDFDYfzvQVF0/appointments>

Thus take his published works with a grain of salt about the size of “Lot’s Wife”.

As for KCS Group something tells me it’s doing,

“A leap on the band waggon.”

With “bought in or stolen technology” that goes back to the 1990’s when I was involved with it.

Something I was Later doing for a small company that was chasing VC money. The technology used SS7 for doing “Traffic Census” by mapping Mobile Phone journeys was being keenly looked at by amongst others AT&T Mobile based up in Seattle.

The system had anonymity built in via a form of encryption I was involved with the design of. I got “uninvolved” when questions started getting asked about removing the anonymizing protections and tying things to other “black databases”.

[1] The UK Special Branch was the “enforcement arm” of the then UK Intelligence forces for “home operations”(think MI5 mainly). Whilst they were technically “Police Officers” only some were actually “warranted”, false ID’s and Warrant Cards were issued on an “as needed” basis. There has been a fluid relationship between the UK Met Police and MI5 since. Some may remember the “under cover operatives” that worked in supposed deep cover to undermine and attack protest groups. And shockingly as became clear sleeping with female “supposed suspects” was seen as a perk of the job since the 1980’s at least and some had children with them, then just disappeared leaving people literally “holding the baby”,
