Hello Compensation Experts,

Since this is my first blog, I merely wanted to check it out and see what you experts thought. By committing errors, I gain knowledge.

Now, let’s continue with details related to this topic.

**Note** – Screenshots are subject to change.

**Compensation Introduction**

A solution called SAP SuccessFactors Compensation was created to make manager compensation planning more uniform. Compensation professionals should rest easy knowing that rewards are not only appropriately calculated to help retain high performance, but also calculated correctly.

It is a system for pay and long-term incentive (stock) planning that uses templates and offers the following advantages:

* Reduce manager bias

* Improve understanding with metrics

* Boost compliance with regulations and budgets Ensure data integrity

**Overview**

Both internal and external HRIS systems can supply the employee information used in SAP SuccessFactors Compensation. Employee data are immediately linked to Compensation when Employee Central is utilised as the HRIS. Employee data for external HRIS can be manually uploaded in CSV format, sent over sftp, or obtained via an API. If using a flat file technique or another integration, your professional services consultant will either help with the field mapping for EC-Integrated customers or give thorough integration requirements.

To successfully integrate work performance with compensation awards, the SAP SuccessFactors Compensation solution can be used in conjunction with performance management. Planners can easily access performance data when deciding how much to pay employees.

It is possible to establish automated merit increases based on formulas for calculating guidelines such job level, pay grade, performance rating, compa-ratio, and range penetration. Additionally, you can automate lump sum payments and merit rollovers when they are due.

**The Compensation Cycle and Forms**

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-21-at-10.49.22-PM.png)

Using forms, SAP SuccessFactors Compensation operates. A compensation plan template is made for each pay period. All the components required for compensation planning are included in the template, including functional currency, exchange rates, benchmarks, rating sources, eligibility requirements, policies, and budgets.

A name is provided to the template that makes it easy to recognise it. Using "20xx Compensation Plan" as an example, you may name a template. The compensation planning forms are then produced using this template.

When a form is submitted, the person in charge of organising the compensation for that particular group of persons receives it. Only for that group, the form includes links to employee profiles or Employee Central data and information on compensation. The person in charge of planning is honoured by having their name on the form. The "20xx Compensation Plan for Carla Grant (cgrant)" example.

**The Compensation Cycle and Forms**

With each new compensation cycle, a new template must be made in order to ensure data integrity. This template in SAP SuccessFactors can be copied from an earlier template. Cloning streamlines the process while maintaining all previous configuration choices. It can also be necessary to copy and modify other supporting materials including salary ranges, lookup tables, and currency conversion rates.

Upon completion, a compensation form is accepted in accordance with a procedure that has been set up in the system through the route map.

**Permissions**

Role-based permissions allow you to control access to applications in the SAP SuccessFactors suite via permission groups and permission roles. Roles define what is allowed; the groups define who is allowed to do it (granted users) and for whom (target users).

Depending on the relevant population and administrative requirements, granular permissions can be granted. The majority of permissions can also be restricted based on the target population, allowing for distributed process administration.

If you want to limit who can see compensation information at the column level, a separate permission option called Field Based Permission is accessible. For instance, you might want HR to be able to update a column while giving managers "read only" access to it.

**The Interface for Compensation Planning**

The interface provides quickly accessible connections to more in-depth information and presents the data that you, the client, have determined is most pertinent to the planner. A manager's team members are listed on an individual compensation planning form together with additional data, such as performance, pay, merit raise guidelines, and budget data (information you think important for managers to make recommendations for their team members).

The system will compute the overall compensation package and the remaining budget allocation when the planner chooses individual compensation awards.

Planners have the option to add notes and turn on a promotion, if your setting permits it. Additional configuration options, depending on your company process, include needing notes, carrying out promotions, requiring managers to stay within budget or within standards, and modifying the majority of column labels and form text.
