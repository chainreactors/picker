Arion Kurtaj, a teenager from the UK, amassed a fortune through audacious cybercrimes. From stealing Grand Theft Auto 6 secrets to erasing Brazil‚Äôs COVID vaccination data, his exploits were legendary. But his hacking spree took a bizarre turn when he was placed under police protection‚Ä¶ in a Travelodge outside Oxford.

Plus Bengal cat lovers in Australia should be on their guard, as your furry feline friends might be leading you into a dangerous trap., and there‚Äôs yet more headaches for troubled 23andMe.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Thom Langford.

Plus don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with Paul Fryer from BlackBerry.
