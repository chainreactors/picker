## Signed Copies of *Rewiring Democracy*

When I [announced](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/my-latest-book-rewiring-democracy.html) my latest book last week, I forgot to mention that you can pre-order a signed copy [here](https://www.schneier.com/product/rewiring-democracy-hardcover/). I will ship the books the week of 10/20, when it is published.

@ Bruce,

I forgot to ask earlier,

**“Are you an Eagle or Owl fan?”**

An odd sounding question perhaps, but it is in effect from an interesting video on the Subliminal message issue of,

> *“These Numbers Can Make AI Dangerous”*

<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NUAb6zHXqdI>

The papers involved are from after you started your book. But the precise mathematical details are just an instance of a more general issue.

The net result is that it appears that there are hidden channels that can be used by an attacker to bias thus pass on a prejudice, or political mantra to more than just an arms length.

The implication, for both the generation and use of legislation by AI, is actually something people need to think about.
