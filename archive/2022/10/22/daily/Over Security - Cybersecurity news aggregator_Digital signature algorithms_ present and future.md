# Digital signature algorithms: present and future

## Abstract

The digital signature is, in many respects, the analogue in the digital world of the handwritten signature that we all use on a daily basis.

The main difference between these two methods, however, lies in the fact that, while for the second the authenticity of the signature is linked to the handwriting of the person who affixes it, in the first case it is guaranteed by the possession of a cryptographic tool (cryptographic keys) by the signatory.

Similarly to the handwritten signature, the digital signature also has non-repudiation as its main objective (the signatory cannot deny having signed a document), as well as ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the signed document.
