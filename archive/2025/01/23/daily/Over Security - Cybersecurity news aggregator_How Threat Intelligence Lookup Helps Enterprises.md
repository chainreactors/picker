How Threat Intelligence Lookup Helps Enterprises

The growing dependence on digital technology of modern businesses makes them vulnerable to cyber threats. For three years in a row, [manufacturing](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/manufacturing-companies-targeted-with-lumma/) has stayed the sector most targeted by cyberattacks, [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence) reports. Industrial companies suffered from more than 25% of security incidents recorded last year, the majority of them being ransomware attacks.

Investing in comprehensive cybersecurity infrastructure helps prevent substantial financial loss and reputation damage. But enforcing the perimeter is not enough: a proactive approach to threat management is essential.

## What is Threat Intelligence

[Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-explained/) (CTI) is about gathering and analyzing data to spot, understand, and stop current and future threats. Even with strong security teams, just reacting to threats is not enough. Using current, detailed information from outside sources is key to responding effectively.

Cyber threat intelligence provides security teams with data about threats, attacks, and adversaries. It powers decision-making on all levels: operational, tactical, and strategic.

By analyzing threat indicators, tactics, techniques, and procedures of attackers, companies can anticipate attacks rather than just react to them. Vulnerabilities get identified before they can be exploited.

## Why Companies Need Threat Intelligence

There are plenty of reasons why industrial enterprises and manufacturing companies may require threat intelligence. Mostly, these reasons relate to the critical role of such companies in the economy on one hand and their specific risks and vulnerabilities on the other:

1. **They are part of critical infrastructure**
   Many manufacturing companies are involved in critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, transportation, defense supply chains). Attacking these industries can disrupt essential services, exert political or economic pressure, or fulfill geopolitical goals.

2. **They are part of important supply chains**
   A successful attack can ripple across industries, causing widespread delays and impacting multiple organizations. In 2021, an attack on Colonial Pipeline disrupted fuel distribution, causing trouble to manufacturing and transportation sectors.

3. **They have high ransom potential**
   Companies rely on continuous operations and cannot afford prolonged downtime. Attacked by ransomware, they are often willing to pay to resume production quickly and avoid financial losses.

4. **They collect consumer data and possess intellectual property**
   A bunch of valuable data is an irresistible honeypot for hackers. Trade secrets, patents, blueprints, and proprietary technologies. Sensitive data about customers, employees, and supply chains. Stolen data can be sold, used for fraud, espionage, and other outlaw activities.

5. **They depend on legacy systems**
   Outdated systems and technologies are not designed with modern cybersecurity in mind. For example, older programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in factories often lack encryption or authentication, making them easy targets.

6. **They are in the midst of digitalization and IoT adoption**
   Manufacturing is embracing Industry 4.0, integrating IoT devices, cloud computing, and automation. More connected devices and networks introduce more vulnerabilities.

## Time is Money, Downtime is No Money

A sadly large share of enterprise companies prioritizes operational efficiency over cybersecurity due to limited budgets, lack of expertise, and a focus on physical security. But it is a short-sighted approach.

Industrial companies have low tolerance for downtime: in the case of a ransomware attack they often prefer to pay adversaries than to permit a production halt. [Research by Siemens in 2022](https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid%3A3d606495-dbe0-43e4-80b1-d04...
