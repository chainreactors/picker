New PhantomLoader Malware Distributes SSLoad: Technical Analysis

*Editor’s note: The current article is authored by Mohamed Talaat, a cybersecurity researcher and malware analyst. You can find Mohamed on [X](https://x.com/BlueEye46572843) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-talaat-049349198/).*

In this malware analysis report, we take an in-depth look at how an undocumented loader called PhantomLoader has been used by attackers to distribute a rust-based malware known as [SSLoad](https://any.run/malware-trends/ssload).

## Overview

The PhantomLoader usually masquerades as a legitimate 32-bit DLL written in C/C++ for an antivirus software called 360 Security Total.

However, in this case, it was found disguising itself as “PatchUp.exe,” which is still a legitimate module of 360 Total Security. This loader has been used in recent attacks to deliver a new rust-based malware called SSLoad.

What makes PhantomLoader unique is that it was added to be part of a legitimate DLL or executable of a well-known software by binary patching the DLL or executable and adding a self-modifying technique. The latter decrypts an embedded code stub, which then decrypts and loads “SSLoad” into memory.

## **Technical** **analysis**

After analyzing the SSLoad sample in [ANY.RUN’s sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=phantomloader&utm_term=071024&utm_content=linktolanding), we observed that one distribution method for this malware involves phishing emails containing malicious Office documents. These documents initiate the infection chain.

The analysis session shows how the drop and execution of PhantomLoader occurs, after which it decrypts and runs SSLoad.

### **Execution of Malicious Word document**

After executing the malicious Word document, it became clear that a new process, “app.com,” was launched by “WINWORD.exe,” indicating that an embedded malicious macro had been executed. This resulted in the creation of the suspicious process.

To better understand the infection chain, the macro was extracted and analyzed further.

### **Execution of Decoded XML String**

In the ANY.RUN [Script Tracer](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/script-tracer/), it was observed that the malware loads an encoded XML string, which appears to be obfuscated using JScript. This encoding is used to disguise the malicious intent, making it more difficult to detect.

Once loaded, the XML string is executed, triggering the next stage in the malware’s infection process.

Upon further investigation of the document’s macros, an **Autoclose macro** was found that reads an XML string from an XML file named “UserForm1.”

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image1e.png)

After analyzing the referenced form file, it became clear that the loaded XML string is encoded in JavaScript. This encoding serves as a protection measure designed by Microsoft to prevent unauthorized copying or alteration of [VBScript](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malicious-scripts/) or JavaScript code.
