The US government and some of the largest open source foundations and package repositories have announced a series of initiatives intended to improve software supply-chain security, while also repeating calls for developers to increase support for such efforts.

On the government side of things, this includes a voluntary threat intelligence sharing program between the Feds and open source software developers and operators, which the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will lead.

"We want to help foster real-time collaboration around security incidents," CISA director Jen Easterly [explained](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/keynote-cisa-director-jen-easterly) in a keynote address at the agency's Open Source Software Security Summit this week.
