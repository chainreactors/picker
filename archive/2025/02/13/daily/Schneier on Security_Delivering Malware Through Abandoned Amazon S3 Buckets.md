## Delivering Malware Through Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets

Here’s a [supply-chain attack](https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/) just waiting to happen. A group of researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.

> The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines—and then abandoned.
>
> Naturally, we registered them, just to see what would happen—”how many people are really trying to request software updates from S3 buckets that appear to have been abandoned months or even years ago?”, we naively thought to ourselves.

Turns out they got eight million requests over two months.

Had this been an actual attack, they would have modified the code in those buckets to contain malware and watch as it was incorporated in different software builds around the internet. This is basically the SolarWinds attack, but much more extensive.

But there’s a second dimension to this attack. Because these update buckets are abandoned, the developers who are using them also no longer have the power to patch them automatically to protect them. The mechanism they would use to do so is now in the hands of adversaries. Moreover, often—but not always—losing the bucket that they’d use for it also removes the original vendor’s ability to identify the vulnerable software in the first place. That hampers their ability to communicate with vulnerable installations.

Software supply-chain security is an absolute mess. And it’s not going to be easy, or cheap, to fix. Which means that it won’t be. Which is an even worse mess.

It seems that Amazon should also be able to identify the same abandoned buckets and place an automatic lock on any abandoned bucket. The next one who wish to resume the project would have to identify themselves, and when that occurs an automatic notice goes out to all who subscribe with an appropriate warning.

Here is the missing link:

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “Presumably the projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.”

You might want to reword that as it’s ambiguous to read.

However what you are talking about is a rather more general issue, and one that hits encryption via the likes of “Public Key Certificates” etc, and lots of hardware and similar devices the worst of which appear to end up in consumer and SoHo type commercial products via “Internet of things”(IoT) “network Edge”, and many others.

In fact Amazon are conspicuously guilty of “enshitification” that includes designing and placing on the market “competing products”. With the sole intent to kill a business product for Amazon’s profit reasons. Then just dumping the “competing product” without any support. Call it “abandonware” or “product orphaning” the result is the same.

The simple fact is there is no way to guarantee that something that is revoked, abandoned, orphand or in other ways “left entirely vulnerable” can be recognised as such by the product user.

In fact any process to do so so far thought up can or does cause more harm than good.

The PubKey “Certificate Authorities” have conspicuously failed in their attempts to resolve this issue. So far the best they have come up with is “shortening the life” of the certificate to in effect a year or lot less.

Which might be good for their ignorant investor/shareholder business model, but it’s actually harmful to just about everyone.

Especially as it will encourage “further ignorance” by “automation”.

Put simply the job of updating a certificate will become automated, and it will work in the background forca length of time that it in effect becomes not just “invisable to use” but “forgoton to use”. Then one day way way upstream sonebody makes a change… And at best it cascades out as a fault that brings sufficient of the Internet down that people have to take action.

At worst it opens up massive security or worse vulnerabilities that “nobody at the sharp end” understands and don’t see anything catastrophic.

An example of which was a crypto system that when the KeyMat expired, rather than “block the comms” just changed the comms protocol down to the only one that still worked of “plaintext” no encryption. Because originally the design called for “high fault tolerance” not “assured security”, thus a very large petro-chem site remote management system became “open house” (luckily it was sufficiently off-shore that nobody got close enough to make it a “plaything that went pop”)…

This sort of crap happens all the time and it just does not get noticed, or even if noticed nobody understands it’s a serious issue so untill unavoidable pain happens next to nothing or nothing happens.

I can see this “nonsense” being “setup to happen” with “Smart Grids” and hopefully I won’t be around when it goes pop or people get killed on mass.

They. Let. Random. People. Register. Old. Expired. Names.

That’s idiotic. The risks are obvious to anybody smarter than your average bowl of pudding.

Which, of course, doesn’t include the esteemed stewards of the DNS. But still.

This just shows that the ability for a user to explicitly and unilaterally prevent unrequested software updates is just as important as security ...
