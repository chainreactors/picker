Critical errors on any system can be extremely frustrating. But if you’ve recently encountered the “**There has been a critical error on this website**” message on your WordPress site, don’t fret! In many cases, critical errors are the result of conflicts in plugins, theme files, or PHP related issues. This is one of the most common errors WordPress administrators can encounter and there are a number of ways you can resolve it.

In today’s post, I’ll go over the steps you can take to quickly find and fix the critical error on your WordPress site to get your site back up and running. I’ll also outline why the error happens in the first place and how to avoid critical errors in the future.

Let’s dig in!

  1. **[Check your admin email inbox](#step1)**
  2. **[Enable debugging in WordPress](#step2)**
  3. **[Backup your website](#step3)**
  4. **[Check for issues in WordPress core files](#step4)**
  5. **[Check for recently modified theme or plugin files](#step5)**
  6. **[Increase memory limit in WordPress](#step6)**
  7. **[Update PHP to latest compatible version](#step7)**
  8. [**Scan for malware**](#step8)

## What is the critical error in WordPress?

The “**There has been a critical error on your website**” message in WordPress means there’s a fatal PHP error on your site during code execution. This happens when a PHP script stops running and is unable to complete its process.

[![There has been a critical error on your website. Please check your site admin email inbox for instructions. WordPress message](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/there_has_been_a_critical_error_on_your_website-1.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/there_has_been_a_critical_error_on_your_website-1.png)

This error essentially tells you that WordPress has either failed to load core files or some other additional plugin or theme functionality, which can be attributed to resource limitations, code-related errors, or even malware.

## Why does the critical error happen on a website?

The reasons for this issue can usually be traced back to one of the following problems:

* **Issues in the WordPress Core Files:** If any of your WordPress core files have become corrupted or are missing you will likely receive critical errors. These messages can also occur if you have unsuccessfully updated your website or tampered with any core files.
* **Broken Theme Files or Plugin Malfunction:** In some cases, corrupted WordPress themes or plugin files can also result in website errors. Many of the best WordPress plugins and themes are thoroughly tested and are not as likely to result in errors. But plugin conflicts and custom code can certainly result in critical error messages.
* **Syntax Errors**: Custom code can inadvertently lead to issues that break normal PHP code execution, especially if they contain accidental syntax errors or paths with [unsafe characters](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/01/bad-paths-the-importance-of-using-valid-url-characters.html). Check for any recent modifications or changes in your website environment to locate possible syntax errors in your code.
* **Malware Infections:** Some malware infections can lead to critical errors in WordPress. You’ll want to [scan your website for malware](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) and [clean up any malicious code](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-a-hacked-website/) that’s present in the environment.
* **PHP Memory Limits:** Website owners often encounter critical errors when trying to upload media or performing tasks, which can indicate that PHP has reached its predefined limits while executing a specific script.
* **Outdated PHP Version:** ...
