This year SAP and ASUG collaborated once again to provide the Best Practices Conference for Oil, Gas, and Energy.  It was held on September 12 – 14, 2022, at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Houston, where 436 attendees gathered to hear inspiring and insightful keynotes from Shell (Steve Mutch, Head of Product Management), Suncor (Jake Turner – GM SAP Transformation and Jamil Hirji – Director Digital Delivery), Chevron (Peter Hung – IT Manager, Enterprise Digital Core and David Slack – Release Scope Manager), P66 (Zhanna Golodryga - SVP, Chief Digital and Administrative Officer), and Geoffery Cann (Author, Speaker, Trainer), as well as, engaging and edifying sessions from other customers and partners.

The theme of this year’s three-day event was “**Embracing Technological Innovation for a Sustainable Future”**.  Leaders united at the event to hear about and share best practices for addressing the industry’s biggest challenges.  Participants in the event departed with tools and resources to help them and the company they represent make the most of their technology investments.  The event was graced with 43 unique companies spanning Upstream, Downstream, and Oilfield Services.  Amongst these unique companies were customers sharing their stories about how SAP S/4HANA, SAP Cloud, and industry-specific solutions are enabling their company to transition into a sustainable intelligent enterprise.  Additionally, the**ASUG Women Connect Panel** **tackled inclusion and diversity head on and led by Kelly Dowling (**Director, Content Strategy - ASUG) and supported by panelists that included SAP executive, Lori Morgan, this session enabled the event to become a catalyst for bringing people in SAP technology together to discuss how we can support, change, and strengthen networks.

For those who attended in-person or virtually, you can experience once again, on-demand keynotes and breakout sessions using the following link to replay the recorded content:  [Agenda | ASUG Best Practices: SAP for Oil, Gas, and Energy](https://events.asug.com/sapforoilgasenergy/agenda).  In the very near future, we look forward to sharing the link for those who did not register to have access to these recordings as well.

This event was the first in-person SAP Oil, Gas, and Energy event held post-COVID and its execution and efforts towards excellence could not have happened without the support of the staff at ASUG, the speakers, and the sponsors, so a BIG THANKS to ASUG and to our speakers and sponsors and a continued appreciation to our Platinum sponsor, Accenture.  Additionally, we thank all participants and certainly thank the leadership and presence of SAP executives whose engagement with customers and partners facilitated our customers’ progression along their journey towards becoming a sustainable intelligent enterprise.
