OK, I admit it: I ***might*** have a problem. But seriously, can you ever *really* have enough screen space? In this blog post, I’ll describe a cheap solution for having a lot of screen space for your work-from-home office. I will also share other aspects of my office that make it functional and enjoyable (links are included if you are interested in imitating any of it).

I’m using five [43” 4K televisions](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TCL-43-Class-4-Series-4K-UHD-HDR-Smart-Roku-TV-43S451/2807312726) as monitors for my work-from-home office. Each TV is less than $200, and they work great for everything I do — from viewing Office documents to joining Zoom meetings. I’m not a graphic designer, I’m clueless about color accuracy, and I don’t play games where you would most likely notice issues using TVs as monitors.

I have two computers hooked up to these five monitors. The screen in the middle is hooked to an [HDMI switch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GG4914P/ref%3Dppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for easy switching back and forth between my work computer and my personal computer, depending on what I am focusing on at the time. The two monitors on the left are always hooked up to my work computer, and the two monitors on the right are always hooked up to my personal computer. It is important to switch the middle monitor with the switch instead of the TV’s input switcher, because windows will hide on the invisible screen using the TV’s input switcher. I like to use the upper monitors for things like keeping an eye on my calendar, email, messaging apps, and as one consistent place for controlling my music.

I recommend setting your mouse pointer options to move “fast” so that you can get to all edges of your monitors in one wrist motion without having to lift up your mouse. It takes some adjustment to get used to, but then is easily doable. Sometimes you lose track of where the mouse pointer is on the screen and it is hard to find. On macOS, you can quickly move the mouse pointer back and forth and the pointer will show up much larger for a second so you can find it (go to Settings→Accessibility→Display→Pointer to customize). On Windows, this option works well.

On my personal computer, I use the free Microsoft [FancyZones tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) to break the screen up into any layout I want and easily snap my windows to the layout. I recorded a demo of it [here](https://youtu.be/xprq8LQ6EYQ). My monitors are very close to the ceiling because I have a raised desk to allow for the treadmill underneath, but that’s [another story](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/healthy-hacking-with-the-treadmill-elliptical-desk-my-journey-to-staying-healthy-while-hacking/).

I record a lot of content for online training, so I’ve doubled up on my [webcams](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Logitech-C270-HD-Webcam-with-noise-reducing-mics-for-video-calls-Black/17616997) and [microphones](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Blue-Yeti-Nano-Wired-Condenser-Microphone/459685367) so that I don’t have to switch them back and forth between my work and personal computers. I had a USB switch originally, but I ruined two Yeti Nano microphones and two USB switches doing that. I don’t think they are built for that kind of switching.

You also see that my personal computer is on a [stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H4DMLVH/ref%3Dppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in the middle and one of my cameras is on an [adjustable arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CN2C93T/ref%3Dppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This is so I can present from a 1080p monitor and lower the camera, so it looks like I am looking into the camera more. (If I didn’t record so much content, I wouldn’t go through so much trouble.)

Of course, I want to be able to switch my keyboard and mouse back and forth between the two computers, but the 1-2 second delay on all the switches can be annoying when I just want to skip a song or respond to a...
