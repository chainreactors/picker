Even the most diligent site owners should consider when they had their last website security check. As our own research indicates, [infections resulting from known website vulnerabilities](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/04/balada-injector-synopsis-of-a-massive-ongoing-wordpress-malware-campaign.html) continue to plague website owners. According to our [2022 Hacked Website Report](https://sucuri.net/reports/2022-hacked-website-report/), last year alone WordPress accounted for **96.2%** of infected websites due to its market share and popularity. Statistics like these highlight why it’s so important to regularly scan your website for vulnerabilities.

Vuln scanners will look at your online property and web apps much like a bad actor would, carefully searching out any insecure or vulnerable code that could lead to a hack. But if you’re aware of those security threats, you can patch them and harden your site before they are exploited by an attacker.

If you do have an infected site as a result of a software vulnerability, it’s critical you act quickly; either [fix the malware yourself](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-a-hacked-website/) or [have a professional do it for you](https://sucuri.net/website-malware-removal/).

## How to scan your website for vulnerabilities

Here are six website security check and vulnerability scanning tools that can help you scan your site for vulnerabilities.

1. [Unmask Parasites](#step1)
2. [WPScan](#step2)
3. [MageReport](#step3)
4. [Snyk](#step4)
5. [Rapid7 Nexpose](#step5)
6. [PatchStack](#step6)

### 1. Unmask Parasites

[Unmask Parasites](https://www.unmaskparasites.com/) is a free website security check that lets you scan an online property, page by page. It’s a great option for people who would rather avoid installing server-side vulnerability scanning tools.

Despite being an online scan, Unmask Parasites is quite thorough and can help you find infected web pages, hidden content, or identify if your core WordPress is outdated.

### 2. WPScan

With the widespread adoption of WordPress today (WP powers [more than 43% of sites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) on the web), it might seem like the free [WPScan](https://wpscan.org/) is nothing short of a miracle.

Installation might require some plain-language documentation, but once you’ve checked out the [Github repo](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) and set it on your Linux or Mac machine, you get access to a website security check from a team that maintains an active vulnerability database.

You can check out our helpful guide on [how to install WPScan](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/04/how-to-install-wpscan-wordpress-vulnerability-scan.html) and scan your website for vulnerabilities.

### 3. MageReport

Online retailers using the popular Magento 1 and 2 platforms can use the [MageReport](https://www.magereport.com/) tool, which was engineered specifically for this CMS powering [over 700,000 e-commerce websites](https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Magento) worldwide.

MageReport – Magento Vulnerability Scanner

In particular, Magento 1 users will want to keep vulnerability scanner tools close at hand, as it reached end-of-life on [June 30th, 2020](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/support-magento-1-software-ends-june-30-2020) and is no longer receiving updates.

### 4. Snyk

If you’re looking for a thorough scan of your web application, [Snyk](https://snyk.io/website-scanner/) makes it easy to check your code, dependencies, and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities. They offer support for Python, JS, and PHP to help you scan and protect your website’s code from exploitation.
