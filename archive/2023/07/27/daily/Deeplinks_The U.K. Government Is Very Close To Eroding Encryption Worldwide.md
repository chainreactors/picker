The U.K. Parliament is pushing ahead with a sprawling internet regulation bill that will, among other things, undermine the privacy of people around the world. The [Online Safety Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137), now at the final stage before passage in the House of Lords, gives the British government the ability to force backdoors into messaging services, which will destroy end-to-end encryption. No amendments have been accepted that would mitigate the bill’s most dangerous elements.

[TELL the U.K. Parliament: Don't Break Encryption](https://eff.org/osb)

If it passes, the Online Safety Bill will be a huge step backwards for global privacy, and democracy itself. Requiring government-approved software in peoples’ messaging services is an awful precedent. If the Online Safety Bill becomes British law, the damage it causes won’t stop at the borders of the U.K.

The sprawling bill, which originated in a [white paper](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8743/) on “online harms” that’s now more than four years old, would be [the most wide-ranging internet regulation ever passed](https://www.theverge.com/23708180/united-kingdom-online-safety-bill-explainer-legal-pornography-age-checks). At EFF, we’ve been [clearly speaking about its disastrous effects](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/uks-online-safety-bill-attacks-free-speech-and-encryption) for more than a year now.
