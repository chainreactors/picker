# Microsoft vs Google spat sees users rolling back security updates to fix browser issues

Posted: May 6, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

We like to imagine we’re in total control of our desktop experience, carefully curated to look and work the way we want it to. However, every so often a story comes along which reminds us how little control we have when the big players notice one another’s existence. A recent Windows update [really wants you to use Edge](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2023/05/microsoft-broke-a-chrome-feature-to-promote-its-edge-browser/) instead of rival browsers, to the extent that some features in those rival browsers are breaking.

A lot of people will only ever use Microsoft’s default Edge browser to download another browser they’d rather use. Last year, Chrome made some changes to how you go about making it your default browser, after you’ve downloaded it with Edge. One “Default” button to press, and boom…your default browser is set to Chrome without having to dig around in your system settings.

This is how things should work, and for a while they did! As Gizmodo notes, this was not to be the case for long.

Microsoft released [update KB5025221](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365?ocid=cmmttvzgpuy&rtc=1) last month, and users of Chrome quickly began to flag peculiar experiences. From a [Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12kp4j6/windows_10_opens_default_app_settings_when/):

> If Chrome is set as the default browser, clicking on the link shortcut will open the link in chrome, but also open the Windows settings on the default apps. Anyone know where this behaviour comes from? It doesn’t happen if we change the default browser to Edge.

Elsewhere, we have a thread about how someone’s [600 business devices all exhibit the same behaviour](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1225895/2023-04-cumulative-update-causes-%29-opening-chrome):

> Opening chrome causes default app settings to open each and every time. After today’s cumulative update for Windows 10 and 11, 2023-04, every time I open Chrome the default app settings of windows will open. I’ve tried many ways to resolve this without luck. This is happening to all 600 systems with the update. Removing the update makes the issue go away. Anyone else having this issue? This does not occur when opening edge or brave browser, only Chrome for us.

A quick glance at the replies illustrates that Todd isn’t the only one impacted, as well as presenting the solution:

> Good morning Todd, We’re having the same issue through our organization as well. We’re on Windows 10 machines and pushed updates the last couple days. Many machines here seeing the issue. We may have just found a fix. Remove the Security Update KB5025221 and restart, this removes the problem. Looks to have fixed several machines just these last few minutes. May need to block KB5025221 until it’s reissued.

Yes, to prevent this behaviour you had to make a decision on removing cumulative security updates. What did KB5025221 offer users? That would be fixes for no fewer than “[ten issues that could lead to crashes, compatibility problems, and bugs in the operating system](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-kb5025221-and-kb5025229-updates-released/)”. Would people really want to gamble by removing such a thing in order to prevent the aggravating system popups when opening Chrome?

It seems not, looking at the various rep...
