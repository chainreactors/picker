[As covered previously](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2022/11/12/apple-device-management-second-edition-book-coming-soon/), I worked with my colleague [Charles Edge](https://krypted.com/) to update our Apple Device Management book with new information for a new second edition. I’m delighted to announce it’s now available for regular sale from Amazon, Apple Books and Apress, our publisher!

* Amazon: <https://a.co/d/bnCAr5W>
* Apple Books: <https://books.apple.com/us/book/apple-device-management/id6445786866>
* Apress: <https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9156-6>

Just like First Edition, Second Edition is a quality item stuffed with useful information. Also like First Edition, Second Edition is suitable for any gift-giving occasion in addition to being the perfect something for yourself. For those who have asked about it being available in electronic format, it’s available in the following formats depending on the seller:

* Amazon: Available for the Kindle
* Apple Books: Available in ePub format
* Apress: Available in PDF format

One thing to be aware of is that First Edition was also initially available via Apple Books, then later disappeared. I don’t know if that will happen with Second Edition, but if you want to get it for Apple Books my advice is to get it now and [avoid disappointment and future regret](https://youtu.be/Jr4xDKsze9U?t=101).
