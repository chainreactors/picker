# Emad Mostaque on the End of Capitalism

An extremely clear vision of how AI will completely disrupt everything within 1,000 days

Ok all, I have a video I'm going to ask **everyone** to go and watch within like 72 hours. This is from a guy named @EMostaque , who I consider to be one of the most intelligent future-thinking guys in tech.

He's on with @TomBilyeu here talking about how Capitalism is about to become obsolete because of AI. Throughout the discussion, he references his book **["The Last Economy"](https://webstatics.ii.inc/The%20Last%20Economy.pdf)**, which dives deep into these transformative ideas. It's the closest narrative I've seen to what I've been talking about, but he adds more of his own flavor and context to it as well. It's just phenomenal. And it will likely scare the living crap out of a lot of people.

I disagree with a few minor things he talked about, specifically around timelines (I think they're a smidge too short), but overall I'd say I agree with 90-95% of the video.

It's just a MUST-SEE. Not just for you, but I encourage to share it with your friends and loved ones as well. Please watch within 72 hours.

Here is a summary of the content created by Kai, but I seriously recommend you watch the full video yourself.

## Summary [​](#summary)

Emad Mostaque, former hedge fund manager and creator of Stable Diffusion, discusses how AI will fundamentally transform the economy, replacing human workers and making traditional economic structures obsolete within 1,000 days.

## Ideas [​](#ideas)

* AI will make human cognitive labor negative in value, not just zero value overall.
* GDP measures cancer as positive but curing cancer as negative for economic growth metrics.
* The middle class hollowed out since 2008 through inflation and asset ownership dynamics fundamentally.
* Digital assets will create the biggest bubble ever, exceeding even the AI bubble significantly.
* China controls robot supply chains and will likely stop exporting robots within five years.
* AI can now hack better than any human hacker according to recent competitive rankings.
* Sleeper agents in AI can be activated with code words hidden in training data.
* Foundation coin directs all proceeds to beneficial compute like cancer research and education initiatives.
* Human attention becomes the scarcest resource as AI handles all cognitive labor tasks effectively.
* Companies hitting $100 million revenue in three months versus three years previously is commonplace.
* AI companies will never make profits, only cash flow, playing the Amazon game strategically.
* Public sector jobs will be the last to go because they don't require efficiency.
* The tax base will shrink as companies stop making profits and focus on compute.
* Violence will increase as economic uncertainty grows and people lose meaning through work displacement.
* Network capital becomes more important than skills as AI outperforms humans at everything cognitive.
* The economy transitions from scarcity allocation to physics of information and entropy reduction fundamentally.
* Monetary creation should shift from debt-based to human-based issuance for economic stability long-term.
* AI models can think for 200 minutes now versus 20 minutes just recently achieved.
* Capitalism won't survive for humans but will be perfect for AI entities accumulating capital.
* Every head teacher questioned homework essays exactly 1,000 days ago when ChatGPT launched globally.
* The Manhattan Project cost $40 billion while OpenAI has raised $60 billion in funding.
* Universal Basic Income at poverty level would cost more than entire US tax base.
* AI will attack both our social systems and technological systems through various vulnerability vectors.
* Countries with high public sectors will see faster job losses but not more stability.
* The oldest professions like human connection and prostitution will persist despite AI advancement everywhere.

## Insights [​](#insights)

* Economic value shifts from material scarcity to organizing information and reducing entropy through intelligence.
* The divorce of capital from labor represents the final great inversion in economic history.
* Human identity tied to work will create psychological crisis as AI replaces cognitive labor.
* Traditional profit disappears as companies reinvest everything into compute for competitive advantage continuously.
* Violence emerges not from politics but from economic displacement and loss of progress narratives.
* Network effects and human connection become primary value sources when intelligence becomes commoditized globally.
* The transition period matters more than the end state for human suffering and adaptation.
* Money creation must shift from debt-based to human-based to maintain economic circulation flows.
* Public goods require decentralized AI systems aligned to humans rather than corporate profit motives.
* Attention becomes the new scarcity driving media, gaming, and digital asset speculation bubbles massively.
* Nation states compete on compute accumulation rather than traditional military or economic metrics increasingly.
* The mathematics of AI prediction directly maps to economic agent success and system evolution.
* Social contracts must evolve to provide meaning beyond work as jobs become obsolete rapidly.
* Regulatory capture through unions only delays inevitable automation while weakening international competitiveness significantly.
* Human cognitive surplus creates unprecedented disruption as replacement happens suddenly not gradually across sectors.
* Trust-building through beneficial compute allocation creates new monetary systems beyond traditional fiat currencies effectively.
