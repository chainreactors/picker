Heylo Community Members,

Hope all is well.

Here once again but this time it is not a technical blog.

This blog will cover my experience as a speaker and an attendee at SAP Insider Track Bengaluru 2023.

# **Backdrop:**

On 4th March 2023, I got a chance to attend and give a session at SAP Inside Track Bengaluru 2023 which was hosted at SAP Labs India.

Spread across 8 tracks offering multiple sessions led by experts and professionals about most recent happenings across technology which also included a Live App Space, SIT Bengaluru 2023 was a treat for technology enthusiast.

It was the largest ever SIT till date attended by over 1000+ professionals and enthusiasts across various organizations with a common interest to learn and connect.

Full House ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

A few goodies with delicious food & high tea arrangements were there for everyone too ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@07E15E26FDBEA98F7284414C1DA418B0/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

Having missed out the previous one and having attended SAP Tech Night few months back, I was super excited for this and that too as a speaker.

Not to mention that it was my second in-person community event attendance and FIRST as a speaker and hence nervousness definitely had a handshake with excitement for me ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@07E15E26FDBEA98F7284414C1DA418B0/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

This blog will cover some of the event highlights and my experience as a speaker.

#

# **KeyNote:**

The event started early with a key note by our very own [Sindhu Gangadharan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sindhugangadharan/), SVP & MD, SAP Labs India.

Hearing from her is always fascinating and this time too, she stressed focus on how important and powerful we as a community are in maintaining the knowledge ecosystem. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her constant support to all such community events.

# **About My Session:**

My session was scheduled after lunch where I shared my knowledge on Code coverage and automation using ABAP Units titled ‘Leverage ABAP Unit to explore the world of Unit Testing, Automation & Code Coverage’.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/SAP-Inside-Track-Speaker-Subhajit-38.jpg)

It was my first-hand experience on speaking at a community event and I tried doing utmost justice to it.

ABAP Units is still an unexplored area for many and my session’s objective was to onboard all with it and to focus on how ABAP Unit plays an important role in code quality and reducing critical defects.

I was blessed to have an engaging and curious audience who seemed to be filled with curiosity to know about the topic. Not to mention some of them who travelled all over from ANOTHER STATE to attend this event. Probably that is the beauty of Community events ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

Speaking on the topic

I was thrilled to discuss with participants after my session on their use cases and other queries.

I had used a 3-D model of this fighter jet to explain how important ABAP Unit is. It seemed to be quite liked by participants ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Product_Anaogy-1-scaled.jpg)

Product\_Analogy

Considering this jet as a final product with all the complex avionics and electrical systems as features, I tried to bring an analogy on how a feature rich product like this can be compared with enterprise applications that we develop and how as developers we share a responsibility in ensuring its quality before it reaches arrives at the Quality Gate.

# **Closure:**

There were some gala musical events to conclude the session and get into some light mood after a long and busy day.

All speakers were shouted out with and we did manage to get a group picture as well ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")
