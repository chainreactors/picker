The Russian troll farm that in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election posted a bizarro video claiming Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was a rhino poacher, is back with hundreds of new fake news websites serving up phony political commentary with an AI assist.

In a paper published today, Recorded Future's Insikt Group threat researchers also unveil evidence that [the pro-Putin posters](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/25/russia_china_iran_election_disinfo/) known as CopyCop, aka [Storm-1516](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/russia_putin_trump_white_house/), use self-hosted, uncensored LLMs based on Meta's Llama 3 open-source models to generate at least some of these fictional news stories.

These websites are likely operated by [John Mark Dougan](https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/john-mark-dougan-russian-disinformation-network/), the security researchers claim.
