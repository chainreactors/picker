### Feature Updates

Warning

This version can't be updated from older versions, you need to reinstall UUSEC WAF!

**Interface & Management**

* Redesigned main program and management interface with improved aesthetics and usability, supports UI language switching (English/Chinese)
* Added Rule Collections functionality: Create custom rule templates for batch configuration
* Introduced whitelist rules that terminate further rule matching upon success
* UUSEC WAF Rules API intelligent suggestions during advanced rule editing
* New plugin management supporting hot-reloaded plugins to extend WAF capabilities

**Protocol & Optimization**

* Supports streaming responses for continuous data push (e.g., LLM stream outputs)
* Enables Host header modification during proxying for upstream service access
* Search engine validation: `waf.searchEngineValid(dns,ip,ua)` prevents high-frequency rules from affecting SEO indexing
* Interception log report generation (HTML/PDF exports)
* Automatic rotation of UUSEC WAF error/access logs to prevent performance issues

**Security & Infrastructure**

* Expanded free SSL certificate support: HTTP-01 & DNS-01 verification across 50+ domain providers
* Customizable advanced WAF settings: HTTP2, GZIP, HTTP Caching, SSL protocols, etc
* Cluster configuration: Manage UUSEC WAF nodes and ML servers via web UI
