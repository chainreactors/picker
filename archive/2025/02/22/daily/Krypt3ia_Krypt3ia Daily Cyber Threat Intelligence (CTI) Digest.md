## üö® Top Headlines

### **Firing of 130 CISA staff worries cybersecurity industry**

Summary: The firing of upwards of 130 cybersecurity professionals at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a disaster for the US, but also for many of its allies that count on close collaboration, a security expert said Thursday.

David Shipley, CEO of Beauceron Security, said he ‚Äústruggles to think of another government agency that has built so much credibility and goodwill and respect across the private sector as what CISA has done. [The dismissals] are wholly undeserved, foolhardy and it‚Äôs like you can see the iceberg and you decide to speed the Titanic up. That seems like a bad thing to me.‚Äù

## üîç Emerging Threats and Indicators

### **Malware Campaigns**

### **New Mac Infostealer Warning‚ÄîDo Not Visit These Sites**

Summary: There‚Äôs a very reasonable argument to suggest that [Microsoft devices](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/07/homeland-security-alert-ongoing-critical-microsoft-outlook-attack/) are more at risk than Apple ones, thanks to the number of Windows users and the accompanying effort that cybercriminals put into attempts to compromise them. That doesn‚Äôt mean that Windows is an inherently insecure operating system, however, and Windows 10 users are urged to upgrade, [for free](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/05/heres-how-you-can-get-windows-11-for-free-if-you-act-now/), to Windows 11 before security support for the former stops being provided.\
