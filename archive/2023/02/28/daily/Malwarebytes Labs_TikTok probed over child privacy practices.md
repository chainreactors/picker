# TikTok probed over child privacy practices

Posted: February 27, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The privacy protection authorities for Canada, Québec, British Columbia, and Alberta have [announced](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2023/an_230223/) they will start an investigation into TikTok’s privacy practices, especially in relation to its younger users.

The investigation will include whether the company obtained valid and meaningful consent from its users for the collection, use, and disclosure of their [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

The investigation was initiated in the wake of now settled, class action lawsuits in the United States and Canada, as well as numerous media reports related to TikTok’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.

## TikTok

TikTok claims to have [1 billion users](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok), and when you look at the age distribution it’s no surprise to see that younger people take up the largest share of users.

So, it is understandable that the Canadian regulators put extra emphasis on protecting the privacy of younger users.

Since it is near impossible to determine with whom information is shared, the focus of the Canadian investigation will be to determine if the company is meeting its transparency obligations, particularly when collecting personal information from its users. It will also assess whether the organization’s practices are in compliance with Canadian privacy legislation.

## Bans

The Chinese-owned platform is under growing Western scrutiny. The FCC has called the app a [“unacceptable security risk” and asked it to be removed from app stores](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/07/tiktok-is-unacceptable-security-risk-and-should-be-removed-from-app-stores-says-fcc).

Because of the suspected ties to the Chinese government, TikTok has been banned from the devices of state employees in [several US states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/10/there-are-tiktok-bans-nearly-two-dozen-states/). The US Congress passed [a ban on downloading TikTok](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/us-tiktok-ban-government-devices-china) for most government devices, which President Joe Biden signed in late December, and momentum is building among lawmakers to broaden it even further.

Recently, public authorities in [the Netherlands](https://www.politico.eu/article/netherlands-dutch-government-work-tiktok-data-protection/) were told to steer clear of TikTok. Staff working at the [European Commission](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64743991) have been ordered to remove the TikTok app from their phones and corporate devices. In the UK, [there is a call](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/delete-tiktok-should-personal-data-b2276426.html) for the UK government to follow the European Commission, the EU executive, and the EU Council, and order staff to delete the app.

Last year the [state of Indiana filed a lawsuit against TikTok](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/indiana-sues-tiktok-describes-it-as-chinese-trojan-horse) because it found that TikTok’s 12+ rating on the Apple App Store and the “T” for “Teen” rating in the...
