There’s no part of your life now where you can avoid the onslaught of “[artificial intelligence.](https://medium.com/center-on-privacy-technology/artifice-and-intelligence%C2%B9-f00da128d3cd)” Whether you’re trying to search for a recipe and sifting through [AI-made summaries](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza) or listening to your cousin talk about how they’ve fired their doctor and replaced them with a chatbot, it seems now, more than ever, that AI is the solution to every problem. But, in the meantime, some people are getting hideously rich by convincing people with money and influence that they must integrate AI into their business or operations.

Enter law enforcement.

When many tech vendors see police, they see dollar signs. Law enforcement’s got deep pockets. They are under political pressure to address crime. They are eager to find that *one* magic bullet that *finally* might do away with crime for good. All of this combines to make them a perfect customer for whatever way technology companies can package machine-learning algorithms that sift through historical data in order to do recognition, analytics, or predictions.

AI in policing can take many forms that we can trace back decades–including various forms of face recognition, predictive policing, data analytics, automated gunshot recognition, etc. But this year has seen the rise of a new and troublesome development in the integration between policing and artificial intelligence: AI-generated police reports.

Egged on by companies like [Truleo](https://www.police1.com/police-products/police-tech...
