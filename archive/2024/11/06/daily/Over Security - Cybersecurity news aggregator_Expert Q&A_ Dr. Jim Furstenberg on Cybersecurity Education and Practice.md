Expert Q&A: Dr. Jim Furstenberg on Cybersecurity Education and Practice

Dr. Jim Furstenberg is a distinguished faculty member in the [Ferris State University](https://www.ferris.edu/business/profiles/accountancy-finance-and-information-systems/jim-furstenberg.html) Information Security and Intelligence program. Since joining the faculty in 2014, he has combined his extensive industry experience — including roles as Chief Information Officer, Cybersecurity Consultant, and Chief Operating Officer — with his passion for teaching.

With an information technology/security career spanning sectors such as retail, healthcare, and nonprofit organizations, Dr. Furstenberg brings a wealth of practical knowledge to the classroom. He is not only a licensed Private Investigator specializing in digital forensics and cyber investigations but also the founder of Kalos Cybersecurity LLC. As a retired team leader in Michigan’s Cyber Partners Incident Response (MIC3), he has played a pivotal role in educating and responding to cyber incidents across public and private sectors.

In this interview, Dr. Furstenberg shares insights into how his real-world experience shapes his teaching methods, the differences between educating students and training professionals, and the critical importance of hands-on learning in cybersecurity. He discusses the integration of tools like [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=dr_furstenberg_qa&utm_term=051124&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s [interactive malware sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/security-training-lab/) into his curriculum, the evolving landscape of cybersecurity education, and the essential skills students need to thrive in this dynamic field.

**Join us as we explore Dr. Furstenberg’s approach to fostering the next generation of cybersecurity experts.**

## On the approach to teaching

### **Q:** As someone coming from a practical background, how does your industry experience shape your teaching methods?

**Dr. Jim Furstenberg:** My industry experience informs my teaching methods in several ways. First, it allows me to provide real-world experiential learning and examples that make cybersecurity concepts more relatable and engaging for students. I emphasize hands-on-keyboard practical applications of theoretical knowledge; helping students understand how their learning can be applied in actual work environments.

I also foster a collaborative learning environment, similar to what they would experience in a professional setting, i.e., group projects that prepare them for teamwork and communication in their careers. I draw on industry best practices to create relevant assignments and projects, encouraging students to develop skills that are in demand.

Additionally, our Information Security and [Intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-explained/) (ISIN) program’s faculty team draws on over 20 years of work experience ranging from leadership positions in multibillion-dollar corporations, healthcare, nonprofits, law enforcement, and licensed professional investigators.

ISIN faculty includes a Distinguished Professor, Michigan Professor of the Year, multiple Fulbright Scholars, and International Educator of the Year. Our faculty team has taught on four continents, including teaching digital forensics to the entire federal cybercrime units in Chile and Perú. In 2023, I was nominated for Outstanding Professor of the Year by students; although I did not earn the award, just the nomination meant a lot to me.

Finally, I am still active and, in the cybersecurity, and digital forensics profession and industry. I own my own cybersecurity business, and those firsthand client engagements and experiences help me stay updated on industry trends and challenges, allowing me to incorporate current topics into the curriculum and ensure that students are equipped for the future job market.
