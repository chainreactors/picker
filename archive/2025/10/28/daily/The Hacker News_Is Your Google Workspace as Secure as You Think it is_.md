## **The New Reality for Lean Security Teams**

If you're the first security or IT hire at a fast-growing startup, you've likely inherited a mandate that's both simple and maddeningly complex: secure the business without slowing it down.

Most organizations using Google Workspace start with an environment built for collaboration, not resilience. Shared drives, permissive settings, and constant integrations make life easy for employees—and equally easy for attackers.

The good news is that Google Workspace provides an excellent security foundation. The challenge lies in properly configuring it, maintaining visibility, and closing the blind spots that Google's native controls leave open.

This article breaks down the key practices every security team—especially small, lean ones—should follow to harden Google Workspace and defend against modern cloud threats.

## **1. Lock Down the Basics**

### **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

MFA is the single most effective way to stop account compromise. In the **Googl**e Admin console, go to:

**Security → Authentication → 2-Step Verification**

* Set the policy to *"On for everyone"*.
* Require security keys (FIDO2) or Google's prompt-based MFA instead of SMS codes.
* Enforce context-aware access for admins and executives—only allow logins from trusted networks or devices.

Even with perfect phishing detection, stolen credentials are inevitable. MFA makes them useless.

### **Harden Admin Access**

Admin accounts are a prime target. In **Admin Console → Directory → Roles**,

* Limit the number of Super Admins to as few as possible.
* Assign role-based access—e.g., *Groups Admin*, *Help Desk Admin*, or *User Management Admin*—instead of blanket privileges.
* Turn on admin email alerts for privilege escalations or new role assignments.

This ensures one compromised admin account doesn't mean total compromise.

### **Secure Sharing Defaults**

Google's collaboration tools are powerful—but their default sharing settings can be dangerous.

Under **Apps → Google Workspace → Drive and Docs → Sharing Settings**:

* Set "Link Sharing" to *Restricted* (internal only by default).
* Prevent users from making files public unless explicitly approved.
* Disable "Anyone with the link" access for sensitive shared drives.

Drive leaks rarely happen through malice—they happen through convenience. Tight defaults prevent accidental exposure.

### **Control OAuth App Access**

Under **Security → Access and Data Control → API Controls**,

* Review all third-party apps connected to Workspace under **App access control**.
* Block any app that requests *"Full access to Gmail"*, *"Drive read/write"*, or *"Directory access"* without a clear business case.
* Whitelist only trusted, vetted vendors.

Compromised or poorly coded apps can become silent backdoors to your data.

## **2. Fortify Against Email Threats**

Email remains the most targeted and exploited part of any organization's cloud environment.

While Google's built-in phishing protection blocks a lot, it can't always stop socially engineered or internally originated attacks—especially those leveraging compromised accounts.

To improve resilience:

* **Turn on advanced phishing and malware protection:**
  + In **Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Safety**, enable settings for *"Protect against inbound phishing, malware, spam, and domain impersonation"* and *"Detect unusual attachment types"*.
  + Enable *"Protect against anomalous attachment behavior"* for Drive links embedded in emails.
* **Enable DMARC, DKIM, and SPF**:

  These three email authentication mechanisms ensure attackers can't impersonate your domain. Set them up under **Apps → Google Workspace → Settings for Gmail → Authenticate Email**.
* **Train your users—but back it up with automation**:

  Phishing awareness helps, but human error is inevitable. Layer detection and response tools that can identify suspicious internal messages, lateral phishing attempts, or malicious attachments that bypass Google's filters.

Email threats today move fast. Response speed—not just detection—is critical.

## **3. Detect and Contain Account Takeovers**

A compromised Google account can cascade quickly. Attackers can access shared Drives, steal OAuth tokens, and silently exfiltrate data.

### **Proactive Monitoring**

In the **Security Dashboard → Investigation Tool**, monitor for:

* Sudden login attempts from new geolocations.
* Unusual download volumes from Drive.
* Automatic forwarding rules that send mail externally.

### **Automated Alerts**

Set up automated alerts for:

* Password resets without MFA challenge.
* Suspicious OAuth grants.
* Failed login bursts or credential stuffing activity.

Google's alerts are helpful but limited. They don't correlate across multiple accounts or detect subtle, slow-moving compromises.

## **4. Understand and Protect Your Data**

It's impossible to secure what you don't understand. Most organizations have years of unclassified, sensitive data buried in Drive and Gmail—financial models, customer data, source code, HR files.

### **Data Discovery and DLP**

While Google offers Data Loss Prevention (DLP), it's rigid and often noisy.

Under **Security → Data Protection**, you can:

* Create rules for detecting patterns like credit card numbers, SSNs, or custom keywords.
* Apply them to Drive, Gmail, and Chat.
* But beware of false positives and the administrative overhead of manual triage.

### **Smarter Access and Governance**

* Enable Drive l...
