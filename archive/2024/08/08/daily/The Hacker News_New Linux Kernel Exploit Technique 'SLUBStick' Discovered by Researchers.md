[![Linux Kernel Exploit](data:image/png;base64... "Linux Kernel Exploit")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5HgscA6NcRSdqThvAd7WSnWKhJzqKi7tyd2e3oR12b3st44NcW8_Ot-uorerFP2EC2lHjnRdOcfe7ePnhdXdfY2WR5_7C1XsuVc-0_R9n9pDJ9GVwaTMwcsAAmLRW3goTGRIRK3rxesCqNJ1vvIsYdS7qi5Sg_-P8zxaFWEtS8Hr4hLGkCly6Kr34OHDF/s790-rw-e365/linux.png)

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a novel Linux kernel exploitation technique dubbed [SLUBStick](https://github.com/IAIK/SLUBStick) that could be exploited to elevate a limited heap vulnerability to an arbitrary memory read-and-write primitive.

"Initially, it exploits a timing side-channel of the allocator to perform a cross-cache attack reliably," a group of academics from the Graz University of Technology [said](https://www.stefangast.eu/papers/slubstick.pdf) [PDF]. "Concretely, exploiting the side-channel leakage pushes the success rate to above 99% for frequently used generic caches."

Memory safety vulnerabilities impacting the Linux kernel have limited capabilities and are a lot more challenging to exploit owing to security features like Supervisor Mode Access Prevention ([SMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisor_Mode_Access_Prevention)), Kernel address space layout randomization ([KASLR](https://lwn.net/Articles/962782/)), and kernel control flow integrity ([kCFI](https://github.com/kcfi/kcfi)).

While software cross-cache attacks have been devised as a way to counter kernel hardening strategies like coarse-grained heap separation, studies have shown that existing methods only have a success rate of only 40%.

SLUBStick has been demonstrated on versions 5.19 and 6.2 of the Linux kernel using nine security flaws (e.g., double free, use-after-free, and out-of-bounds write) discovered between 2021 and 2023, leading to privilege escalation to root with no authentication and container escapes.

[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8jw-IgUso8mh782X46fmJOpjss6zWGaO5mEBhvgs2g-VYr-bvA-E89b8ECjsqm6A0ibEYSMZr1aWgTQtGI_i1HWmECGFe13f-ShwxW7CI2bqbchkygMXtaVCQKrxXJLkeDN_HM0ayuFSPRVbuph5q8fGPCaR4ZCLOeOJjm8So1jk3TIjm9A9tbBS30BUl/s790-rw-e365/linux.png)

The core idea behind the approach is to offer the ability to modify kernel data and obtain an arbitrary memory read-and- write primitive in a manner that reliably surmounts existing defences like KASLR.

However for this to work, the threat model assumes the presence of a heap vulnerability in the Linux kernel and that an unprivileged user has code execution capabilities.

"SLUBStick exploits more recent systems, including v5.19 and v6.2, for a wide variety of heap vulnerabilities," the researchers said.
