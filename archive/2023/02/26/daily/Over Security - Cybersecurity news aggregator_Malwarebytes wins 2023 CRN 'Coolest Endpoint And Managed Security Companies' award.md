## Malwarebytes wins 2023 CRN ‘Coolest Endpoint And Managed Security Companies’ award

February 24, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

CRN, a trusted source for IT channel news and analysis, has named Malwarebytes one of the “Coolest Endpoint And Managed Security Companies” on the 2023 CRN Security 100 list.

The CRN Security 100 highlights channel-friendly cybersecurity vendors across a number of market segments including Endpoint and Managed Security, Identity Management and Data Protection, Network Security, and more. Solutions that leverage cloud-native technologies and provide more comprehensive detection capabilities are featured prominently on the list.

By featuring Malwarebytes on their list of key cybersecurity vendors for 2023, CRN recognizes the strides we’ve made to best serve our channel partners in the past year, including:

* Expanding our partner network to more than **3,000 global MSP partners and over 250 percent growth YoY**
* Forming new strategic partnerships with **Addigy, Atera, ConnectWise, GCN Group, Kaseya/Datto, Sherweb, TeamViewer, and Pax8, among others.**
* Growing the MSP sales and marketing team **175 percent YoY to support partners across geographies and industries.**

And on the Value Added Reseller (VAR) front:

* Continuing to strengthen key partnerships with distribution and partners, including **TD Synnex, Carahsoft, CDW, SHI, Insight, and Howard Technologies**.
* **Increasing transactions 100 percent YoY with VARs in the US**.
