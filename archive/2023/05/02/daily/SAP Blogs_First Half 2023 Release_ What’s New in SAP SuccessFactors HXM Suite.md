With the 1H 2023 release now in preview (as of April 28) and moving into production soon (June 2), we are pleased to highlight the following [SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html) innovations, designed to help you create a more agile, engaged, and future-ready workforce:

### **Build a future-ready workforce**

**Dynamic teams:** General availability, Linking of OKRs, Report stories
We’re happy to share dynamic teams is generally available in the 1H 2023 release. This was previously open to all customers with early adopter care in the 2H 2022 release and we’ve had some great feedback from the customers using this functionality either in production or preview.

In addition to moving to GA, we also have a few new features to highlight. First, team members can now link objectives and key results (OKRs) to their personal performance goals within SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals. This will give managers improved line of sight into the contributions of their employees – and allow employees themselves to align their dynamic teams work to applicable performance goals.

As part of this release, dynamic teams data is now integrated with SAP SuccessFactors People Analytics. The creation of report stories gives leaders greater visibility into the volume and composition of dynamic teams across their organization, as well as the ability to track team progress with OKR data across lines of business and departments.

In addition, to create a better experience for teams just getting started, we’ve enhanced the welcome message to provide tips and best practices for success. This was based on customer feedback from our early adopter care program – a great example of how our customer programs are helping to influence our solutions and experiences.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/05/Dynamic-Teams_1H2023.png)

**SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace:** Opportunities based on growth portfolio, Job recommendations
With this release, we are introducing the ability for employees to search and filter opportunities based on their growth portfolio attributes, allowing employees to quickly find relevant growth opportunities that align to their skills, competencies, and aspirations. In addition, job postings from the [SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/recruiting-software.html) solution can now be surfaced as recommendations within the [SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/opportunity-marketplace.html) solution to support an increased focus on internal mobility.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/05/Opportunity-Marketplace_1H2023.png)

**SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals:**Pre-populated goal library
Continuing our focus on reimagining the goal management user experience, we are introducing a new pre-populated goal library. This allows employees to search and select from a catalog of goals, making the goal-setting process simpler and more powerful with suggestions that help employees craft more ambitious and meaningful goals. In addition, with new sub-goal tables, users can now add targets and milestones to increase granularity when tracking goal execution.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/05/Performance-Goal_1H2023.png)

**Talent intelligence hub:** Open early adopter, Growth portfolio across the suite, Skills inference
In this release, we’re opening access to the talent intelligence hub to all interested early adopters. This includes the new growth portfolio, which allows individuals to add, rate, and accept recommended skills and competencies without using performance management forms. The growth portfolio will power several SAP SuccessFactors solution areas, including recruiting, talent management, learning, and compensation. In addition, with the new attributes library, admins now have the flexibility to configure and track any number of custom attributes.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/05/TIH_1H2023.png)

### **Drive employee engagement with elevated experiences**

**User experience:** Horizon theme, Custom and new quick action cards
In this release, the new Horizon theme is turned on by default, delivering a simple and modern user interface. This visual change – which is designed to increase employee engagement – will be applied to all employee-facing pages ...
