# 10 Consequences of a Data Breach and How To Protect Yourself

The world revolves around data. Worth more than money, data is the latest currency that can change the world for better or worse. And when your personal data or your business’s data gets into the wrong hands, it can have severe consequences.

Unfortunately, the [threat of a data breach](https://www.digitalforensics.com/blog/software/data-breach/) is not a matter of “if” but “when.” By being prepared and equipped to handle potential cyber threats, you can ensure your data doesn’t get into the hands of anyone who shouldn’t have it, especially cybercriminals.

The scary thing about security breaches is that as soon as you realize what’s happening, it could already be too late to stop it. If you don’t already, take some time to understand the severity of a data breach and how to protect your information security.

## What Are the Consequences of a Data Breach?

### Financial Loss

From having your bank account drained to fraudulent charges on your credit card, these types of data breaches can result in serious financial losses. If your financial information falls into the hands of a hacker, they can quickly wreak havoc on your bank accounts and credit cards.

While the loss of money can be staggering, so can the average cost of legal fees for prosecuting the perpetrators or recovering the stolen funds. Not to mention, it can take months or even years to recoup the lost money.

### Identity Theft

When your data gets out, so does important personal information about your identity, like your date of birth, phone number, driver’s license, or social security number. With that information, criminals can commit identity theft by taking out loans, applying for credit cards, or forging documents with your name.

If you start to receive bills for services you have never used or unpaid loans you haven’t authorized, your identity could have been stolen. When it comes to clearing your name from these charges, remediation often requires a lot of back and forth with banks, credit card companies, law enforcement, and insurance providers.

### Credit Score Damage

These fraudulent activities from a [data breach](https://www.digitalforensics.com/blog/software/data-breach/) can ruin your credit score and impact any future plans of securing loans or mortgages. Having a damaged credit score can have far-reaching consequences, from applying for apartments to getting good insurance rates.

Rebuilding your credit score can be a lengthy process, often taking several years to complete. It involves multiple interactions with [credit bureaus](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/) as you work to prove you were a [victim of fraud](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-do-i-do-if-i-think-i-have-been-a-victim-of-identity-theft-en-31/). This can require extensive documentation and evidence to support your case.

### Legal Repercussions

If your data is used for illegal activities, you might find yourself tangled up in a legal challenge. From minor offenses, like traffic violations, to serious crimes, such as tax evasion or money laundering, clearing your name requires legal representation and cooperation with law enforcement—which can be time-consuming and costly.

The burden of dealing with these legal issues goes beyond just the legal back and forth. It also involves coping with the psychological strain and the added inconvenience of demonstrating one’s innocence in relation to these legal issues.

### Privacy Invasion

In a data breach, personally identifiable information (PII) like photos or messages can become public and lead to embarrassing data leaks that can be used for [blackmail](https://www.digitalforensics.com/blog/blackmail/how-to-deal-with-instagram-blackmail/). With a data breach, sensitive data can suddenly be exposed without your consent, leaving you embarrassed and vulnerable.

Sometimes, cybercriminals will use this confidential information to extort money from you or blackmail you to do something. This sensitive information can leave you in a tough situation, wondering whether you should comply with the blackmailer’s demands. If you’re dealing with extortion from a data breach, our team at Digital Forensics can help you navigate the situation and avoid paying hefty fees or having your information leaked.

Beyond photos and messages, privacy invasion can also take the form of leaked medical records and health information, which are not only personal but vital to your life. Even if a hacker doesn’t obtain compromising photos or messages of you, leaked phone numbers or social media passwords can result in social engineering attacks like phishing scams later on.

### Reputational Damage

Both individuals and businesses can get a negative reputation from a data breach, which can take years to...
