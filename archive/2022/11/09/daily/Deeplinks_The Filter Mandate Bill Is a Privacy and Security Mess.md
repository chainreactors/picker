And that mandate is broad, so poorly-conceived, and so technically misguided that it will inevitably create serious privacy and security risks.

Since 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) has required services to accommodate "standard technical measures" to reduce infringement. The DMCA’s definition of standard technical measures (STMs) requires them to be developed by a broad consensus in an open, fair, multi-industry, and perhaps most importantly *voluntary* process. In other words, current law reflects an understanding that most technologies shouldn’t be adopted as standards because standards affect many, many stakeholders who all deserve a say.
