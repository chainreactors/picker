# “Nearly all” AT&T customers had phone records stolen in new data breach disclosure

Posted: July 12, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In a déjà-vu nightmare, US phone giant AT&T has [notified](https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979) customers that cybercriminals managed to download phone call and text message records of “nearly all of AT&T cellular customers from May 1, 2022 to October 31, 2022 as well as on January 2, 2023”.

In a [filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000732717/000073271724000046/t-20240506.htm) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AT&T said:

> “On April 19, 2024, AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) learned that a threat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs.”

AT&T says the customer data was illegally downloaded from its workspace on a third-party [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) platform. This might be related to the [Snowflake incidents](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/snowflake-breach-looks-like-165-individual-incidents/) we have seen several of by now.

In the statement, AT&T specifies which data it believes was stolen:

> “The call and text records identify the phone numbers with which an AT&T number interacted during this period, including AT&T landline (home phone) customers. It also included counts of those calls or texts and total call durations for specific days or months.”

And which data is unlikely to be included:

> “The downloaded data doesn’t include the content of any calls or texts. It doesn’t have the time stamps for the calls or texts. It also doesn’t have any details such as [Social Security numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web), dates of birth, or other [personally identifiable information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).”

Even though the data doesn’t include customer names, there are many easy ways to find the name that’s associated with a phone number.

This is the second time AT&T has disclosed a security incident this year. Back in March, [AT&T confirmed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/att-confirms-73-million-people-affected-by-data-breach) that 73 million people had been affected in a breach that people had been [speculating about for some time](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/the-att-breach-what-you-need-to-know).

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of [two-factor...
