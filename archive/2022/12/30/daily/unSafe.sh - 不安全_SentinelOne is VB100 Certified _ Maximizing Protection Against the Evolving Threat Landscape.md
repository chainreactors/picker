## What is VB100 Certification?

VB100 tests the efficacy of Windows endpoint security products and their ability to protect against common, file-based Windows threats without creating excessive false alarms for legitimate programs. The certification is only awarded to products that meet the strict perimeters of the test – that it can detect no less than 99.5% of malware samples listed as ‘In the Wild’ by the WildList Organization and generate no more than 0.01% false positives when scanning a test set of clean sample files.

The testing process first involves the download of each sample test set. Then, a scan-on-demand action is performed by the product under test for the downloaded samples. Any remaining samples are finally inventories and their integrity verified. Test case sets are collected frequently to include fresh samples and are divided into three subsets:

* **Certification Set:** This set is compiled of prevalent Windows malware recently observed in the wild. The size of this set will vary, generally including 1000 to 2000 purely Windows PE-type cases.
* **Clean Set:** This set comprises widely and less widely used legitimate program files. This set contains 100,000 samples selected randomly from a much larger repository of samples and includes both PE (minimum of 25%) and miscellaneous file types.
* **Diversity Set:** This set comprises assorted malicious Windows executables, including less clear-cut cases and more obscure threats. It will contain predominantly PE file types and typically includes 1000 samples selected randomly from a larger repository.

After the testing, the product’s responses are categorized into true positives and negatives and false positives and negatives. True positives and negatives indicate corrected detected malware and the treatment of legitimate files as such. False positives and negatives indicate missed malware detection and false alarms on legitimate files.

## Importance of VB100 Certification

Virus Bulletin (VB) is an independent testing and certification body based in the UK. For the past two decades, VB has built a rich history in establishing a highly-regarded industry benchmark for security solutions used by the infosec community. Any product awarded VB100 certification is regarded as having met a strict quality standard regarding malware detection.

Achieving VB100 certification is widely recognized in both antivirus and malware communities, known for its stringent testing requirements. The certification demonstrates a product’s ability to stop common threats and minimize alert fatigue, marks its resilience against developing cyber threats, and helps many enterprises meet federal guidelines for broader security measures. VB100 certification can be earned and maintained through frequent testing and a product retains its certification status for 180 days since the last successfully passed the test.

To keep ahead of security challenges in a changing threat landscape, enterprises have accelerated the effort of replacing their legacy antivirus solutions at scale. For many modern-day CISOs, a large part of helping their enterprise’s security programs is comparing hundreds of cybersecurity solutions that all claim to solve the problem of cyberattacks. Public testing and transparent methodologies such as Virus Bulletin’s certification allow CISOs to navigate these comparisons more effectively and choose the right solution for their organization.
