# GlobalX, airline used for Trump deportations, gets hacked: Report

GlobalX, an airline [used by the Trump administration](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-01/airline-at-center-of-brazil-fiasco-key-to-trump-s-deportations?embedded-checkout=true) as part of its massive deportation campaign, has reportedly been hacked.

On Monday, [404 Media first reported news of the breach](https://www.404media.co/globalx-airline-for-trumps-deportations-hacked/), based on [a defacement message](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505140730/https%3A//foqa.globalxair.com/) on the airline’s official website and stolen data that the hackers shared with the news website.

“Anonymous has decided to enforce the Judge’s order since you and your sycophant staff ignore lawful orders that go against your fascist plans,” wrote the hackers, who claimed to be affiliated with the amorphous hacktivist group Anonymous.

The hackers were referring to rulings by [several](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-orders-return-second-migrant-deported-el-salvador-2025-04-24/) [judges](https://www.wate.com/hill-politics/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-facilitate-return-of-second-deported-man/) [ordering](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/04/politics/judge-orders-us-government-return-man-from-el-salvador/index.html) the Trump administration to return people who were wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

GlobalX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
