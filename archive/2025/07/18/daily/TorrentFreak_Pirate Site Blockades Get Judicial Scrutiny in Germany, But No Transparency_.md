# Pirate Site Blockades Get Judicial Scrutiny in Germany, But No Transparency?

Germany's voluntary pirate site blocking regime has undergone a fundamental change, now requiring judicial oversight for all blocking actions. The participants will rely on court orders going forward, instead of their own recommendations. While the change ensures a proper review of blocking requests, it does not necessarily make the blockades more transparent for the public.

The ISPs teamed up with rightsholders groups and launched the “Clearing Body for Copyright on the Internet” ([CUII](https://cuii.info/)), which was in charge of handing down blocking ‘decisions’.

Notably, the CUII did not rely on court judgments. Instead, the private organization issued their own recommendations after an internal review process, which assess whether a reported domain is indeed linked to a website that structurally infringes copyrights.

As an extra precaution, the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) reviewed all of CUII’s blocking decisions before they were implemented.

This extrajudicial blocking regime has resulted in 25 blocking orders since it launched, targeting hundreds of domains operated by sites such as Kinox, Filmfans, Sci-Hub, Lib-Gen, Romslab, and Totalsportek. This significantly reduced the traffic to these domain names and reportedly worked well. Nonetheless, [Heise](https://www.heise.de/news/Clearingstelle-Urheberrecht-Gremium-fuer-Websperren-setzt-kuenftig-auf-die-Justiz-10490090.html) reports that a major change just taken place.

## Judicial Oversight Is Now Required

Last month, the participants of the blocking agreement amended their code of conduct, which fundamentally changes how CUII operates. Going forward, all blocking action will take place after a court orders at least one Internet provider to block a website.

“The CUII no longer reviews blocking claims, but instead coordinates the initiation and conduct of proceedings, the implementation of court blocking decisions, and the unblocking of domains that are no longer infringing,” CUII writes.

*What Changed?*

Under the amended agreement, other ISPs will follow court-ordered blockades, even if they are not directly targeted themselves. This is similar to the blocking regime that is currently operational [in the Netherlands](https://torrentfreak.com/brein-signs-landmark-pirate-site-blocking-agreement-with-dutch-isps-211105/).

The move away from privatized blocking orders is notable, but is not directly linked to accuracy concerns. According to CUII, the main reason is that the Federal Network Agency could no longer efficiently review CUII’s orders, as it has limited resources and other priorities.

“[T]he Federal Network Agency could no longer guarantee the continued fast and effective process with the usual level of quality. Therefore, it has asked the CUII to have the review conducted by the courts in the future,” CUII writes.

## Key Changes

Under the updated agreement, rightsholders will report potential blocking targets to CUII, which will then pick one Internet provider to be sued in court. If the rights holder is successful in court, they will inform the clearing house of the outcome, which will then ask other ISPs to block the targeted domains as well.

While this sounds straightforward, obtaining a pirate site blocking order in Germany is more complicated than elsewhere. Previously, courts have ruled that blocking measures should only be used [as a last resort](https://torrentfreak.com/federal-court-of-justice-pirate-site-blocking-must-be-a-tool-of-last-resort-221014/), which means that action against hosting providers can be required beforehand.

Just a few weeks ago, rightsholders complained about these strict requirements at the European Commission, noting that they prevent swift and effective enforcement. The complaining parties include the MPA, BVMI, GAME, and DFL, who are all part of CUII.

“[T]he overextended application of the subsidiarity principle places undue burdens on rights holders, who are often required to take prior legal action against EU-based hosting providers before obtaining blocking orders,” the rightsholders wrote.

When a court order is obtained and implemented by all participating ISPs, CUII will be responsible for reviewing new domains and mirrors to be added to the blocklist. If permitted by the underlying order, a new court procedure is not required.

Rightsholders will remain in charge of monitoring that the blocking conditions still apply. When a domain name no longer links to infringing content, they will alert CUII so the associated blocking order can be lifted.

## Transparency?

The decision to add judicial oversight will help to ensure a proper review of all blocking requests. That said, CUII’s blocking decisions were generally quite thorough; most problems in Germany can be traced back to a lack of transparency.

In Germany, there is no public overview of blocked domain names, which makes public scrutiny much more difficult. It took a [then-17-year-old developer](https://torrentfreak.com/17-year-old-student-exposes-germanys-secret-pirate-site-blocklist-240822/) to start an [independent monitoring site](https://cuiiliste.de/), after which several erroneously blocked domains were identified and reported.

The now-18-year-old Lina writes in a [blog post](https://lina.sh/blog/cuii-gives-up) that she exposed dozens of wrong and outdated blocks since the site was started. This often involved domain names that were no longer active but remained blocked.

While many CUII critics, including Lina, are happy to see blocking powers in the hands of the judicial system, this change doesn’t make the blockades more transparent.

Aside from [inadvertent leaks](https://torrentfreak.com/non-transparency-resumed-after-pirate-site-blacklist-publicly-exposed-in-error-250415/) and an unofficial monitoring portal, there’s no official overview of blocked domains. As in the older version, the new agreement stipulates that “details” about the site will be published, but that [doesn’t include](https://cuii.info/anordnungen/) a full list of domains.
