## Introduction

Ransomware has been a major cyber threat globally since late 2019 and is a top concern for just about every organisation regardless of industry or business model. After year-on-year increases in ransomware attack figures, competing sources have provoked debate on whether ransomware rose or fell as a risk in 2022.

* From one perspective, there is a growing consensus and evidence to suggest total attack rates may have lessened, substantiated by falling reported cryptocurrency revenues for ransomware groups.
* Conversely, the narrative of exponential growth which has accompanied ransomware since 2019/20 still carries significant momentum, with announcements that 2022 was a ‘breakout year’ for ransomware – despite evidence that 2022 showed a less dramatic rise in activity.

Globally in 2022, JUMPSEC’s data shows that attacker reported ransomware rates experienced diminished growth compared to previous years. However, **attacker reported incidents in the UK specifically have increased by a further 17% in 2022**, meaning that from a UK perspective at least, any statements about the diminished threat of ransomware should be met with a degree of caution. Furthermore, the initial data for 2023 shows signs of an uptake in UK ransomware activity.

#### Total UK cases 2020-2023. Total UK reported attacks increased by 17% in 2022 compared to 2021, although the rate of attacks broadly followed a similar pattern to the previous year.

[![UK total timeline 2022](https://www.jumpsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UK-total-timeline-2022.jpg)](https://www.jumpsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/UK-total-timeline-2022.jpg)

New and emerging vulnerabilities are likely to increase the damage ransomware groups can inflict on organisations following discovery and exploitation. New vulnerabilities such as Spring4Shell, Follina and ProxyNotShell were identified and exploited in 2022, however, not to the same degree as Log4j in 2021.

**In 2022, at no point did total attack rates reach the record high of November / December 2021, which saw a total of 20 attacks in the UK over a two-week period – primarily due to the widely exploited Log4j vulnerability.**

#### Total activity in the UK overlaid with a timeline of major cyber security events.

Perhaps more influentially in 2022, **new threat actors** have become more prominent in the ransomware space following the disintegration of Conti and REvil, formerly the largest ransomware players, and key actors in the December 2021 spike.

After the decline of Conti in May, attack rates fell mid-way through the year, before rising again over the Autumn due overwhelmingly to the resurgence of LockBit.

Lockbit have since taken the mantle as the largest ransomware threat by some distance, both globally and in the UK, claiming over 52% of global reported ransomware attacks. In September alone, Lockbit registered a total of 291 total attacks in just two weeks – the most recorded since the ransomware wave began in 2019.
