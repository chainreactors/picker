### Jump to

In our latest Fusion Fireside episode, we sit down with Patrick Bours, Professor of Behaviour at NTNU and keynote speaker at this year’s [Fraud Forward event in Amsterdam](/fraud-forward-nl-editie-3-2025). Patrick’s journey—from academic research to real-world fraud prevention—offers a compelling look into the evolving role of behavioural biometrics in cybersecurity.

The conversation, recorded in a relaxed setting just before Fraud Forward, dives into how behavioural analytics are reshaping fraud detection. Patrick shares insights into the nuances of passive biometrics, the challenges of explainability and model transparency, and the ethical dilemmas posed by AI-driven decision-making.

Patrick’s reflections on becoming a professor in Norway, his thoughts on privacy-preserving methods, and his take on the future of AI in fraud prevention made for a rich and engaging discussion.

This episode is a must-watch for anyone interested in the intersection of behavioural science, machine learning, and fraud defence. As Patrick aptly puts it, “AI can be both saviour and scourge”—a theme we explore in depth throughout the session.

Watch the full episode below and let us know what you think. As always, we welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing the conversation.
