Although APT groups use zero-day vulnerabilities as part of their attack kill-chains, in its yearly [Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2022) last week, Microsoft said it spotted Chinese threat actors using an increased number of zero-days over the past year.

Microsoft believes this sudden spike in zero-day exploits from Chinese threat actors comes as a direct result of a new law passed by the Chinese government last year.

Passed in July 2021 and entered into effect in September 2021, this [new law](http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/13/c_1627761607640342.htm) requires that all Chinese security researchers report new vulnerabilities they find to a state security agency.

Faced with criticism at the time it passed the law, the Chinese government said it only wanted to maintain an accurate index of vulnerabilities and make sure local companies don't dodge responsibility for failing to patch vulnerabilities in time and leaving Chinese users and government networks exposed to attacks.

But the new law also contains several generically-worded clauses that could be interpreted to suggest that the Chinese government was setting up a secret process through which its offensive cyber units could pilfer and suppress the work of the infosec community for the country's espionage operations.

While no solid evidence has been found so far to support these theories, Microsoft appears to be sold on this narrative in its latest report.

> " This new regulation might enable elements in the Chinese government to stockpile reported vulnerabilities toward weaponizing them. The increased use of zero days over the last year from China-based actors likely reflects the first full year of China's vulnerability disclosure requirements for the Chinese security community and a major step in the use of zero-day exploits as a state priority.

The company listed five zero-days in its report as possible examples of abuse: two in Zoho ManageEngine (CVE-2021-40539 and CVE-2021-44077), and one in SolarWinds Serv-U (CVE-2021-35211), Atlassian Confluence (CVE-2022-26134), and Microsoft Exchange (CVE-2021-42321).

Were exploits for these zero-days developed by Chinese APTs after they were reported through China's in-house vulnerability disclosure rules? **Possibly. Maybe. Who knows.**

Has the same software been repeatedly plagued by major vulnerabilities and zero-day exploits over the past years? **Yes! Oh, God, yes!**

Maybe that's a more accurate assessment. You can’t blame Chinese APTs for looking at what everyone else is looking at. Are they getting a little help from the state's mandatory disclosure law? We’re not convinced so far. China has a huge cybersecurity scene, so there’s no need to "steal" someone's bug report when you can just as easily buy it from a private contractor who is also going to keep their mouth shut.

In the meantime, please enjoy Microsoft's latest APT names chart. You're gonna need it if you wanna decipher any of the company's APT reports and attributions.

### Breaches and hacks

**Solend crypto-heist:** DeFi platform Solend [said](https://archive.ph/Bd2zt/) it lost $1.26 million worth of cryptocurrency following an Oracle attack on its platform, targeting the Hubble (USDH) currency.

**Successful defense:** In a [post-mortem](https://medium.com/pnetwork/pgala-post-mortem-measures-taken-to-safeguard-the-ecosystem-from-malicious-actors-and-recovery-6407048f4497), pNetwork said it successfully defended an attack on its pGALA token.

**DSB cyber-attack:** Danish train operator DSB [said](https://www.reuters.com/technology/danish-train-standstill-saturday-caused-by-cyber-attack-2022-11-03/) that the [disruptions](https://cphpost.dk/?p=140006) to some of its trains over the previous weekend were the result of a cyber-attack on the infrastructure of one of its IT subcontractors.

**Personal Paraguay hack:** Paraguay's Personal ISP service [disclosed](https://www.facebook.com/personalpy/posts/pfbid02dQqdkwfp6V1VDWeb6AqtC2qGJsnPNWSBc4h97PehFasNjDGmMh4Kjrd2i2PDheajl) last week that it was the victim of a cyber-attack.

### General tech and privacy

**SolarWinds settlement:** SolarWinds said it reached a settlement with its shareholders in a class-action lawsuit filed in 2021 in which the company was accused of misleading its investors about the [2020 hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach) and subsequent supply chain attack. According to [documents](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739942/000173994222000091/swi-20221028.htm) filed with the SEC, the settlement is worth $26 million but still needs to be approved by the case judge.

### Government, politics, and policy

**Qatar spied on FIFA officials:** A [report](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/-project-merciless---how-qatar-spied-on-the-world-of-football-in-switzerland/48022952) in Swiss media claims that Qatar officials "orchestrated a large-scale and long-standing intelligence operation against FIFA officials with the help of former CIA operatives" in the run-up to Qatar being awarded the FIFA 2022 World Cup. The report claims that "the highest echelons of the Qatari government were involved" and that the cyber-espionage campaign targeted critics inside and outside FIFA alike.

> "The scale of the espionage activities is considerable. One sub-operation alone involved the planned deployment of at least 66 operatives over nine years. The budget amounted to $387 million. And the activities spanned five continents."

The AP reported last week that [the FBI started an investigation](https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de) against Kevin Chalker, a former CIA agent and the founder and CEO of Global Risk Advisors, the company that helped the Qatari government orchestrate this operation.

**Armenian cyber-attacks:** Azerbaijan officials [said](https://en.trend.az/azerbaijan/politics/3665869.html) they successfully mitigated "large-scale cyberattacks by Armenia" fo...
