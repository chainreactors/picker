A CEO is arrested for turning satellite receivers into DDoS attack weapons, and we journey into the world of bossware and ‚Äúaffective computing‚Äù and explore how AI is learning to read our emotions ‚Äì is this the future of work, or a recipe for dystopia?

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
