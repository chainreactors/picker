# Description #

ERPGo is a software as a service (SaaS) platform that is vulnerable to CSV
injection attacks. This type of attack occurs when an attacker is able to
manipulate the data that is imported or exported in a CSV file, in order to
execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access to sensitive
information. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by
injecting specially crafted data into a CSV file, which is then imported
into the ERPGo system. This can potentially allow the attacker to gain
access to sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial
data, or to execute malicious code on the system.
