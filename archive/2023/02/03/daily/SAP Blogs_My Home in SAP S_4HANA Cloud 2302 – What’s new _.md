The newly released ***My Home* in SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2302**, **public edition**, provides enhanced personalization capabilities, a better user experience, new card types, and additional functionalities in the Insights section.

*My Home* gives you easy access to business insights and helps you access and manage your to dos (combining items from the *My Inbox* and the *My Situations* apps), your favorite pages, your favorite apps, and your insights – on any device. *My Home* builds on the functionality of SAP Fiori Launchpad in SAP S/4HANA Cloud and leverages Spaces and Pages (as a prerequisite).

### **Enhanced personalization capabilities and user experience**

One strength of *My Home* is the ability to personalize the layout and content of the page. We have expanded this capability with the 2302 release.

For example, you are now able to **expand** each section of the *My Home*page to enable a full screen view. You can pin what’s essential in a section and see the details by clicking on the Expand icon.

Thanks to the **persistence of state**, you can now navigate away from the *My Home* page and find the page just as you left it when you return.

Previously, you had to scroll to each section of the *My Home* page to personalize it. Now, with the 2302 release, **editing *My Home* sections is consolidated,** making it even easier for you to personalize the page. You can access the "*My Home* Settings" dialog either from your user profile, or by using the Edit option of each section.

Pages sometimes have very similar or even the same name. To make your experience in the *My Home* Pages section even more efficient, we added the **space title as a subtitle** to the pages you select as your favorites to allow you to clearly identify your favorite pages.

The Apps section has been renamed **“Apps and Activities”**. It contains, on top of your Favorite apps, your Recent Activities and Frequently Used applications.

### **Additional** **card types and functionalities in My Home Insights section**

To benefit from even more business insights, *My Home* now supports two new card types in the Insights section: **table cards and list cards**.

Table cards can be added from [SAP Fiori elements overview page](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/overview-page/#cards) applications and SAP Fiori elements list report applications containing a responsive table. List cards can also be added from SAP Fiori elements overview page applications.

Adding cards from a Fiori Elements Overview page

By clicking on the horizontal three-dots menu of an Insight card, you can now directly check what **filters** are applied to the card, access a **link to the application** from which the card was created or **refresh** the card after default values have been modified.

New functionalities added to an Insight card

We hope you will enjoy the new features of *My Home* in SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2302, public edition, designed to provide you access to everything you need to do your job with speed and agility.
