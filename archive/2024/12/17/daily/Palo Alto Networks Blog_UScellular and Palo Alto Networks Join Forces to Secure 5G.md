Remember when securing your network meant throwing up a firewall and calling it a day? Well, the cellular network industry has evolved, and so have the threats. A decade back, UScellular’s quest for IT security solutions ignited a long-standing partnership with Palo Alto Networks. Now, UScellular and Palo Alto Networks are teaming up once again to tackle the ever-growing security challenges of LTE, 5G and Gi-LAN networks.

What’s the twist? Palo Alto Networks [Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)](/network-security/next-generation-firewall) go beyond the internet perimeter, providing comprehensive visibility and real-time threat mitigation for both UScellular’s high-capacity network interfaces and its customers. This isn’t just about throwing hardware at the issue. Palo Alto Networks leverages its innovative [Zero Trust approach](/zero-trust), a security framework that extends beyond the traditional network edge to bring best-in-class security to business- and mission-critical applications in 5G environments.

Discover how this powerful partnership is pushing the boundaries of network security and preparing for the secure future of 5G.

## Unlocking 5G’s Potential — Why Partnering With Palo Alto Networks Is the Key

UScellular wasn't taking any chances when choosing a partner to protect its critical LTE and 5G environments. After an extensive evaluation process, they selected Palo Alto Networks for our leading-edge expertise and comprehensive security solutions.

First, Palo Alto Networks NGFWs, specifically PA-7080 models, are ideally suited for Gi-LAN environments. Second, the leading position of Palo Alto Networks in 5G security is a significant draw. Our cutting-edge technology, including advanced AI, proactive threat mitigation and seamless scalability, aligns with UScellular’s evolving needs. By leveraging these innovative features, UScellular can confidently navigate the rapidly shifting landscape of 5G security. Mike Sweeney, vice president of enterprise infrastructure and security for UScellular, said:

“The privacy and security of our customers’ data is a top priority for us, and it’s imperative to build security into our networks from the ground up. We look forward to continuing our extensive collaboration with Palo Alto Networks, to ensure our network and our customers’ data remains secure.”​​

## Securing Your Foundation in the Face of New Threats

As 5G networks unlock new possibilities, they also introduce heightened security challenges. With an expanded attack surface and the proliferation of IoT/OT devices, organizations face escalating threats from sophisticated cyber attacks. What further raises the stakes is the increased complexity of the networks, distributed cloud environments and increased dependence on automation and orchestration. Sophisticated and evasive cyber attacks are on the rise, with nation-states and cyber criminals intensifying their efforts against organizations and critical infrastructure, motivated by gaining access to more information:

* Critical enterprise applications
* Customer data
* Real-time location data
* Mobile devices
* Access to enterprise customers’ IT environments
* Disruption of critical business processes
* Disruption of national telecom infrastructure

Security can't be an afterthought. Building security into 5G networks from the ground up is imperative. The Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) ensures comprehensive visibility and offers five nines availability, providing robust support for mission-critical workloads and emergency services on 5G networks. With efficient scaling capabilities tailored for the most demanding use cases, it contributes to seamless business continuity. Additionally, its platform approach minimizes operational overhead and lowers the total cost of ownership (TCO).

* **Five-Nines Availability:** The PA-7080 supports mission-critical workloads and emergency services on 5G, and it ensures business continuity.
* **Efficient Scaling**: Highly scalable next-gen firewalls tailored for demanding environments ensure seamless growth alongside network expansion.
* **Platform Approach:** Delivering essential functionality for mobile network deployments, the PA-7080 offers critical security capabilities for 5G infrastructure protection and advanced threat mitigation.
* **Operational Simplicity**: With Panorama, managing and operating firewalls across multiple sites is streamlined, enhancing operational efficiency.
