# ‘House of the Dragon’ Is The Most Pirated TV Show of 2024

'House of the Dragon' is the most-pirated TV show released on torrent sites in 2024. The popular 'Game of Thrones' prequel replaces 'The Last of Us', which topped the chart last year. Amazon's 'The Boys' takes the second spot at a respectable distance, while Disney's Shōgun is the hottest newcomer.

At the end of every year, we take a look at the most-downloaded TV shows among torrenting pirates.

For several years in a row, the list was [headed by Game of Thrones](https://torrentfreak.com/game-of-thrones-is-the-most-torrented-tv-show-of-2019-191228/), but that reign came to an after the final season.

In the years that followed, Disney+ releases stepped in to fill the void, with ‘Wandavision’ and ‘The Mandalorian’ taking wins in 2020 and 2021 respectively. This takeover didn’t last very long, however, as HBO Max’s ‘Game of Thrones’ prequel ‘House of the Dragon’ snatched the title [in 2022](https://torrentfreak.com/house-of-the-dragon-is-the-most-pirated-tv-show-of-2022/).

With no dragon-themed series in the mix, HBO’s post-apocalyptic drama ‘The Last of Us’ snatched [the title last year](https://torrentfreak.com/the-last-of-us-is-the-most-pirated-tv-show-of-2023-231225/). That change didn’t last, however, as the Dragons came out on top again this year.

While ‘House of the Dragon’ faced stiff competition from ‘Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ two years ago, it easily secured the top spot this year. Surprisingly, Amazon’s Tolkien-inspired series barely cracked the top 10.

Amazon did get an entry in the top three with The Boys in second place, followed by Disney’s historical drama series Shōgun.

Interestingly, all other entries in the top 10, including Netflix’s massively popular animated series Arcane, come from major streaming platforms. This marks a shift from last year when no Netflix shows made the list.

Last year, we theorized that, as the leading streaming service, Netflix was less susceptible to [‘complementary’ piracy](https://torrentfreak.com/could-piracy-help-netflix-win-the-streaming-wars-240108/) than its competitors. That argument may still hold, but Netflix certainly isn’t immune to it.

In closing, we should note that the chart is based on BitTorrent traffic, which represents a small portion of the piracy landscape. Most people use streaming sites and services nowadays, which generally do not report viewing stats.
