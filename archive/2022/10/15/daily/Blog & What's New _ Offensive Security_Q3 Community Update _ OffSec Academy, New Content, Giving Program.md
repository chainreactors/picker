##### Latest News

Since our update last quarter, so much has happened! We are excited to share all of the new features, products, services, and events that have occured this last quarter. This blog will update you on how OffSec supports and informs students transitioning into cybersecurity training and beyond through collaboration with organizations, community events, live streams, and much more.

##### Giving Program

We are pleased to announce that our Giving program has a new name: CyberDiversity in Action! Representing how the company supports non-profits, organizations and foundations focused on bridging the diversity gap in cybersecurity and information security worldwide. The program provides orgs free PWK courses to help individuals from under-represented groups such as women, blacks, LGBTQIA+, Latinx, low-income, disabled, and indigenous people the opportunity to enter the field of information security and thrive. OffSec is proud to present the new logo for the CyberDiversity in Action, as it will help organizations identify the cause of the giving program.Â  We thank our community for your hard work and dedication, ensuring everyone has a chance to work in cybersecurity.

##### Conferences and Community Events

The OffSec team has attended and/or sponsored the following conferences over the last quarter:

* [BSides Charlotte, NC](https://www.bsidesclt.org/)
* [ThreatCon](https://threatcon.io/)
* [Women in Cybersecurity Middle East](https://www.womenincybersecurity.me/)
* [Red Team Village](https://redteamvillage.io/)
* [Blackhat 2022 Conference, Las Vegas, NV](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/training/schedule/#advanced-windows-exploitation-26449)
* [Adversary Village Panel at DefCon, Las Vegas, NV](https://adversaryvillage.org/adversary-events/DEFCON-30/)
* [502 project](https://www.usf.edu/education/about-us/usf-cybercamp.aspx)

OffSec has been very vocal in the cybersecurity community and supports many groups within the information security community with education, mentorship, and resources.Â  OffSec sponsors organizations that create opportunities for the community to grow their networks and leverage information security to advance their careers.

We sponsored the BSides Charlotte conference in North Carolina, US, with free OSCP vouchers and a hackers conference called ThreatCon, giving people the opportunity to enter the cybersecurity field. The Women in Cybersecurity Middle East group dedicated to increasing women’s participation in cybersecurity received OSCP vouchers for their upcoming CTF event in November as a prize for the winning team. We supported another CTF event hosted by a content creator named [Alh4zr3d](https://twitter.com/alh4zr3d).

OffSec has also sponsored the Red Team Village (RTV). This organization provides workshops in offensive security and CTF events to professionals in the community with OffSec vouchers. We are proud to be a part of the community we serve.

August was an exciting time for our team members with the annual summer hackers camp in Las Vegas, USA.Â  Ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals from around the world gathered at the famous hacking conference at Blackhat.Â  Over the four days, cybersecurity professionals received excellent training at our sold-out in-person courses on Advanced Windows Exploitation (AWE) and [Penetration Testing with Kali Linux](https://www.blackhat.com/us-22/training/schedule/#penetration-testing-with-kali-linux-26452) taught by OffSecâs expert instructors. Attendees also had the opportunity to speak with the community team members at the booth to ask technical questions and receive some swag.Â  OffSec’s speaker, TJNULL, joined the Adversary Village panel of speakers at the biggest hacking conference in the world, DefCon, to share the preparation guidelines for the OSCP/PWK PEN-200 course with the community.Â  Thanks to our exceptional group of trainers, speakers, and team members for engaging and providing information to a wide range of people interested in information security.

OffSec has responded to the growing need to prepare the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. Over the summer, OffSec collaborated with the 502 Project, which allows high school students to explore the field and learn cybersecurity principles to consider furthering their studies after graduation. We want to thank our two community moderators, Tristam and Omeganeth, for speaking to the students in a cyber panel about their careers and why they got into cybersecurity at the Cyber summer camp at Miami Senior High School earlier this summer.

##### Online Events

The OffSec community provides a space online for people to share information, host discussions, podcasts, and even contests and giveaways by moderators:

##### OffSec Academy:

PEN-200 offers weekly live Zoom sessions on Penetration Testing with Kali Linux to students registered in the PWK course. The Academy is facilitated by OffSec instructors to enhance students learning experience as they prepare for the OSCP exam. OffSec Academy airs every Wednesday at 12PM ET via Zoom for those registered for the PEN-200 course, including alumni. Take part, get more value out of the course, speak with instructors, and connect with former students.Â [Register](https://learn.offensive-security.com/offsec-academy) for the OffSec Academy: PEN-200 training stream sessions on Zoom.

##### OffSec LIVE

is a series of free streams that cover a variety of OffSec’s courses and general topics for students and the public. Expert instructors will provide review sessions and brief demonstrations on each course offered by OffSec. Other subject areas taught include how to break into a career in cybersecurity, which certificate to select, and resume writing tips, to name a few. These sessions provide additional opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, communication, and networking, all while gaining valuable employment skills.

OffSec LIVE airs every Friday at 5PM ET on Twitch for anyone interested in considering a career in cybersecurity, students and alums. Take advantage of this valuable opportunity and join the conversations with our instructors and connect with others to gain preparedness for your career in cybersecurity. [Check out](https://www.twitch.tv/offsecofficial) our next session.

##### Office Hour

This quarter we have tried something a little different for the online community on the Discord server. In addition to streaming the Office Hour on Discord, it is now available for a live stream on the Twitch channel. Closed captioning is available on the Twitch channel for those whose English is their second language.

Our student companions at Offensive Security provide online contests and extracurricular activities. On the OffSec Discord server in August, moderators set up a BBQ and recipe competition for users in the #food-and-recipes channel. Five winners were selected for submitting the best recipes and got some OffSec swag.

##### New Subreddit

OffSec has entered the Reddit space with the launch of the [r/offensive-security](https://www.reddit.com/...
