## NordVPN vs Private Internet Access Reviews – The Comparison

In our comparison today, we looked into several important aspects listed below:

1. Servers and Network
2. Speed
3. Streaming
4. Torrenting
5. Ease of Use
6. Compatibility
7. Jurisdiction
8. Privacy
9. Security

### 1. NordVPN vs Private Internet Access – What are the available servers and network?

**Number of Servers**

A VPN service is really as good as the number of servers available for users to connect to. All the best VPNs can afford to maintain a huge server and IP address park. This way the users can be evenly distributed among the servers to maintain speed and stability.

As of today, NordVPN is packed with more than 5,600 servers while PIA is at 3,375. [Does Private Internet Access work?](https://www.suspek.org/private-internet-access-vpn/) While NordVPN wins in this category by a huge margin, PIA is still one of the top VPNs in terms of number of servers.

**Number of Countries**

The servers locations offered by Private Internet Access or IPVanish must be considered, to allow great internet accessibility to their uses.. Generally, most VPN users prefer to hide their IP addresses, however, there is still a significant number of netizens that need an IP based in an “obscure” state such as in the case of accessing location restricted media content.

NordVPN supports 60 different countries while Private Internet Access has 32. Below is a list of countries available on NordVPN but not on Private Internet Access.

| Albania | Indonesia | Turkey | Vietnam |
| Bulgaria | Moldova | Bosnia and Herzegovina | Costa Rica |
| Cyprus | Serbia | Argentina | Croatia Greece |
| Egypt | South Korea | Chile | Iceland |
| Georgia | Latvia | Slovakia | Malaysia |
| Estonia | North Macedonia | Taiwan | Portugal |
| Slovenia | Thailand | ​ | ​ |

### **2. Private Internet Access vs NordVPN - Which is faster?**

Private Internet Access and NordVPN have decent speed test results which, all speed tests were conducted using OpenVPN with AES-256 encryption and my baseline speed was at approximately 160 Mbps.

I tested out the server download speeds and connection speeds through speed tests in several locations as listed below::

| **Country** | ****NordVPN**** | | ****Private Internet Access**** | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ​ | Download  (Mbps) | Upload  (Mbps) | Download  (Mbps) | Upload  (Mbps) |
| UK | 150.0 | 9.6 | 65.7 | 8.3 |
| Switzerland | 150.8 | 9.5 | 85.1 | 9.3 |
| New York | 148.7 | 9.3 | 63.2 | 7.7 |

Overall, NordVPN offers much almost double the download speed of PIA across different countries. This could partly be due to NordVPN’s larger server network as compared to Private Internet Access. If performance is your top priority, NordVPN may be the better option to go for.

### 3. NordVPN vs PIA – Which is more ideal to access Netflix & streaming?

If you are a major Netflix lover, you’d be curious on the capability of your VPN in streaming services. Fortunately, NordVPN is able to access US Netflix without any issues but I still get redirected to an error page when I open Netflix through PIA. In any case, streaming Netflix through a VPN is often hit-or-miss as there are only a handful of VPN services that unblock Netflix.

NordVPN proves to be a better pick for Netflix fans as it works effortlessly to unblock content in the US, UK, Canada, France, Japan, and Brazil. This provider is well-equipped for consistent streaming with their great choice of servers and proprietary SmartPlay DNS feature.

Overall, NordVPN unblocks a large number of streaming services, both in the US and internationally, which includes Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, and others.

Private Internet Access does not reliably block any of the streaming services, although some of their servers do provide access to Netflix at random times. All-in-all, it’s not the VPN to go for if you’re looking to stream media.

### 4. NordVPN vs PIA – Which offers better Torrenting accessibility?

The great news is that NordVPN and PIA allow P2P connections on their servers. With that said, NordVPN has a quality-of-life torrenting feature that is not present in PIA. This makes it one of the [best VPN for torrenting](https://www.suspek.org/best-vpn-for-torrenting/). You can find a separate tab in their app for you to choose from more than 4,400 servers to connect to.

PIA, on the other hand, is a little more spartan. Though you can still connect to any server for secure torrenting, their P2P-optimized servers mean the VPN silently reroutes your connection if P2P traffic is detected. The resulting double-hopping will likely slow your connection down and it is still better to pick the right server from the very start.
