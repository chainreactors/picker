Medical device and software maker Zoll Medical says the personal and health information of more than a million people, including patients and employees, may have been stolen by crooks in January.

In [documents](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ab192c35-667d-4bc9-ad18-fa710bd10b15.shtml) submitted to officials in US states, and letters sent out to those people affected, Zoll said that on January 28 the biz detected "unusual activity" on its internal network and confirmed an intrusion on February 2.

The data that could have been pored over or exfiltrated includes the names, addresses, birth dates, and Social Security numbers of current and former employees and patients, they wrote in a March 10 letter which is included in the state filings. In addition, miscreants seeing this information may be able to infer that some of those people either used or considered using a Zoll product, the LifeVest wearable cardioverter defibrillator.
