## First Sentencing in Scheme to Help North Koreans Infiltrate US Companies

An Arizona woman was [sentenced](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/arizona-woman-sentenced-17m-information-technology-worker-fraud-scheme-generated-revenue) to eight-and-a-half years in prison for her role helping North Korean workers infiltrate US companies by pretending to be US workers.

From an [article](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-woman-sentenced-to-8-years-in-prison-for-running-laptop-farm-helping-north-koreans-infiltrate-300-firms/):

> According to [court documents](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1352191/dl), Chapman hosted the North Korean IT workers’ computers in her own home between October 2020 and October 2023, creating a so-called “laptop farm” which was used to make it appear as though the devices were located in the United States.
>
> The North Koreans were hired as remote software and application developers with multiple Fortune 500 companies, including an aerospace and defense company, a major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, and a high-profile company.
>
> As a result of this scheme, they collected over $17 million in illicit revenue paid for their work, which was shared with Chapman, who processed their paychecks through her financial accounts.
>
> “Chapman operated a ‘laptop farm’ where she received and hosted computers from the U.S. companies her home, so that the companies would believe the workers were in the United States,” the Justice Department [said](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/arizona-woman-sentenced-17m-it-worker-fraud-scheme-illegally-generated-revenue-north) on Thursday.
>
> “Chapman also shipped 49 laptops and other devices supplied by U.S. companies to locations overseas, including multiple shipments to a city in China on the border with North Korea. More than 90 laptops were seized from Chapman’s home following the execution of a search warrant in October 2023.”

The quotes are obviously from a US Gov mouthpiece.

The thing is it’s actually “political kangeroo courting” rather than something that a whole bunch of agencies employing “India workers” are not already doing and have done for years.

The fact is most of the work was not anything other than doing a job remotely like thousands of others.

The fun thing if you think about it is Microsoft and Chinese remote workers… Do people think that Microsoft senior managers and C-Suit critters are going to go to jail?

Arizona: frequently jealous of Florida Man and wanting to get back in the running.

(Spoken as a former Zonie who worked IT for Phoenix PD for the better part of a decade. Yes, I have plenty of stories.)

After a casual reference to UN sanctions, and the possibility of cyber intrusion, the main charges laid are the old tried and trusted: Wire Fraud, and Conspiracy to commit Fraud.

And the alleged conspirators include: Chapman, one named Korean, and FOUR Chinese.

Two more Chinese have been charged in a separate case, where Nvidia H100s were purchased from Super Micro and shipped to an allegedly non-existent address in Singapore.

ב”ה,

Korea can simply announce its arm was twisted on Capitalism, they have seen the light, and nuclear weapons are now available to the highest bidder.
