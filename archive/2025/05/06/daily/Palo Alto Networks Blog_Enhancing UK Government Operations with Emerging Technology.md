# **Spotlight on Prisma Access Browser (PAB)**

In today's advanced digital environment, public sector organisations face the dual challenge of maintaining security and enhancing efficiency amid growing cyberthreats. These threats are increasing in complexity, and with employees spread across various locations, protecting sensitive data while facilitating team collaboration is crucial. This situation leaves key applications, systems and data vulnerable to significantly increasing security risks. Additionally, shifts in user interaction with technology bring both new challenges and opportunities.

To effectively manage these changes and their impact on cybersecurity, public sector entities must adapt. Prisma® Access Browser (PAB) emerges as a key solution, designed specifically for these challenges. It provides critical support in areas such as controlled access, remote working, governance and operational visibility.

### 1. Controlled Access to Critical Applications

The importance of rigorous access controls in government operations is pivotal. PAB enhances security by ensuring that access to sensitive applications is both secure and restricted. By integrating multifactor authentication (MFA) and creating a cloud-based, isolated browsing environment, PAB effectively prevents direct interactions between the internet, applications and user devices. This setup, which includes browser isolation technology, significantly reduces the risk of malware attacks, thus protecting critical government applications from unauthorized access and cyberthreats. This feature empowers government entities to manage access to sensitive systems, such as tax or health records, and curtail the use of unauthorized applications, helping reduce the risks associated with shadow IT.

### 2. Remote Working and BYOD

The shift toward remote working and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies has introduced complex cybersecurity challenges. PAB addresses these by providing secure remote access to sensitive data and applications without the need for traditional VPN or mobile device management (MDM) solutions. Browser isolation ensures consistent secure access regardless of the device's security status, whether it's a personal laptop or mobile device. Furthermore, Privileged Access Controls enhance security by enforcing granular policies for SSH and Remote Desktop Protocols through a secure browser. This system not only boosts productivity and flexibility but also adheres to the stringent security standards necessary for government operations. Significantly, it also allows cost savings as contractors can use their own devices to access government systems, eliminating the need for government-issued laptops.

### 3. Governance and Compliance

Complying with standards, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and following guidelines, such as the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF), is mandatory for government bodies. PAB aids in meeting these requirements by providing data encryption, comprehensive logging, auditing and stringent access controls. Such features enhance auditing and reporting, helping organisations maintain transparency and meet strict regulatory demands. Moreover, PAB's built-in security functions, including data loss prevention and risk mitigation, enable proactive rather than merely reactive governance.

### 4. Visibility and Control

Operational visibility and control are essential for robust security management, especially in complex government networks. PAB stands out by offering administrators detailed control over web access and in-depth insights into user behavior. It enhances visibility and management for applications, like M365 or those on the QUIC protocol, providing browser-level inspection without the complexities of network-level scrutiny. The centralised dashboard supports real-time monitoring and swift action on suspicious activities, enabling IT teams to enforce strict security measures and efficiently manage web access policies inline with established security standards.

## **PAB for Digital Government Operations**

As the UK government modernizes its operations, the integration of advanced technologies, like Prisma Access Browser (PAB), is becoming essential. PAB not only bolsters the security framework of government agencies but also meets their operational demands by providing flexibility, compliance and control. By incorporating PAB into their cybersecurity strategy, UK government agencies can confidently tackle digital complexities while upholding public service integrity and trust.

For Public Sector IT leaders aiming to improve their cybersecurity framework and promote a flexible, compliant work environment, it is crucial to prioritise PAB. Investing in such innovative solutions sets the standard for secure, efficient and resilient digital government operations.
