Cyber Security Awareness Month: Cyber tune-up checklist

by Nicole Beaudoin | October 1, 2025 | Threat Lab

*Reading Time: 4mins*

October is the month for pumpkin spice and all things spooky. But protecting your personal information online doesn’t need to be scary. For more than 20 years now, October has also been recognized as [Cybersecurity Awareness Month](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month).

In our digitally connected world, apps and online accounts can make our lives much more convenient. Sadly, they can also make our personal data more vulnerable to cyber threats. Each year, a shocking number of people become victims of sophisticated cyberattacks. In one recent data breach, [TransUnion announced  4.4 million consumers'](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/transunion-says-44-million-consumers-data-compromised-hack-2025-08-28/) data compromised in a hack involving a third party.

Created by the National Security Division within the Department of Homeland Security and the National Cyber Security Alliance, Cyber Security Awareness Month promotes online safety and security for both individuals and small businesses. Its theme is *Secure Our World*, and its mission is to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and showcase some of the easy ways we can all protect our identities, devices, and data

**Password best practices**

One of the best ways to keep your personal data out of the hands of hackers is also one of the simplest. Create strong passwords. Here are some tips for creating unbreakable passwords.

* **Keep it complicated**
  We juggle so many passwords; it’s tempting to use something easy to remember. Unfortunately, using “12345” or “Password” just doesn’t cut it anymore. Each of your passwords needs to incorporate numbers, symbols and capital letters, use at least 16 characters. Do not use your pet’s name!
* **Use a password manager**
  Keeping track of complex passwords for each of your accounts can seem overwhelming, but a password manager offers a simple and safe solution. Quality password managers like the one included with [Webroot Total Protection](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection) will generate, store and encrypt all your passwords, requiring you to only remember one password.
* **Turn on multi-factor authentication**
  Using [multi-factor authentication](https://www.staysafeonline.org/articles/multi-factor-authentication) adds a layer of security to your passwords by having you prove your identity in multiple ways. This means getting a text or email with a security code or answering a security question.

**Identifying phishing scams**

[Phishing scams](https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=003740525869091321116:i9-usfjt4ve&q=https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-phishing&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwji-9nsqtyIAxV7NmIAHc-JBCEQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Iae11z7t9ER5PIKMxdSI1) appear in our email inboxes, text messages and even voicemails on a daily basis. Designed to trick you into giving up your personal and financial information, knowledge is power when identifying what is real and what is in fact, fake.

According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/07/31/online-scams-and-attacks-in-america-today/) a  majority of U.S. adults report getting scam phone calls (68%), emails (63%) or text messages (61%) at least weekly.

* **Urgent requests**
  Beware of messages that demand immediate action and threaten consequences if you don’t respond.
* **Suspicious email domains**
  If an email is really from your bank, the address should contain the official domain name (e.g., noreply@yourbank.com.) Authentic company emails do not usually come from addresses like @gmail.com.
* **Poor grammar**
  If an email contains awkward phrases, misspellings, and grammatical errors, it probably didn’t come from a legitimate company.
* **Generic greetings**
  Your bank is probably never going to address you as “Dear Customer”. They know your name, and if they’re really trying to contact you, they’re going to use it.

If you think you’ve been a target of phishing, you can report it at reportphishing@apwg.org. For added safety, products such as  [Webroot Total Protection](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection)will protect you from identity theft, safeguard your devices, and keep your personal and financial data out of the hands of cyber thieves.
