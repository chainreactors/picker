* README

# xortool.py

A tool to do some xor analysis:

* guess the key length (based on count of equal chars)
* guess the key (base on knowledge of most frequent char)

**Notice:** xortool is now only running on Python 3. The old Python 2 version is accessible at the `py2` branch. The **pip** package has been updated.

## Installation

```
$ pip3 install xortool
```

For development or building this repository, [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is needed.

```
poetry build
pip install dist/xortool*.whl
```
