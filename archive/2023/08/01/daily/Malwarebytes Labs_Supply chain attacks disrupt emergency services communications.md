# Supply chain attacks disrupt emergency services communications

Posted: July 31, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A supply chain attack rendered two ambulance trusts [incapable of accessing electronic patient records in the UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-66315690). The two services, which operate in a region of 12 million people, were not targeted directly. Instead, the attack was aimed at a third-party technology provider used by both the South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) and the South Western Ambulance Service (SWASFT).

According to reports, the systems were attacked [sometime on the evening of July 18](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/supply-chain-attack-hits-nhs/), impacting “customer systems within its hosted datacentre environment”.

The targeted organisation, Ortivus, has the following to say in a [statement regarding the attack](https://www.ortivus.com/mfn_news/ortivus-electronic-patient-record-system-are-down-for-some-united-kingdom-based-customers-due-to-a-cyber-attack/):

> The electronic patient records are currently unavailable and are until further notice handled using manual systems. No patients have been directly affected. No other systems have been attacked and no customers outside of those in the hosted datacenter have been affected.
>
> Ortivus are currently working in close collaboration with the affected customers to restore the systems and recover data. The affected customers are the ones using MobiMed ePR, electronic patient record systems in a hosted environment.
>
> The organization behind the cyber-attack is not known at this stage and the incident has been reported to the authorities as a crime.

The targeted platform is called [MobiMed](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ORTIVUS-AB-PUBL-30049549/news/Ortivus-electronic-patient-record-system-are-down-for-some-United-Kingdom-based-customers-due-to-a-44365777/). This is a “modular platform that connects and enable(s) real-time information sharing throughout the prehospital care chain”. It is claimed to be used by “over 12,000 paramedics in over 2,700 emergency vehicles”.

To lose access to patient record data under these conditions is clearly far from ideal. The Register reports that healthcare workers are [having to resort to pen and paper](https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/26/uk_ambulance_services_cyber_attack/), alongside staff being warned of the potential for [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attacks.

While there is a backup system able to take MobiMed’s place “within 24 hours” of an attack, integration with other systems is not 100%. Until a full analysis of the attack has taken place, the backup system will remain in place.

Regular readers of the blog will know of the chaos that [accompanies attacks on healthcare providers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/summer-of-exploitation-leads-to-healthcare-under-fire). If crucial systems are compromised, people’s lives are put at risk. It’s something of a hot-button issue for [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) authors, to the extent that some of them will [apologise and offer up free decryption tools](https://www.csoonline.com/article/574271/lockbit-apologizes-for-ransomware-attack-on-hospital-offers-decryptor.html#:~:text=LockBit%2C%20a%20prominent%20ransomware%2Das,and%20offered%20a%20free%20decryptor.). They have calcul...
