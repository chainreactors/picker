# Russian Missile Identified in Kyiv Children’s Hospital Attack

July 9, 2024

An analysis of open source evidence, as well as missile experts, have pointed to a Russian launched Kh-101 cruise missile being the weapon that struck a children’s hospital in Kyiv, debunking claims from pro-Russian accounts and actors that denied responsibility and sought to shift the blame for the incident on to Ukraine.

The July 8 attack on the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital [killed two](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/7qtQnWmyiTiwJ19F/) and injured over 50 others, according to the hospital. However, the full toll of dead and injured remains unknown with individuals [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/08/rescuers-search-rubble-of-kyiv-childrens-hospital-after-russian-missile-attack-in-ukraine) to still be trapped under rubble.

In the aftermath of the strike, several social media accounts known for spreading disinformation — including that of the [Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://x.com/mfa_russia/status/1810307880244965438) — began to claim that the missile was American-made and that it had been launched from a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system.

Yet an analysis conducted by Bellingcat using social media footage as well as  a 3D model of the missile, all point to the munition being a [Russian Kh-101 cruise missile](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/kh-101-kh-102/). The analysis is in line with the view of experts, including [Fabian Hoffman](https://x.com/FRHoffmann1/status/1810350033616732653), a doctoral research fellow at the University of Oslo who specialises in missile technology.

Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons and missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California, similarly concluded in an email to Bellingcat that a Kh-101 missile could be seen in footage of the attack posted to social media sites.

Bellingcat also tested an alternative theory floated online that the missile was a US-made AIM-120, but found no evidence for this.

The hospital attack came as part of a wider Russian missile barrage that hit civilian targets elsewhere in Ukraine, including the city of Dnipro. According to [the Ukrainian Air Force](https://t.me/kpszsu/16341), the attack began at approximately 10:00 AM local time and involved at least 36 missiles, including 13 Kh-101 cruise missiles.

## **Analysing the Missile Strike Footage**

Shortly before noon, [reports began to surface](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56544) claiming that there had been an explosion at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital. These reports were followed by video footage posted to Telegram showing a missile impacting the hospital.

A *screenshot from a video from a* [*Telegram channel*](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56581) *showing the missile near the moment of impact at* [*the hospital*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B027%2702.4%22N%2B30%C2%B028%2753.8%22E/%4050.450675%5B%E2%80%A6%5Ddata%3D%213m1%214b1%214m4%213m3%218m2%213d50.4506754%214d30.4816207?entry=ttu)*(Source:*[*Telegram*](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56581)*)*

The video clearly captured the missile that impacted the hospital. The following frames of the missile were taken from the video above.

*The image collage above was made using four screenshots from* [*the video*](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56581) *shared previously. It shows the missile an instant before it hits the hospital (Source:*[*Telegram*](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/56581)*)*

The missile exhibits several characteristics, including the presence of what appears to be a jet engine at its rear as well as two short wings near the middle of the missile.

These are distinct features of the [Kh-101](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/kh-101-kh-102/), a cruise missile used exclusively by the Russian armed forces. A comparison of a screenshot of the missile that hit the hospital with a 3D rendering of a Kh-101 missile shows that the two indeed share these features.
