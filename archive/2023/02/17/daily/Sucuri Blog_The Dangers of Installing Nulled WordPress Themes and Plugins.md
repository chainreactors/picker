Nulled WordPress themes and plugins are a controversial topic for many in the web development world — and arguably one of the bigger threats to WordPress security.

Essentially modified versions of official WordPress themes and plugins with their licensing restrictions removed, these nulled software copies are often touted as premium functionality packaged in a free download. Nulled components can attract webmasters looking to save money and cut costs, as many premium themes and plugins can be expensive.

However, installing nulled themes or plugins on your website is not only participating in software theft; it can also introduce serious risks — including [malware](https://sucuri.net/guides/website-malware/), [SEO spam](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/12/seo-spam-links-in-nulled-plugins.html), and [website backdoors](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/examining-emerging-backdoors.html). As a result, these “free software downloads” may end up costing your website and pocketbook a lot more in the long run.

Let’s take a look at some of the dangers involved in using nulled versions over official releases and examine a recent example of malware found in a nulled plugin.

## What are nulled themes and plugins?

Also sometimes referred to as “cracked” or “pirated” software, nulled themes and plugins are an altered version of the premium component that has had its licensing restrictions and limitations removed.

While these free versions may be attractive to website owners looking to save a buck, the dangers of using them far outweigh any benefits. These altered versions may be compromised and contain security vulnerabilities or technical issues that can put you, your customers and visitors, and your website at risk. The user will also not receive updates or support of any kind from the original developer.

## Why do people use nulled themes and plugins on WordPress?

Some webmasters choose to use nulled themes and plugins to save money on website development, as many premium themes and plugins can be expensive. Others may not know there are risks involved. They may believe they are downloading a safe, legitimate copy not realizing the dangers involved in doing so.

## What are the risks of using nulled themes and plugins?

When using nulled WordPress themes and plugins, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved. Below, we’ll discuss security risks and some technical issues you might encounter.

### Security risks:

1. **Backdoor access:** In some cases, nulled themes and plugins contain hidden backdoors that allow unauthorized access to your website. Hackers can leverage backdoors to steal sensitive information including financial details, customer data, and login credentials. Backdoors can also be used to perform a wide range of malicious activities including [black hat seo](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/02/what-is-black-hat-seo.html), injected malware or credit card stealers, [spam doorways](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/07/spam-doorway-manager.html), or even generating new malicious users.
2. **Vulnerabilities:** Nulled themes and plugins may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers to spread malware and gain unauthorized access to your website.
3. **Malware:** Malware is often found concealed within nulled software, which can harm your website and infect your computer. Malware can also spread to your customers’ computers and other devices causing potential harm and negatively impacting your reputation.
4. **SEO spam and ads:** Attackers often monetize nulled themes and plugins by injecting hidden links to shady sites or scripts for unwanted ads.

### Technical issues:

1. **Compatibility problems:** Nulled themes and plugins may not be compatible with the latest version of WordPress or with other themes and plugins you are using. Using them runs the risk of technical issues and broken functionality.
2. **Lack of updates:** Nulled themes and plugins do not receive regular updates from the original developer, which means that th...
