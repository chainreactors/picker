In its continued push to provide their Public Cloud Acceleration Partners with all the tools they need to be successful, the North America Partner Solution Adoption team held an in-person Demo Readiness Workshop in Miami during the first week of March.

In attendance were 30 individuals from 10 different Partners, with varying degrees of experience and knowledge. The objectives of the workshop were to position the participants to be able to proceed toward Presales Validation with adequate knowledge of a variety of demo topics, including:
• Understanding of Cloud Mindset, SAP Activate Methodology and Best Practices
• Understanding of localization approach
• Understanding Fit-2-Standard approach (not fit gap)
• Understanding of SAP S/4HANA Cloud landscape architecture
• Guidance, assets and resources to enhance demo skills
• Demo resources available including systems and tools
• Support options
• Tips and Tricks for an effective customer demo

Participants also has an opportunity to practice what they learned. They were all grouped into teams and each individual participated in delivering a demo of a supplied product demo script; feedback was given afterward.
