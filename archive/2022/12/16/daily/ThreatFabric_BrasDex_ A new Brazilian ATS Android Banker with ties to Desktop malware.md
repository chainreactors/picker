## BrasDex: A new Brazilian ATS Android Banker with ties to Desktop malware

## A varied and wild landscape

The mobile malware landscape of the LATAM region, more specifically Brazil, has recently risen to prominence in the news due to families like Brata and Amextroll, extending their reach all the way to Europe. [ThreatFabric has already reported in length about these families](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/brata-a-tale-of-three-families.html). However, not all malware developed in South America targets the European market.

In fact, ThreatFabric analysts discovered an ongoing multi-platform malware campaign, targeting both mobile and desktop Brazilian users, with thousands of infections and with an **estimated loss of hundreds of thousands of Brazilian Reals (R$), which corresponds to tens of thousands of USD**.

This campaign involves a highly flexible novel Android malware dubbed **BrasDex** by ThreatFabric, featuring a complex keylogging system designed to abuse Accessibility Services to extract credentials specifically from a set of Brazilian targeted apps, as well as a highly capable Automated Transfer System (ATS) engine.

When analyzing BrasDex, our team found the evidence of some desktop malware controlled through the same backend. Our analysts were able to identify the malware samples related to the same campaign targeting Brazilian users as well: it involves [Casbaneiro](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/10/03/casbaneiro-trojan-dangerous-cooking/), a well-known malware family known to be active in Latin America.

## BrasDex: a trend switch away from overlay attacks

The malware has been active for more than a year, initially posing as Android settings applications and targeting Brazilian banking applications. In its latest campaign, it started posing as one specific Banking application (Banco Santander BR), but continuing to target the same subset of applications as its previous versions.

BrasDex abuses accessibility services to keylog the information that is input in the target application, veering away from the traditional overlay attack mechanism that we have observed for years now, towards what seems to be the next standard in Android banking malware.

This follows a trend that we have started to see in the past year, where different malware families have started abandoning the use of overlays, which require continuous update and additional downloaded data, in favour of more lean and flexible solutions. For example, in the case of Vultur this solution was to perform screen-recording and subsequently accessibility logging, in the case of Cabassous it was to load the real target login page in a browser controlled by the malware, with JavaScript enabled.

However, in most cases, malware families are starting to rely heavily on accessibility logging to exfiltrate logging credentials and other PII from infected victims. This is also the case for BrasDex. This malware family is able to log not only credentials, but also other important information, like account balance, and then use it to perform a DTO (Device TakeOver), which allows criminals to perform fraudulent transactions using the infected device.

What sets BrasDex apart from many other malware families is its ATS (Automated Transfer System) capabilities. ATS allows malware to programmatically use the information stolen from the victim to initiate fraudulent transactions in an automated way, making the whole infection and fraud chain more flexible and scalable.

ThreatFabric has mentioned ATS before in our blogs, as one of the most dangerous features present in modern day malware, specifically when speaking about Bankers such as Gustuff, the first Banker to implement this technique in 2018, and more recently SharkBot.

## Targets

BrasDex is a malware family strictly focused on the Brazilian market. The malware contains checks to make sure it only operates on devices from Brazil. To do so, it programmatically checks that the SIM used by the device is operating in Brazil, and only then it properly completes its operations and configurations. If the device has a SIM card from anywhere else, the malware shuts down and never contacts its C2 server.

This hard complete dedication to a single market might be motivated by the fact that BrasDex uses its features to abuse one specific subset of transactions within the Brazilian banking ecosystem. BrasDex specifically abuses the [Pix payment system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pix_%28payment_system%29). Pix is a fast payment system from the Central Bank of Brazil that went live in 2020, and allows users to perform payments to other users just by knowing their identifier (which can be an email, CPF, phone number, or random ID).

**NOTE:** **ThreatFabric wants to point out that the Pix system is not vulnerable. Actors are not exploiting any vulnerabilities in the Pix System, but rather abusing the fast payments system and Android known issues to make fraudulent transfers**

Bloomberg referred to the Pix app as “ubiquitous” in Brazil in October 2021, a year after Pix’s release. As of November 2022, Pix has been reported to perform an average of more than 2 million monthly transactions, with a user base of more than 120 million people. **Only in November 2022, Pix was used to perform transactions corresponding to a volume of more than one billion Brazilian Reals (R$), which equals to more than 180 million USD ($)**.

For each targeted bank, the step in the ATS script which is responsible for the actual fraudulent transfer performs it through the Pix technology, not the traditional bank transfer that many other malware families use.

The script will find the UI element corresponding to Pix payments within the banking application, use it to start the transfer procedure, and then navigate through the different screens, selecting the beneficiary and the amount, authenticating with the stolen credentials. This kind of instant payment does not require Multi Factor Authentication, as it can be authorized directly through the banking application itself, making it the perfect target for an Android Banking Malware. We will later cover in detail an example of a transfer procedure with such t...
