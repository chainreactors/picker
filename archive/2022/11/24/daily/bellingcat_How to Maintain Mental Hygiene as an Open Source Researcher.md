# How to Maintain Mental Hygiene as an Open Source Researcher

November 23, 2022

Bellingcat has been overwhelmed with messages from concerned people around the world who want to help us identify and analyse images of potential war crimes taking place in Ukraine. While this increased interest in open source research is encouraging, it comes with costs of which new researchers may not be aware.

Those wishing to conduct open source research into this invasion will be exposed to images that are extremely graphic: they show the painful, disfiguring effects that war has on human bodies, cities and nature. Many of these images can be highly distressing, especially if viewed repeatedly and intensely. But their effect can also be cumulative: you may feel alright for a long time until one day, you don’t. What’s more, even non-graphic images can have a negative impact on you in ways that you may not expect, as I outlined [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gianfiorella/status/1574347677114007558).

All this means that we have to be all the more guarded when we conduct research online.

Practicing good mental hygiene is a continuous process that requires active input at all times. The small steps you take today to minimise and mitigate your exposure to distressing content may in a few years’ time save you from burnout or worse.

Your future self will thank you.

## On Vicarious Trauma and Other Terms

Terminology can make it more difficult to talk about the distress that you might feel when researching content online. Sometimes we don’t have the right words to describe why we’re feeling a certain way, especially when those feelings are having a negative impact on our lives.

The concept of vicarious trauma can be a useful one. In its [“Style Guide for Trauma Informed Journalism”](https://dartcenter.org/resources/dart-center-style-guide), the [Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma](https://dartcenter.org/) defines the term as:

*…psychological challenges resulting from cumulative, empathetic engagement with trauma survivors in a professional context.*

Vicarious trauma initially referred to a psychological risk from prolonged work with traumatised individuals. However, the term has since been [used](https://firstdraftnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/vicarioustrauma.pdf?x11129) by media professionals to refer specifically to the negative responses that journalists may experience through prolonged viewing online of “violent and distressing images… hundreds of thousands of miles away from where the actual horrors occur.”

Even if you are sitting thousands of miles away, these negative responses can be all the more pronounced if you are researching a topic or region with which you have a personal connection.

With that in mind, we’ve become acutely aware of the risks of vicarious trauma in our work.

Back in October 2018, Hannah Ellis published [an article](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2018/10/18/prevent-identify-address-vicarious-trauma-conducting-open-source-investigations-middle-east/) for Bellingcat outlining some steps that you can take to minimise your exposure to vicarious trauma, which she defined as “mental distress [as a result of] interacting with graphic online media.” A [2022 guide for journalists](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/6ca5410e-ac1d-4642-b85f-b717e6a71453/downloads/Vicarious%20Trauma_final.pdf?ver=1668672882671) by Headlines, a foundation to promote mental health in the media and Mind, a leading UK mental health charity, defines the term as “exposure to someone else’s trauma”, and warns that it can affect researchers who “are exposed frequently or repeatedly to traumatic material.”

It’s important to point out that, as you’ll see below, vicarious trauma from exposure to graphic images is not the only potential source of distress to an open source researcher. Exposure to certain sounds, hateful text, or far-right imagery can also have a negative impact on your mental health.

Recently, Bellingcat has worked with the [Dart Centre for Journalism and Trauma](https://dartcenter.org/) to help our researchers build resilience when working with traumatic materials. That means adapting positively to the challenges and stresses of working with distressing content (the American Psychological Association has a more thorough definition of ‘resilience’ [here](https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience/building-your-resilience)).

At Bellingcat, we also [receive psychological support](https://www.tt-intl.org/news/2022/4/25/bellingcat-staff-to-benefit-from-ttis-expert-psychological-services-9exk7) from professionals at Trauma Treatment International. This support includes one-one-one sessions with clinical psychologists who are experts in trauma that is caused by exposure to distressing content online, and is meant to help us avoid burnout, depression, and other negative effects on our mental health.”

## Tips for Building Resilience

Below are some tips that I use and have found helpful to build resilience so that I am able to work with potentially distressing content effectively without sacrificing your mental health and well-being.

While it may not be practically possible to always implement all of these into your workflow, hopefully the list will at least make you aware of some methods available to you.

Please bear in mind that these tips are in no way a substitute for professional medical advice, which you should seek if your work appears to be taking a toll on your mental health.

* **Realise that once you put something in your head, it will be there for the rest of your life**

  There’s simply no way to get a disturbing image or sound out once it’s in there. This is the single most important piece of advice that I can give to someone who is looking to get into the field of open source research and expects to work with potentially distressing content.

  If you stumble across a link to a graphic video online, take a minute and ask yourself: “Do I absolutely have to watch this video?” While the human desire to bear witness to the suffering of others is strong, many times, you’ll find out that the answer is “No”, and you’ll save yourself needless exposure to graphic content.

  Engaging with such content ought to be a deliberate act taken with the same thoughtfulness and care as a police detective about to walk into a crime scene. Unfortunately, the way that content is delivered on the internet is seldom thoughtful or careful, and neither are our browsing habits. By carelessly clicking on Twitter links or scrolling through a Telegram channel, you are bound to eventually come across distressing content. Without the...
