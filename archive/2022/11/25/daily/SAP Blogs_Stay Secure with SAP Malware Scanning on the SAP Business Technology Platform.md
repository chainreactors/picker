The SAP BTP security plane developer team has been working hard in the past months to make the malware scanning functionality available for your applications, which run on the business technology platform. It adds another possibility to be proactive about your security posture.

The malware scanning service enables you to address the challenge of malware. Malicious code can harm your business, from account takeover to stealing data and other forms of cyberattacks. Through the intelligent scanning of documents for malware, you can detect and remove malware before anything catastrophic happens.

This will help you to stay secure and meet internal and external compliance requirements.

In the past the malware scanning service was already used by SAP developed applications, such as the [SAP Document Management service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/document-management-service-application-option?service_plan=standard&region=all&commercialModel=cloud) .

Now you can use the [SAP Malware Scanning service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/malware-scanning-service?service_plan=clamav&region=all&commercialModel=cloud) to scan your business documents for malware, which are uploaded to your own applications.  Integrate the service with your custom-developed apps running on Cloud Foundry. When your apps upload business documents, they can call the [SAP Malware Scanning service](https://help.sap.com/docs/MALWARE_SCANNING/b416237f818c4e2e827f6118640079f8/b7c9b86fe724458086a502df3160f380.html) to check for viruses or other malware.

The document will be send to the malware scanning service by your application. SAP Malware Scanning service integrates ClamAV as its scan engine. ClamAV® is an open source (GPL) anti-virus engine for detecting trojans, viruses, malware & other malicious threats.

Get started with SAP Malware Scanning service using the standard procedures for the Cloud Foundry environment.
