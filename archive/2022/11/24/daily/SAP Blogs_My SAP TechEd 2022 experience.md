## Introduction

In the following article I will share with you my journey to SAP TechEd 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. For me personally, SAP TechEd is the event I look forward to the most. It's been three years since TechEd 2019 was held in Barcelona. I find it hard to believe how much has changed in the world in that time. It was the first major event I've attended since then.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's great to work from home in sweatpants and a hoodie, but there's nothing I've missed as much as being able to talk directly with the great people in the SAP community. In my eyes, virtual events cannot replace personal exchange.

## My journey to Las Vegas

My trip started on Saturday, November 12. from Frankfurt. After a short stopover in Amsterdam I went on to Las Vegas.

## My activities besides SAP TechEd

Due to my early arrival I was lucky enough to attend the NFL football game of the Las Vegas Raiders against the Indianapolis Colts on the following Sunday. I confess to you that I am a Dallas Cowboys fan so after the game I went back to the hotel to watch my team lose.

The following Monday started for me classically like almost any other day. I exchanged ideas with my colleagues about the business operations, initiated one or the other project activity and worked my way through my todos. Afterwards, I took a little side trip to the nearby [Red Rock Canyon](https://goo.gl/maps/TbtQyVKbrhnmjgB98). The nearby National Conservation Area is a radical contrast to the bustling Las Vegas Strip.

In the afternoon I met up with my ex-colleague fabianlehmann for a hop smoothie. It was great to meet him here in Las Vegas. His session [Enable, Configure, and Integrate a Central Inbox on SAP BTP [IN264]](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/hybrid/2022/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/sapteched2022catalog/page/catalog/session/1661198449247001X3bj) was on my calendar for the following day anyway.

Fabian had to put the finishing touches on his session, so I was able to end the evening at [The Forum Shops at Caesars](https://g.page/TheForumShops?share).

## My first day at SAP TechEd

After two wonderful days in Las Vegas, SAP TechEd began on Tuesday at the [Mirage Casino](https://g.page/themiragelv?share). A number of innovations were released during the keynote. You can find a detailed overview of the content in the blog article [SAPTechEd2022-keynote-day](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/15/sapteched2022-keynote-day/) by 9958e4b6df99431a84a41b015b639ac8.

My hands-on kickoff was Fabian's session. In the session, the [SAP Task Center](https://help.sap.com/docs/TASK_CENTER) on SAP BTP was set up, configured, and connected to SAP S/4HANA using the [SAP Mobile Start](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_MOBILE_START) app as a native entry point for mobile access.

Subsequently, I participated in the session [Achieve Exactly-Once Semantics in Apache Kafka Using SAP Integration Suite [IN260]](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/hybrid/2022/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/sapteched2022catalog/page/catalog/session/1661198448190001Xnb6). During the session, an end-to-end event-driven integration scenario was built. It was possible to use [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [SAP Integration Suite](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATION_SUITE) to respond to business events and deliver and process a message exactly once to the receiving system.

In the evening, I was able to make a number of new contacts during the event. I was very pleased to meet iinside and mar-hol. I only knew Max(imilian) through his work in the Sap Community. It was therefore great to meet him personally.

Towards the end of the evening, I noticed that there was a great goodie at the Developer Hub booth. There were 2 vouchers given away on site. One 100% as well as another 25% discount for [SAP certifications](https://training.sap.com/certification/). I have been wanting to take the [SAP Certified Development Associate - SAP Integration Suite](https://training.sap.com/certification/c_cpi_14-sap-certified-development-associate---sap-integration-suite-g/) certification for quite some time now and can tackle this task after SAP TechEd.

## My second day at SAP TechEd

The following Wednesday started with the [Business Applications Keynote\_Las Vegas [KEY101\_LV]](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapsapphire/virtual/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/sapteched2022catalog/page/catalog/session/1662112641472001xqmg). For a detailed overview of the content, see the blog article [SAP Tech Ed 22 - day 2](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/16/sap-tech-ed-22-day-2/).

[KWS SAAT SE](https://www.kws.com/corp/en/) has started to align and synchronize interfaces using [SAP WorkFlow Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/WORKFLOW_MANAGEMENT) with an Enterprise Architecture Management System, I was especially interested in [SAP Build Process Automation](https://help.sap.com/docs/PROCESS_AUTOMATION) topics. My session day started with [Build Robust Apps Enhanced with Process Automation and Low-Code Tooling [AD160]](https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/hybrid/2022/reg/flow/sap/saptech2022/sapteched2022catalog/page/catalog/session/1661198448374001X6GH). In this hands-on session, the SAP Build Apps tool together with the SAP Build Process Automation solution has been leveraged t...
