Many organizations don’t understand that not all health information is PHI and apply HIPAA more broadly than is required. This has implications for which organizations are considered Business Associates (because an organization must handle PHI to be considered a Business Associate) and how HIPAA is applied within Covered Entities and Business Associates. This post takes a deep dive into the definition of PHI to help organizations determine if and how HIPAA applies to them.

This post is part of a series that helps understand HIPAA applicability. For other posts in this series see:

Much of the confusion about the definition of PHI comes from the failure to understand that IIHI, as used in the definition of PHI, also has a very specific definition that is in turn based on the definition of health information.

The full definitions of IIHI and health information are available in [45 CFR 160.103](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/section-160.103), but a more descriptive definition of PHI can be created by merging these definitions.
