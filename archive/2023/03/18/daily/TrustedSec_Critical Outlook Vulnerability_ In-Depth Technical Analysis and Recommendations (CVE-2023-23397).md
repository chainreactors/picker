## Threat Overview

Earlier this week, Microsoft released a patch for Outlook vulnerability CVE-2023-23397, which has been actively exploited for almost an entire year. This exploit has caught the attention of a hacking group linked to Russian military intelligence that is using it to target European organizations.

CVE-2023-23397 allows threat actors to steal NTLM credentials of Microsoft Outlook users with minimal complexity or effort. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending an email to a target user but does not require that user to open the email. It poses a dire threat to vulnerable organizations, as threat actors can repeatedly execute this attack and commandeer user accounts while the user is none the wiser.

## How it Works

CVE-2023-23397 functions from a network-based attack vector. It starts with a specially crafted email containing a malicious calendar or meeting invite. A custom notification sound is added that bypasses the default WAV file and instead contains a path to an SMB share controlled by the attacker. Accessing the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path forces an NTLM authentication from the victim to the attacker. The attacker can then steal the leaked NTLM hashes and attempt to recover or replay them.

The malicious email requires no user interaction to conduct this attack. The email and the exploit itself trigger automatically upon landing in a user's inbox. The loss of financial data, sensitive customer information, employee data, and more are realistic and potentially devastating consequences of such an attack. This poses a significant threat to any vulnerable organization and demands immediate action to minimize exploitable exposure to CVE-2023-23397.
