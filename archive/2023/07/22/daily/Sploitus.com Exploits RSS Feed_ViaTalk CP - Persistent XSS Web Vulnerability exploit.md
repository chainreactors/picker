Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent post inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the viatalk control panel web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script code in post method requests to compromise user
session data or to manipulate application contents for clients.

The vulnerability is located in all account information input fields. Remote attackers with privileged user accounts are
able to inject own malicious script code as account data. After the inject the code executes in the frontend and backend
of the application. The attack can be performed by a profile update, by a new registration or by add via panel ui.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent
external redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] First Name
