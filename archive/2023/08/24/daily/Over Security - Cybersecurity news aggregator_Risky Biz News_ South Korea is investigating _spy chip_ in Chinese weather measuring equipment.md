South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) has found malicious code embedded in the chips of weather-measuring instruments made in China and used by the Korean Meteorological Administration.

The malicious code was described as a "*spy chip*" that can eavesdrop on its surroundings and "*steal information through radio frequencies*," South Korean TV network *[Channel A](https://www.ichannela.com/news/main/news_detailPage.do?publishId=000000363086)* reported this week.

A representative for the Korean Meteorological Administration told *[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=7754114)*, South Korea's national broadcaster, that the malicious code was found four months ago but didn't elaborate on how it was discovered.

NIS says that while it dealt with Chinese malware (software-based backdoors) in the past, the incident marks the first time it found a "*hardware backdoor*" in Chinese-made equipment.

In the aftermath of the discovery, NIS is currently conducting a [massive security audit](https://www.ichannela.com/news/main/news_detailPage.do?publishId=000000363087) on more than 10,000 pieces of equipment made in China and used by government agencies. It said it plans to publish the results of its investigation later this year.

The two reports confirm [early reporting](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/1100857.html) from last month about mysterious malicious code in "measuring equipment used by government agencies." The initial report was widely dismissed or ignored because officials didn't share enough information.

In recent months, South Korea as a whole seems to have turned on the idea of blanketing its territory with insecure Chinese-made equipment.

After footage from a Seoul plastic surgery clinic that used Chinese security cameras [showed up](https://blog.criminalip.io/2023/03/10/plastic-surgery-cctv-leak/) on Chinese adult forums, NIS forbade government agencies from using any CCTV or IP security cameras that have not gone through a [formal "security verification" process](https://www.cctvnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=234948), with the directive specifically taking aim at Chinese made equipment.

### ***Risky Business featured interview***

*In this joint Risky Business and Geopolitics Decanted feature interview, Patrick Gray and Dmitri Alperovitch talk to Illia Vitiuk, the Head of the Department of Cyber and Information Security of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), about the cyber dimension of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.*

### **Breaches, hacks, and security incidents**

**Ecuador's election disrupted by cyberattack:** A cyberattack has disrupted Ecuador's online voting system. Officials say the attack prevented Ecuadorians living abroad from casting their votes in the country's presidential election. The attack did not alter votes, but the incident was the least of everyone's worries as Ecuador was also rocked by an earthquake on the day of the vote. In addition, the voting took place under a heavy police and military presence after one of the presidential candidates was assassinated earlier this month.

**Baghdad closes LED advertising screens after hack:** Iraqi officials have ordered street marketing companies to shut down LED advertising screens across the city of Baghdad. The order comes after a hacker defaced a screen and showed an adult movie in one of the city's largest intersections. The movie ran for minutes until someone cut the board's power cable. Iraqi security forces say they [arrested a suspect](https://www.facebook.com/ministry.of.interior.iraq/posts/pfbid02uoZo2epBruqrDLQmqReY9oxJxCNFkRjeoCWvbzEWVQTbWe5pbBwRvBM2PExbHCk6l) believed to have orchestrated the hack.

**Bern police hack:** Hackers have exploited a vulnerability in an Ivanti (formerly MobileIron) server and stolen the personal details of more than 2,800 police officers from Bern, Switzerland's capital. The breach took place in mid-July and was most likely carried out using a zero-day in the Ivanti EPMM server. This same zero-day was also used to hack and steal data from [12 Norwegian government agencies](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-norwegian-government).

**BabakovLeaks:** Pro-Ukrainian hacktivist group Cyber Resistance has hacked and leaked data from the email account of [Oleksandr Babakov](https://informnapalm.org/ua/babakovleaks/), deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma. Journalists from InfoNapalm claim the leaked files expose Babakov's corruption and call him a "master of primitive money laundering schemes." The leak also shows Babakov's role in establishing ways for the Russian government to evade Western sanctions by working with African and Asian countries to import sanctioned goods. This is the fourth major hack-and-leak operation orchestrated by the Cyber Resistance group. They previously [doxxed](https://informnapalm.org/ua/zlam-75387-960-aviapolku/) Russian pilots who bombed civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, [doxxed](https://informnapalm.org/en/hacked-russian-gru-officer/) the leader of the APT28 cyber-espionage group, and [dumped](https://informnapalm.org/en/bagdasarovleaks-hacking-semyon-bagdasarov/) the email correspondence of former Duma member and Russian propagandist Semyon Bagdasarov.

**AUR data leak:** Romanian right-wing political party AUR has [exposed](https://www.facebook.com/daniel.kloyber/posts/pfbid0NzLvLT7gN56Ne8LFQ33VifaMypNQe1XHdDNGkJMDvcoLRD9j6uSmXfoBCPC5M84hl) the personal details of more than 20,000 donors who signed up for the organization's official mobile app. The leak occurred through the app's donor leaderboard section, which was retrieving each member's entire data through an unencrypted JSON file. Exposed data included sensitive details such as real names, home addresses, emails, phone numbers, and ID card numbers.
