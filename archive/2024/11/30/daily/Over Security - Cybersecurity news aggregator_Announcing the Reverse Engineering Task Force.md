Goal and backgound

In the spring of 2023, the [Tracking Exposed](https://tracking.exposed) project came to an end. This gave rise to several new initiatives, including the **Reverse Engineering Task Force**.

This is the professional group that wants to continue the [efforts started in 2019](https://tracking.exposed/#h.7litmink24dc), which are better explained in [this report](posts/2023/09/exercising-workers-rights-in-algorithmic-management-systems/).

The goal can be summarized as: to support trade unions in defending workers’ rights. Address the digital abuses embedded in modern platforms. Explain the power dynamics to policymakers so that new regulations are modern and timely.

Expect website updates in the coming days. For contact, please email `staff@reversing.works`.
