Have you ever stopped to think about the potential consequences of a cyberattack on your organization? It's getting more intense and destructive every day, and organizations are feeling the heat.

That's why more and more businesses are turning to [cyber insurance](https://thehacker.news/cyber-insurance-webinar?source=article) to find some much-needed peace of mind. Imagine, in the unfortunate event of a successful security breach or ransomware attack, the right policy can help minimize liability and contain losses.

However, skyrocketing claims in 2020 sent shockwaves through the insurance industry, forcing insurance providers to reinvent the criteria for acquiring or renewing cyber insurance. As a result, businesses are now navigating a dramatically altered terrain where they must prove their ability to defend against ransomware attacks. This includes implementing a wide range of robust security measures, particularly around identity protection requirements such as MFA coverage and service account protection.

The new identity protection requirements have come as a surprise to many organizations who find themselves struggling both with understanding the technical details, and also, with finding the right solution for a policy. Fortunately, there are ways for companies to address even the most challenging requirements.

So, what exactly does the new identity protection requirement entail, and how can you address any gaps in your coverage to meet brokers' requirements?

⚡ It's time to take action and protect your assets! Join us for an informative webinar with Don Hoffman of Silverfort [[**Don't miss it, register now**](https://thehacker.news/cyber-insurance-webinar?source=article)], where he will explain the identity protection aspects of the new cyber insurance requirements and what you need to do to comply.

Topics to be thoroughly covered during the webinar include:

* What types of MFA are required for cyber liability insurance?
* What are the new specific MFA controls for cyber liability insurance – and how do they help minimize ransomware attack surfaces?
* How can you extend MFA and other modern access controls to all resources, including service accounts and others that couldn't have been protected before?
* And much more

Don't miss this chance to expand your skills and knowledge and secure your business from any potential cyber threats.

With limited spots available, we expect this webinar to fill up quickly. Don't wait any longer, [**sign up now**](https://thehacker.news/cyber-insurance-webinar?source=article).
