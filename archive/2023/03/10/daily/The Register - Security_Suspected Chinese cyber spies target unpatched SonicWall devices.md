## They've been lurking in networks since at least 2021

Suspected Chinese cyber criminals have zeroed in on unpatched SonicWall gateways and are infecting the devices with credential-stealing malware that persists through firmware upgrades, according to Mandiant.

The spyware targets the SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 Series – a gateway device that provides VPN access to remote users.

The networking vendor confirmed the malware campaign in a statement emailed to *The Register*:

"Working in partnership with Mandiant, the SonicWall Product Security and Incident Response Team (PSIRT) confirmed a persistent threat actor campaign leveraging malware against unpatched SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) Series 100 appliances. While not tied to a new or specific vulnerability, SonicWall urges organizations to be proactive in updating to the most recent SMA 100 series firmware (10.2.1.7 or later), which includes additional hardening and security controls."

The campaign targeted "an extremely limited number of unpatched SMA 100 series appliances from the 2021 timeframe," the spokesperson added.
