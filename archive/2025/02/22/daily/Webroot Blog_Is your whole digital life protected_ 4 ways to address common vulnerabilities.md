Cyber threats. Identity theft. Online profiling. Financial fraud. Social media misuse. The list just gets longer. As more aspects of our lives move online and digital devices proliferate, staying safe from threats has become more important than ever.

Consider all the connected devices you use for daily tasks—browsing, shopping, banking, gaming, and more. Then think about all the content that you share on these devices every day; much of it likely contains sensitive or critical information that, in the wrong hands, could lead to serious damage with long-lasting impact.

The solution? Comprehensive digital protection. Webroot Total Protection is the latest release in our Customer Digital Life Protection strategy that checks all the boxes. It’s a top-end, true all-in-one offering based on a new platform that combines antivirus, password manager, identity protection, VPN, backup, and parental controls.

## 1. Protect your devices from viruses

How confident are you that your digital music, photos, and important documents—as well as email and applications—are safe? Cybercriminals are constantly developing new [malware](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection), [ransomware](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-ransomware), and phishing attacks that can steal identities, encrypt memorable family photos and documents for ransom, and turn home computers into devices that criminals take over to send spam or steal data.

Effective security software shields you from worms, trojans, [adware](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-adware), and more. And it protects not just your PC and laptop, but also your tablets, smartphones, and other digital devices.

Comprehensive antivirus software is most effective when used in conjunction with security best practices. Here are a few:

* Make sure your antivirus software performs scans regularly
* Install the latest security patches for your operating systems
* Keep your antivirus software up to date
* Be careful when downloading new apps onto devices; only download from app stores you trust
* Regularly backup important data

## 2. Protect your privacy in your online activities

Sharing information has become commonplace in our digital lives. From purchasing a plane ticket to opening a bank account and registering to vote, or simply doing your grocery shopping online, getting through the day without sharing at least some [personal information](https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information) online seems nearly impossible.

The flip side to this convenience, however, is that we risk losing control over who can access our personal information. Malicious actors are constantly seeking to collect personal data to commit fraud, steal identities, harass and threaten individuals, and more.

Protecting privacy is a top priority for families facing growing threats. [**Password managers**](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2017/09/01/password-manager/)generate strong, unique passwords and simplify their use, protecting you and saving time by automatically filling in credentials for website and app logins. Besides, using a **[VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/11/21/do-you-actually-need-a-vpn-your-guide-to-staying-safe-online/)** that establishes secure connections to public Wi-Fi hotspots by encrypting data transmission will keep you safe and anonymous when you’re away from home.

By paying attention to your device settings you can take steps to protect your privacy across your digital life:

* **Social media:** Choose who can see your posts, photos, and personal information and review these settings regularly. Set your default sharing settings to “friends” or a more restricted group rather than “public.” Check which third-party apps have access to your account and remove those you no longer use.
* **Mobile devices:** Disable location, camera, microphone, and contact list access for apps that don’t truly need them. Consider turning off location services when not needed and review which apps track your location in the background.
* **Web browsers:** Clear your browsing history and cookies regularly, block third-party cookies, and enable “do not track” features. Review and manage which sites can send you notifications, access your location, or use your camera/microphone.
* **Smart home devices:** Review privacy settings for voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home regularly. Check what data these devices collect and adjust accordingly.
* **Email services:** Keep tabs on apps and services that have access to your email account. Adjust spam filter settings to your preferences.
* **Operating systems:** Check your privacy settings to control app permissions, data access, and tracking features.

## 3. Safeguard your identity and private information
