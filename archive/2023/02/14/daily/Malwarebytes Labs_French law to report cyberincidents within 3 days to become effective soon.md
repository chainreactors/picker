# French law to report cyberincidents within 3 days to become effective soon

Posted: February 13, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The pressure on victims of cybercrime to notify authorities in a timely manner is increasing from many sides and for multiple reasons.

On January 24, 2023 France passed a law (Article L12-10-1 of the Insurance Code) that victims of cybercrime are required to report the incident within 72 hours after discovery, if they want to be eligible for compensation by the insurance for losses and damages caused by the attack. In accordance with French law these provisions come into force three months after the announcement of this law. That effective date will be April 24, 2023.

Earlier, we saw a [proposal](https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11038-fact-sheet.pdf) from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to amend Form 8-K to require registrants to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident within four business days after the registrant determines that it has experienced a material cybersecurity incident. Form 8-K is known as a “current report” and it is the report that companies must file with the SEC to announce major events that shareholders should know about.

In the [take-down of the Hive ransomware group](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/01/hive-ransomware-infrastructure-taken-down) the international law enforcement agencies stressed how crucial it was that victims filed timely reports about the cybercrimes committed against them.

## Cyber liability insurance

[Cyber liability insurance](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/business/what-is-cyber-liability-insurance) is a type of insurance policy that protects businesses from the expenses incurred after the result of a [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach), including stolen or damaged intellectual property.

It may strike us as weird that the compensation by the insurance is what’s at stake here, but it’s incorporated in US law as well. The [Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act](https://www.cisa.gov/publication/cybersecurity-information-sharing-act-2015-procedures-and-guidance) was one of the initial Federal laws passed in 2015 to enable sharing of personal information on cyberincidents. And many states have enacted their own legislation to address cyberrisks in depth, from exclusions to penalties.

Every US state has a Data Breach Notification law that must be complied with when a certain number of consumers’ [personally identifiable information (PII)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) is compromised. A few states have added requirements specifically for insurers to notify the state’s insurance department.

## Insurance companies

The amount of money involved in cyberincidents is enormous. Cybercrime costs include damage and destruction of data, stolen money, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of personal and financial data, embezzlement, fraud, post-attack disruption to the normal course of business, forensic investigation, restoration and deletion of hacked data and systems, and reputational harm.

Covering these risks that amass to [trillions of dollars](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/cybersecurity-statistics.html) per year is not something insurance companies will take on lightly. Their clients will have to show they were careful, protected, and diligent to be eligible for compensation. And no...
