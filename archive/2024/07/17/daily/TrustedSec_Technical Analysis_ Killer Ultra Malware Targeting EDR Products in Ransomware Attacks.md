ARC Labs recently recovered a tool leveraged in Qilin ransomware attacks aimed at impairing defenses by disabling popular endpoint detection and response (EDR) and antivirus (AV) tools. ARC Labs has labeled this malware as "Killer Ultra" based on a module name within the malware. Killer Ultra leverages a well-documented Zemana driver as a mechanism to terminate EDR/AV processes; however, ARC Labs have identified additional capabilities within Killer Ultra that indicate it can be leveraged for more than just impairing defenses.

ARC Labs analyzed Killer Ultra to understand its full functionality and provide tactical threat intelligence to organizations to inform their detection and response strategies.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Terminates Processes for Common Security Tools:** Killer Ultra obtains Kernel level permissions and targets endpoint security tools from Symantec, Microsoft, and Sentinel One.
2. **Event Log Clearing:** It enumerates and clears all Windows Event Logs.
3. **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Killer Ultra is packed with a vulnerable version of Zemana AntiLogger leveraging CVE-2024-1853 for Arbitrary Process Termination.
4. **Extended Capabilities:** Analysis revealed inactive code with capabilities associated with post-exploitation tools, such as downloading and executing tools over a C2 channel.

## CVE-2024-1853

CVE-2024-1853 is an Arbitrary Process Termination vulnerability identified in Zemana AntiLogger v2.74.204.664. This vulnerability exploits the 0x80002048 IOCTL code of the Zemana AntiLogger drivers, allowing an attacker to terminate processes arbitrarily, including critical security processes such as AV or EDR software.

In May 2023, a threat actor with the pseudonym “SpyBoy” incorporated this vulnerabilit...
