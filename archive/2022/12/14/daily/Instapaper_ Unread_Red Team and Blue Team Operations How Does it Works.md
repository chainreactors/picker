Security is a multifaceted field with multiple roles for carrying out diverse operations. In this article, we demystify the concept of the red and blue teams in security.

First, why do we need to bifurcate security roles for two teams on **[Penetration Testing](https://cybersecuritynews.com/penetration-testing-phases/)?**

Simply put, a company’s security responsibilities are so wide that it’s impossible to be an expert in every field. In an attempt to provide encompassing and strong security posture, large organizations prefer to have different units within their security departments, fulfilling different purposes using advanced **[red team tools](https://cybersecuritynews.com/red-team-tools/)**.

These are usually called the **Red team vs Blue team**. We’ll dive deep to understand what both mean, which tasks they handle, and how important they are.

* [The Red Team: Ethical Advisors](#h-the-red-team-ethical-advisors)
* [Penetration Testing Tools: Bridging The Gap](#h-penetration-testing-tools-bridging-the-gap)

## **The Blue Team: Defenders**

* **SOC Analyst**
* **Incident Responder**
* **Digital Forensic & Incident Response Analysts**
* **Threat Intelligence Analyst**
* **Malware Analyst/Reverse Engineer**

Blue teamers in the security department specialize in protecting the organization’s assets. **They are responsible for ensuring that every company’s system is secured and patched**, monitoring hacker activity to look for malicious signatures, and many other complex procedures.

They have to ensure and maintain strong product security, which is why multiple roles are defined even within blue teaming.

Let’s take a look at a few of them below:

## **SOC Analyst**

**[SOC](https://cybersecuritynews.com/the-foundation-of-an-effective-soc/) stands for “[Security Operations Center](https://gbhackers.com/how-to-build-and-run-a-security-operations-center/)”**, a sub-department continuously monitoring for anything unusual. SOC analysts do this job — they are the first line of defense in any organization, keeping an eye on multiple assets to determine if something malicious is happening.

SOC Analyst

## **Incident Responder**

While SOC analysts are there to figure out and identify current and past threats, once an event or incident is uncovered, it’s the job of [incident responders](https://cybersecuritynews.com/soar/) to take it forward with the help of [incident response tools](https://cybersecuritynews.com/endpoint-security-tools/).

**They have certain guidelines and strict procedures that must be followed to do proper containment and escalation after something occurs. They are usually part of CSIRT.**

Incident Responder

## **Digital Forensic & Incident Response Analysts**

They analyze artifacts and evidence after an event or compromise occurs. They perform tasks such as memory analysis, network, and [event logs analysis](https://cybersecuritynews.com/event-log-bugs/), file system analysis, etc., where they look for how the attack was carried out to dig deeper into them and thoroughly investigate.

## **Threat Intelligence Analyst**

After the information related to cybersecurity is collected and analyzed to understand cyber criminals’ motives, methods, etc., the finalized data is called threat intelligence.
