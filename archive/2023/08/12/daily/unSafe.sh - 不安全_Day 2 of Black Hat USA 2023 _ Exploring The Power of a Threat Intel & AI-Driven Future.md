What a few days it was at this year’s BlackHat cyber event in sunny Las Vegas! The stunning SentinelOne booth welcomed thousands of visitors who came to learn about PurpleAI, our newly launched [Ranger Insights](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/singularity-ranger-insights/) console, and all the ways the [Singularity™ platform](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform/singularity-xdr-protection/) helps organizations protect their endpoints, secure their cloud, and unify their data.

We’ve connected with so many of our customers, prospects, partners, as well as our executive and R&D teams over the last few days. For those who couldn’t join us live at the event this time around, our blog today will cover everything that happened on Day 2 of Black Hat USA 2023.

## PurpleAI | AI-Driven Threat Hunting, Analysis & Response for the Modern Enterprise

On Thursday, the SentinelOne Theatre beckoned visitors for another full day of presentations and live product demonstrations. In particular, folks were drawn to our demos of [PurpleAI](https://www.sentinelone.com/press/sentinelone-unveils-revolutionary-ai-platform-for-cybersecurity/), SentinelOne’s recently launched generative AI platform, dedicated to threat-hunting, analysis and response. PurpleAI, not surprisingly, piqued the interest of many in line with this years’ event theme surrounding Generative AI and its growing presence within the cybersecurity community.

In the packed theater, Joseph Poyner, Director of Sales Engineering and Solution Engineering at SentinelOne showcased how PurpleAI accelerates the offensive strategies and response levels of your Security Operations Center (SOC). Before presenting the PurpleAI demo, Poyner explained some of the industry problems that we set out to solve when we created PurpleAI from the ground up.

Before PurpleAI came to life, we considered some of the hard facts about the current climate. It’s been reported that our industry is millions of analysts short in dealing with the current cybersecurity workload. For the workforce we do have, they’re fighting against both new and sophisticated cyberattack TTPs, which are fueling the rise in ransomware, software supply chain attacks, and more. As single-layer, reactive security solutions are no longer enough to keep up with increasingly skilled cybercriminals, enterprises now have to stack multi-layered, proactive solutions together to build a robust defense posture.

In analyzing SentinelOne customer data and telemetry, we also found that many of the customer queries in our platform are surprisingly simple. Why aren’t people writing complicated queries, we asked? Why aren’t they pulling insights from this large pool of data? The reason, we found, is that most analysts are new to their role and still honing their skill set. Given the reality of these observations, we set about building PurpleAI, which Poyner then demoed through a Capture the Flag (CTF)-like game.

“Rather than an hour-long investigation, we’re going to cut that down to five to 10 minutes,” he explained during the CTF demo. “The other thing is [PurpleAI] never sleeps. This is going to programmatically go through your queries.”

Poyner also highlighted how PurpleAI and your queries can integrate with other popular SaaS tools like Okta.

“You don’t even have to be an analyst. You just have to understand what type of data you want. You can just ask PurpleAI those queries and supercharge your SOC.”

Test drive PurpleAI for yourself with this [interactive demo](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/tour/). Interested in learning more? [Connect](https://www.sentinelone.com/contact/) with a SentinelOne expert to find out how PurpleAI can benefit your organization.

## Presentation Highlight | Mandiant On Combining Cyber Threat Intel

For a second day, we also welcomed partners and fellow security leaders in our industry to give in-booth presentations. In one notable instance, Mandiant’s esteemed Head of Managed Defense Consulting, [Alan White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aw31337/), shared his thoughts in a series of slides on why SentinelOne and Mandiant are truly better together for customers.

“We’re talking about taking really great powerful technology that SentinelOne has with a really powerful Mandiant service. Combined with that threat intelligence, it’s unstoppable,” White told us after his presentation.

Consider this: Without this SentinelOne-Mandiant advantage, organizations would face the expensive and difficult challenge of staffing a team of 24/7 security analysts to achieve the same level of protection. By leveraging SentinelOne XDR technology with Mandiant’s leading MDR service, intelligence, and expertise, customers receive around-the-clock support, proactive threat hunting, and the unification of security across their existing tools.

“You’re going to find evil quickly, you’re going to detect it quickly, and you’re going to leverage the technology to reduce the threat as fast as possible,” White told us. “At the end of the day, I can’t think of a better way to tell a client, ‘If you can’t manage your own environment 24/7, then the partnership that we bring together is the way to go.”

Learn more about how SentinelOne and Mandiant can benefit your organization [here](https://www.sentinelone.com/partners/mandiant/). We’re also excited to join Mandiant at its [mWISE conference](https://mwise.mandiant.com/conf23) in Washington D.C. next month.

## Noetic Cyber | Automating Asset Management With Endpoint Context

SentinelOne partner and [S Ventures](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/s-ventures/) portfolio company, [Noetic Cyber](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/s-ventures-noetic/), announced on Day 2 of Black Hat the next phase of its integration with us. In their latest [blog post](https://noeticcyber.com/sentinelone-singularity-connector-updates-2023/), Noetic Cyber outlines its plans to extend its market-leading cyber asset attack surface management (CAASM) platform to support new use cases.

The company focuses on providing a proactive approach to cyber asset and controls management to help security professionals better understand the cyber risks within their environments, map the relationships between all of their assets and entities, and tie together context and insights to enable faster, more accurate decisions.
