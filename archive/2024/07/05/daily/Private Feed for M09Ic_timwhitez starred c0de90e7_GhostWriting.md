# GhostWriting

A paradox: Writing to another process without openning it nor actually writing to it

The concept
Lots of todayâ€™s malicious software (virii, trojans, rootkits, etc.) use remote execution techniques in order to avoid AV software, hide themselves, go resident in more suitable processes and so on.

Remote execution means a process can somehow inject executable code into another process and trigger the execution of said executable code into the context of that process. Injected code can be both, a DLL that gets loaded into the target process or a bunch of code+data bytes directly written into the memory space of the target process.

What we present here is a new way of accomplishing this task of remote code execution or, in more general terms, remote byte injection.

The basic idea of this method is forgetting about this process-centric idea of remote code execution. This is the challenge: writing and running remote code without actually opening the target process. We will not open any process nor will we write to it. Is this a paradox ? No, it is not. It is true that we are not going to use any OpenProcess, DebugActiveProcess, NtOpe...
