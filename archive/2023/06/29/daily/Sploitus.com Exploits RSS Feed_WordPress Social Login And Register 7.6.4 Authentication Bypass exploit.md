Fully Patched Version: 7.6.5

The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.6.4. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the email address associated with that user. This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.

Technical Analysis

The WordPress Social Login and Register plugin, according to its settings, provides the ability for users to login to a WordPress website using a social login through various popular social media platforms and service providers. Examining the code reveals that there is a case with custom apps, where the data is sent encrypted during the login process. The data required for login must be decrypted using the secret key at the request.

While encrypting this information would normally provide protection against manipulating the request and prevent identity spoofing, we unfortunately found that the encryption key is hardcoded in vulnerable versions of the plugin, which means that threat actors also had access to the key which was not unique per WordPress installation. This makes it possible for attackers to craft a valid request containing a properly encrypted email address which vulnerable versions of the plugin use during the login process to determine the user.

Ultimately, this makes it possible for threat actors to bypass authentication and gain access to arbitrary accounts on sites running a vulnerable version of the plugin. As always, authentication bypass vulnerabilities and resulting access to high privileged user accounts, make it easy for threat actors to completely compromise a vulnerable WordPress site and further infect the victim.
