# Grok, ChatGPT, other AIs happy to help phish senior citizens

Posted: September 16, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

If you are under the impression that cybercriminals need to get their hands on compromised AI chatbots to help them do their dirty work, think again.

Some AI chatbots are just so user friendly that they can help the user craft phishing text, and even malicious HTML and Javascript code.

A few weeks ago we published an article about the actions Anthropic was taking to stop its Claude AI from helping [cybercriminals launch a cybercrime spree](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/claude-ai-chatbot-abused-to-launch-cybercrime-spree).

A recent investigation by [Reuters journalists showed](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ai-chatbots-cyber) that Grok was more than happy to help them craft and perfect a phishing email targeting senior citizens. Grok is the AI marketed by Elon Musk’s xAI. Reuters reported:

> “Grok generated the deception after being asked by Reuters to create a phishing email targeting the elderly. Without prodding, the bot also suggested fine-tuning the pitch to make it more urgent.”

In January 2025, we [told you about](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/01/ai-supported-spear-phishing-fools-more-than-50-of-targets) a report that AI-supported spear phishing mails were equally as effective as phishing emails thought up by experts, and able to fool more than 50% of targets. But since then, the development of AI has grown [exponentially](http://www.v500.com/ai-exponential-monthly-growth/) and [researchers are worrying about how to recognize AI-crafted phishing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417425006669).

Phishing is the first step in many cybercrime campaigns. It poses an enormous problem with billions of phishing emails sent out every day. AI helps criminals to create more variation which makes pattern detection less effective and it helps them fine tune the messages themselves. And Reuters focused on senior citizens for a reason.

The [FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 2024 report](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-annual-internet-crime-report) confirms that Americans aged 60 and older filed 147,127 complaints and lost nearly $4.9 billion to online fraud, representing a 43% increase in losses and a 46% increase in complaints compared to 2023.

Besides Grok, the reporters tested five other popular AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Meta AI, Claude, Gemini, and [DeepSeek](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/01/the-deepseek-controversy-authorities-ask-where-the-data-comes-from-and-where-it-goes). Although most of the AI chatbots protested at first and cautioned the user not to use the emails in a real-life scenario, in the end their “will to please” helped overcome these obstacles.

Fred Heiding, a Harvard University researcher and an expert in phishing helped Reuters put the crafted emails to the test. Using a targeted approach to reach those most likely to fall for them, about 11% of the seniors clicked on the emails sent to them.

An [investigation by Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/security/yellowai-customer-chatbot-cookies-flaw/) showed that Yellow.ai, an agentic AI provider for businesses such as Sony, Logitech, Hyundai, Domino’s, and hundreds of other brands could be persuaded to produce malicious HTML and JavaScript code. It even allowed attackers to bypass checks...
