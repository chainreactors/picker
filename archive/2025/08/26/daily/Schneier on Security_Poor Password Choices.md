## Poor Password Choices

Look at [this](https://www.wired.com/story/mcdonalds-ai-hiring-chat-bot-paradoxai/): McDonald’s chose the password “123456” for a major corporate system.

Why cite a paywalled Wired puff piece instead of KrebsOnSecurity? Krebs actually did the work and correctly pointed the finger at Paradox, not customers like McD’s. Wired’s framing was misleading clickbait.

@ThemePro

Andy Greenberg’s piece is from July 9, 2025. Sorry you can’t see article. Paradox.ai jumps on it somewhere around paragraph 5.

Krebs’ article with additional detail is July 17, 2025.

If I were them, I’d go with “whopper”. No one would guess that!

That’s amazing. I’ve got the same combination on my luggage.

They should use a passphrase. Something like:
two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun

As von Neumann said “Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. For, as has been pointed out several times, there is no such thing as a random number — there are only methods to produce random numbers, and a strict arithmetic procedure of course is not such a method.”

Have your pseudorandom number, just make sure it isn’t in the range of some low complexity function (where the function domain is included when measuring complexity).

“It had not been logged into since 2019 and frankly, should have been decommissioned. …” [via Krebs]

“When will they ever learn … ” [via Pete Seeger]

A century after Barnum,
the population has grown.
Now it’s about every six seconds.

A 3rd party developer’s test account on a 3rd party app … I believe the post should be calling out Paradox for hosting an app they developed with the mentioned highly privileged test account left active.

I’m reminded of XKCD 221,

Surely McDonalds should have commissioned their own pen test on any software they purchased?
