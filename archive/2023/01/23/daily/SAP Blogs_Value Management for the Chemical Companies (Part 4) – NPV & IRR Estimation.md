Ola, boa tarde!

**Reference**

That is Part 4 of the blog article series I would like to describe the Value Management Approach for Chemical companies.

* The Part 1 with common overview of the approach is here: <https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/24/value-management-approach-for-the-chemical-companies-part-1/>

* The Part 2 with KPI list and baseline description is here: <https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/04/value-management-approach-for-the-chemical-companies-part-2/>

* The Part 3 with explanations of expected benefits calculation and defining of the high-level roadmap is here: [https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/05/value-management-approach-for-the-chemical-companies-part-3-define-...](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/05/value-management-approach-for-the-chemical-companies-part-3-define-roadmap/)

Today I will continue with the common approach and for doing this I should remind the process overview diagram.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/Pict_1-4.png)

Picture 1. The effective Value Management Approach – high-level overview.

In previous Part # 3 I explained the common approach of the estimation of the expected benefits value, and the high-level definition of the transformation roadmap based on previous analysis.

All these parts are necessary for upcoming steps – estimation of the transformation program returns in terms of ROI, NPV & IRR. In this Part 4 I want to explain the common approach how to estimate these values.

**Estimate the program costs | Step 7**

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/Navi_4-7.png)

To start the evaluation of the investments returns, we need to estimate two cash flow streams: positive and negative. Positive means expected benefits in USD, and we calculated in Part 3. Negative means costs of program realization, and to make it lets look again at our program defined as the outcome of Step 6.

Picture 2. Example of high-level transformation roadmap.

We require costs estimation for each program phase and workstream and these costs could be defined via document like “Request for Information” (or RFI) with price estimation. To initiate the RFI the Company Business Architecture team should prepare the high-level architecture, functional requirements, and any other required questionnaire documents.

To prepare these documents I recommend contacting the software vendor (SAP and/or others) or to independent consulting company to get the assistance from the Architecture and Value Experts.

Solution high-level architecture

The possible high-level architecture to build the SAP Solution for the Program and Value realization phases with the integrated Value Management approach might look like this:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/Pict_4-3.png)

Picture 3. High-level business solution architecture for Digital Transformation with Embedded Value Management Approach.

With high-level architecture the RFI should contain also other parameters work cost estimation like:

* Business processes list,

* Functional requirements, including requirements to build:

  + KPI data collection and monitoring solution,

  + Solution for Personal KPI Assignment and Compensation for Executives and Mid-level Management responsible on these KPIs,

  + Business Processes Monitoring & Insights Solution,

  + Investments Projects Management Solution with Projects Outcomes Monitoring,

* Organizational scope,

* System deployment preferences (ex. Preferred Cloud Hyperscalers Provider),

* Integration scheme,

* Matrix with segregation of works,

* Desired Program Timing,

* Change Management,

* Post-live support,

* … and other requirements.

The detailed approach about RFI preparation is out of the scope of my blog article, but if you are interested you can contact your favourite consulting services partner for detailed explanation of the procedure and Services Expert Team will be happy to guide you through the process.

Request for Information Outcome

As a result of RFI you should be provided with the high-level estimation of costs in terms of future payments distributed by quarters and years. This distribution is important for Cash Flow estimation and subsequent NPV and ROI calculation.

The payments estimation might look like this table:

Picture 4. Example of the costs estimation for the Transformation Program.

Important DISCLAIMER: amounts presented in this table are abstract for demonstration and calculations explanation only, these digits are not real and do not relate to any real costs of SAP software subscription, partners services, and / or any other costs. Please consider these digits only as the demo content for calculations explanation.

What is important in the table above:

* Time horizon is 5 years from the program initiation point,

* Costs will continue after go-live (at least cloud subscriptions),

* Different costs in different lines,

* Costs distributed by Quarters and Years

After we received the Costs Estimation and Distribution table, we can perform estimated calculation of the transformation program outcomes: NPV and IRR. This leads us to the Step 8.

Roles and responsibilities for the Step 7:

Step 7 should be performed by company’s Business Efficiency (BE) team with assistance and advisory of SAP Value Advisory team (SAP VA) and with participation and approval of business e...
