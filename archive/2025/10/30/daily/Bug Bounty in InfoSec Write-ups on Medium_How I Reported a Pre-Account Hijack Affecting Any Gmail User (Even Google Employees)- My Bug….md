## Intro - a normal night that turned interesting

Bug hunting looks cool on Twitter: big payouts, P1 RCEs, flex posts. Reality is usually half-cold coffee, many tabs, and small logic bugs that break real user trust.

I found one of those quiet but dangerous bugs on a Google subdomain. Short version: **you could create a full account for any Gmail address, get a token, and change profile or cart - all without email verification and without rate-limiting.** Bad, right? Very bad.

This is my story - how I found it, how I reported it, the follow-ups, the frustration, and what I learned.

## Whoami?

Ek aur din, ek aur vulnerability. Same banda, naye emotions üò≠. Intro ke liye purane writeups padho yaar.
(Translation - Another day, another vulnerability. Same guy, new emotions üò≠. Read old write-ups for the intro, friend.)

## The ‚Äúwait, that worked?‚Äù moment

I was just poking around the Website. I found the website is using graphql , I already had learned how graphql works and stuff so without wasting time I runned Graphql Introspection query and I found many things. Interestingly i found an registeration mutation. I tried and results , Success.

No OTP. No verification. Just a token in response. I could update name, add address, and even pre-fill the shopping cart via GraphQL mutations.

Two feelings hit me: **(1)** ‚ÄúYes - proof!‚Äù and **(2)** ‚ÄúOh no - this is dangerous.‚Äù

The main reason it is more dangerous because they only have SSO for Sign-up / Sign-in , if the real user later logged in with Google OAuth, they would land inside the account I had already created. Zero-click takeover. Silent and nasty.

(Fun Fact- They can‚Äôt even revoke the account as they don‚Äôt have any reset password option or any other way they can revoke the JWT token.)

I tested carefully and kept all sensitive stuff private. I made a small, repeatable PoC: createCustomer ‚Üí generateCustomerToken ‚Üí updateCustomer/addProductsToCart ‚Üí victim logs in via OAuth ‚Üí victim ends up in attacker account.

## PoC and impact (short & clear)

I prepared:

* a private PoC video (redacted here),
* reproduction steps (sanitized),
* a clear impact list.

Why it matters:

* **Zero-click account takeover** ‚Äî no phishing, no user interaction needed.
* **Persistent access** ‚Äî attacker has a valid JWT; victim cannot revoke.
* **Business logic abuse** ‚Äî attacker can prefill carts, spam, change profile, maybe place orders if payment saved.
* **Internal risk** ‚Äî I tested behavior for an internal-style email during private testing (kept private here).

This was a logic bug, not a shiny exploit - but the damage could be real.

## Reporting to Google VRP ‚Äî timeline (real, no filter)

I submitted the report and started the usual back-and-forth.

* **Jun 13, 2025 ‚Äî** Report submitted (triaged).
* **Jun 18, 2025 ‚Äî** Sent detailed attack scenario and PoC video to Google on request.
* **Jun 28, 2025 ‚Äî** Clarified that the victim cannot remove attacker or revoke token.
* **Jul 7, 2025 ‚Äî** Shared additional impact (internal-style email test ‚Äî private).
* **Jul 10, 2025 ‚Äî** Status: accepted (filed to product team).
* **Jul 24 & Jul 31, 2025 ‚Äî** VRP panel‚Äôs reward decision: $0.
* **Oct 15, 2025 ‚Äî** Final: closed ‚Äî reason: application is operated by a third-party vendor (out of scope for VRP).

Important: I also tried contacting the vendor directly about the bug, but I didn‚Äôt get a reply from them. Still, the vulnerability was **eventually resolved** now they have forget password option GraphQL is also secured (good - users protected), even though vendor communication was radio-silent from my side.

## The emotional part - excitement and a bit of let-down

That PoC moment - big dopamine spike. Getting triaged and accepted - validation. The follow-ups - expected. The closure because of ‚Äúvendor-operated‚Äù scope - frustrating.

I pushed with WHOIS and ownership info, argued that a Google subdomain with user-facing security issues needs fixing regardless of vendor operation. The panel reviewed and still closed the report citing vendor operation. It felt like: I did the right technical job, but the procedural ladder stopped the reward path.

Still - the main win: the bug was fixed. That‚Äôs what matters for users.

## What I learned (practical, short)

If you hunt logic bugs or build auth systems, keep these in mind:

* **Check signup & SSO edges first.** Signup, invite, change-email, SSO-linking - these often hide logic mistakes.
* **Don‚Äôt issue long-lived tokens before verification.** Tokens before verification = trouble.
* **Give users session visibility & revocation.** If someone links via SSO, users should be able to see and remove sessions.
* **Rate-limit / CAPTCHA unauthenticated endpoints.** GraphQL is powerful ‚Äî throttle public mutations.
* **Collect ownership evidence early.** WHOIS, registrar info, footer screenshots ‚Äî they help if scope is questioned.
* **Be ready for non-technical fights.** Scope and ownership debates happen. Patience + evidence win.

## Message for other researchers ‚Äî short & real

Be curious more than flashy. Tools help, but thinking wins. Click around like a normal user. Try weird flows. Ask ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù and follow it.

When you report:

* Make PoC repeatable and clean.
* Explain impact in simple words engineers understand...
