Threat: Trojan.Win32.Platinum.gen
Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution
Description: The malware looks for and executes DLLs in its current directory. Therefore, we can potentially hijack a vuln DLL execute our own code, control and terminate the malware. Once loaded the exploit dll will check if the current directory is "C:\Windows\System32", if not we grab our process ID and terminate. All basic tests were conducted successfully in a virtual machine environment.

MD5: 71a76adeadc7b51218d265771fc2b0d1
Vuln ID: MVID-2022-0657
Dropped files: Adobe_Update_Sync.exe
Disclosure: 11/18/2022

Exploit/PoC:
1) Compile the following C code as "WTSAPI32.dll"
2) Place the DLL in same directory as the malware
3) Optional - Hide it: attrib +s +h "WTSAPI32.dll"
