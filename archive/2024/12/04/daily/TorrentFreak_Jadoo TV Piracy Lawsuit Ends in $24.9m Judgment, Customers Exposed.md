A long-running lawsuit against pirate set-top box distributor Jadoo TV, launched by DISH Network and coordinated by the International Broadcaster Coalition Against Piracy, has ended with a $24.9m judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. In addition to the imminent shutdown of the IPTV service, domain names, trademarks, and all customer lists will be handed over to DISH.

Jadoo TV distributed self-branded set-top IPTV boxes and later various software apps. The DISH complaint described Jadoo TV’s operation as a “deliberate, multi-year effort” to distribute its exclusively-licensed TV channels without authorization, amounting to direct, contributory, and vicarious infringement under [17 U.S.C. Section 501](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/501).

From the beginning, DISH took the position that Sohail could be held personally liable because he authorized, directed, or participated in Jadoo TV’s copyright-infringing activities. Sohail argued to the contrary but in September 2020, the court found “plausible inference” that Sohail “authorized, directed, or participated” in the alleged infringement.

In June 2023, the court [granted summary judgment](https://torrentfreak.com/ibcap-dish-prevail-in-jadoo-tv-piracy-lawsuit-ceo-held-personally-liable-230615/) against Jadoo TV and Sohail, finding them liable for direct, contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, noting that Sohail was personally liable as the “guiding spirit” behind the infringement carried out via Jadoo TV.

## Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction

In a joint stipulation filed yesterday at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, DISH Network and Jadoo TV, Inc. and Sajid Sohail, filed a request that the Court enter a final judgment and permanent injunction.

“DISH and Defendants agree that a final judgment should be entered for DISH on Counts I, II, and III of the Amended Complaint for direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement under [17 U.S.C. § 501](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/501),” the request reads.

“DISH and Defendants also agree that damages should be awarded to DISH in the amount of $24,969,911, consisting of statutory damages of $14,550,000
for 97 registered Works (calculated at $150,000 per Work) and Defendants’ profits of $10,419,911 for 159 unregistered Works. [17 U.S.C. § 504(b), (c)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504).”

DISH and the defendants also agreed to the Court’s entry of a permanent injunction, effective immediately, enjoining Jadoo TV and Sohail and any other persons acting in concert, from infringing the plaintiff’s rights moving forward.

## IBCAP Welcomes Conclusion of Long-Running Litigation

In an announcement welcoming the end of the long-running litigation which dates back to 2018, the International Broadcaster Coalition Against Piracy (IBCAP) celebrated the win alongside IBCAP member DISH.

“This final judgment and settlement marks the culmination of a six-year legal battle against one of the most popular South Asian services offering pirated content, Jadoo TV, and its CEO, who was found personally liable for the damages caused by his and his company’s copyright infringement,” says Chris Kuelling, executive director of IBCAP.

“Today’s announcement sends a strong message that the end of the road for a pirate IPTV service is a significant monetary payment and loss of your entire business.”

The statement also revealed the existence of a separate settlement, one that has a financial component but also potential implications for entities that conducted business with Jadoo TV.

“Jadoo TV and Mr. Sohail agreed to transfer all Jadoo TV customer lists to DISH, transfer all Jadoo TV trademarks and domain names to DISH, and pay DISH $1,500,000 by Feb. 20, 2025,” the statement reads.
