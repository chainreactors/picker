# Incendiary Munitions Strike Gaza-bound Flotilla Two Nights in a Row

On September 8 and 9, two vessels of the Gaza-bound Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) were attacked outside the port of Sidi Bou Said in Tunisia.

Bellingcat analysed footage and images from both incidents. The experts consulted believe improvised incendiary munitions were likely used. The trajectory followed by the objects and the audio recordings also appear to suggest they could have been dropped from an aerial platform above the vessels. Although this tallies with witness accounts that claim they saw a drone, more evidence would be needed to confirm the device used for the attacks.

The first attack happened around midnight local time and targeted the lead vessel, referred to as the Family Boat. The GSF’s [official statement](https://www.instagram.com/globalsumudflotilla/p/DOXEm8viAZO/) said the Family Boat was “struck by a drone in Tunisian waters”, causing a fire on “the main deck and below deck storage”. The six passengers and the crew managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries or significant damage were reported.

Tunisian official sources first said there was “no evidence of any hostile act or external targeting”. A statement published by the country’s [National Guard on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DGGN1956/posts/812698534423606?ref=embed_post) stated that initial investigations indicated the fire broke out in one of the life jackets “as a result of a lighter or cigarette butt”. Bellingcat sent an inquiry to Tunisian authorities, but had not received a response by the time of publication. On the evening of September 10, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior [published](https://www.interieur.gov.tn/actualite/32994/%D8%A8%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%80%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%BA) a statement, saying the incident “that took place yesterday on a ship docked in Sidi Bou Said port was a premeditated attack”.

The GSF [reported](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZmcP-iK7U/) that another boat, the Alma, was hit by a second attack on September 9, shortly after midnight local time, approximately 24 hours after the first incident. They released a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZqrkLCnSl/) showing incendiary munition falling in a similar manner to that which struck the Family Boat. The crew of the Alma managed to extinguish the fire. No injuries were reported, and damage was minor.

## The First Attack: What Open Source Can Reveal

Following the first attack, the GSF released several videos, including one [recorded](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXaR_MiOZ_/?igsh=YjdnaTEybGNocW94) from another vessel showing an incendiary munition falling onto the Family Boat. The object ignites above the boat’s mast – the highest point on the vessel – before erupting into a larger flaming mass and striking the deck. The visual evidence appears to contradict the statement published by the country’s National Guard.

The object must have been deployed from an aerial platform, as no higher structures or elevated positions are visible in the analysed footage.

Eyewitness accounts support the aerial origin. Portuguese citizen Miguel Duarte was on the Family Boat. He can be seen [in a video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXL9KhjJaK/) from a camera installed on the vessel, showing a view of the aft-deck and looking upwards shortly before an explosion occurs off camera. He [said](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXMeRaiq9t/) in a statement that he “saw a drone clearly about 4m above” his head. He described the object to Bellingcat as a very noisy, square drone of around half a meter in width.

Duarte also said that the projectile landed directly on a pile of life jackets. The boat’s paint was damaged, but no steel melted. Bellingcat was not able to identify any munition remnants from the [available](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOXSL3jClWD/) open sources documenting this strike.

However, Bellingcat contacted two independent experts who appear to agree that an improvised incendiary object was used in the attack and deployed from an aerial platform.

Dr N.R. Jenzen-Jones from Armament Research Services (ARES) stated: “The videos appear to show an incendiary object falling onto the deck of the ship in question. Contrary to some public observations, there is nothing to suggest this was an explosive munition.” He said that while the available imagery is limited, preventing an identification at this time, the incendiary object “could conceivably be a military incendiary munition, a civilian object (such as a flare), or an improvised device.”

Dr. Jenzen-Jones also said that “the sound in some videos suggests a flying object such as a UAV or light aircraft may have dropped the object from overhead, but there is no conclusive evidence of this, and the noise could be coincidental.”

Petro Pyatakov, a retired colonel who is now a consultant for the arms industry, told Bellingcat that from the videos, “it looks like an improvised incendiary shell dropped from 100-130 metres. [There are] no sounds like a rocket engine or an arty shell, [just a] low blast effect only, [maybe] some incendiary material with an igniter like a Molotov cocktail”....
