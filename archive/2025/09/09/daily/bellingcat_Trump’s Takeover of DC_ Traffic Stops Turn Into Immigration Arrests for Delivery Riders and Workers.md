Four masked men in police tactical vests surround a young scooter rider, cuffing his hands behind his back. One person, whose face is fully obscured with a cap, sunglasses and a balaclava, is heard [on eyewitness video](https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/414743e9e3b90a2db8300e1f/474c67b3ea7a49e29ebe9bb6.html) telling the scooter rider: “You came into this country as a J1, as an exchange student. You didn’t show up … You lied, ok?”

“Yeah, he’s illegal, either way,” another person is heard saying, before they lead him to an unmarked car.

Nearby, two Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) cars are seen blocking part of the lane. Uniformed MPD officers stand around the area, neither intervening nor appearing to participate directly in the arrest.

The video was posted by Will Allen-DuPraw, whose profile says that he is a photographer and videographer based in DC, on Sept. 2. Allen-DuPraw wrote in [the post](https://bcat-archive.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/no-dups/414743e9e3b90a2db8300e1f/474c67b3ea7a49e29ebe9bb6.html) that bystanders reported that authorities were stopping Latino men on scooters along Florida Avenue Northwest, a major road in Washington DC, and had arrested two.

[An urgent alert](https://stopice.net/login/?alert=TUESEP2094119PDT2025alert) sent out on the morning of the same day by Stop ICE Alerts, a community-driven alert network for those affected by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, reported similar information. The alert said that ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – a branch of ICE focused on investigating transnational crime – and MPD were “stopping Latinos on scooters” and had arrested one or two people along Florida Avenue Northwest.

With US President Donald Trump’s [crackdown on immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention), scenes of federal agents detaining people while accusing them of immigration offences have been cropping up all over social media from around the country. An [analysis of ICE arrest data](https://www.cato.org/blog/1/5-ice-arrests-are-latinos-streets-no-criminal-past-or-removal-order) by DC-based think tank Cato Institute found that in June and July alone, ICE conducted almost 9,000 street arrests nationwide of immigrants who had no criminal convictions, charges, or removal orders. About 90 percent of these were immigrants from Latin America.

The incident on Florida Avenue Northwest was one of 42 that Bellingcat and our partner Evident Media geolocated and verified using videos and photos from social media and news reports. These showed federal agent encounters in the capital, in the month or so since Trump’s [federal takeover](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cj9ww4z39xko) of DC on August 11. The full dataset can be downloaded [here](https://bellingcat-embeds.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025-us-border-patrol/dc_incidents_augtosep_25.csv).

In the three weeks after DC was placed under federal control, Trump’s administration said [more than 300 people](https://wtop.com/dc/2025/08/arrests-top-1000-in-d-c-federal-law-enforcement-surge/) without legal immigration status were arrested in the District.

Like previous immigration raids that we documented [in Los Angeles](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/07/08/masked-armed-and-forceful-finding-patterns-in-los-angeles-immigration-raids/), the federal agents involved in the DC cases were often masked and in military wear. Some wore generic “Police” vests, while others had attire indicating specific government entities such as ICE and HSI. The vehicles they used were usually unmarked, with plates from a variety of US states.

There is one key difference, however. In LA, a [state law](https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-local-law-enforcement-and-immigration-under-california-0) prohibits local law enforcement from using its resources for immigration enforcement in most cases. But in DC, where no such law applies, [MPD has frequently been seen working with federal officers](https://51st.news/ice-presence-mpd-fears-dc-takeover/) since the federal takeover last month.

In half of the incidents in our dataset, local DC law enforcement could be seen working alongside federal agents. Most of the DC local police were from MPD, though some were from the Metro Transit Police Department. Aside from ICE and HSI, agents from federal agencies including the US Park Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were also seen in the videos.

“We are definitely seeing MPD cooperate at a level we’ve never seen before, and it is resulting in people getting arrested and sent to detention,” Michael Lukens, who runs immigrant rights centre [Amica](https://amicacenter.org/), told Evident Media.

MPD has not replied to Evident Media’s queries about their cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies as of publication.
