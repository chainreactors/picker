BreachForums, an underground cybercrime forum that made a reputation for being the go-to place for buying and selling hacked personal data, is officially no more.

The site has closed down on its own, but the decision to shutter all operations for good comes after a very turbulent four days.

Last Friday, the FBI detained the forum's main administrator—a New York man named Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, aka Pompompurin—after the personal data of US lawmakers and their staff was [posted for sale on the site](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/at-least-17-congress-members-sensitive-information-data-breach/).

On the same day, an individual named Baphomet took over the forum. In a message posted on the site, Baphomet promised at the time to move the forum to new infrastructure in order to protect the identities of its users from any potential law enforcement seizure.

Both the clear web and dark web versions of BreachForums went down on Monday, and it was initially believed the downtime was most likely caused by Baphomet's attempts to move the site to new servers.

This was, however, not the case. In a follow-up message posted on Tuesday, Baphomet said BreachForums would shut down for good because the site "is not safe anymore."

Baphomet says that while migrating the site, they found evidence that "*the glowies*" (aka [government agents](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glowie)) gained access to Pompompurin's machine and had accessed some CDN servers that were part of the BreachForums backend.

Baphomet's explanation for the decision to shut down BreachForums is most likely accurate, as law enforcement officials have most likely seized computer equipment from Pompompurin's house during the arrest.

However, the downfall of BreachForums does not mean the end of the hacked data trading ecosystem, which has previously survived multiple similar takedowns.

BreachForums itself is a reincarnation of another forum named RaidForum, which was [seized and taken down](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-leads-seizure-one-world-s-largest-hacker-forums-and-arrests-administrator) by EU and US law enforcement in April last year. In fact, BreachForums is an almost pixel-perfect clone of the original RaidForums, which is why it became so popular so quickly, ensuring most RaidForum users migrated over.

While Baphomet touted possible plans for a new platform where the BreachForums userbase can migrate, they expect the community to split and get absorbed by other existing cybercrime platforms.

Recorded Future CTI researcher Alexander Leslie shares Baphomet's assessment.

"Most of the low-tier stuff — combolists, leads, log dumps, etc. — will probably be redirected to other English-language forums. Think Cracked, Nulled, etc. The initial access, database leak, and ransomware communities will likely go to XSS and Exploit," Leslie wrote in a [long thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20230321161349/https%3A//twitter.com/aejleslie/status/1638191389627260929) on the aftermath of BreachForums' demise.

"The threat landscape will continue to evolve, despite the closure of BreachForums," he added.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Ferrari extortion:** Sports car maker [Ferrari says](https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/cyber-incident-in-ferrari) a hacker recently contacted its Italian branch and demanded a ransom payment in regard to certain customer contact details they appear to have obtained. The company says it contacted law enforcement and will not pay the ransom as a matter of policy. A source with knowledge of the incident told *[DataBreaches.net](https://www.databreaches.net/ferrari-hacked-doesnt-pay-1-million-ransom-demand/)* this is a new incident and not related to a [ransomware attack](https://www.redhotcyber.com/post/la-ferrari-e-stata-colpita-dal-ransomware-ransomexx-7gb-di/) carried out by the RansomExx gang in October of last year.

**Latitude hack:** Australian financial services company Latitude says the personal information of almost 330,000 customers was stolen in a security breach. The company says the breach took place after a threat actor obtained a Latitude employee's login credentials, which they used to log into its network and steal data stored on the network of two service providers. Stolen information includes identification documents, with the bulk being copies of customer driver's licenses.

**Euler hack linked to NK:** Blockchain analysis company [Chainalysis says](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/euler-finance-flash-loan-attack/) it spotted $175,000 (100 ETH) from the Euler Finance hack move to an address that previously received funds stolen from the Axie Infinity Ronin Bridge incident, a hack formally linked to North Korea's Lazarus hacking group. Despite the discovery, Chainalysis says it was not ready to link the Euler exploit to Lazarus operators, as this could be a "misdirection by another hacking group" and because only a very tiny portion of the $197 million stolen funds was transfe...
