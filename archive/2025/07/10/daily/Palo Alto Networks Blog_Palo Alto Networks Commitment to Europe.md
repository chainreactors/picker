# Building Trust in the Digital Age

Over the last decade, the adoption of digital technologies has brought unprecedented opportunities for innovation, economic growth and improved public services. As governments and businesses around the world accelerate the integration of new technologies, such as AI, ensuring the security and integrity of data has become imperative. Amid rising geopolitical tensions and growing cyber threats, trust is now more than ever a critical foundation for digital progress. Many of the regulatory frameworks in Europe, such as [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/), [NIS2,](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) [DORA](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) and the [AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai), are designed to foster digital progress as well as manage associated risks. These frameworks call for solutions that deliver not only strong cybersecurity and operational resilience but also support for organizations to retain control over their data.

## Our Five Pillars in Support of Europe’s Digital Future

Palo Alto Networks has built a strong presence and extensive operations across Europe, aligning with the critical objectives of the regulatory frameworks. As a trusted partner to tens of thousands of organizations across the continent, we empower them to prevent cyber breaches and navigate an ever-evolving threat landscape. Our commitment extends beyond compliance, it is built on creating partnerships that advance our shared commitment to Europe’s values, laws and strategic ambitions. This commitment is structured around five foundational pillars, designed to provide unparalleled security, control and assurance.

**![Our five pillars in support of Europe's digital future.](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/word-image-341442-4.png)**

### Pillar 1: Customer Control Over Data

We believe that digital autonomy begins with direct control over your data. Palo Alto Networks empowers our customers with the necessary capabilities to meet data governance requirements in Europe and around the world.

* **EU Data Residency for Customer Data:** We provide the capability for our customers to host the data we process on their behalf within the European Union. This commitment ensures that your critical data remains in a tenant location that you select, aligned with your regional compliance mandates and the highest standards of data protection providing granular control over geographical data storage. This choice is foundational to our customers’ digital autonomy and strengthens their confidence in our service.

* **Customers Choice in Data Provision:** Our customers retain control over what data they choose to provide to Palo Alto Networks for processing as part of delivering our products and services.
* **Customer-Managed Encryption:** For applicable products and services, we offer Bring Your Own Encryption Keys (BYOK) capabilities. This feature is an additional layer of security that enables customers to manage the encryption keys used to protect their data.
* **Customer Data Is Processed Solely to Deliver the Service:** We process customer data exclusively and strictly for the purpose of delivering our products and services, in accordance with applicable laws and robust contractual commitments.

### Pillar 2: Transparency and Accountability around Government Requests for Data

We are dedicated to protecting data and have committed to notifying customers if and when their personal data is subject to a government request. We believe this transparency is key to maintaining the trust of our partners.

* **Publicly Documented Process for Responding to Government Requests:** Our [process](/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/how-palo-alto-networks-responds-to-government.pdf) for responding to government requests for personal data is rigorous and transparent. This process is designed to meticulously scrutinize every request, leveraging available legal mechanisms to protect customers within applicable jurisdictions.
* **Consistent Global Transparent Reporting:** We publish a comprehensive biannual [Transparency Report](/content/dam/pan/en_US/assets/pdf/legal/transparency-report.pdf), detailing all government and law enforcement requests for personal data that we receive. This reporting reflects our dedication to provide verifiable proof of our commitment to protecting data.

### Pillar 3: Investing in Robust, Resilient and Secure European Infrastructure

Palo Alto Networks is committed to operational resilience and security by making substantial and enduring investments in its European infrastructure. We aim to deliver high-performance security and reliability when and where you need it.

* **Geographically Distributed, Resilient EU Infrastructure:** Our European infrastructure is designed for maximum availability and continuous service delivery. With a geographically dispersed, multiregion presence within the European Union, we aim to ensure exceptional operational resilience. We are safeguarding against localized disruptions, and minimizing latency for our European customers, while enhancing their user experience and critical service continuity.
* **Expanding and Localized European Presence:** We are continuing to invest in Europe with a growing [physical footprint](https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/about-us/locations). Our EMEA headquarters is based in Amsterdam, supported by offices strategically located in other key European cities, including Paris, Madrid, London, Munich and many others.
* **Dedicated Security, Engineering and Customer Support:** We are further developing our dedicated security operations, engineering and support teams within the EU. These European-based teams provide specialized expertise, leveraging their deep regional understanding to support the continuous monitoring, management and security of our global infrastructure and services. Working alongside our global experts, their local presence ensures timely, localized customer support.

### Pillar 4. Compliance with EU Laws and Active Partnership with European Regulators

The European regulatory landscape is dynamic and complex. More than just focusing on rudimentary compliance, we are dedicated to staying ahead of current and forthcoming regulatory frameworks and actively enabling our EU customers to meet their own evolving obligations.

* **Proactive Adherence to Applicable EU Regulations:** We are committed to complying with and actively supporting our EU customers to meet their obligations under applicable European regulations. This includes, but is not limited to GDPR, NIS2, DORA and the forthcoming AI Act. For example, Palo Alto Networks was part of the initial group of signatories and the first pure-play cybersecurity provider to sign the [AI Pact](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-pact), committing to applying the principles of the AI Act. Further, we proactively monitor legislative developments, adapt our offerings and provide expert guidance to ensure our solutions support our customers’ compliance journey.
