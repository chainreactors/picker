# The 3 biggest cybersecurity threats to small businesses

Posted: May 1, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

In an online world filled with extraordinarily sophisticated cyberattacks—including organized assaults on software supply chains, state-directed exploitations of undiscovered vulnerabilities, and the novel and malicious use of [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet))—small businesses are forced to prioritize a different type of cyberattack: The type that gets through.

Without robust IT budgets or fully staffed cybersecurity departments, small businesses often rely on their own small stable of workers (including sole proprietors with effectively zero employees) to stay safe online. That means that what worries these businesses most in cybersecurity is what is most likely to work against them.

Here are the three biggest cybersecurity threats to small businesses right now. They may sound basic or even crude, but they are the biggest threats precisely because they are so effective.

## 1. Phishing

In [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) scams, cybercriminals trick people and businesses into handing over [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) like credit card numbers or login details for vital online accounts.

Cybercriminals do this by sending messages—like emails and texts—disguised as legitimate communications from major businesses (think Slack, Uber, FedEx, and Google). These messages frequently warn recipients about a problem with their accounts, like a password that needs to be updated, a policy change that requires a login, or a delayed package that has to be approved.

But when victims follow the links within these malicious messages, they are brought to a website that, while appearing genuine, is completely controlled by cybercriminals. Lured in by similar color schemes, company logos, and familiar layouts, victims “log in” to their account by entering their username and password. In reality, those usernames and passwords are delivered directly to cybercriminals on the other side of the website.

In phishing attacks, there never is a genuine problem with a user’s account, and there never is a real request for information from the company. Instead, the entire back-and-forth is a charade.

As devastating as this is, the more complex threat of phishing lies in its adaptability. Whereas early phishing scams arrived almost entirely through emails, modern phishing scams can reach victims through malicious websites, text messages, social media, and even [mobile app downloads](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/phishing-evolves-beyond-email-to-become-latest-android-app-threat).

In 2024, Malwarebytes found more than 22,800 phishing apps on [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus), according to the recent [2025 State of Malware report](https://www.threatdown.com/dl-state-of-malware-2025/). Disguised as apps such as TikTok, Spotify, and WhatsApp, these Android apps can trick victims into handing over their associated usernames and passwords when asking them to login.

Understandably, some small business owners might discount the threat of losing their login credentials to consumer too...
