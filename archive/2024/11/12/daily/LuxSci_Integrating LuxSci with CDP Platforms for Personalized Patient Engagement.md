# Integrating LuxSci with CDP Platforms for Personalized Patient Engagement

November 11th, 2024

As patient expectations evolve, healthcare providers, payers and suppliers are making increasing use of Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) to deliver timely, personalized communications. However, when it comes to managing sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI), HIPAA compliance is essential. Integrating LuxSci with CDP platforms offers a secure way to better engage with patients while maintaining privacy and security standards.

### **What Is a CDP?**

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is an application that acts as a central repository for data within your organization. A CDP consolidates data from various sources, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, social media channels, and more to create a comprehensive unified customer profile. In healthcare, a HIPAA-compliant CDP ensures that all patient interactions comply with strict data protection laws, safeguarding PHI in ways that optimize personalization without compromising privacy.

### **Why Integrate CDP Platforms with HIPAA-Compliant Email?**

For healthcare companies, the current range of CDP solutions allows them to successfully integrate data from CRMs, patient portals, mobile apps, and other places personal data and PHI may reside. Consequently, email platforms are a logical extension. HIPAA-compliant email brings CDPs a new source of intelligence on areas like deliverability, engagement and preferences, while allowing organizations to securely transmit PHI in messages to deliver highly personalized, highly relevant communications that improve results.

Let’s examine a few of the benefits of integrating LuxSci’s HIPAA-compliant email platform with your CDP for better campaign performance and results:

* **Enhanced Personalization Options**:  by consolidating data from multiple sources, healthcare organizations can better segment patient subpopulations and personalize communications based on an individual’s health status, conditions, history, and more. Examples of more effective messaging this enables include appointment reminders, proposed treatment plans, and product offers and upgrades.
* **Seamless Multichannel Engagement**: patients and customers receive consistent communications across email, text, patient portals, mobile apps and other channels. This enables providers, payers and suppliers to deliver more connected and effective healthcare journeys.
* **Real-Time Updates**: on a related note, integration with a CDP allows for instantaneous updates to engagement data, ensuring the unified view you have on each patient stays current and the communications you send them are as applicable and valuable as possible.
* **Higher Engagement & Conversion Rates**: personalized messages resonate more with patients and lead to them being more active in their healthcare journey, resulting in greater satisfaction with the companies they deal with, increased adherence to treatment and usage of products, and overall better health outcomes.

### **Leading CDP Solutions**

Here are a few examples of widely-used CDP Solutions, in addition to their suitability for healthcare outreach efforts:

* **Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)**: one of the most popular CDP platforms on the market, AEP offers a secure, scalable solution for managing patient engagement campaigns, underpinned by its advanced analytical and marketing tools. That said, AEP is *not* a HIPAA-compliant CDP solution.
* **RedPoint Global**: praised for its strong identity resolution and real-time engagement capabilities, RedPoint Global allows for seamless, HIPAA-compliant patient interactions and, consequently, supports healthcare-specific marketing use cases.
* **Salesforce Health Cloud**: enables healthcare providers to manage patient data within a secure ecosystem and can be made HIPAA-compliant with the addition of a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Also, while Health Cloud provides the required infrastructure and tools for HIPAA-compliant data security, it’s up to the healthcare organization to configure and use the platform accordingly.
* **Tealium**: a HIPAA-compliant customer data platform with a robust ecosystem of partner integrations for consolidating customer data across web, mobile, IoT devices, and offline sources.
* **Treasure Data**: an experienced CDP provider with a platform tailored towards developers and enterprises; supports HIPAA compliance for healthcare.

### **Case Study: How LuxSci and RedPoint Drive More Effective Healthcare Engagement**

To better illustrate how a HIPAA-compliant communications platform interconnects with a CDP, let’s look at the integration of LuxSci with [RedPoint Global](https://www.redpointglobal.com/cdp/) and how it facilitates secure data exchange and engagement orchestration.

The benefits you reap from such an integration include:

* **Data Synchronization**: RedPoint aggregates patient data, such as demographics, preferences, and engagement history, and synchronizes with LuxSci for advanced email personalization and secure HIPAA-compliant communications.
* **Automated Workflows**: RedPoint and LuxSci can be used to set up automated email workflows, where subsequent messages are triggered by particular events. For instance, an aftercare appointment reminder is sent after a specific amount of time following a patient’s treatment.  These workflows can then be customized via LuxSci’s trigger automation email tools, ensuring timely and relevant delivery that drives patient engagement and desirable outcomes, such as increase leads and sales conversions.
* **Encryption**: both LuxSci and RedPoint Global encrypt all PHI, both in transit and at rest, as per [HIPAA requirements](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html). This better safeguards patient data, ensuring it can’t be interpreted by malicious actors in the event of its interception or exfiltration during a data breach.  Additionally, real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities allow healthcare organizations to stay compliant and adapt to changes in patient data quickly.
* **Continuous Testing and Monitoring**: this allows you to determine the effectiveness of your engagement campaigns and refine them accordingly for optimal results.

### **Conclusion**

Integrating HIPAA-compliant communications solutions like LuxSci with CDPs empowers healthcare companies to craft more meaningful, timely,  and consistent communications with their patients and customers. This personalized approach to patient engagement enables efficient, effective and above all, compliant communication strategies that deliver better outcomes and results.
