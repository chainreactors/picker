## I’m Spending the Year at the Munk School

This academic year, I am taking a sabbatical from the Kennedy School and Harvard University. (It’s not a real sabbatical—I’m just an adjunct—but it’s the same idea.) I will be spending the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters at the [Munk School](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

I will be organizing a reading group on AI security in the fall. I will be teaching my cybersecurity policy class in the Spring. I will be working with [Citizen Lab](https://citizenlab.ca/), the [Law School](https://www.law.utoronto.ca/), and the [Schwartz Reisman Institute](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/). And I will be enjoying all the multicultural offerings of Toronto.

It’s all pretty exciting.

Who is there for you to collaborate with? Any new investigations or projects?

Welcome! I see your name is already on the Munk website as an Adjunct Professor, but I’m not seeing any further info. As a UofT (but not Munk) student back to school after 50 years, how would I engage further? Classes start the week of Sept 1, I believe, so time is short. Thanks.

Hello, Bruce

Long time old friend. During life’s journeys our paths crossed during my transition to becoming a young man. I always held your work and thoughtform in high regard. Life is full of journeys and this the next step for you. You are fortunate to be able to do this and its the next step in your evolution. I know in my hearts of hearts you will be forged by of fire of silence.

Bruce : I will be spending the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters at the Munk School at the University of Toronto.

Citizen’s Lab boss is Ron Deibert.

Who participated in a CBC podcast “The Current” on

The Current Worry many have about travelling across U.S. border, and what you can do to hopefully make life easier,

<https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-63-the-current/clip/16143737-worried-travelling-across-u.s.-border-listen>

Whilst this is from the ‘Canadian to US transit’ perspective, in these turbulent times things change very rapidly. But certain base rules are based on international law in most Western Nations.

Oh and remember “Continental Climate” with upto 2ft snow, 22f average temps. So, Good walking-boots/stout-shoes, thick socks, heavy trousers, warm Hat, Warm coat, warm gloves can be advantageous and remember in those conditions you need to drink about twice as much water as you would for “temperate climate”.

Congrats. I look forward to your posts on squid encounters or whatever else you find interesting in Toronto.
