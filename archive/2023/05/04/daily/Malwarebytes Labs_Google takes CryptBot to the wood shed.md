# Google takes CryptBot to the wood shed

Posted: May 3, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Google is in the [midst of a legal campaign](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/google_cryptbot_shutdown/) designed to take down the creators of a very persistent piece of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) called CryptBot. This malware, which Google [claims compromised roughly 670k computers](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/continuing-our-work-to-hold-cybercriminal-ecosystems-accountable/), set about infecting users of the Chrome browser. Unfortunately for the malware campaign operators, Google’s *not* impressed.

This legal campaign focuses on shutting down domains associated with the stealer. The lawsuit [unsealed this week](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/04/28/handout_google_cryptbot_complaint.pdf) reveals Google’s line of approach for tackling CryptBot’s alleged primary distributors, located in Pakistan.

It’s easy to see what piqued Google’s interest in this infection campaign. A big part of the CryptBot tactics on display involved offering up cracked or modified versions of popular Google products. The products were secretly infected with CryptBot, which would then go on to try and plunder credentials from the infected systems. From the complaint document:

> (The) defendants’ criminal scheme is perpetrated via a pay-per-install (“PPI”) network known as “360installer,” which fosters the creation of websites that offer illegally modified software (“Cracked Software Sites”).
>
> These websites offer software infected with CryptBot malware, such as maliciously modified versions of Google Chrome and Google Earth Pro, and also cracked third party software. The Malware Distribution Enterprise operated by Defendants in this case is one of the primary means of spreading the CryptBot malware to new victims.

Google highlights that CryptoBot targets users of Chrome. When it notices Chrome is installed on a PC, it attempts to “locate, collect, and extract user credentials saved to Chrome”. This can be logins, [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) methods, private data, and several types of payment information, such as card details and cryptocurrencies.

This attempt at a takedown by Google isn’t just focused on the code side of things. There’s also a trademark component, and the search giant is none too happy about their familiar product icons being used for malware-related purposes. From the blogpost:

> The legal complaint is based on a variety of claims, including computer fraud and abuse and trademark infringement. To hamper the spread of CryptBot, the court has granted a temporary restraining order to bolster our ongoing technical disruption efforts against the distributors and their infrastructure. The court order allows us to take down current and future domains that are tied to the distribution of CryptBot. This will slow new infections from occurring and decelerate the growth of CryptBot.

As [The Register notes](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/27/google_cryptbot_shutdown/), this goes beyond the usual restraining order approach where URL registries falling under the court’s jurisdiction must shut down rogue domains. Hardware and virtual machines can be turned off,  network providers can kill server connections powering CryptoBot, and steps can be taken to keep the infrastructure offline permanently.

In other words, the CryptoBot f...
