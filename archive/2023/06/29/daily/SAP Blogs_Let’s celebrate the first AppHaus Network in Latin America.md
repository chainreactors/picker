Hello, Integration Innovators

Welcome back to #IntegrationForYou a series of posts about how to integrate with SAP. We dedicate our content to startups that want to become SAP Partners, but everyone is welcome!

Today I am here to share some news with you all. Who doesn't love a good gossip, right?

Did you know that São Paulo now also has an AppHaus to call its own? ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@D5B60FFD43F3456C6831F3387D779148/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

In celebration of the newest and first [AppHaus Network](https://apphaus.sap.com/location/sao-paulo) office in Latin America, today I bring you 3 Discovery Center missions that you can't miss.

**1)** [Simplify connectivity to any application with Integration Suite - Open Connectors](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3097/3117/)

Start the next level of low-code integration. Accelerate connectivity with third-party cloud applications using the Open Connectors capability of SAP Integration Suite. It provides prebuilt and feature-rich connectors to simplify the connectivity and seamless integration with over 170 non-SAP cloud applications. Customers benefit from connectivity to third-party APIs via harmonized RESTful APIs and can develop and map canonical data models to extend prebuilt connectors.

**2)** [Keep the Core Clean Using SAP Build Apps with SAP S/4HANA](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/4024/4228/)

You don't want to impact on your customer's clean core, right? Use the SAP Build Apps, a no-code platform, to create a unique and innovative UI without changing the core functionality of your SAP S/4HANA Cloud or your SAP S/4HANA on-premise system.

**3)** [Develop extensions for SAP S/4HANA with SAP BTP, ABAP Environment, runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3248/3277/)

Do you want to help your customer and develop an application that they can use inside S/4HANA? Last week a Startup asked me if they could develop extensions for S/4HANA, of course you can! In this mission will guide you to build side-by-side extensions for an SAP S/4HANA backend system in an SAP BTP ABAP Environment system. You will create your own transactional Fiori elements app with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP) and use remote-enabled APIs (an OData service and a SOAP Web Service) provided by an SAP S/4HANA backend system to leverage existing data in SAP S/4HANA thereby extending existing functionality in a side-by-side scenario.

And because I'm nice and I like you guys, here's an extra mission:

[Get Started with SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP), SAP Fiori, and SAP HANA Cloud](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/4273/4534/)

CAP is my darling, and good things shouldn't be kept, but shared. The goal of this mission is to create a basic CAP application using data model, service and a Fiori application in SAP Business Application Studio.

By the way, have you ever visited [AppHaus website](https://apphaus.sap.com/)?

They have a toolkit with a complete guide where you can start or improve innovation in your company and with your customers using the SAP methodology.

I hope you enjoyed the content and these missions I've selected especially for you.
