You know those moments when you just wish you could learn something new without it taking forever?

Whether it's picking up a new language, mastering an instrument, or diving into a new hobby, most of the time it feels like there's just not enough time in the day.

I want to pick up new hobbies, and I wanted to find a way to do it quicker.

So, I spent a week listening to podcast, watching interviews, and reading a dozen articles and research papers.

Now, I’m breaking it down for you.

That way, we both have a library of condensed research meant to help us engineer our existence, earn more, and live with purpose.

So let’s get into it, shall we?

## **The Myth of 10,000 Hours**

First, let’s tackle the elephant in the room: the 10,000-hour rule.

I’m sure you’ve heard of this before.

This idea claims that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill.

Sounds like a lifetime, right?

Well, I think this rule is a bit of a misinterpretation.. let me explain.

The original research by Dr. K. Anders Ericsson focused on elite performers—think chess grandmasters, world-class musicians, and Olympic athletes.

These guys are aiming for the absolute peak of performance, not just getting good enough to impress your friends at a party.

The thing is, you can get pretty damn good at almost anything with just **20 hours of focused, deliberate practice**.

Yup. you read that right—20 hours.

Suddenly, learning something new feels possible, even if you don’t have a lot of time on your hands.

## **The Two-Stage Learning Process**

So, how do we make the most of those 20 hours?

Dr. Andrew Huberman breaks it down into a two-stage process: **active engagement** and **rest**. Let's dig into this because it’s important.

### **Active Engagement and Focus**

When you're learning something new, like conversational Spanish or playing the ukulele, deep focus is your best friend.

This kind of focus releases [acetylcholine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24568-acetylcholine-ach?utm_source=www.engineeryourexistence.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-learn-anything-fast&ref=hackernoon.com), a neurotransmitter that acts like a highlighter in your brain, marking the areas that need to change and grow.

Think of it as priming your brain to absorb new information.

### **Rest and Sleep**

Now—the actual rewiring of your brain happens during deep sleep or rest-like states.

A 20-minute nap or engaging in non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocols within four hours of learning can significantly speed up the learning process.

It’s kind of like giving your brain a chance to marinate in everything you’ve just learned. We previously talked about this concept in the [problem-solving](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-should-forget-everything-you-know-about-problem-solving?ref=hackernoon.com) edition a while back.

Imagine you’re marinating a steak. The active engagement is like adding all those spices and sauces, and the rest and sleep is the time the steak spends soaking up all those flavors.

You wouldn’t skip the marinating time and expect a great steak—would you?

Right..

Same goes for your brain.

## **My Journey into Rapid Learning**

This year, as I travel and write, I find myself with more time to explore new interests.

But being an optimization junkie, I can't resist the urge to streamline my learning process.

This drive for efficiency started when I worked as a consultant in the hospitality industry. Back then, I read "The 4-Hour Work Week," and one concept stuck with me: if you’re paid for 10 hours of work but can complete it in half the time, you’re effectively doubling your hourly rate.

This idea sparked my journey into hyper-optimization. It was 2014.

This allowed me to learn the skills I needed, pass the 63 hour real estate license while still working full time, which ultimately lead me to start and scale my real estate investment firm to 7 figures in under 3 years.

Fast forward to today. Yes, I do have more time. But I still crave the endless pursuit of optimization.

If I can learn something in 20 hours instead of 40, I’m all in.

What this means for me is that I can tackle two skills per week, doubling my learning speed. Multiply that by a year, and the potential for growth is enormous.

Anyway. Back to the learning.

**Introducing Josh Kaufman’s Method**

Enter Josh Kaufman’s method.. which suggests you can learn anything in just 20 hours.

Here’s the breakdown:

## **The 20-Hour Method**

1. **Deconstruct the Skill**: Break down the skill into smaller, manageable parts. For instance, if you want to learn the ukulele, start with the four basic chords used in most songs.
2. **Learn Enough to Self-Correct**: Gather 3-5 resources (books, videos, courses) about the skill. Learn just enough to practice and correct your mistakes as you go. Avoid the trap of over-preparation.
3. **Remove Barriers to Practice**: Eliminate distractions like TV and social media. Create a dedicated space and time for practice.
4. **Practice for at Least 20 Hours**: Commit to practicing for at least 20 hours. Push through the initial frustration barrier, where you feel disgustingly incompetent. This is where most people give up, but if you persist, you’ll see significant improvement.

### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Skill**

This step is all about breaking the skill down into bite-sized chunks. Let’s say you want to learn the ukulele.

You don’t need to learn every possible chord right away. Focus on the basics—G, D, Em, and C chords. These four chords will get you through most pop songs.

It’s like learning to cook. You don’t start with a five-course meal; you start with a simple recipe.

### **Step 2: Learn Enough to Self-Correct**

Gather just a handful of resources. This could be a couple of books, a few YouTube videos, or an online course. The goal is to learn enough to practice and correct your mistakes. Don’t fall into the trap of endless preparation.

I’ve been there—buying 20 books on a subject and thinking I need to read them all before I start.

That’s just procrastination dressed up as productivity.

### **Step 3: Remove Barriers to Practice**

Eliminate distractions. Turn off the TV, put your phone on airplane mode, and create a practice space that’s free from interruptions. It’s like setting up your own little learning sanctuary.

The fewer distractions, the better your focus, and the quicker you learn.

### **Step 4: Practice for at Least 20 Hours**

This is where the magic happens. Commit to practicing for 20 hours. The first few hours will be tough—you’ll feel awkward and incompetent.

That’s normal.

Push through it. Think of it like working out. The first few sessions are the hardest, but once you get past that initial hurdle, it gets easier, and the results start to show.

## **The Neuroscience of Learning**

To deepen my understanding, I turned to neuroscience. Dr. Tara Swart highlights six critical ingredients for effective learning:

* **Attention**
* **Alertness**
* **Sleep**
* **Repetition**
* **Breaks**
* **Mistakes**

### **Attention**

Focused attention is crucial. Avoid multitasking and frequent context switching, which impair your ability to retain information.

Try attention-enhancing activities like focused meditation or exercise to improve your concentration. Think of your brain like a spotlight—shine it on one thing at a time for the best results.
