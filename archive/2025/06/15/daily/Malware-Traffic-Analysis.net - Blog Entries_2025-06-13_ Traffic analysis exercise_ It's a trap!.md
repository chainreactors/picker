This is more a "traffic analysis opportunity" instead of a traffic analysis exercise.  I'm just providing the traffic and some forensic analysis.

## LAN SEGMENT DETAILS FROM THE PCAP

* LAN segment range:  **10.6.13[.]0/24**   (**10.6.13[.]0** through **10.6.13[.]255**)
* Domain:  **massfriction[.]com**
* Active Directory (AD) domain controller:  **10.6.13[.]3 - WIN-DQL4WFWJXQ4**
* AD environment name:  **MASSFRICTION**
* LAN segment gateway:  **10.6.13[.]1**
* LAN segment broadcast address:  **10.6.13[.]255**

If you've followed the tutorials I've linked to elsewhere on this blog, you should be able to answer the following:

* What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
* What is the mac address of the infected Windows client?
* What is the host name of the infected Windows client?
* What is the user account name from the infected Windows client?

I'm not going to post any answers, so feel free to do what you will with the data.  In the meanwhile, the following images illustrate some possible analysis techiques.
