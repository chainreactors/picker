*In Spring 2023, the Zcash Foundation engaged NCC Group to conduct a security assessment of the Zebrad application. Zebrad is a network client that participates in the Zcash consensus mechanism by validating blocks, maintaining the blockchain state (best chain and viable non-finalized chains), and gossiping blocks, transactions, and peer addresses. Five consultants performed the review, in a total of 60 person-days.  The Zebra repository on branch `audit-v1.0.0-rc.0` was in scope, with the following modules highlighted as the main areas of focus: `zebra-chain`, `zebra-client`, `zebra-consensus`, `zebra-network`, `zebra-node-services`, `zebra-rpc`, `zebra-script`, `zebra-state`, `zebra-utils`.*
