# Weekly Update 330

14 January 2023

Big week! So big, in fact, that I rushed into this week's update less prepared and made it a very casual one, which is just fine ðŸ˜Š It's mostly password books and kitchen equipment this week, both topics which had far more engagement than I expected but made them all the more interesting. Next week I'll get back into the pattern of switching between last thing Friday and first thing Friday so it'll be my morning again on the 20th, see you then!
