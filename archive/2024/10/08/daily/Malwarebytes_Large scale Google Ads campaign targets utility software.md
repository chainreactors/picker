# Large scale Google Ads campaign targets utility software

Posted: October 7, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

After what seemed like a long hiatus, we’ve observed threat actors returning to [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) to drop [malware disguised as software downloads](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/poseidon-mac-stealer-distributed-via-google-ads). The campaign we identified is high-impact, going after utility software such as Slack, Notion, Calendly, Odoo, Basecamp, and others. For this blog, we decided to focus on the Mac version of communication tool Slack.

Following the creation of advertiser identities belonging to real businesses, the threat actors launch their malicious ads, hiding their infrastructure behind several layers of fingerprinting and cloaking.

We have reported these incidents to Google and the related advertisers have been banned. However, we are still finding new malicious ads and hearing from others seeing the same, indicating that this campaign is not over yet.

## Wanted: Utility software

The threat actor is abusing various platforms to host their payloads, giving insights into what they are choosing to lure in victims. For Windows users, all payloads were found in various GitHub accounts which we have reported already.

For Mac, we saw payloads originating from the same domain via PHP scripts using identifiers. These appear to be created for individual and perhaps time-based downloads. Other links that include the name of the software (i.e. *clockify\_mac.php*) work regardless.

## Impersonating two identities at once

When we searched for Slack from the US, the top Google result was an ad that looked completely trustworthy. It had the brand’s logo, official website and even detailed description.

If you follow this blog, you probably know there is more to it. By clicking on the three dots next to the ad, you can see more information about the advertiser, which in this case is a law firm.

*Note: We understand that most users will not—for lack of time, interest or knowledge—take this step, which is why we offer solutions such as [Malwarebytes Browser Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard) that automatically blocks ads.*

The “My Ad Center” vignette shows that the advertiser was not verified yet, but we were able to access their profile and see their collection of ads. There were four ads in total, and three of them were related to lawyer services using the name and address of a real company in the US.

The Slack ad was somewhat the odd one sticking out but could, in theory, have been promoted by this advertiser. What we believe is the problem with Google ads is how any advertiser can still use the branding ...
