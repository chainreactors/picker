## Zero-Day Exploit in WinRAR File

A zero-day vulnerability in WinRAR is [being exploited](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/08/high-severity-winrar-0-day-exploited-for-weeks-by-2-groups/) by at least two Russian criminal groups:

> The vulnerability seemed to have super Windows powers. It abused [alternate data streams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/c54dec26-1551-4d3a-a0ea-4fa40f848eb3), a Windows feature that allows different ways of representing the same file path. The exploit abused that feature to trigger a previously unknown path traversal flaw that caused WinRAR to plant malicious executables in attacker-chosen file paths %TEMP% and %LOCALAPPDATA%, which Windows normally makes off-limits because of their ability to execute code.

More details in the article.

Wait…

I think we are missing the real headline that WinRar still exists.

This is a “new instance” in a “known Class” of vulnerability.

In a way you can blame Apple and it’s filch from Unix file systems…

Because “alternate data streams” came about as Microsoft wanted to do the same thing but had to do it differently (probably patent reasons).

In essence the idea was a way to group different data type files together as a single entity under an onscreen “Windows icon”.

The thing is on the file system they are “different distinct files” that can be anywhere in the file system. And the “file-name” you see on screen is in turn not a content/data file but a link to a file containing links that get passed not to the OS but to Windows that then pushed them at helper aps.

Thus those links and the actual file types could be anything. Even to the same data content but in different places and later with the expansion from early FAT 8.3 DOS file name format to “whatever” under later FAT format.

It was a useful feature you could use to “hide files” and I used it with a text editor to basically have both a hidden “undo list” and hidden “diff” file and a way to link them back to the text file and a series of entire “back-up” files.

So “Belts n Braces” because NTFS had a flaky reputation when used under the DOS command shell.

WinRAR is also an abomination because it tried to be helpful to “hide stuff from humans” according to some developers notion of what helpful was… (Not mine or most other people I knew at the time).

So the issue was a cludg at the Windows level caused stuff to be added in the wrong way to file systems and in effect developers tried to bypass the OS in between and they “Cods’d it up”.

But the notion of “legacy support” means it all got brought down the time line, even though the early reasons for such things to exist nolonger existed…

Hopefully Microsoft will fix the issues properly, but I very much doubt they will, so expect similar attacks down the line.

No! Not WinRAR!

I am unclear about this being an issue with WinRAR or the RAR fiée format itself ?

@Clive

You can pin Microsoft certificates in WinRAR, drop in Windows modules and DLLs, use a batch script to drop them where required and hide any prompts. Make it a self-executable and have it automatically reboot the system if needed. Then Windows clobbers its own security.

It is extremely helpful. You could even use it to silently drop spyware after extracting a benign document that is entirely legitimate without the recipient being any wiser.

–

Spyware will not remain restricted to government use. It can find its way into criminal hands. An unregulated market for powerful surveillance tools risks both national security and public safety.

“U.S. actions to undermine the rule of law, politicize intelligence and undercut civil society will legitimize similar actions by dictators and despots the world over.”

Canada and the United states are securing a plethora of new surveillance technologies.

@ ResearcherZero,

With regards to the macleans link article…

Since from before this blog, I started warning people about surveillance issues and over that time I’ve warned about those the article identifies and one or two more besides.

But people did not want to know some called me “paranoid” or worse, others openly attacked me and accused me of in effect hurting them. However my points have been proved over and over.

To see this in action search back on this site to when I first telling people disabling javascript was a wise idea… Today most accept the logic or wisdom behind it, some still do it begrudgingly. Any way we got the early advert blockers that disabled javascript or stopped questionable javascript running. A clear indication that peoples thinking was changing. Whilst I as an individual have not recently been told I’m destroying their jobs, profit, etc, there are still companies that insist you have javascript enabled. And as I noted yesterday in Germany on company is taking it through the German Federal court system (search for “Axel Springer” which is a publishing mega corp (SE) and “adBlock” company “Eyeo” (GmbH).

You will find articles like,

<https://www.heise.de/en/news/Copyright-Springer-vs-Adblock-Plus-enters-another-round-10505898.html>

Which give some of the long running series of defeats for Axel Springer in their attempts to legalise “theft” and considerably worse.

As the article linked above notes,
