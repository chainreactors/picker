Addressing cyber threats before they have a chance to strike or inflict serious damage is by far the best security approach any company can embrace. Achieving this takes a lot of research and proactive threat hunting. The problem here is that it is easy to get stuck in endless arrays of data and end up with no relevant intel.

To avoid this, use these five battle-tested techniques that are certain to improve your company's threat awareness and overall security.

## Finding threats targeting orgs in your region

The most basic, yet high-impact way to learn about the current threat landscape for your company is to go and see what type of attacks other organizations in your region are experiencing.

In most cases, threat actors attempt to target dozens of businesses at the same time as part of a single campaign. This makes it possible to catch the threat early and make correct adjustments in your organization.

### **How it contributes to your security:**

* More targeted and effective defense strategy.
* Accurate threat prioritization.
* Resource optimization.

### **How it works:**

While there are several ways to find out about the current threat landscape in your country, [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5techniques&utm_content=landing&utm_term=171224) provides one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly solutions for this.

It runs a massive public database of analysis reports on the latest malware and phishing samples, which are uploaded to ANY.RUN's sandbox by over 500,000 security professionals worldwide.

Extensive data from each sandbox session is extracted and can be searched through by users via ANY.RUN's [Threat Intelligence (TI) Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5techniques&utm_content=intelligence.any.run&utm_term=171224). The service offers over 40 different parameters, from IP addresses and file hashes to registry keys and mutexes, helping you pinpoint threats using the smallest indicators with accuracy.

Say we want to see what type of phishing threats are targeting organizations in Germany, while excluding URLs from the search (using the NOT operator), as we wish to focus on malicious files specifically. To do this, we can type the following query into TI Lookup:

> [threatName:"phishing" AND submissionCountry:"de" NOT taskType:"url"](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5techniques&utm_content=tasks_lookup1&utm_term=171224#%7B%2522query%2522:%2522threatName:%255C%2522phishing%255C%2522%2520AND%2520submissionCountry:%255C%2522de%255C%2522%2520NOT%2520taskType:%255C%2522url%255C%2522%2522,%2522dateRange%2522:180%7D)

| You can explore each sandbox session shown by TI Lookup |

In seconds, we get a list of public sandbox sessions which include phishing documents, emails, and other types of content submitted to ANY.RUN by users in Germany.

You can observe each session closely completely for free to gain additional insights into the threats and collect invaluable intelligence.

## Checking suspicious system and network artifacts with TI tools

On an average day, security departments at mid-size organizations get hundreds of alerts. Not all of them are properly followed through, which leaves a gap for attackers to exploit. Yet, simply adding one more layer of verifying all the suspicious artifacts with TI tools can potentially save organizations from considerable financial and reputational losses.

### **How it contributes to your security:**

* Early detection of malicious activities.
* Understanding of the tactics and techniques used by attackers.
* Quick incident response to minimize impact.

### **How it works:**

A common scenario for security departments is dealing with unusual IP connections. Since there are many instances of legitimate addresses generating alerts, it's easy for some employees to get complacent and let actual malicious ones slip off the hook.

To eliminate such situations, employees can check all IP addresses in TI Lookup. Here is an example of possible query:
