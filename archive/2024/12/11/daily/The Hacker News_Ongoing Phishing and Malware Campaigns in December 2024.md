Cyber attackers never stop inventing new ways to compromise their targets. That's why organizations must stay updated on the latest threats.

Here's a quick rundown of the current malware and phishing attacks you need to know about to safeguard your infrastructure before they reach you.

## Zero-day Attack: Corrupted Malicious Files Evade Detection by Most Security Systems

The analyst team at [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_campaigns&utm_content=landing&utm_term=101224) recently [shared their analysis of an ongoing zero-day attack](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/corrupted-files-attack/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_campaigns&utm_content=blog&utm_term=101224). It has been active since at least August and still remains unaddressed by most detection software to this day.

The attack involves the use of intentionally corrupted Word documents and ZIP archives with malicious files inside.

| VirusTotal shows 0 detections for one of the corrupted files |

Due to corruption, security systems cannot properly identify the type of these files and run analysis on them, which results in zero threat detections.

| Word will ask the user if they want to restore a corrupted file |

Once these files are delivered to a system and opened with their native applications (Word for docx and WinRAR for zip) they get restored, presenting the victim with malicious contents.

The ANY.RUN sandbox is one of the few tools that detect this threat. It allows users to manually open corrupted malicious files inside a fully interactive cloud VM with their corresponding apps and restore them. This enables you to see what kind of payload the file contains.

| A restored document with a phishing QR code analyzed inside the ANY.RUN sandbox |

Check out [this sandbox session](https://app.any.run/tasks/f0c1fe95-8165-4015-bb58-d9b38a8e9486/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_campaigns&utm_content=task&utm_term=101224) featuring a corrupted Word document. After recovery, we can see that there is a QR code with an embedded phishing link.

## Fileless Malware Attack via PowerShell Script Distributes Quasar RAT

[Another notable recent attack](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/psloramyra-malware-technical-analysis/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_campaigns&utm_content=blog&utm_term=101224) involves the use of a fileless loader called Psloramyra, which drops Quasar RAT onto infected devices.

| ANY.RUN identifies PSLoramyra and its malicious actions |

[This sandbox session](https://app.any.run/tasks/24dbdd79-5ff1-4050-8ac3-9edb348ff923/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=malware_campaigns&utm_content=task&utm_term=101224) shows how, after taking initial foothold on the system, Psloramyra loader employs a LoLBaS (Living off the Land Binaries and Scripts) technique to launch a PowerShell script.
