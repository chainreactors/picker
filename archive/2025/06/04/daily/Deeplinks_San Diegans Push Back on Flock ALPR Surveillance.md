Approaching San Diego’s first annual review of the city's controversial Flock Safety contract, a local coalition is calling on the city council to roll back this dangerous and costly automated license plate reader (ALPR) program.

The [TRUST Coalition](https://sandiegotrust.org/)—a grassroots alliance including [Electronic Frontier Alliance](https://efa.eff.org/) members [Tech Workers Coalition San Diego](https://efa.eff.org/allies/tech-workers-coalition-san-diego) and [techLEAD](https://efa.eff.org/allies/techlead)—has rallied to stop the unchecked spread of ALPRs in San Diego. We’ve previously covered the coalition’s [fight for surveillance oversight](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/san-diego-city-council-breaks-trust), a local effort kicked off by a “smart streetlight” surveillance program five years ago.

In 2024, San Diego installed [hundreds of AI-assisted ALPR cameras](https://webmaps.sandiego.gov/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a70a4dc00702448da5948992b144a98f) throughout the city to document what cars are driving where and when, then making that data accessible for 30 days.

ALPRs like Flock’s don’t prevent crime—they just vacuum up data on everyone who drives past. The resulting [error-prone dragnet](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/11/human-toll-alpr-errors) can then chill speech and be weaponized against marginalized groups, like [immigrants](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/eff-files-new-lawsuit-against-california-sheriff-sharing-alpr-data-ice-and-cbp) and those seeking [trans](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/tr...
