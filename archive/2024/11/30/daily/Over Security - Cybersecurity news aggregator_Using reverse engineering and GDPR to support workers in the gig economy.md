Our session at Privacy Camp 2024

We will be guests of the Privacy Camp 2024 to bring our experiences to a broader audience of privacy experts. We will be moderating a panel that will cover:

* The potential overlap between digital rights activists and platform workers challenges.
* Grassroots approaches to technological empowerment of surveiled workers.
* Legal and technical tools beyond mobile reversing and GDPR to support gig workers

We are organising this panel believing that the gig economy is a space that deserves a strong commitment to accountability and rights, and to talk and engage with actors in the network who can participate in a multidisciplinary approach.
The Privacy Camp represents a gathering of activists and digital rights advocates that has the potential advance the debate around digital investigations in the labour sector.
