Veeam Backup & Replication users are urged to apply the latest patches that fix another critical bug leading to remote code execution (RCE) on backup servers.

Tracked as CVE-2025-23121 with a CVSS v3 score of 9.9, the vulnerability affects only domain-joined backup servers. Veeam's documentation specifically advises against joining servers to domains, but as observed by customers following the [previous B&R RCE in March](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/20/infoseccers_criticize_veeam_over_critical/), very few are aware of this fact.

The previous vulnerability was also a near-maximum severity issue (CVE-2025-23120, 9.9), affecting domain-joined servers. While Veeam didn't state whether the underlying causes were the same, researchers at watchTowr, who were credited with the discovery of CVE-2025-23121 along with CodeWhite, suggested that may be the case.
