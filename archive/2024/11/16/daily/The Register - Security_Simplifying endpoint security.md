Webinar As organizations expand their digital footprint, the range of endpoints - spanning from laptops to IoT devices - continues to grow.

Managing the security of these diverse endpoints has become increasingly complex and time-consuming, especially when relying on multiple, fragmented solutions.

On [November 20th at 11am GMT/8AM ET](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32962/secure-everything-for-every-endpoint), Kaseya experts will discuss how consolidating security tools into a single platform can streamline management and enhance endpoint protection.

Sam Duckett will be telling the Reg's Tim Phillips how a comprehensive, integrated solution that combines multiple security tools and functionalities into a single platform will achieve better results.

Key topics to be covered include:

*- Reducing complexity in endpoint management.*

*- Automating security and backup processes.*

*- Leveraging integrated solutions for better security outcomes.*

[Register for this webinar here](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32962/secure-everything-for-every-endpoint) to discover how unified endpoint management can transform your organization's security posture while reducing operational headaches.
