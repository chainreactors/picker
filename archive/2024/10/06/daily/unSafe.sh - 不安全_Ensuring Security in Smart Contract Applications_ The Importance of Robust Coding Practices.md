When it comes to scalability, smart contract applications are the most advanced blockchain use case, they also use blockchain technology as their base. The benefit of such technology is the trust, safety, and integrity it provides, but as secure as they are, even the blockchain networks (more specific to smart contract networks) can be attacked. They’re automated which means they have their own terms and conditions coded directly in their code.

This makes them able to be compromised because of logic flaws from the coding side and misuse or even potential external threats. Having secure smart contracts excludes a failure of blockchain security. These are the developer steps for securing and maintaining the trust of their smart contracts.

## **Understanding Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**

Rather than jump into best practices for securing smart contracts, it is critical to first grasp where vulnerabilities can occur. Coding faults, logical issues, and external compromise are the most common threats, and often, result in millions of dollars in cash being lost or contracts working improperly. The so-called ‘DAO hack’ of 2016 exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in an Ethereum smart contract to steal $60 million worth of Ether. And this isn’t an isolated example. Without proper security policies, these types of issues continue to happen.

For example, because blockchain is decentralized, unlike a contract written by a lawyer, a smart contract that has been executed ‘cannot be altered’ – a fact that only serves to make it more crucial that developers test their code to the utmost before it goes live.

## **Rigorous Code Auditing and Testing**

Vulnerability elimination during smart contract development cannot be accomplished as effectively without exposing the code to audits and testing. Before deploying smart contracts to mainnet, they are evaluated in debugging, staging, and other test environments. Unit tests should be performed on each deployed function and use cases that each of them has been designed to facilitate.

Besides manual and automatic auditing, one of the most important steps is using both manual and automated auditing technologies. Manual audits are not enough since logic flaws often reside within the code; automated tools such as MythX and Securify have a wider net for detecting bugs such as integer overflows, reentrancy, and DoS.

Another excellent practice is to carry out external audits by specialist information security companies. They provide disinterested opinions and help to find the missing elements. Da Vinci, who is a family guy who also works as a scientist, explains Taoism as an insurmountable revolution where errors have to be accepted and later fixed by informing about their presumable occurrence before they occur. In the best case, a scorer stands useful in approving such conclusions.

## **Avoiding Overcomplicated Logic**

Guaranteeing the convenience of the used interfaces is the first thing to keep in mind while elaborating smart contracts. With sophistical logic, the chances of going wrong and the doors for unnecessary dependencies become too numerous, hence increasing the difficulties in the review and maintenance of the code. Each operation, emitted by a smart contract, has to be kept simple, visible, and short. So, it is necessary to avoid the temptation to try to make a contract multifunctional bathe in highly complex logic.

## **Implementing Upgraded Contract**

An obstacle that comes with smart contracts is their immutability. Once deployed on-chain, the deployed code is acceptable as is, without any amendments. This, however, can be cured through the construction of upgradable contracts, which permit the change of some aspects of a contract after its deployment.

Though this feature enhances flexibility, it may also pose some risks in terms of security if not implemented properly. People working in this area should ensure that the mechanism that enables an upgrade is robust enough to be immune to hostile abuse. The use of the OpenZeppelin proxy library provides proxy patterns that help build convenient upgradeable contracts. Also, escalation controls should be designed in such a way as to protect upgrades from unauthorized initiators.

## **Protecting Against Reentrancy Attack**

Reentrancy stands as a common exploit avenue in smart contracts and has featured prominently in illustrious breaches. This flaw manifests when an external contract triggers a function inside the smart contract while the initial transaction lingers in completion, leading to unanticipated actions. Developers ought to employ checks-effects-interactions strategies to shield against reentrancy threats.

This method involves altering the contract's state ahead of any external calls. Additionally, mutexes may be employed to mitigate reentrancy hazards by limiting concurrent engagements with a contract.

## **Ensuring Proper Gas Utilization**

Skillfully governing gas usage is vital for the fortification of smart contracts. Gas fuels transactions on networks like Ethereum, and contracts guzzling too much gas risk falling prey to DoS attacks. Excessive gas use might cause a contract to malfunction, potentially trapping funds or freezing the contract.

To avert this risk, developers must refine their code for efficiency, trimming redundant calculations and outside requests. Establishing suitable gas limits during contract execution is key to staving off DoS attacks due to gas exhaustion, thus protecting the contracts.

## **Leverage Decentralized Oracle With Caution**

Numerous smart contracts hinge on external data for their functionality, often sourced from decentralized entities called oracles. These oracles serve as conduits between the blockchain and the tangible world but also represent a potential vulnerability as a target for attacks. Should an assailant seize an oracle, it might supply erroneous information to the smart contract, leading to flawed outcomes.

To mitigate such risks, developers should turn to decentralized oracles with a robust track record of reliability. Employing diverse data sources to cross-verify information can also diminish the likelihood of manipulation. Moreover, developers must embed contingency measures within the smart contract to secure its operations if the oracle is compromised or malfunctions.

## **Implementing Multisig Wallets**

Developers are advised to consider the integration of multi-signature wallets for critical operations like large fund transfers or contract upgrades. These wallets necessitate the consent of multiple parties to execute transactions, adding a defensible layer of security. Multisig wallets thwart unauthorized activities by ensuring that solitary entities cannot exert unilateral control over the contract. This is particularly advantageous in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, where significant assets are susceptible to risk.

## **Continuous Monitoring and Response Plan**

Ensuring security in smart contracts requires continuous attention and effort. Continuous monitoring remains crucial after deployment to guarantee the continued safety of the contract. It is important for developers to frequently monitor smart contract activity for any abnormal actions, such as significant withdrawals or contract calls that differ from anticipated patterns.
