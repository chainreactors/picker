![Blog Post - How do website owners know that their website is hacked](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Post-How-do-website-owners-know-that-their-website-is-hacked-820x385.png)

Whether you manage a gaming blog, an e-commerce platform, or an enterprise-level website you probably want to be able to detect infections when they occur. A hacked website can lead to financial loss, disruption of business operations, and the exposure of confidential information. The key is acting fast once you discover possible compromise.

But how can you tell if your website has been hacked?

In this post, we’ll explore the most common causes of infection, how to monitor your site to avoid bad actors from accessing your website, and how to restore its security and functionality after a hack.

## Key Indicators That Your Website Is Hacked

There are several signs that your website may be compromised, some of which might seem minor at first. However, these signs can become serious issues if left unchecked. Let’s break down the most common indicators:

### 1. Unexplained Traffic Drops

One sign of a compromised website is a sudden drop in organic traffic. This can happen when search engines detect security issues on your website and either deindex or blacklist your website. SEO spam infections are the most common cause of this, targeting explicit keywords that ultimately poison your ranking.

Here are three of the most common and damaging types of malicious injections that hackers use to compromise a website’s traffic:

* **SQL Injection:** [SQL injections](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-sql-injection/) (SQLi) can cause severe issues such as hackers obtaining full access control and leaking sensitive information from site users. These can occur through the web page or application input. If a web application isn’t validating its values received from a web form, cookie, input parameter, etc., before passing them via SQL queries, it’s executed on a database server. Without proper input validation, a hacker can manipulate the input so data is interpreted as code, rather than as data.
   ![sqlmap](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/sqlmap.png)
   These injections can be detected with tools such as [SiteCheck](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/), SQLmap, Havij, or jSQL. Tools such as SQLmap are also handy in being able to detect possible intrusion points, helping prevent an injection before it occurs. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in your website’s SQL database to inject malicious code.

* **Backdoor Installation:** Once hackers gain access, they [plant backdoors](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/examining-emerging-backdoors.html) in your website’s code, providing continuous access to inject malicious scripts and opening the door to further attacks.
* **Admin Panel Compromise:** These are one of the most common attacks everyday WordPress admins face. By default, there are inherent risks like a lack of 2FA, the login page being widely accessible, and having no limit on failed login attempts. Consider incorporating these security measures, along with [setting a strong password](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/how-to-make-strong-password.html).

### 2. Unexpected Redirects or Pop-ups

If users report being redirected to unfamiliar websites or encountering unexpected pop-ups, this is a clear sign of a compromised site. This usually occurs when malicious code is injected into your website, leading users to harmful sites or displaying unwanted ads. These redirects are often used in phishing attacks to steal sensitive information from your users.

Here are three common methods hackers use to execute redirects or pop-up attacks:

* **Malicious iFrame Injections:** Hackers embed [malicious iFrames](https://docs.sucuri.net/malware-encyclopedia/malicious-iframes/) into your website’s code, which secretly load harmful websites or phishing pages without the user’s knowledge.
* **Malvertising:** Attackers inject malicious ads that appear legitimate but are designed to redirect users to harmful sites or trigger unwanted pop-ups. These ads can be especially dangerous on high-traffic websites.

### 3. Browser and Antivirus Warnings

One of the clearest signs that your site is under attack is when browsers like Chrome or antivirus programs displa...
