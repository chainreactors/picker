# US school district sues Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok over harm to kids

Posted: January 10, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

Public schools in a Seattle district filed [a lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.317950/gov.uscourts.wawd.317950.1.0.pdf) on Friday against parent companies of the biggest social networks on the internet, alleging social media is to blame for “a youth mental health crisis”, and saying these companies have purposefully designed, refined, and operated their platforms in a way that “exploit[s] the neurophysiology” of children’s and youths’ brains.

The companies they sued are Meta for Facebook and Instagram, Snap for Snapchat, ByteDance for TikTok, and Alphabet for YouTube.

In [a brief](https://www.seattleschools.org/news/social-media-case/) about this case, Seattle Public Schools said:

> “Students in the Seattle Public Schools, like students around the country, are struggling with anxiety, depression, thoughts of self-harm, and suicidal ideation, which led King County to join the US Surgeon General last year in recognizing the youth mental health crisis in this community. According to the Surgeon General, one in five children aged 13 to 17 now suffer from a mental health disorder.”
>
> “More than 90% of youth today use social media. Most youth primarily use five platforms: YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook, on which they spend many hours a day. Research tells us that excessive and problematic use of social media is harmful to the mental, behavioral, and emotional health of youth and is associated with increased rates of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, eating disorders, and suicide.”

## Cyberbullying

The school district also pins the blame for [online bullying](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/08/cyberbullying-101-a-primer-for-kids-teens-and-parents) on social networks. “The more time an individual, especially males, spend on social media, the more likely they are to commit acts of cyberbullying,” the complaint alleges, citing research on cyberbullies from 2021. Youths experience bullying acts online like name calling; being subjected to false rumors; receiving unsolicited explicit media or threats of bodily harm; online stalking; and revenge porn.

Multiple studies have shown cyberbullying has numerous mental, emotional, and behavioral effects on everyone involved. This includes anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation, to name a few. The lawsuit mentions that students experiencing these mental health issues “perform worse in school, are less likely to attend school, more likely to engage in substance use, and to act out.” All these, the SPS argues, “affects Seattle Public Schools’ ability to fulfil its educational mission”.

## Immune to liability, per Section 230?

When it comes to potential counter-arguments, Seattle Public Schools appears to have foreseen that the companies will hide behind [Section 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230) of the Community Decency Act. This specific section expressly says: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” However, the district isn’t arguing that the companies should be liable for their users’ posts but that Section 230 shouldn’t shield them from the consequences of their conduct.

“Plaintiff [school district] is ...
