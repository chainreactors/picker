"Pen Testing")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg65IQA9iOwrG066NElSLTeXCQl4DZShJDYkaPGmYWwqmImHa6sE0QijPsaTX2lN0NaPCkmSWDoHXJIXdnnSf_YqeXrZZmNulYG_DL4KVROQ0bdCt3hLFidNzlcsDwlAisma3EVaZ1Mmp6trvSZjLD3UQv9KooXa40j8xUAEFfcIP2u85ThHhETl0sb/s790-rw-e365/hack.png)

Any organization that handles sensitive data must be diligent in its security efforts, which include regular pen testing. Even a small data breach can result in significant damage to an organization's reputation and bottom line.

There are two main reasons why regular pen testing is necessary for secure web application development:

* **Security:** Web applications are constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities are being discovered all the time. Pen testing helps identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers and allows you to fix them before they can do any damage.
* **Compliance:** Depending on your industry and the type of data you handle, you may be required to comply with certain security standards (e.g., PCI DSS, NIST, HIPAA). Regular pen testing can help you verify that your web applications meet these standards and avoid penalties for non-compliance.

## How Often Should You Pentest?

Many organizations, big and small, [have once a year pen testing cycle](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/04/29/penetration-testing-blind-spots/). But what's the best frequency for pen testing? Is once a year enough, or do you need to be more frequent?

The answer depends on several factors, including the type of development cycle you have, the criticality of your web applications, and the industry you're in.

**You may need more frequent pen testing if:**

### You Have an Agile or Continuous Release Cycle

Agile development cycles are characterized by short release cycles and rapid iterations. This can make it difficult to keep track of changes made to the codebase and makes it more likely that security vulnerabilities will be introduced.

If you're only testing once a year, there's a good chance that vulnerabilities will go undetected for long periods of time. This could leave your organization open to attack.

To mitigate this risk, pen testing cycles should align with the organization's development cycle. For static web applications, testing every 4-6 months should be sufficient. But for web applications that are updated frequently, you may need to test more often, such as monthly or even weekly.

### Your Web Applications Are Business-Critical

Any system that is essential to your organization's operations should be given extra attention when it comes to security. This is because a breach of these systems could have a devastating impact on your business. If your organization relies heavily on its web applications to do business, any downtime could result in significant financial losses.

For example, imagine that your organization's e-commerce site went down for an hour due to a DDoS attack. Not only would you lose out on potential sales, but you would also have to deal with the cost of the attack and the negative publicity.

To avoid this scenario, it's important to ensure that your web applications are always available and secure.

Non-critical web applications can usually get away with being tested once a year, but business-critical web applications should be tested more frequently to ensure they are not at risk of a major outage or data loss.

### Your Web Applications Are Customer-Facing

If all your web applications are internal, you may be able to get away with pen testing less frequently. However, if your web applications are accessible to the public, you must be extra diligent in your security efforts.

Web applications accessible to external traffic are more likely to be targeted by attackers. This is because there is a greater pool of attack vectors and more potential entry points for an attacker to exploit.

Customer-facing web applications also tend to have more users, which means that any security vulnerabilities will be exploited more quickly. For example, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an external web application with millions of users could be exploited within hours of being discovered.

To protect against these threats, it's important to pen test customer-facing web applications more frequently than internal ones. Depending on the size and complexity of the application, you may need to pen test every month or even every week.

### You Are in a High-Risk Industry

[Certain industries are more likely to be targeted](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221293/cyber-crime-target-industries/) by hackers due to the sensitive nature of their data. Healthcare organizations, for example, are often targeted because of the protected health information (PHI) they hold.

If your organization is in a high-risk industry, you should consider conducting pen testing more frequently to ensure that your systems are secure and meet regulatory compliance. This will help protect your data and reduce the chances of a costly security incident.

### You Don't Have Internal Security Operations or a Pen testing Team

This might sound counterintuitive, but if you don't have an internal security team, you may need to conduct pen testing more frequently.

Organizations that don't have dedicated security staff are more likely to be vulnerable to attacks.

Without an internal security team, you will need to rely on external pen testers to assess your organization's security posture.

Depending on the size and complexity of your organization, you may need to pen test every month or even every week.

### You Are Focused on Mergers or Acquisitions

During a merger or acquisition, there is often a lot of confusion and chaos. This can make it difficult to keep track of all the systems and data th...
