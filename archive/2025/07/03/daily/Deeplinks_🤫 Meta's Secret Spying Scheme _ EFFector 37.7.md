Keeping up on the latest digital rights news has never been easier. With a new look, [EFF's EFFector newsletter](https://eff.org/effector/37/7) covers the latest details on our work defending your rights to privacy and free expression online.

[EFFector 37.7](https://eff.org/effector/37/7) covers some of the very sneaky tactics that Meta has been using [to track you online](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/protect-yourself-metas-latest-attack-privacy), and how you can mitigate some of this tracking. In this issue, we're also explaining the legal processes [police use to obtain your private online data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/how-cops-can-get-your-private-online-data), and providing an update on the [NO FAKES Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/no-fakes-act-has-changed-and-its-so-much-worse)â€”a U.S. Senate bill that takes a flawed approach to concerns about AI-generated "replicas."

And, in case you missed it in the previous newsletter, we're debuting a [new audio companion](https://youtu.be/AVdo2IYxUEg) to EFFector as well! This time, Lena Cohen breaks down the ways that Meta tracks you online and what youâ€”and lawmakersâ€”can do to prevent that tracking. You can listen now on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AVdo2IYxUEg) or the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/37.7_20250702).
