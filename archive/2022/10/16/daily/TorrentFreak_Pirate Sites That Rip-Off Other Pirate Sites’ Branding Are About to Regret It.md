# Pirate Sites That Rip-Off Other Pirate Sites’ Branding Are About to Regret It

Sites like The Pirate Bay are recognized for their unique branding but in today's pirate streaming sector, individuality can mean copying a successful site and buying the closest possible domain. Countering ISP blocking is a driving force but opportunists are also putting Coke labels on cheap, generic cola. Thanks to the High Court in London, pirating other pirates ends in site blocking.

[![123moviesMir](https://torrentfreak.com/images/123moviesMir.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/123moviesMir.png)Ten years ago the High Court in London [ordered](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-isps-must-censor-the-pirates-bay-high-court-rules-120430/) all major ISPs in the country to block The Pirate Bay. The injunction couldn’t stop the site from operating but indirectly left its mark in more insidious ways.

To demonstrate the futility of blocking, hundreds of Pirate Bay-themed proxy and mirror sites swarmed online, ready to stick to the man. Most looked and functioned like The Pirate Bay itself and by undermining the injunction, quickly became go-to platforms in the UK. Within the file-sharing community it was seen as a glorious yet functional display of the ‘hydra effect’. But more was to come.

## Chopping All Heads Off At Once

Over the next decade more than [20,000 sites and 75,000 domains](https://torrentfreak.com/more-than-20000-pirate-sites-are-blocked-by-isps-around-the-globe-221012/) would find themselves blocked in 39 countries, a total that now includes mirrors and proxies that facilitate access to previously blocked sites. Thousands are covered by dynamic injunctions, meaning that if previously banned sites use new domains to circumvent blocking, those will be blocked more quickly than the originals, no court process needed.

Meanwhile, however, another type of irritant has been gaining ground.

## Rise of The Big Fat Phony

In a mainstream piracy scene where blocking has normalized the use of sites that simply resemble the original, imposter sites with big-name branding easily gain traction. Since the sites they impersonate are blocked by ISPs and [delisted from Google](https://torrentfreak.com/google-delists-hundreds-of-pirate-bay-domains-from-uk-search-results-220715/), pirate site forgeries (not to mention malware sites) often dominate the top results.

The case of long-dead streaming site 123movies provides a good example. The MPA obtained an injunction to [block the site](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-piracy-blocklist-expands-with-123movies-and-other-streaming-sites-161028/) in October 2016 after 123movies.to became the most-used pirate site in the UK. A month later it was confirmed that [half a dozen](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-piracy-blocklist-silently-expands-with-hundreds-of-domains-161120/) additional 123movies domains had also been blocked.

In March 2018, the MPA described 123movies as the [world’s most popular pirate site](https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-brands-123movies-as-the-worlds-most-popular-illegal-site-180316/). Two days later, [123movies.to shut itself down](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-streaming-giant-123movies-announces-shutdown-180319/) following a [criminal investigation](https://torrentfreak.com/123movies-was-shut-down-following-a-criminal-investigation-181005/).

After pulling in tens of millions of visitors each month thanks to competing domains being shut down, in May 2021 the operator of yet another 123movies site, operating from 123movies.la, was identified by Hollywood and also [forced to shut down](https://torrentfreak.com/123movies-la-shut-down-by-alliance-for-creativity-and-entertainment-210510/).

As a result, many other unaffected 123movie-branded sites stepped in to reap the benefits.

## And There’s More

Continuing the fight that never ends, over the next few months [MPA injunctions](https://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-netflix-win-new-streaming-piracy-blocking-order-at-uk-high-court-210220/) hit more and more pirate sites featuring 123movies branding, such as 123movies-one.com, 123moviess.online, 123movies-one.com, 123-movies.gy, 123-movies.as, 123-movies.gs, 123movies.ms, 123-movies.sx, 0123movies.cam, and 123moviesready.org.

At this point it’s not difficult to imagine frustration setting in at the MPA. While domains are sometimes covered by existing injunctions, others demand more work and more court appearances. Although it wasn’t apparent back then, blocking orders obtained late last year marked a significant turning point in the war against these imposter sites.

## More Blocking Injunctions Turn The Tide

Orders obtained by the MPA last [October](https://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-netflix-win-new-high-court-injunction-to-block-pirate-streaming-sites-211025/) and [December](https://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-netflix-win-new-high-court-injunction-to-block-pirate-streaming-sites-211025/) targeted domains including 123movies.online, 123moviesfun.ch, and 0123movies.net, 1-2-3movies.com, 123movies.vu, and watch123movies.ch.

But, of course, this wouldn’t solve the problem either. At least not immediately.

The application hasn’t been made public but the MPA returned to the High Court this summer with two sets of new domains and requested blocking in connection with an earlier order. As far as we can establish they included 123chill to, 123series.ru, d123movies.to and w-123movies.com.

The first set was handled without a hearing but the second set was described by the High Court as “something of an extension of the relief” that had been granted earlier.

A hearing took place and here’s what happened.

## Clone and Imposter Sites Neutralized Injunctions

Referencing two injunctions targeting 123movies domains and handed down by Justice Falk and Justice Johnson late last year, Justice Meade stated the following:

“The problem is that when an order in the form granted by Falk J or indeed by Adam Johnson J (as he did in December 2021 and which I will touch on again shortly), the reaction of people willing to infringe this kind of copyright is to start up a website with a different but very similar domain name,” the Judge wrote.

According to a confidential witness statement provided by an MPA lawyer, when 123movie domains were blocked following the December order, “traffic diminished, as one would expect.” But then a new problem emerged.

“[O]ther websites with very similar names picked up the slack and either increased the previous traffic or started from zero and moved to significant traffic, with the effect that although the specifically-targeted websites were throttled back to a significant degree, overall traffic through websites with 123 Movies in their name was not restricted very much if at all,” the Judge added.
