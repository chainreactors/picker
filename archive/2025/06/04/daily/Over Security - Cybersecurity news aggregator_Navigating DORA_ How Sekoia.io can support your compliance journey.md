As the cyber threat landscape evolves and the digital landscape changes, regulatory frameworks continue to emerge, aiming to bolster the security posture of organisations, particularly in the financial sector. One such regulation is the **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)**, effective since January 2025, which sets stringent security requirements for financial entities operating within the European Union. In this blog post, we will explore the key aspects of DORA and how Sekoia.io assists organisations in achieving compliance, particularly through robust cyber threat intelligence for crisis exercises and cyberattack simulations.

## Introducing DORA, TIBER and friends

The European DORA regulation (read the [official text](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R2554)) adopted at the end of 2022 and effective from January 2025, aims to ensure that nearly all financial sector entities (including banks and insurers, administrators of critical benchmarks, service providers and crypto-asset issuers – over 22,000 entities accross the EU) put in place the necessary safeguards to mitigate risks linked to cyberattacks.

DORA will also require all firms to:

1. implement measures to protect against all types of threat and disruption linked to information and communication technologies (ICT)
2. put in place a system for managing, classifying and reporting ICT-related incidents
3. in the case of systemic entities, regularly conduct advanced tests on ICT tools, systems and processes using threat-led penetration testing (or red teaming)

In addition, DORA introduces a framework for the direct oversight by financial supervisors of critical service providers, including cloud service providers.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://t7f4e9n3.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DORA-blogpost_5.png)

One essential aspect of DORA compliance is the performance of cyberattack simulations and penetration testing. The DORA regulation requires among others a Threat Lead Penetration Testing (TLPT) framework, in accordance with [TIBER-EU](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html). TIBER (Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming) is a common, EU-wide framework that delivers a controlled, bespoke, intelligence-led red team test of financial entities’ critical live production systems.

It allows the tested entities to understand their real-world resilience by stressing all elements of their business against the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of threat actors specific to their organisation. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, organisations can evaluate their response capabilities, refine their incident response plans, and ultimately enhance their operational resilience.

## How Sekoia.io can support your DORA compliance journey

At Sekoia.io, we understand the multifaceted challenges organisations face in navigating DORA compliance while addressing real-world threats. Our extensive experience in cyber threat intelligence empowers organisations to not only meet regulatory expectations but also adapt proactively to the evolving threat landscape. Let’s break it down.

### **Resilience testing: actionable cyber threat intelligence**

The power of the SOC Platform also comes from its exclusive threat intelligence, delivered by **Sekoia Threat Detection & Research** (TDR), commonly known as the TDR team. Created in 2020, Sekoia TDR is one of the largest teams in Europe and is a partner of Europol EC3 for the fight against cybercrime, and of FS-ISAC regarding the financial sector specifically. Discover more about Sekoia TDR [here](https://blog.sekoia.io/introducing-sekoia-tdr/).

Covering both state-sponsored and cybercrime threats, our CTI includes freshly contextualised Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and high-quality threat reports for decision makers- thereby providing a comprehensive perspective from the strategic to the technical level. In addition, detection engineering aims to developing and maintaining high-quality detection rules, focusing on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) most exploited by adversaries.

Our research on the financial sector, as detailed in the 2023 report by Sekoia TDR *Unmasking the Latest Trends of the Financial Cyber Threat Landscape*, highlights emerging cyber threats specifically relevant to financial institutions including sector-specific lucrative intrusion sets, banking malware and other trends in terms of tactics (TTPs) used by new threat patterns. Read the full report [here](https://blog.sekoia.io/unmasking-the-latest-trends-of-the-financial-cyber-threat-landscape/).

This long expertise in cyber threat intelligence enables Sekoia.io to provide organisations with critical insights into the evolving threats impacting the financial sector. This intelligence helps organisations understand vulnerabilities and trends within the sector, enabling more informed risk assessments and proactive strategies. More especially, it allows organizations to conduct TLPT penetration tests based on relevant identified threats- thereby facilitating compliance with DORA, which made these tests mandatory for certain critical financial entities.

### **CTI in practice: from strategic view to technical data**

Sekoia Intelligence provides the insights and operational data you need for penetration tests. But what does it look like in practice? How can CTI be concretely leveraged in the platform for cyber ex...
