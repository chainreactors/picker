## Friday Squid Blogging: Another Giant Squid Captured on Video

[Here’s](https://www.sciencealert.com/couple-captures-rare-footage-of-a-giant-squid-swimming-off-the-coast-of-japan) a new video of a giant squid, filmed in the Sea of Japan.

I believe it’s injured. It’s so close to the surface, and not really moving very much.

> “We didn’t see the kinds of agile movements that many fish and marine creatures normally show,” he said. “Its tentacles and fins were moving very slowly.”

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce, ALL,

This might amuse,

“What Not To Write On Your Security Clearance Form”

<http://milk.com/wall-o-shame/security_clearance.html>

(note the date of 1988 oh and take a pinch of salt 😉

Whilst I’ve never had the authorities chase me in this way, my mis spent youth has had more than sufficient scrapes one way or another.

My father once told me,

“If you get yourself into trouble you can not talk your way out of, then you deserve what you get!”

Admittedly it was mid 1970’s in times when the authorities were somewhat more honest in their approach[1].

I’ve had a few bits of fun, one involving a 55gallon drum full of fertilizer and a handfull or three of coal dust in the middle of a farmers field… The resulting “duck pond” is quite impressive… Doing that today would probably get you an orange jump suit and an indefinate stay holiday at the arse end of Cuba[2] or worse…

And that as they say is not the least of it… My involvment almost pre-teen in “Broadcast Radio” and being in effect a “Pirate” caused me to meet a lot of people before they became famous more legitimately was fun but that sort of “lime light” never was of interest, as they say “hup narf” I was “doin it frer t’ crac”[3]

Oddly great fun though it all was, when I went through the security clearence process, it never came up… The big problem was when getting put through the process again the issuers of clearences knowing what level I held were puzzled by the fact another organisation wanted me cleared at a much lower level[4]…

Which should tell you something about the way bureaucracy combined with securiry DOES NOT work…

Any way, as they say,

“Plenty more stories where those came from…”.

[1] I used to think it was at the end of the 1980’s when things turned dishonest… But in more recent times now the Old Witch is dead, and thirty years have gone by, I was informed after enquiry that Mrs Thatcher when UK Prime Minster and effective Head of State had called for me to be setup to be arrested and discredited thus neutralized. Why because I had the temerity to point out grave security faults in a system called “BT-Gold”. It had caused much embarrassement by being hacked on the BBC Micro-Live show estimated to have been seen by about half the UK viewers back then… Most embarrassing because Maggie was trying to flog of BT to the UK public and she wanted nothing to bring the share price down… So my writing up further bad news, could not be alowed to happen… Luckily it was my own bl@@dy mindedness that foiled the plan. I got a request to go and demonstrate, which I thought was “odd” what I’d written up was both accurate and easy to follow as well as clearly showing BT had been less than honest with the UK media and public. I said “NO” I’d better things to do. The request came back down another path, so I chatted to someone and they said if BT were that desperate ask for big money and noliability all signed and paid up front… They tried again with the “fame” aspect and I just said I’d get more from publishing so they did get back kind of offering money but not the noliability so by now I thought it was way too fishy, so said no. Unfortunately by then it had become “Yesterdays news” so the journalists I’d talked to were not interested (turns out in one case the editor had “warned off” the journo…). A very short while later the BT-Prestel and “Hack of HRH Philip’s” in box made the news and some friends of mine found out what Mrs Thatcher had in mind…)

[3] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic>

[4] The first was in for a “daytime job” designing “green use” equipment, the second was for “wearing the green” part time, and needing to work on the same equipment… It also ment I had to go on a basic traing course on the equipment and got told off for “not paying attention”…

Juliann, as one of the intellectual heads of the cyberpunk movement, has posited some of the most interesting and well thought out thesis on the crest of digital information’s transformation of society. Assange is also one of the most brilliant commentators respecting information technology and applications, now enduring the criminal treatment of an intellectual by those not worthy of judging his character or actions.

This is more than just a judicial farce and failure, this is a reflection of a failing of society. More generally, the failure to recognize those among us worthy of our support; instead, the callous and tortured actions carried out by those that are nothing more than criminal thugs is celebrated and encouraged.

The most durable form of writing is still less than 2000 years old in Europe.

In Australia we have this resource to help deal with online scams

<https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/>

Not sure if there is anything like it in other countries but most of these look applicable to the rest of the world
