Apple just released iOS 18.3, its latest software update for iPhone, on January 27 â after 42 days of beta testing. While it's not as feature-packed as the previous updates for [iOS 18.2](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/complete-ios-18-2-features-guide-heres-everything-new-and-improved-for-your-iphone-0385644/) and [iOS 18.1](https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/30-must-know-new-features-ios-18-1-and-ipados-18-1-thatll-make-you-want-update-0385631/) were, there are still a few important changes you'll want to know about.

Aside from the return of a critical Calculator feature, most of the changes in iOS 18.3 apply to [iPhone models](https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/are-your-devices-compatible-with-ios-18-ipados-18-and-macos-15-heres-complete-list-0385604/) that support [Apple Intelligence](https://apple.gadgethacks.com/collection/apple-intelligence-tips-tricks/). Those would be the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models. The new emoji from Unicode 16 are also missing from this update but are [expected to arrive with iOS 18.4](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/new-emoji-ios-18/).

*Note: Many of these features and changes also apply to iPads running iPadOS 18.3 and Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.3.*

## New Unity Rhythm wallpapers

Included in the update are new wallpapers for Apple's [Black Unity Collection](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/01/apple-introduces-the-2025-black-unity-collection/).

> Apple today [Jan. 27] unveiled a new Black Unity Collection to honor Black History Month, and celebrate Black culture and community. Inspired by the rhythm of humanity, the collection includes a special-edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a matching watch face, and iPhone and iPad wallpapers.

The wallpapers, called Unity Rhythm, feature custom lettering in black, green, and red â the colors of the Pan-African flag. They spell out "Unity," which changes orientation when locked or unlocked. When you wake up your iPhone, the letters on your Lock Screen adjust, and the brushstrokes come to life.

There are six to choose from: Unity, Black, Cream, Red, Green, and Gold.

## Apple Intelligence enabled by default

According to Apple's [release](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18_3-release-notes) [notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-15_3-release-notes) for developers, you'll automatically be opted into Apple Intelligence after upgrading a supported device to iOS 18.3. That way, you have immediate access to all of Apple Intelligence's features. If you don't like Apple's generative artificial intelligence tools, you can opt out via Settings Â» Apple Intelligence & Siri.

## Add events with Visual Intelligence

[Visual Intelligence](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/unlock-power-visual-intelligence-your-iphone-translate-and-explore-world-around-you-0385649/) was introduced with [iOS 18.2](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/complete-ios-18-2-features-guide-heres-everything-new-and-improved-for-your-iphone-0385644/) for iPhone models with Camera Control, but one thing that didn't make the cut was the ability to add events to Calendar after scanning event details from a poster, flyer, or other sources. That ability is now available with iOS 18.3. To be fair, you could add an event to Calendar manually whenever a date or time appeared in the Visual Intelligence capture, but the process is now streamlined with a Create Event action item.

## Identify plants and animals with Visual Intelligence

Another missing thing from Visual Intelligence was the ability to identify plants and animals, which is also now included in iOS 18.3's update.

## Updated style for Notification Summaries

Notification Summaries, another big part of Apple Intelligence, are more visually different on the Lock Screen and in the Notification Center on an iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Before, the summary glyph would help you tell them apart from regular notifications. That's still the case, but now summaries are also italicized.

## Manage Notification Summaries from the Lock Screen

Notification Summaries can also now be turned off per app from the Lock Screen or Notification Center. On an iPhone 16 model, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max, swipe left on the notification summary, select Options, then choose Turn Off [App] Summaries. You may also see options to turn summaries on when they are off for an app.
