### [Books, 2022](/2022/12/18/books.html) (18 Dec 2022)

As Twitter is having a thing (agl@infosec.exchange, by the way) it's nice that RSS is still ticking along. To mark that fact as we reach the end of the year, I decided to write up a list of books that I've read in the past 12 months that feel worthy of recommendation to a general audience.

### [Flying Blind](https://www.google.com/search?q=9780593460177)

Boeing was once a standard-bearer for American engineering and manufacturing abilities and now it's better known for the groundings of the 737 MAX 8 and 787. This is a history of how Boeing brought McDonnell Douglas and found that it contained lethal parasites.

### [Electrify](https://www.google.com/search?q=9780262545044)

Burning things produces CO2 and air pollution. Both slowly hurt people so we should stop doing it where possible. This is a data-filled book on how to get a long way towards that goal, and is an optimistic respite from some of the other books on this list.

### [The Splendid & The Vile](https://www.google.com/search?q=978-0385348713)

Do we really need another book about WWII? Perhaps not, but I enjoyed this one which focuses on the members of the Churchill family in the first couple of years of the war.

### [Transformer](https://www.google.com/search?q=978-0393651485)

Ignorant as I am about microbiology, I love Nick Lane books because they make me feel otherwise and I cross my fingers that they're actually accurate. This book is avowedly presenting a wild theory—which is probably false—but is a wonderful tour of the landscape either way.

### [Stuff Matters](https://www.google.com/search?q=978-0544236042)

A pop-science book, but a good one that focuses on a number of materials in the modern world. If you know anything about the topic, this is probably too light-weight. But if, like me, you know little, it's a fun introduction.

### [Amusing Ourselves to Death](https://www.google.com/search?q=978-0143036531)

This is a book from 1985 about the horrors of television. Its arguments carry more force when transposed to the modern internet but are also placed into a larger context because they were made 40 years ago and TV hasn't destroyed civilisation (… probably).

### [The Story of VaccinateCA](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-story-of-vaccinateca/)

I'm cheating: this isn't a book, although it is quite long. As we collectively fail to deal with several slow crises, here's a tale of what failed and what succeeded in a recent short, sharp crisis. It is very California focused, and less useful to those outside of America, but I feel that it's quite important.

### [Art of Computer Programming, Satisfiability](https://www.google.com/search?q=978-0134397603)

This isn't “general audience”, but if you read this far perhaps neither are you. SMT solvers are volatile magic and, while this is only about SAT, it's a great introduction to the area. I would love to say that I read it in the depth that it deserves, but even skimming the text and skipping the exercises is worth a lot.

The Economist also has its [books of the year](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/06/these-are-the-economists-best-books-of-2022) list. I've only read one of them, [Slouching Towards Utopia](https://www.google.com/search?q=1399803425), and it didn't make my list above!
