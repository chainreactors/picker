Last week I published a
[featherweight narrative](/ongoing/When/202x/2025/07/01/First-AI-Code) about applying GenAI in a real-world context, to
a tiny programming problem. Now I’m regretting that piece because I totally ignored the two central issues with
AI: What it’s meant to do, and how much it really costs.

What genAI is for ·
The most important fact about genAI in the real world is that there’ve been literally
[hundreds
of billions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-nvidia-played-a-central-role-in-the-306-billion-ai-startup-boom-195741749.html?guccounter=1) of dollars invested in it; that link is just startups, and ignores a comparable torrent of cash pouring out of Big
Tech.

The business leaders pumping all this money of course don’t understand the technology. They’re doing this for exactly one
reason: They think they can discard armies of employees and replace them with LLM services, at the cost of
shipping shittier products. Do you think your management would spend that kind of money to help you with a quicker first draft or
a summarized inbox?

Adobe said the quiet part out loud:
[Skip the
Photoshoot](https://petapixel.com/2024/05/03/adobe-throws-photographers-under-the-bus-again-skip-the-photoshoot/).

At this point someone will point out that previous technology waves have generated as much employment as they’ve eliminated.
Maybe so, but that’s not what business leaders think they’re buying. They think they’re buying smaller payrolls.

Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but thinking about these truths leads to a mental stench that makes me want to stay away from
it.

How much does genAI cost? ·
Well, I already mentioned all those hundreds of billions. But that’s pocket change. The investment community in general and
Venture Capital in particular will whine and moan, but the people who are losing the money are people who can afford to.

The first real cost is hypothetical: What if those business leaders are correct and they can gleefully dispose of millions of
employees? If you think we’re already suffering from egregious levels of inequality, what happens when a big chunk of the
middle class suddenly becomes professionally superfluous? I’m no economist so I’ll stop there, but you don’t have to be a
rocket scientist to predict severe economic pain.

Then there’s the other thing that nobody talks about, the massive greenhouse-gas load that all those data centers are going
to be pumping out. This at a time when we we blow past one atmospheric-carbon metric after another and David Suzuki says
[the
fight against climate change is lost](https://www.ipolitics.ca/2025/07/02/its-too-late-david-suzuki-says-the-fight-against-climate-change-is-lost/), that we need to hunker down and work on survival at the local level.

The real problem ·
It’s the people who are pushing it. Their business goals are quite likely, as a side-effect, to make
the world a worse place, and they don’t give a fuck. Their technology will inevitably worsen the onrushing climate catastrophe,
and they don’t give a fuck.

It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people” — it’s not exactly easy to escape the
exigencies of modern capitalism. But they are people who are doing shitty things.

Is genAI useful? ·
Sorry, I’m having trouble even thinking about that now.

"It’s probably not as simple as “They’re just shitty people” — it’s not exactly easy to escape the exigencies of modern capitalism. But they are people who are doing shitty things."

They said the same thing about bitcoiners, another technology with no real world use-case. Bitcoiners have extremely clearly and unambiguously established themselves as shitty people, but look, its been what 15 years and there they are, still ponzi-ing away.

LLM people are just more shitty people with yet another technology with no real world use-case. They just have a lot more money to burn, so they can do a lot more damage, for a lot longer.

For them, fundamentally its all about substituting "whatever" because all glop/content is fungible, fuck "Truth" or "Beauty." And it'll be Gresham's Law all over again, except for information instead of money. I expect we are going to see Weimar levels of information inflation pretty shortly, we're going to drown in it.

I personally hope that open-source local models become “good enough” quick enough to make the bottom fall out for these planet destroying cloud services. Once that happens, the investment money will rapidly dry up, and the true economic costs of offshoring human labour to poorly tested, nondeterministic, unspecialised black boxes will be revealed. It is only a matter of time, the question is when.

We’ve already seen a scummy “buy now, pay later” company try replacing large chunks of their workforce with so-called AI, and they were forced to reverse course after it almost destroyed them. Teachers, lawyers, judges and even police officers have been shamed when caught publishing important documents unchecked. Microsoft screwed the pooch with GitHub Copilot as a programming tool to the point where it’s now a legal liability for well-known software projects to use. People are already getting good at spotting glitches in generative images, including video when viewed in situations outside of scummy social networking services. Even video gamers are spotting generated slop with ease when it’s being shown to them, and are very quickly rejecting it.

At best, by the end of the hype cycle, we will end up with improvements upon already highly specialised models for a variety of tasks humans struggle to deal with in bulk (e.g. interpreting medical imaging reliably, categorising physical objects, transcribing and translating conversations at near real time speeds, tracking individuals for security purposes).

What we won’t have are these unsustainable cloud services providing all you can eat access to unspecialised models. We are already seeing the beginning of the end with ever increasing charges for “credits” (on top of monthly subscription fees) for those who do try to use these services for bulk processing; which essentially destroys any cost savings businesses could have otherwise made.

Hi Tim,

I think you've mistaken what we have today for capitalism, when objectively it really isn't.

Capitalism requires a number of things, and one of which is strong rights of ownership, which put quite simply is having the right to dispose of your property for nothing. We do still own some small things, but any large asset is for the most part not owned except in some very rare circumstances.

The other missing requirement is adversarial independent decision-making without cooperation in the market.

What we have in most things today is control of resources without real ownership, and there are so-called private companies but they are equivalent to state-run apparatus having received loans from a money-printer.

You can't dispose of a property or buildings, while you have a mortgage, and you generally must keep a mortgage on leverage for a number of reasons related to the money-printing economy (fiat) to avoid recapture, or hostile takeovers/leveraged buyouts which sieve the market into fewer and fewer participants in a long-term deflationary cycle.

If you don't, you lose money from currency debasement, and other factors...
