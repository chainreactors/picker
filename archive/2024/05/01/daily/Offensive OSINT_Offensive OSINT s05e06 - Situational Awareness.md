# Introduction

Originally developed to aid OSINT investigations but now it's being used by people with various backgrounds. In this article, I will explore the most common use cases for OSS and demonstrate how it enhances your investigations and helps with day to day research.

System supports many sources: public & surveillance cameras, Internet facing devices (IoT & ICS & Cameras), Wifi networks, crimes, Amber alerts, many social media platforms, information about protests or different ongoing events. This platform stands out because it is primarily location-based. This means that each post or item is displayed on a map with either an exact or estimated location. It effectively combines physical security with incidents that occur on social media or the internet at large, providing a unique and comprehensive view of events as they happen.

# Use cases

In previous posts and tweets, I’ve shown how to fully utilize this system and shared some of its most impressive findings. Now, let's explore what OSS can do to enhance your situational awareness across various fields.

## Critical infrastructure

Open Source Surveillance allows to quickly find all critical infrastructure facilities on a given territory. It includes military, power, water, religion, communication, emergency sectors.

Having exact coordinates and up to date satellite images allows to check physical security of the facility. Moreover, OSS allows to gather information about Internet facing industrial devices and potential more information via social media modules.

It's one of my favourite topic, but you should know it already if you follow the blog. I published couple of research to show how to gather intelligence on critical infrastructure around the world.

[Offensive OSINT s01e04 - Intelligence gathering on critical infrastructure in Southeast Asia

This is the second part of my investigation into critical infrastructure around
the world. This article should have been a presentation on ICS Conference in
Singapore, however due to Coronavirus it will be a virtual event. I’m not
interested in participating and I have left with quite good material so

## Situational awareness

Open Source Surveillance provides situational awareness by gathering data from a variety of open sources, connecting the cyber and physical worlds. I'm particularly referring to the Transportation modules—covering planes, ships, trains, incidents, and Waze. Additionally, social media modules like Snapchat, Meetup, Ticketmaster, and Eventbrite provide a full overview of mass gatherings giving more context.

In addition, the Crimes and Amber Alerts modules provide further insights into events occurring in the city, helping to address them quickly

The timeline and statistics feature clearly indicate what happened and where. Additionally, you can obtain more information about the owner of the activity or post. Each item also includes a timestamp, giving you clear details on who, where, what, and when.

## Face recognition

Face recognition have gained significant attention among OSINT researchers and law enforcement agencies. OSS enables face search on collected images with just one click.

This feature helps in identifying other social media accounts linked to a person under investigation or discovering new ones from a provided photo. It's particularly useful for finding photos of suspects or missing persons from the News module and using them in the Face Search module.

## Crimes & Amber Alerts & Sexual offenders

These modules are particularly useful for various types of investigations. By knowing when and where a crime occurred, we can compare events, photos, or other items from that specific location and time frame.

Additionally, having the exact addresses of sexual offenders in the US and the locations where Amber Alerts were issued can provide further leads and connections

## Military

This highlights another unique use of OSS. I've tracked numerous military bases worldwide to look for any activity, often sourced from fitness tracking applications but not only. For instance, in Ukraine, soldiers sometimes upload photos with geolocation tags, which can have significant consequences. By analysing movements on bases and across territories, along with information from other potential sources, OSS can provide useful information on battlefields and military installations, often due to the personnel's limited cyber training.

## Protests

OSS acts as virtual 'boots on the ground,' monitoring social media and other open sources in real time. The ACLED Protests module is particularly useful, providing details on the topic, location, and timing of major protests in specific cities. Each module serves a unique purpose, with Snapchat being es...
