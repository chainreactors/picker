# Four EU telco giants will start asking users if they want personalized targeted ads

Posted: February 16, 2023

They say you can’t have too much of a good thing. Unfortunately, this applies to ads, too, whether you think they’re a good thing or not. Soon, Europe’s four biggest telecommunication companies—Germany’s Deutsche Telekom (DK), France’s Orange, Spain’s Telefónica, and the UK’s Vodafone Group—will deliver targeted ads to their millions of subscribers while also observing European privacy laws.

Back in January, the quartet of telcos [filed](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/09/trustpid-joint-venture/) a [proposal](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases1/202302/M_10815_8844242_215_3.pdf) to offer a “privacy-led, digital identification solution to support the digital marketing and advertising activities of brands and publishers.”

Now, the joint venture has been [approved](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_721) “unconditionally” by the European Commission under the EU Merger Regulation. With the four giants merging, the commission concluded competition concerns wouldn’t be raised in the European Economic Area (EEA), meaning this merger can only compete with non-EU telcos.

“The joint venture will offer a platform to support brands and publishers’ digital marketing and advertising activitiesin France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK,” the [press release](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_721) noted. “Subject to the user’s consent, the joint venture will generate a unique digital code derived from the user’s mobile or fixed network subscription. Such code will allow brands and publishers to recognize users on their websites or applications on a pseudonymous basis, group them under different categories and tailor their content to specific users’ groups.”

Although the commission cleared the joint venture, this doesn’t mean the EU’s data protection regulators will give this a sign-off, too, as the press release further stated: “During its investigation, the Commission has been in contact with data protection authorities. Data protection rules are fully applicable, irrespective of the merger clearance.”

The still-unnamed adtech merger is set to operate in Belgium, with each of the four holding a 25 percent stake. It isn’t clear when this venture will begin operation.

## Subscribers *must* opt-in

The hundreds of millions of subscribers of the four telcos will not automatically be subjected to the ads; they have to agree to this explicitly. Because this new ad platform, which they dubbed as a “counter-design to third-party cookies”, [according to TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/24/trustpid/), was designed with the GDPR and ePrivacy directive in mind, the JV would have to create an opt-in mechanism for willing subscribers to submit their phone numbers to start receiving “communication from brands via publishers”.

“The trial platform requires affirmative opt-in consent by the consumer to activate communications from brands via publishers,” [said](https://www.vodafone.com/news/corporate-and-financial/deutsche-telekom-orange-telefonica-vodafone-form-ad-tech-joint-venture) Vodafone about the venture’s platform. “The only data that is shared is a pseudo-anonymous digital token that cannot be reverse-engineered. Consumers are free to opt in o...
