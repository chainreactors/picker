# Apple AirPlay SDK devices at risk of takeover—make sure you update

Posted: May 1, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

[Researchers](https://www.oligo.security/blog/airborne) found a set of vulnerabilities in Apple’s AirPlay SDK that put billions of users at risk of their devices being taking over.

AirPlay is Apple’s proprietary wireless technology that allows you to stream audio, video, photos, and even mirror your device’s screen from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to other compatible devices like Apple TV, HomePod, smart TVs, or speakers. It works over Wi-Fi, so you don’t need cables.

Apple added the necessary updates on April 28 to the [March 31 update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122371). The update—iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4—was initially issued on March 31, but the additional security fixes were delivered through Rapid Security Responses, or minor patches that Apple incorporated after the initial release. Rapid Security Response (RSR) is a type of software patch delivering security fixes between Apple’s regular, scheduled software updates.

The good news is if you installed the March 31 update, you should be fine. Otherwise, check manually if any updates are available.

To check if you’re using the latest software version, go to **Settings > General > Software Update**. You want to be on iOS 18.4.1 or iPadOS 18.4.1, so update now if you’re not. It’s also worth turning on Automatic Updates if you haven’t already. You can do that on the same screen.

* The latest version of macOS is 15.4.1. Learn how to [update the software on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108382) and how to allow important [background updates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101591).
* The latest version of tvOS is 18.4.1. Learn how to [update the software on your Apple TV](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108414).
* The latest version of watchOS is 11.4. Learn how to [update the software on your Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108926).
* The latest version of visionOS is 2.4.1. Learn how to [update the software on your Apple Vision Pro](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118481).

The AirPlay SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of programming tools Apple provides to app developers to integrate AirPlay functionality into their apps. Using the AirPlay SDK, developers can add features that allow their apps to stream audio or video content wirelessly to AirPlay-compatible devices. This makes apps “AirPlay-ready” by handling the streaming and control behind the scenes.

Combining vulnerabilities allows an attacker on the local network to potentially take control of devices that support AirPlay—both Apple devices and third-party devices that leverage the AirPlay SDK.

Apple [released](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122403) updates to fix the vulnerabilities on April 29 for members of the [Apple MFi Program](https://mfi.apple.com/), who are developers of Apple-compatible accessories or software.

The researchers who found and reported these flaws warn they can be exploited without any user interaction—or with just a single click—to execute remote code. Attackers could also use them for man-in-the-middle interceptions, denial-of-service disruptions, and to bypass access controls and user prompts. On top of that, these vulnerabilities may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and local files, making them a serious risk that dem...
