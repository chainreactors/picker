It gives me immense pleasure to announce that SAP has been recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS), Worldwide with SAP Integration Suite being evaluated. This is the third consecutive time in which SAP has been positioned in the Leaders quadrant.

**“Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision”**

It is imperative for us to understand our customers’ requirements and deliver a solution that will not only solve their current needs but also set them up for business innovation that will hold them in good stead for the future. Gartner has positioned us the farthest right on the quadrant for Completeness of Vision. We believe this is a validation of our future-ready roadmap that will ensure you have an IPaaS that will support you in the ever-changing market. It also protects your investments in Integration Suite for the foreseeable future.

 We have a strong customer influence program and a host of other channels that enable us to keep a tab on the pulse of our customer base. However, we are also conscious of the dynamic and fast-paced nature of today’s world and want to ensure that we are well-prepared for future challenges. The fact that this recognition is based on our Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision, from our perspective, validates that we are heading in the right direction and inspires us to deliver more value in the upcoming weeks and months.

 **SAP Integration Suite’s Value Propositions**

**API-led and Event-Driven Integration**

Digital transformation is a mandatory requirement for all businesses to remain competitive. Integration Suite enables our customers to use APIs as the foundation of their digital Integration hub by offering full API lifecycle management capabilities that can lead to the creation of an API economy at scale. This enables customers to open up their ecosystem to innovations and co-innovations by facilitating secure data access, with real-time process and data insights.

Event-driven integration pattern is evolving rapidly as it offers an intuitive and efficient way of integrating business processes and systems. With SAP Event Mesh and SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh, we offer comprehensive event brokering capabilities with flexible deployment options that will enable customers to build a real-time event-enabled landscape. This enables the evolution of intelligent IT landscapes that can sense and respond to business events as opposed to the traditional model of polling for business events on a periodic basis, which could potentially delay the response time.

 **Reduced Total Cost of Ownership**

Getting started quickly by using integration packs infused with the business expertise and best-in-class industry experience on SAP API Business Hub has been one of our unique offering for our customers. We have doubled down on it by improving the quantity and variety of content that is available to our customers. We also engage our vibrant community to develop content in a collaborative model and offer it to our customer base. As of today, there are 2600+ integration scenarios and 200+ SAP and Third-party connectors offered out-of-the-box to accelerate customers’ implementation journey and these numbers are growing every month.

**Democratizing Integration with Low****-****Code/No-Code tooling**

A smooth, seamless user experience has been one of our primary goals since we embarked on the Integration Suite journey. Integration Suite offers a cohesive user experience with no media breaks and all the capabilities available to you as a single application. The drag-and-drop user interface, a wide variety of pre-built integration flow mediation steps, integration flow step suggestions (powered by AI) combined with the integration packs enable business users with limited or no technical knowledge to leverage Integration Suite and implement integration scenarios with a minimal learning curve.

 **Feature-Rich iPaaS for All Enterprise-Wide Integration Needs**

At the heart of it, we are offering an iPaaS with enterprise-grade qualities that is a must for organizations with heterogeneous IT landscapes for reliable execution of business processes. We have added a host of capabilities like Trading Partner Management for B2B integration, Integration...
