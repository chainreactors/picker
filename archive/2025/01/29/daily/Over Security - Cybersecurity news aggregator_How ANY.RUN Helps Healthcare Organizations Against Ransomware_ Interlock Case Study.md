Interlock Ransomware: Analysis of Attacks on US Healthcare Providers

Ransomware attacks have become a relentless threat to the healthcare sector, exposing sensitive patient data, disrupting life-saving treatments, and placing lives at risk. With healthcare systems underfunded and critical infrastructure vulnerable, cybercriminals find this sector an easy and lucrative target.

In recent years, ransomware attacks have not only caused financial losses but have also shaken public trust in healthcare organizations. Hospitals, medical service providers, and even blood donation centers have been hit, leaving a trail of chaos.

This article highlights how healthcare organizations can benefit from [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=interlock_attack&utm_term=280125&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s Interactive Sandbox and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) to identify, investigate, and analyze ransomware attacks, using a real-world case study of the Interlock ransomware group.

## The Impact of Ransomware on Healthcare

Before we dive deeper into how ANY.RUN helps counter such threats, let’s examine how devastating ransomware attacks can be across the healthcare sector.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| UnitedHealth | 190 million records stolen in the largest healthcare breach |
| Ascension | 5.6 million patients affected in a Black Basta ransomware attack. |
| Kootenai Health | 464,000 patient records leaked. |
| ConnectOnCall | Exposed the health data of over 910,000 patients in a breach of its SaaS system. |
| Medusind | A December 2023 breach impacted 360,000 individuals, exposing sensitive billing and health information. |
| Anna Jaques Hospital | Ransomware exposed sensitive health data for over 316,000 patients, disrupting critical medical services. |

### What’s at stake?

* **Loss of patient trust:** Exposed personal and health information undermines confidence in healthcare providers.

* **Operational disruption:** Hospitals and medical facilities are forced to halt services, delaying critical treatments.

* **Financial strain:** Organizations face ransom demands, legal fees, and recovery costs, compounding the impact.

### Why Healthcare Is a Prime Target

1. **Sensitive data**: Patient records are incredibly valuable on the black market. Ransomware groups exploit this by encrypting data and demanding payments for decryption.

2. **Critical infrastructure**: Many healthcare systems cannot afford prolonged downtime due to their role in patient care.

3. **Underfunded cybersecurity**: Many healthcare providers operate on tight budgets, often prioritizing patient services over robust IT defenses.

4. **Slow detection**: A common issue is the inability to identify and respond to attacks in their early stages, which allows ransomware to spread undetected.

## Interlock Group: Active Ransomware Threat to Healthcare

Interlock is a ransomware actor that engages in double-extortion.

In late 2024, the Interlock ransomware group launched targeted attacks against multiple healthcare facilities in the United States, causing significant disruptions and exposing sensitive patient data:

* **Brockton Neighborhood Health Center**: Breached on October 20, 2024, undetected until December 17, 2024.

* **Legacy Treatment Services**: Attack detected on October 26, 2024.

* **Drug and Alcohol Treatment Service**: Breach discovered on October 24, 2024.

## How ANY.RUN Helps at Different Stages of Interlock Attacks

ANY.RUN provides healthcare organizations with proactive tools to analyze and investigate ransomware attacks at various stages.

Let’s discover how by having a look at the Interlock ransomware group. The stages of the attack are taken from one of the most [detailed reports](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/) on the threat from Talos, released on January 14, 2025.
