# Malicious QR codes sent in the mail deliver malware

Posted: November 15, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Physical letters that contain a [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code) to trick people into downloading [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) are being sent through the mail, according to a [warning](https://www.ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/aktuell/im-fokus/2024/2024-meteosuisse.html) issued by The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

The letters are sent as if they come from the official Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss) and they urge the recipient to install a new “severe weather app.”

This app, however, does not exist, and the letters do not come from MeteoSwiss either.

Scanning the [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code) in the malicious letters leads to a banking [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) known as Coper, but also referred to as Octo2. Coper is a Malware-as-a-Service which “customers” can spread as they see fit, but they pay for the use of the malicious software and the underlying infrastructure. These customers are running campaigns targeting Europe, the US, Canada, the Middle East, Singapore, and Australia.

Coper is a sophisticated banking Trojan that has several advanced features:

* Device Takeover (DTO) capabilities for remote control
* Advanced obfuscation techniques to avoid detection
* [Overlay attacks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/explained-android-overlays-and-how-they-are-used-to-trick-people) aimed at credential theft

The fake “meteorology app” for this malware campaign is disguised under the name “AlertSwiss” when installed on [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) devices, but Coper cybercriminals can customize these names for all other campaigns. That adaptability makes for a more convincing lure depending on which country or region is being targeted. For instance, “AlertSwiss” is a clear attempt to fake the name of an official app from the Federal Office for Civil Protection which is used by federal and cantonal agencies to inform, warn, and alert the population. That real app’s name is “Alertswiss” (note the tiny difference).

Using QR codes in snail mail offers the criminals a few advantages. People may not expect to end up with their device infected by something as non-technical as a physical letter. And QR codes get typically read by mobile devices, which—unfortunately—still get overlooked when it comes to installing [security software](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus).

QR codes are becoming more common, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic which pushed many restaurants into using digital menus instead of physical menus that are shared between customers (in the earliest days of COVID lockdowns, science was still emerging on the risk levels of touching shared objects). Because of so much change in the past few years, seeing a QR code in a letter from an official institution does not trigger any alarm bells anymore.

And many Android users suffer from either a “patch gap” or are even using Android versions that are no longer supported, so will never receive another security update. One of the main causes for a patc...
