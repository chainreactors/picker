In episode six of The AI Fix, our hosts discover an unusual place to put a traffic cone, Mark learns why Americans should pretend to be from Brazil, and Graham discovers a way to make any situation much, much worse.

Graham inflicts his terrible Australian accent on Mark while explaining bot-on-bot crime, and Mark tells Graham how to lobotomise an AI that‚Äôs obsessed with bridges.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
