In 2006, British mathematician [**Clive Humby**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clivehumby/?originalSubdomain=uk) coined the phrase - "data is the new oil."  This has proven to be very true since like oil, data if left unrefined (unanalyzed and misunderstood) is effectively worthless.

### Forcepoint Data Visibility

This worthless data is often called "dark data."  What makes it a difficult problem for most organizations is the sheer size of all this dark data.  **80% of data** today is unstructured and **90% of that data** is [unanalyzed, unknown or unseen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/02/03/the-unseen-data-conundrum/?sh=6a2da8d27fcc)—in other words it's dark.  On top of that, a lot of that data may contain personally identifiable information (PII) which you as a company are responsible to protect.

> How can you protect data you effectively can't even see?"

Check out [this infographic](https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/infographics/forcepoint-data-visibility-infographic) to learn about the hidden costs of dark data and how you can turn that data from a liability into a valuable asset.  See how Forcepoint can bring you a panoramic view into all your unstructured data, reduce the risk and cost of data and turn a liability into a valuable asset for your organization.
