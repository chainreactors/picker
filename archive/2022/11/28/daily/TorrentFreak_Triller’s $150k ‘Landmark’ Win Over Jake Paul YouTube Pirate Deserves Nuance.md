# Triller’s $150k ‘Landmark’ Win Over Jake Paul YouTube Pirate Deserves Nuance

As part of an anti-piracy campaign against people who allegedly streamed the Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren fight in 2021, Triller sued the operator of the YourEXTRA YouTube channel. Last week a California court found Arvin De La Santos liable for $150,000 in copyright infringement damages, a "landmark" win according to Triller. The details of the case provide a little more nuance.

[![boxing](https://torrentfreak.com/images/boxing.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/boxing.png)YouTube is one of the most successful sites ever to grace the internet. The site is extremely easy to use and with almost no barriers to entry, it’s one of the best platforms to build an audience.

On the downside, using unlicensed content to gain traction renders successes vulnerable to sudden collapse on the whim of a copyright holder. That could mean a strike, a channel ban, or even a lawsuit.

After Arvin De La Santos restreamed the Jake Paul vs. Ben Askren fight on his YourEXTRA YouTube channel in April 2021, Triller filed a DMCA notice and YouTube removed the content. For a channel that specialized in “drama related” topics, the next year of events could’ve taken it to the next level.

## Triller Lawsuit – June 2021

YourEXTRA built an audience of 113,000+ subscribers and generated 14 million views in just four years, but after Triller hit De La Santos with a full-blown lawsuit in June 2021, the channel went quiet. Filed at a California district court, the scale of Triller’s complaint probably contributed to the silence.

Triller [described](https://torrentfreak.com/triller-sues-yourextra-youtube-channel-for-jake-paul-fight-piracy-210618/) De La Santos as a business entity and sued for copyright infringement (making the content available on YouTube), vicarious copyright infringement (liability for YouTube viewers’ infringement), plus violations of the Federal Communications Act (alleged interception of satellite broadcasts).

When combined these overly ambitious claims stretched well beyond six digits but even a partial win for Triller would’ve been devastating for De La Santos. So, in its determination to send a message to pirates, Triller dug in. What the YouTuber needed now was a good lawyer and on October 18, 2021, intellectual property specialist Steven Vondram stepped in to answer Triller’s complaint.

## Triller Accused of Deception

Defendants are required to file an answer but in most cases they consist of a tedious list of yes, no, or don’t know type responses. This one was different. According to the defense, De La Santos was “enticed to settle the alleged infringement” instead of going to court. He reportedly paid a settlement fee to Triller, which came with a release of claims. Things didn’t go to plan.

“Thereafter, [Triller] filed this lawsuit and returned the settlement fee (without interest) and now seeks to recover damages and attorney fees that they are not entitled to,” the YouTuber’s attorney [informed the court](https://torrentfreak.com/triller-reportedly-agreed-to-settle-jake-paul-piracy-claim-then-returned-the-cash-211023/).

“This is a deceptive act and practice under California law. The parties have previously agreed and resolved this dispute, which Plaintiff has now refused to honor.”

Alleged wrongdoing in hand, De La Santos attempted to turn the tables. He asked for the complaint to be dismissed with prejudice, judgment to be entered in his favor, plus an order for costs and attorneys’ fees incurred to date.

## Neither Side Gives Ground

A joint report to the court in November 2021 revealed a damages claim adjustment but little progress. Statutory copyright damages can reach $150,000 per claim but the report indicated $140,000. Triller’s original complaint demanded $110,000 for each violation of the Federal Communications Act but the report cited an adjusted figure of $10,000.

For his part, De La Santos insisted that since he’d settled the matter, he would respond by sueing Triller for damages. Triller warned it would depose both the YouTuber and a “corporate representative” of the YourEXTRA YouTube channel, and conduct discovery to find out how the broadcast was obtained, how it was shared and with whom, and whether any financial benefit was accrued by the YouTuber.

## Money Makes The World Go Round

In March 2022, Vondran told the California district court that a written retainer agreement between him and his client required payment for certain fees “if a settlement wasn’t achieved” and if the lawsuit “moved to litigation,” which it clearly had.

Court records show that De La Santos couldn’t actually afford a lawyer so Vondran requested permission to withdraw as counsel for the defense, noting that “YourNEXT is NOT a corporation.” De La Santos could either represent himself or find replacement counsel, but he’d probably be forced to default, Vondran wrote.

## Triller Wins Partial Summary Judgment

With De La Santos apparently in no position to mount a credible defense, five weeks later Triller submitted a proposed summary judgment declaring the YouTuber liable on three grounds: direct infringement, vicarious infringement, and violation of the Federal Communications Act.

Against defendants Del Santos, YourEXTRA, and Does 1-10, Triller demanded $50,000 jointly and severally under [17 U.S.C. § 504(a)-(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504#:~:text=statutory%20damages%2C%20as%20provided%20by%20subsection%20(c).&text=The%20copyright%20owner%20is%20entitled,in%20computing%20the%20actual%20damages), $10,000 under 47 U.S. Code § 605 (Unauthorized publication or use of communications), plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

Triller submitted a second, largely unchanged proposed summary judgment this June and in July, United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer agreed that Triller was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of copyright infringement.

“Triller has demonstrated that even if Defendants were not actually aware that their conduct constituted copyright infringement, Defendants at the very least recklessly disregarded that possibility or were willfully blind to it,” Judge Fischer wrote.

## Triller’s Damages Claim Lacked Substance

Triller’s $50,000 statutory damages claim for copyright infringement was based on its assertion that “at least one thousand people” chose to watch the fight on the YourEXTRA YouTube channel instead of paying $50 each to Triller..

The theory presented to the court stated that De La Santos had made “several hundred dollars” by gaining around one thousand followers and one million views on his YouTube channel by airing the fight. Given that the fight was quickly taken down by Triller, these numbers didn’t appear to make much sense. There were reasons for that.

Surprisingly, Triller’s figures were not obtained direc...
