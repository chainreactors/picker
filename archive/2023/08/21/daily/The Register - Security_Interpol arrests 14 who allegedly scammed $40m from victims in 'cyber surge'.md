An Interpol-led operation arrested 14 suspects and identified 20,674 "suspicious" networks spanning 25 African countries that international cops have linked to more than $40 million in cybercrime losses.

Africa Cyber Surge II, a [combined police operation](https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2023/Cybercrime-14-arrests-thousands-of-illicit-cyber-networks-disrupted-in-Africa-operation) which began in April and lasted four months, was a coordinated effort between Interpol, African law enforcement, and private-sector security firms to disrupt online extortion, phishing, business email compromise (BEC) and other cyber scams. But given that BEC scams [cost billions](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/05/fbi_cyber_scams/) of dollars a year it's small change.

Interpol, Afripol, and infosec companies Group-IB and Uppsala Security provided on-the-ground operational support, the international agency said. This included helping with three arrests in Cameroon related to an online scam involving the fraudulent sale of works of art worth $850,000.
