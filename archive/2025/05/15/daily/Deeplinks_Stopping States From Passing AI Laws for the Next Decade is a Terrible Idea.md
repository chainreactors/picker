This week, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee moved forward with a proposal in its budget reconciliation bill to impose a ten-year preemption of state AI regulation—essentially saying only Congress, not state legislatures, can place safeguards on AI for the next decade.

We strongly oppose this. We’ve talked before about why [federal preemption of stronger state privacy laws](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/federal-preemption-state-privacy-law-hurts-everyone) hurts everyone. Many of the same arguments apply here. For one, this would override existing state laws enacted to mitigate against emerging harms from AI use. It would also keep states, which have been more responsive on AI regulatory issues, from reacting to emerging problems.

Finally, it risks freezing any regulation on the issue for the next decade—a considerable problem given the pace at which companies are developing the technology. Congress does not react quickly and, particularly when addressing harms from emerging technologies, has been far slower to act than states. Or, as a number of state lawmakers who are leading on tech policy issues from across the country said in a recent [joint open letter](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/8aa50f9a-5bde-47b4-b69b-0fdbf2f6670c?source=email), “If Washington wants to pass a comprehensive privacy or AI law with teeth, more power to them, but we all know this is unlikely.”
