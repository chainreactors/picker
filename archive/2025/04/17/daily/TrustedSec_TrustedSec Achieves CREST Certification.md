At TrustedSec, our goal of making the world a safer place has culminated in a new milestone: CREST Certification. This internationally recognized accreditation is a testament to our commitment to maintaining the highest standards in cybersecurity.

[CREST](https://www.crest-approved.org/) (Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers) is an internationally recognized accreditation body that sets rigorous standards for penetration testing, incident response, threat intelligence, and SOC services. Companies that achieve CREST Certification must undergo a rigorous assessment process that evaluates technical capabilities, methodologies, data security, and professional ethics.

## Why CREST Certification Matters

By adding CREST Certification to our credentials, TrustedSec bolsters our position as a [cybersecurity leader](https://trustedsec.com/trustedsec-named-a-leader-in-cybersecurity-consulting-services). This certification brings several key benefits to our partners:

**Assurance of Quality** – CREST Certification validates that our work meets global standards, ensuring that our partners receive high-quality, repeatable, and consistent assessments and consulting services.

**Compliance and Regulatory Alignment** – Many industries and regulatory bodies, including PCI DSS, GDPR, and NIST frameworks, recognize or require CREST-accredited testing firms. TrustedSec’s certification means our services align with these global compliance requirements.

**Continuous Improvement** – CREST accreditation requires firms to maintain ongoing training, rigorous technical assessments, and regular audits. This ensures our team remains at the forefront of knowledge and innovation, delivering the best possible services to our partners and the cybersecurity community.

### Onward and Upward

We are always pushing boundaries to help organizations secure environments, reduce risk, and respond to evolving threats, and achieving CREST certification is another step toward those goals.

If you’re looking for a trusted, CREST-certified security partner, TrustedSec is [ready to help](https://trustedsec.com/contact).
