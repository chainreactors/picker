Business Process Transformation came to life as a medium to enable Digital Transformation by helping businesses design, restructure, and automate their business process to improve operational efficiency. Unsurprisingly, every major Digital Transformation initiative now heavily focuses on optimizing business processes through intelligence and insights. However, there still is a misconception about how wide of an impact Business Process Transformation has on your overall Digital Transformation Strategy which comprises various other important factors and initiatives. Through this blog, I would like to dig deeper into understanding Digital Transformation and highlighting how Business Process Transformation plays a much bigger role than we give it credit for (hang tight!), especially as offerings in the space become stronger and wider. I would like to share some learnings and research from a course that I took on ‘Digital Transformation and Enterprise Agility’ at Duke University and from my time at SAP Signavio as a Product Strategy intern, touching on three crucial aspects:

* The three horizons of Digital Transformation

* How Business Process Transformation plays a role in Digital Transformation; &

* The path forward

Join me on this journey!

# **The History of Digital Transformation**

Digital Transformation has been around for years. Despite being a relatively new concept that is adopted at scale today, it can be traced back to the late ‘70s when computer-aided design and manufacturing came into the picture.

Looking further back, we can also find traces of transformation at the onset of industrialization. Mass production changed how businesses worked, followed by changes with the wide availability and adoption of computers. It took some time for these technological advancements to appear; computers came 50-60 years from the onset of mass production, and the internet became publicly available after 15-20 years of home computers.

Despite these huge gaps, it was hard for businesses to adjust to these technological advancements and change how they work and interact with their consumers. The common pitfall was the lack of a holistic understanding of Digital Transformation; and history has taught us that Digital Transformation efforts should focus on much more than just technology.

Employee engagement, cross-functional collaboration, accountability, and the right mindset are critical to realizing your dream of Digital Transformation on top of a willingness to maintain, extend, improve, and reimagine your business through innovation. Moreover, Digital Transformation is not a one-time exercise anymore but needs to be constantly incorporated into your business strategy to survive. It becomes vital for businesses today to be prepared and to keep riding these waves of disruption.

# **The Three Horizons of Digital Transformation**

These days, we understand that Digital Transformation is not just about using the latest technology to improve your current operations and make them more efficient.

While it is essential to strengthen your core against possible disruptions, it is also important to constantly look at how you can improve and extend your offerings while thinking about innovation to reimagine your business.

According to the model on Strategic Horizons of Digital Transformation, developed by Prof. Anthony O’Driscoll of Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, an organization looking at Digital Transformation should look at all the following three horizons.

With the rise of both technological and competitive disruptions, the need to constantly look for new areas to explore is higher than it has ever been before. To understand the three horizons mentioned above, let us look at organizational examples of digital transformation across the three layers. Below you can find some examples of each of the horizons:

## Horizon 1 - Maintain

A simple example of Horizon 1 (Maintain) would be of the hospitality/hotel industry which included technology through online bookings to maintain/improve their operations. Although some direct technological investments did serve the long-term purpose of making bookings easier, we still can argue that the hospitality industry could have done better. They could have prepared for insurgents like Airbnb if they had reimagined their businesses and invested in innovation across Horizons 2 and 3 alongside focusing on Horizon 1.

## Horizon 2 - Extend/Improve

An example of Horizon 2 (Extend/Improve) is Spotify, which ventured into podcasts on top of its music platform. Spotify already had the technology to deliver content through its platform. It understood the growing demand for podcasts and extended its offering, opening a new market by providing podcasts alongside music.

## Horizon 3 – Reimagine

The last example for Horizon 3 (Reimagine) is Amazon which foresaw the red ocean being created in the e-commerce space and ventured into AWS,...
