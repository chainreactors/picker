# Build-Your-Own-Ransomware: Hands-On Offensive and Defensive Insights

Slides:

[Part 1](/rad9800/byor/blob/main/slides/BYOR.pdf)

## Exercises

### Time to Write Your Own Ransomware

* Implement hybrid encryption
  + Master + Ephemeral Keys
  + Encryption + Decryption
    - String - one program
    - File - one program
    - File - two program
* File System Enumeration
  + Depth or Breadth First Search
  + Print out the files you discover
  + Realize then you want to skip certain folders

### Applying Evasion

* Review the references and slides
  + Apply the techniques to your ransomware

Examples:

* Different encryption strategies
* File System Enumeration (not DFS/BFS)
