## Remotely Exploding Pagers

[Wow](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-attack-hezbollah/index.html).

It seems they all exploded simultaneously, which means they were triggered.

Were they each tampered with physically, or did someone figure out how to trigger a thermal runaway remotely? Supply chain attack? Malicious code update, or natural vulnerability?

I have no idea, but I expect we will all learn over the next few days.

EDITED TO ADD: I’m [reading](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-17-2024/) nine killed and 2,800 injured. That’s a *lot* of collateral damage. (I haven’t seen a good number as to the number of pagers yet.)

EDITED TO ADD: Reuters [writes](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-hezbollah-members-wounded-lebanon-when-pagers-exploded-sources-witnesses-2024-09-17/): “The [pagers](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/) that detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months, three security sources said.” That implies supply chain attack. And it seems to be a large detonation for an overloaded battery.

This reminds me of the 1996 assassination of [Yahya Ayyash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Ayyash) using a booby-trapped cell phone.

EDITED TO ADD: I am deleting political comments. On this blog, let’s stick to the tech and the security ramifications of the threat.

EDITED TO ADD (9/18): [More](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/18/world/israel-hezbollah-gaza-hamas) explosions today, this time radios. Good *New York Times* [explainer](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/europe/pager-explosions-lebanon-what-we-know.html). And a *Wall Street Journal* [article](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/new-details-in-hezbollah-pager-attack-point-to-supply-chain-breach-by-israel-8cd76a60). Clearly a physical supply chain attack.

EDITED TO ADD (9/18): [Four](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/hezbollah-pager-explosions-israel-suspicions) [more](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israel-s-hand-of-god-operation/ar-AA1qMval) [good](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/hezbollah-pager-explosion-israel-lebanon.html) [articles](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/israel-s-strategic-win/ar-AA1qLoeA).

Supply chain attack, surely?

Who on earth still uses *pagers* for comms today? Even the NHS has moved on. Maybe Hezbollah were sold special “secure” pagers because they didn’t have all the tracking that modern smartphones have?

The fact that they all exploded simultaneously makes unlikely the thermal runaway hack hypothesis. I also doubt a pager very small battery would be enough to actually kill the wearer…

Whatever one thinks of Israel in general, one cannot but stand in awe sometimes at the works of their military/intelligence/cyberwarfare people.

@Paul,

I can’t help thinking that if both sides put as much time, effort, and money into working toward peaceful solutions rather than trying to kill each other things would be so much better for the people on both sides.

I have no idea how that could come about though with the constant justification for violence used by both sides.

Sigh

Now that the world knows this technology exists, many nation states are going to be trying to develop or steal this tech. The risk of using this against Hezbollah is that it will later be used against one’s own nations or allies’ nations.

Who still uses pagers in developed nations? Doctors.

Thermal runaway would not produce explosions I think. Because of the large scale it almost has to be explosives inserted in the pagers in a supply chain attack.

The American University of Beirut Medical Center, Office of Communications, posted a message about the pager attacks, saying that their pager system was updated August 29, 2024 and implying that none of the hospital’s pagers exploded. They also stated they have over 160 seriously injured victims of the pager attack.

What are these pagers used for? What is one supposed to do when paged?

Can one bootstrap a membership roster with a list of the injured?

Who else uses these pagers? Just the HzbA or another group?

Part of their comms system is down…unless these pagers work after exploding. In what scenario might that be useful?

Probably just a speculation at this point, but this article claims a cyber attack against the mobile provider, uploading some script to the pagers that caused battery overload:

“That’s a lot of collateral damage” – quite the contrary. This seems to be targeted specifically at operatives holding those pagers, and the videos show that even people standing within a couple of feet of the devices aren’t hurt. This is as surgical as you can get at this scale.

Definitely a supply chain attack; there’s not enough power in a pager battery, and what there is can’t be released by a thermal runaway f...
