Microsoft today released patches for 71 vulnerabilities. 16 of these vulnerabilities are considered critical. One vulnerability (CVE-2024-49138) has already been exploited, and details were made public before today's patch release.

### Significant Vulnerabilities

**CVE-2024-49138**: This vulnerability affects theÂ Windows Common Log File System Driver, a subsystem affected by similar privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the past. The only reason I consider this "significant" is that it is already being exploited.

**Windows Remote Desktop Services**: 9 of the 16 critical vulnerabilities affect Windows Remote Desktop Services. Exploitation may lead to remote code execution. Microsoft considers the exploitation of these vulnerabilities less likely. Even without considering these vulnerabilities, Windows Remote Desktop Service should not be exposed to the internet.

**LDAP**: Remote code execution vulnerabilities in the LDAP service are always "interesting" given the importance of LDAP as part of Active Directory. Two critical vulnerabilities are patched for LDAP. One with a CVSS score of 9.8. A third critical vulnerability affects the LDAP client.

**CVE-2024-49126**: LSASS vulnerabilities always make me reminisce of the "Blaster" worm and the related vulnerability back in the day. This one does involve a race condition, which will make exploitation more difficult. It could become an interesting lateral movement vulnerability if a reliable exploit materializes.
