# An Elf walks into the bar‚Ä¶

Posted on [2023-05-11](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2023/05/11/an-elf-walks-into-the-bar/ "10:29 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

Windows 11‚Äôs advapi32.dll includes interesting export functions:

* ElfBackupEventLogFileA
* ElfBackupEventLogFileW
* ElfChangeNotify
* ElfClearEventLogFileA
* ElfClearEventLogFileW
* ElfCloseEventLog
* ElfDeregisterEventSource
* ElfFlushEventLog
* ElfNumberOfRecords
* ElfOldestRecord
* ElfOpenBackupEventLogA
* ElfOpenBackupEventLogW
* ElfOpenEventLogA
* ElfOpenEventLogW
* ElfReadEventLogA
* ElfReadEventLogW
* ElfRegisterEventSourceA
* ElfRegisterEventSourceW
* ElfReportEventA
* ElfReportEventAndSourceW
* ElfReportEventW

And I know nothing about them‚Ä¶ while they are obviously exported by advapi32.dll and for some unknown reason, they do not seem to be imported ‚Ä¶ by anything (no .exe, .dll import these functions, at least directly!). Plus, most of these apis‚Äô code reference NDR functions (RPC), so unless you are really well-versed in these, it‚Äôs hard to reverse them üôÅ

BUT

A [quick google](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-log-file-format) suggests that these are not Linux-related (refrerence to ‚ÄòELF‚Äô), and are actually Event Log File (also ‚ÄòELF‚Äô)-related. In a trivial pursuit of the truth, we look at the code of Elf\* functions and their invocations and we can almost immediately see that f.ex. that [RegisterEventSourceW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-registereventsourcew) is calling ElfRegisterEventSourceW internally. So‚Ä¶ looks like either intentionally, or accidentally the MS coders exposed a lower-level interface to Event Logs.

As such, functions:

* ElfClearEventLogFileA
* ElfClearEventLogFileW

may be perhaps of interest?
