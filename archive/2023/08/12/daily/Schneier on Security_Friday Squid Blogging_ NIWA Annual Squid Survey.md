## Friday Squid Blogging: NIWA Annual Squid Survey

Results from the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research Limited annual [squid survey](https://niwa.co.nz/news/fascinating-finds-from-niwas-annual-squid-survey):

> This year, the team unearthed spectacular large hooked squids, weighing about 15kg and sitting at 2m long, a Taningia—­which has the largest known light organs in the animal kingdom­—and a few species that remain very rare in collections worldwide, such as the “scaled” squid Lepidoteuthis and the Batoteuthis skolops.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Is there a sinister side to the rise of female robots?

“The idea of having sex with an android has existed in mainstream entertainment for decades, in science fictions films such as Blade Runner, AI Artificial Intelligence, Her and Ex Machina.

In her book Man-Made Women, Richardson warns of a growing trend – the idea has jumped from science fiction to morning talk shows and music videos. Sex doll brothels are opening in Barcelona, Berlin and Moscow.

She cautions that there would be a massive cost to normalising such interaction. “What we’re building into society is this very egocentric idea that actually what a single human being is feeling and thinking and experiencing is “a relationship”. So they can project onto an AI avatar all these feelings.

“There’s a concern generally with AI, especially when it’s related to sex: human relationships are difficult. There’s risk involved with any kind of intimacy, and AI is more compliant.”

Some people find pornography easier than dating, he says, and AI could provide a way of avoiding the effort of dealing with other human beings, and the fear of rejection that this brings.

He sees more of a future in animated characters which are interactive, rather than three-dimensional humanoid “companion bots”. “Pretty much anything with moving parts is going to be problematic. Think about the attention the automobile requires compared to whatever computer you’re working on.”

@ vas pup

what a single human being is feeling and thinking and experiencing

This ultra-solipsism of living for a purely imaginative ideal and adjusting external realities to conform to that image has become more and more common as technologies have provided more and more mastery over nature. It’s Descartes’  *cogito ergo sum*  at headlong cancerous growth.

@ vas pup, modem phonems,

Re : Man made Woman.

Whilst the mechanics are there and apparently improving there is no AI that comes even close to even minimal social interaction.

However we have to ask the important question,

“Will it reduce the issues to do with unmaried males under 25 creating violence and other social disruption including war?”

It’s been found that where normal prostitution is accepted and sensibly controled, streat crime and violent crime tends to be less.

It’s been argued that religious opposition to prostitution is actually not traditionally part of most religions. And further it has been brought in as a form of political control to increase the likelyhood of social unrest thus a steady supply of soldiers to go get slaughtered in national conflicts and the like.

But in this century we have an issue. Corporates etc have an increasing requirment for non physical labour employees. For various reasons women still get paid less than men and a 25% salary / bonus disparity is common despite legislation.

Since the 1950’s women have increasingly been able to become independently waged at a rate that alows them to be not supported by either their family or a husband etc. This in turn has enabled them to avoid what many called “the marriage trap”. The result is that rather than starting families in their late teens or early twenties women are putting of having children into their late thirties and even fourties (with some leaving it to late). One consequence of which is that they do not form traditional relationships… That is they do not want what many men want and part of that is increasing numbers of men are not in any kind of relationship with women even as friendship.

It is argued that this lack of available women for more traditional relationships is causing significant social disruption.

It’s thus not hard to see why some would argue,

“Why not robots/androids?”

Anyone who saw the original “Westworld” film can see the way movie developers thought through the last three decades of the last century. Likewise “Stepford Wives”, it’s a form of misogynism that is actually a “teen queen slave” prediliction boardering on worse behaviours.

Whilst it might be a “five minute fantasy” the reality is that it is not what the majority want out of a relationship short term or otherwise.

So it’s not the mechanics of robots / androids that is going to be looked for but the “intelligence” and as normal AI is still for bilking investors “a decade away” but in reality is not going to happen in our life times nor that of our children.

Also,

Could we aford the energy bill?

Current LLMs suck in energy like crypto-coin mining machines and what they push out in the way of “conversation” is easily recognized as faux at best.

So whilst there are “sex machines” that are starting to look creepily like girls they are not in anyway “companion bots” or substitutes for women, nor are they going to be.

@Clive Robinson. We agree with never steering women this way (however implicitly), never mind religious o...
