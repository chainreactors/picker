With mobile applications considered an indispensable part of many business strategies, safeguarding them from cyberthreats means more than ever. However, the current developer shortage and lack of specialized mobile app security training makes it difficult to create high-quality mobile apps built with security in mind.

For instance, a [recent IDC Market Perspective report](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US48223621) predicts a global labor shortfall of 4 million developers by 2025. Additionally, a [Trellix global survey](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bad-news-the-cybersecurity-skills-crisis-is-about-to-get-even-worse/) of more than 1,000 cybersecurity professionals found that roughly 30% plan to change professions within two or more years, further emphasizing the struggle for organizations to hire the right employees to maintain proper mobile app security.

## How Pros Benefit from Mobile AppSec Training

Many mobile-first or mobile-enabled organizations have developers, security engineers, architects, analysts and QAs to help build quality mobile apps. But it turns out that even highly experienced workers within these categories have a limited understanding of the techniques, methods, and compliance requirements needed to develop safe and secure mobile apps. Some professionals believe that their [web app development](https://discover.nowsecure.com/c/web-vs-mobile-app-security-testing-tools?x=9z-j5n#page=1) knowledge directly translates to mobile app development, but mobile apps require a very specific set of skills and tools to minimize security and privacy risks.

Additionally, many professionals simply underestimate the security risks of mobile apps in general. In fact, a [2022 survey by Secure Code Warrior found](https://www.securecodewarrior.com/press-releases/secure-code-warrior-survey-finds-86-of-developers-do-not-view-application-security-as-a-top-priority) that 86% of devs do not view application security as a top priority when writing code, and only 29% believe the active practice of writing code free of vulnerabilities should be prioritized. Researchers also found that 33% of surveyed devs don’t know what makes their code vulnerable.

Businesses and government agencies have a vested interest in hiring dev security advocates that understand the significance of building mobile apps with security in mind throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Upskilling with mobile AppSec training courses allow developers to increase their understanding of mobile AppSec terminology and best practices, helping them become [security champions for their organization](https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2022/09/07/how-to-build-a-mobile-application-security-champion-program/). These courses help professionals showcase their mobile security expertise, increase their earning potential and open doors for promotions and new career opportunities.

Similarly, security analysts can use mobile AppSec training courses and certifications to demonstrate their unique value to current and new employers. Many security analysts have the skills and knowledge to keep web applications secure, but may be unfamiliar with the specific techniques needed to minimize risk in mobile apps. Mobile AppSec training can help security analysts understand the differences and intricacies of safeguarding mobile apps, helping those with mobile-specific security skills stand out from web-focused competitors.

Mobile app professionals can boost their productivity with several hours of free courseware, so they can proactively write secure code and test mobile apps for the most common security vulnerabilities. Free mobile AppSec courses also help learners write better code and test faster. In fact, NowSecure internal stats show trained professionals can release up to 30% faster at lower cost, and reduce risk by up to 40%. At the same time, these courses help professionals grow their resume by adding certifications and badges that showcase their understanding of mobile app security.
