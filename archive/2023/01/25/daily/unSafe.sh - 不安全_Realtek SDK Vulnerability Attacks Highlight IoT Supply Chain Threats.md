## **Executive Summary**

Unit 42 researchers review tens of millions of attack records every month, and most months, attacks targeting a single vulnerability do not exceed 10% of the total number of attacks. However, [we discovered that between August and October 2022](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security-trends-aug-oct-2022/), the number of attacks attempting to exploit a Realtek Jungle SDK remote code execution vulnerability ([CVE-2021-35394](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35394)) accounted for more than 40% of the total number of attacks.

As of December 2022, we’ve observed 134 million exploit attempts in total leveraging this vulnerability, and about 97% of these attacks occurred after the start of August 2022. At the time of writing, the attack is still ongoing.

Many of the attacks we observed tried to deliver malware to infect vulnerable IoT devices. This tells us that threat groups are using this vulnerability to carry out large-scale attacks on smart devices around the world. While the attacks we observed were successfully blocked by our products, it’s important to assess protection of these devices in your environment. Because IoT devices and routers are often not considered as part of an organization’s security posture, many devices and organizations could still be at risk.

CVE-2021-35394 affects almost 190 models of devices from 66 different manufacturers. We believe that this vulnerability attracted so many attackers because supply chain issues can make it difficult for the average user to identify the affected products that are being exploited.

In response to this concerning phenomenon, we dug deep into all the attack records of this vulnerability from when it was disclosed to December 2022 for analysis.

Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from the vulnerability and malware families mentioned in this post with the [Next-Generation Firewall](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) with [cloud-delivered security services](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/security-subscriptions) including [WildFire](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/wildfire). [Advanced URL Filtering](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering) and [DNS Security](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/dns-security) can block the command and control (C2) domain and malware hosting URLs. Our [IoT Security](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/enterprise-iot-security) platform can help identify anomalous network traffic, as well as determining the vendor, model and firmware version of a device to identify specific devices that are vulnerable to the aforementioned CVE.

## **Vulnerability Overview**

[CVE-2021-35394](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35394) was [disclosed](https://onekey.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-realtek-sdk-iot-supply-chain) on Aug. 16, 2021. The vulnerability affects UDPServer in Realtek Jungle SDK version 2.0 and later-Realtek Jungle SDK version 3.4.14B. Remote unauthenticated attackers could leverage this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary command execution, leading to devices being taken over.

Realtek chipsets are used by many IoT vendors in a variety of different products. This is a typical supply chain issue in that it can be difficult to identify whether your own devices are impacted, as the chipset may not be visible from the exterior of the device. According to a [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) scan searching for this vulnerability, we found port 9034 open in over 80 different IoT devices, and these devices belong to 14 unique vendors.In particular, we noted that router models manufactured by [several popular networking vendors](https://onekey.com/blog/advisory-multiple-issues-realtek-sdk-iot-supply-chain/) are affected by CVE-2021-35394. Based on crowdsourced data from enterprise networks monitored by the Palo Alto Networks IoT Security product, the brands in Table 1 have the most popular vulnerable devices in mid-to-large sized deployments. The supply chain vulnerabilities in these products directly contribute to expanding the attack surface of these networks.

(Note that the vendors who produce these devices may have released updated versions or recommended mitigations. However, organizations sometimes continue to use vulnerable models, and threat actors take advantage of such situations.)

Table 1. Vulnerable IoT networking devices.

Based on the attacks we have seen in the wild, we found the following three types of payloads:

* A script executes a shell command on the targeted server. This script actively connects to a malicious IP address, and automatically downloads and executes malware (shown in Figure 1). These threats were mostly from the Mirai malware family.

Figure 1. CVE-2021-35394 payload one.

* An injected command directly writes the binary payload to a file and then executes it (shown in Figure 2).

![Image 2 is a screenshot of the second payload of CVE-2021-35394. It is many lines of binary where the injected command writes this binary payload into a file for execution. ](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/word-image-126726-2.png)

Figure 2. CVE-2021-35394 payload two.

* An injected command directly reboots the targeted server to achieve denial of service (shown in Figure 3).

## **Malware Analysis**

Unit 42 researchers conducted analysis of malware samples that are delivered through the exploitation of CVE-2021-35394. Based on the attacks we have seen in the wild, most of the malware samples are from well-known malware families like [Mirai](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/search/unit42search#q=mirai), [Gafgyt](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/search/unit42search#q=Gafgyt) and Mozi. We also observed a new distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet developed in Golang, called RedGoBot (SHA256: 26e96945ee32199536d4c85...
