Every so often, Mac admins who administer Jamf Pro may run into a situation like this:

1. They need an installer package For Reasons.
2. That installer package is only stored on their Jamf Pro server.
3. They don‚Äôt have access to the distribution point which stores their Jamf Pro server‚Äôs installer packages.

In a situation like this, you can use a Jamf Pro policy to provide the installer to a specified Mac. For more details, please see below the jump.

To enable downloading an installer to a specified Mac using Jamf Pro, use the following procedure.

1. Create a policy in Jamf Pro.

![Screenshot 2023 05 25 at 3 22 50 PM](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screenshot-2023-05-25-at-3.22.50-pm.png?w=599&h=375 "Screenshot 2023-05-25 at 3.22.50 PM.png")

2. Add the installer package to the policy.

3. Set the installer package‚Äôs **Action** to **Cache**.

Set policy trigger and scoping as preferred.

Once the policy runs on the Mac(s) it‚Äôs scoped to run on, Jamf Pro will download the installer package to the following directory on the Mac(s):

**/Library/Application Support/JAMF/Waiting Room**

Note: The **Waiting Room** directory is only accessible using root privileges.

Once the policy finishes running, you can collect the downloaded installer from **/Library/Application Support/JAMF/Waiting Room**.

   The other useful technique here is to use Jamf Admin (the app), and drag a folder in the left side window. Then highlight said folder, and you will see a button on the bottom left to ‚ÄúReplicate‚Äù and then you can have a local copy of all your assets.

     Michael, if you‚Äôre on-premise, you‚Äôre over engineering things if you only need one package. When Jamf Admin is open with the drive mounted, open /Volumes. There you will find the smb share and can navigate to the pkg you need. I have no experience with Jamf Cloud so I can‚Äôt speak to that.

   While this is a good addition in tools/workflows, I have been using Jamf CPR with the ‚Äûsave only‚Äú option in these situations. Then you don‚Äôt need a policy.
   And probably it would be good, if the GUI just had a download button for each pkg.(I think there is a feature request for this, that we all should upvote)

   If you use the Jamf Cloud distribution point you can also use the following trick:

   1) Create a policy similar to your policy example, but add a custom trigger to it. In my example i use the trigger office365

   2) Open the terminal on a client device that is scoped to the policy

   3) In the terminal, run the policy with the custom trigger in verbose mode

   user@Macbook ~ % sudo jamf policy -trigger office365 verbose
   Checking for policies triggered by ‚Äúoffice365‚Äù for user ‚Äúuser‚Äù‚Ä¶
   Executing Policy Microsoft Office 365 Business Pro ‚Äì Install
