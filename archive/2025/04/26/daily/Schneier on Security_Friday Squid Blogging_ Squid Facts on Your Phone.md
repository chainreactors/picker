Text “SQUID” to 1-833-SCI-TEXT for [daily squid facts](https://squidfacts.bigcartel.com/product/girl-talk-squid-preorder). The website has merch.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce, ALL,

More “Internet Of Things”(IoT) being “tanked”

Some may remember “Nest” from before the Big G consumed them like a greedy child with a chocolate bar. As it really was not that long ago.

Well come this Sept Google is totally dropping support for the UK & Europe Nest Thermostats and the US is loosing support for the thermostats but Google are allegedly offering discounts on “upgrades”.

<https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-ending-support-for-older-nest-thermostats-will-stop-selling-nests-in-europe/>

This IoT “End Of Life”(EOL) by corporate Dictate” is reducing product life times towards the span of the warranty or less (Amazon I’m looking at you…).

I’ve been asked in the past why I don’t do “Voice Assistants” and electronics controlled from a mobile phone… Well aside from Amazon killing an IoT device within 6 months and the entire lack of security in IoT, I oft mention the European Directive on “Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment”(WEEE). Which is supposed to stop what Cory Doctorow calls “Enshitification” of such goods.

But consider on a couple of walls in my home I have Thermostats to control the pumps in my central heating that follow an electrical timer switch. As an independant pair for the upstairs and likewise the downstairs they have both been working quietly and unobtrusively for over 40years and still work today… I can not remember how much I paid for them it was probably less than 10UKP, so they have more than paid for themselves in that time.

But I do remember they only took a half day to replace the original downstairs untimed thermostat with a new timer and thermostat and install a “back box” and timer and thermostat upstairs with the hard part “pulling through and splicing in” a “frost override” from a thermostat in the porch (technically you are nolonger allowed to do a “wired OR” with mains wiring in the UK so I’d have to rewire if I ever upgrade). It’s been suggested to me that I should replace with a “Smart Heating” device to which I giveca hollow laugh and shake my head sadly, because,

“New does not imply better.”

More accurately these days it actually means “worse” a lot worse…

A quiet little release by the SCMP [1] notes a “dual use” tool developed by Chinese marine engineers. The Conversation [2] takes one extreme use case for a pearl-clutching story.

@ lurker,

With regards sub-sea cable cutting, I’ve mentioned it as a major security threat several times over the years on this blog (search for “sub sea” or “choke point”).

Gives an overview of what could be done more than a quarter century ago.

You can see the process is basically little different than the subsea equivalent of “walk up and strap a bomb on”.

Add a bit of fancy electronics as a detonator and you could bring the Western world to a near grinding halt in seconds…

@ d30, ALL,

With regards,

> “hi hello is this like exploding internet cables”

Rather more than…

Whilst we hear a lot about the new low earth orbit satellites bringing the Internet to the entire surface of the globe. The reality is nearly 99% of all “data” is hauled across microwave links, copper wires and fiber optic strands of glass. All of which are actually quite fragile and a good hit with the force of a “14lb lump hammer” in any one of a multitude of sensitive places will stop that data moving.

But much of that “data” is not what most would think of as the “Internet” it’s phone calls and other traditional communications like industrial and transportational “telemetry” that controls the flow of human voices, industrial process feedstock, and finalised product in supply chains.

It would not be unfair to say that,

“Next to nothing moves in the physical domain without bit movements preceding it in the information domain.”

Rather more bits of data moved, than there are granules in that big jar of instant coffee you had your morning cup of “eye opener” from, just to get the jar in your hands. Admittedly many if not most of them completely redundant but flow they did.

Whilst it’s all “fairly simple” when you understand enough of the foundations it still has an overwhelming feeling of fantasy about it.

The problem is that back in the mid Victorian days when sending bits of information over wire and even microwaves was starting most European Nations had “Enemies of the State” whilst not all top hat wearing long moustache twirling types of melodrama they did know how to make “Infernal Machines” that was the name given to explosive devices with mechanical fuses. As most surmise the percussive force of such devices in close proximity to fragile equipment oft results in fragile pieces being not just disrupted but spread widely about, thus not working or being easily reparable, thus remaining out of action for quite some period of time.

Well have a thought about it as an asymmetric exercise, of how you protect fragile from percussive and just how crud the infernal devices can be.

If you are unsure what tha...
