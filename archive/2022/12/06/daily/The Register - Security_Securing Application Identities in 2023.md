# Securing Application Identities in 2023

## The rise and rise of non-human identities

Webinar Just as Frank Sinatra sang in days gone by, 'love and marriage' goes together like a 'horse and carriage,' there should be no question about the true pairing of security and speed. Or as Sinatra went on to croon, 'try, try, try to separate them, it's an illusion.' Companies may feel they are forced to choose between securing all their application identities at the cost of speed of development, but this doesn't have to be the case.

Non-human identities, applications, workloads, and devices with all the data they contain will make up nearly 98 percent of the total identities in any company by 2023, according to research cited by CyberArk. More than ever, it is vital to ensure all applications identities are secure everywhere at the same time as developing operations at speed. But how to bring about the marriage of two minds – in this case, Security and DevOps.

Join The Register's Tim Phillips on 13 December 5 pm GMT/12 pm ET in conversation with Kurt Sand, General Manager of DevSecOps at CyberArk as they discuss major emerging trends in the DevSecOps world along with a big future prediction. They will also look at automation and policy-as-code, a new 'SaaS' – Secrets as a Service.' And share advice on how to effectively partner in this new world.
