Updated Cybersecurity workers review major updates to software applications only 54 percent of the time, according to a poll of tech managers.

That figure comes from CrowdStrike, which recently [published](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/report-2024-state-of-app-security-report.pdf?version=0) [PDF] its 2024 State of Application Security Report. It's based on interviews with admittedly just 400 US security managers, so take it all with a suitable pinch of salt.

The likelihood that major code updates undergo a security review resembles a bell curve, according to the survey. Twenty-two percent of respondents confessed they did a security review under half of the time, and the same percentage claim to have reviewed code 50 to 74 percent of the time.
