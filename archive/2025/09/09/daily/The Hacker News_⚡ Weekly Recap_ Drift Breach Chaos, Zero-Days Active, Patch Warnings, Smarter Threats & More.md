Cybersecurity never slows down. Every week brings new threats, new vulnerabilities, and new lessons for defenders. For security and IT teams, the challenge is not just keeping up with the news‚Äîit's knowing which risks matter most right now. That's what this digest is here for: a clear, simple briefing to help you focus where it counts.

This week, one story stands out above the rest: the Salesloft‚ÄìDrift breach, where attackers stole OAuth tokens and accessed Salesforce data from some of the biggest names in tech. It's a sharp reminder of how fragile integrations can become the weak link in enterprise defenses.

Alongside this, we'll also walk through several high-risk CVEs under active exploitation, the latest moves by advanced threat actors, and fresh insights on making security workflows smarter, not noisier. Each section is designed to give you the essentials‚Äîenough to stay informed and prepared, without getting lost in the noise.

## ‚ö° Threat of the Week

**[Salesloft to Take Drift Offline Amid Security Incident](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/salesloft-takes-drift-offline-after.html)** ‚Äî Salesloft announced that it has taken Drift temporarily offline effective September 5, 2025, at 6 a.m. ET, as multiple companies have been caught up in a far-reaching supply chain attack spree targeting the marketing software-as-a-service product, resulting in the mass theft of authentication tokens. "This will provide the fastest path forward to comprehensively review the application and build additional resiliency and security in the system to return the application to full functionality," the company said. "As a result, the Drift chatbot on customer websites will not be available, and Drift will not be accessible. To date, Cloudflare, Google Workspace, PagerDuty, Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, SpyCloud, Tanium, Tenable, and Zscaler have confirmed they were impacted by the hack. The activity has been attributed to a threat cluster tracked by Google and Cloudflare as UNC6395 and GRUB1, respectively.

## üîî Top News

* **[Sitecore Flaw Under Active Exploitation in the Wild](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/cisa-orders-immediate-patch-of-critical.html)** ‚Äî Unknown miscreants are exploiting a configuration vulnerability in multiple Sitecore products to achieve remote code execution via a publicly exposed key and deploy snooping malware on infected machines. The ViewState deserialization vulnerability, CVE-2025-53690, has been used to deploy malware and additional tooling geared toward internal reconnaissance and persistence across one or more compromised environments. The attackers targeted the "/sitecore/blocked.aspx" endpoint, which contains an unauthenticated ViewState form, with HTTP POST requests containing a crafted ViewState payload. Mandiant said it disrupted the intrusion midway, which prevented it from gaining further insights into the attack lifecycle and determining the attackers' motivations.
* **[Russian APT28 Deploys "NotDoor" Outlook Backdoor](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/russian-apt28-deploys-notdoor-outlook.html)** ‚Äî The Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked as APT28 has been attributed to a new Microsoft Outlook backdoor called NotDoor (aka GONEPOSTAL) in attacks targeting multiple companies from different sectors in NATO member countries. NotDoor "is a VBA macro for Outlook designed to monitor incoming emails for a specific trigger word," S2 Grupo's LAB52 threat intelligence team said. "When such an email is detected, it enables an attacker to exfiltrate data, upload files, and execute commands on the victim's computer."
* **[New GhostRedirector Actor Hacks 65 Windows Servers in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/ghostredirector-hacks-65-windows.html)** ‚Äî A previously undocumented threat cluster dubbed GhostRedirector has managed to compromise at least 65 Windows servers primarily located in Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. The attacks, per Slovak cybersecurity company ESET, led to the deployment of a passive C++ backdoor called Rungan and a native Internet Information Services (IIS) module codenamed Gamshen. The threat actor is believed to be active since at least August 2024. "While Rungan has the capability of executing commands on a compromised server, the purpose of Gamshen is to provide SEO fraud as-a-service, i.e., to manipulate search engine results, boosting the page ranking of a configured target website," the company said.
* **[Google Fixes 2 Actively Exploited Android Flaws](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/android-security-alert-google-patches.html)** ‚Äî Google has shipped security updates to address 120 security flaws in its Android operating system as part of its monthly fixes for September 2025, including two issues that it said have been exploited in targeted attacks. One of them, CVE-2025-38352, is a privilege escalation vulnerability ...
