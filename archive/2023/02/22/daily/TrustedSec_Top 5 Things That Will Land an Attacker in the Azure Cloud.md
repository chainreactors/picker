## 1. Misconfigured Cloud Infrastructure

**What type of misconfigurations can exist in a cloud infrastructure?**

Vulnerable front-facing webservers, unpatched appliances, and storage accounts allowing anonymous public access are just a few examples of common infrastructure misconfigurations in cloud environments.

**How can these services translate into an attacker gaining access to my cloud?**

Storage accounts can hold a wide range of data types, including documents that contain plaintext credentials, secrets stored in JSON or XML format, and private keys.

Vulnerable web servers can contain an array of different footholds. If an attacker can gain shell access, it could allow pivoting to your internal network if the webserver is configured to do so. The server could also be hosted within a docker container. Docker containers can be configured with environment variables that may expose credentials and client secrets in plaintext, which could also allow a foothold into your cloud environment.

## 2. Phishing

Is your organization protected with MFA? Many enterprises are not using phishing-resistant forms of MFA. Under certain conditions, attackers can be granted cloud access by phishing and replaying an access token that can bypass MFA.

The following phishing message could convince an unsuspecting user to inadvertently give an attacker cloud access.

According to the [Microsoft Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2021) in 2021, phishing was responsible for 70% of data breaches.

## 3. Weak Credentials/Credential Reuse

***Winter2023!*** is an example of a weak password because it contains a season and a year. In cases where an enterprise requires frequent password changes, these types of passwords are more common because they are very easy for an end-user to remember. This password policy can result in users making poor decisions when creating passwords.

Do you have a password compliance policy that requires an industry standard of 14 characters or more? ***Wintertime2023!*** is another example of a weak password that technically meets that password policy requirement. Of course, weak passwords don't have to incorporate seasons or months—if your enterprise name is Widgets Inc, then another example of a weak password would be ***Widgets2023!***. Unfortunately, these types of password combinations are very common for us to see during a cloud penetration test.

Credential reuse is also common when cross-referencing public breach data. Services such as DeHashed can offer valuable insight into how end-users are making decisions on passwords. It’s also worth spray...
