"OpenAI")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhKv9uasNsw28qTYlQnEanUTlerknejVI09Ht0AM8f2mo_L9ySGQT5CSdSawy0TzIpwDEm-OgZ7qqIcezxAH2F51rN6jtmGczKX3k1xuyHA_8fVrpCE59GuM2wQz-wBZjs7EPNuocXaGHWLG4oZ7KiQgjcYG4Fha6xUR-JBPm54HofDpjwx7ckXQ8uBaQz/s790-rw-e365/iran.png)

OpenAI on Friday said it banned a set of accounts linked to what it said was an Iranian covert influence operation that leveraged ChatGPT to generate content that, among other things, focused on the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

"This week we identified and took down a cluster of ChatGPT accounts that were generating content for a covert Iranian influence operation identified as Storm-2035," OpenAI [said](https://openai.com/index/disrupting-a-covert-iranian-influence-operation/).

"The operation used ChatGPT to generate content focused on a number of topics — including commentary on candidates on both sides in the U.S. presidential election – which it then shared via social media accounts and websites."

The artificial intelligence (AI) company said the content did not achieve any meaningful engagement, with a majority of the social media posts receiving negligible to no likes, shares, and comments. It further noted it had found little evidence that the long-form articles created using ChatGPT were shared on social media platforms.

The articles catered to U.S. politics and global events, and were published on five different websites that posed as progressive and conservative news outlets, indicating an attempt to target people on opposite sides of the political spectrum.

OpenAI said its ChatGPT tool was used to create comments in English and Spanish, which were then posted on a dozen accounts on X and one on Instagram. Some of these comments were generated by asking its AI models to rewrite comments posted by other social media users.

"The operation generated content about several topics: mainly, the conflict in Gaza, Israel's presence at the Olympic Games, and the U.S. presidential election—and to a lesser extent politics in Venezuela, the rights of Latinx communities in the U.S. (both in Spanish and English), and Scottish independence," OpenAI said.

"They interspersed their political content with comments about fashion and beauty, possibly to appear more authentic or in an attempt to build a following."

Storm-2035 was also one of the threat activity clusters [highlighted](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/08/08/iran-targeting-2024-us-election/) last week by Microsoft, which described it as an Iranian network "actively engaging U.S. voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the U.S. presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict."

Some of the phony news and commentary sites set up by the group include EvenPolitics, Nio Thinker, Savannah Time, Teorator, and Westland Sun. These sites have also been observed utilizing AI-enabled services to plagiarize a fraction of their content from U.S. publications. The group is said to be operational from 2020.

Microsoft has further [warned](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/iran-emerges-as-the-most-aggressive-foreign-threat-to-u-s-election-b61161ad) of an uptick in foreign malign influence activity targeting the U.S. election over the past six months from both Iranian and Russian networks, the latter of which have been traced back to clusters tracked as [Ruza Flood](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/us-seizes-domains-used-by-ai-powered.html) (aka Doppelganger), Storm-1516, and Storm-1841 (aka Rybar).

"[Doppelganger](https://www.verfassungsschutz.bayern.de/ueberuns/medien/pressemitteilungen/desinformationskampagne-doppelgaenger/) spreads and amplifies fabricated, fake or even legitimate information across social networks," French cybersecurity company HarfangLab [said](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/doppelganger-operations-europe-us/). "To do so, social networks accounts post links that initiate an obfuscated chain of redirections leading to final content websites."

However, indications are that the propaganda network is shifting its tactics in response to aggressive enforcement, increasingly using non-political posts and ads and spoofing non-political and entertainment news outlets like Cosmopolitan, The New Yorker, and Entertainment Weekly in an attempt to evade detection, per Meta.

The posts contain links that, when tapped, redirect users to a Russia war- or geopolitics-related article on one of the counterfeit domains mimicking entertainment or health publications. The ads are created using compromised accounts.

The social media company, which has disrupted 39 influence operations from Russia, 30 from Iran, and 11 from China since 2017 across its platforms, said it uncovered six new networks from Russia (4), Vietnam (1), and the U.S. (1) in the second quarter of 2024.

"Since May, Doppelganger resumed its attempts at sharing links to its domains, but at a much lower rate," Meta [said](https://transparency.meta.com/en-us/metasecurity/threat-reporting/). "We've also seen them experiment with multiple redirect hops including TinyURL's link-shortening service to hide the final destination behind the links and deceive both Meta and our users in an attempt to avoid detection and lead peop...
