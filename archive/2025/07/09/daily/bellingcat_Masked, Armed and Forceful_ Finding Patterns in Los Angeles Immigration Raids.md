# Masked, Armed and Forceful: Finding Patterns in Los Angeles Immigration Raids

Armed and masked men leaping out of unmarked vehicles. Latino men taken from their places of work or while waiting for the bus. Street vendors roughly tackled to the ground and forcefully held down.

Since early June, the streets of Los Angeles have borne witness to frequent and aggressive immigration raids that have seen people suspected of being undocumented migrants detained. Some have been [rapidly deported](https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/taken-la-immigration-raids/).

Between [June 6 and June 22](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-06-25/more-than-1-600-immigrants-detained-in-southern-california-this-month-dhs-says) alone, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly arrested 1,618 people for deportation from LA and the surrounding areas of Southern California. This averages out at about 95 people a day, and arrests and deportations have continued in the period since.

Those numbers represent an increase over the months prior and appear to be in line with [reports](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/protests-los-angeles-immigrants-trump-f5089877?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjCRjA7jFYJOoEhbYeokm9zEc2dqRlQKwt8DsPrDPTpftqzhlNxWJACWczu_lE%3D&gaa_ts=68657098&gaa_sig=CQtDOA1VCdRCwle87tKU6tuznXwOSl3bYBdT5ugfFA-y6LItFc5uWmSADeGED6a_puXwGO00mjhMuR5nrCUuxg%3D%3D) of apparent White House directives to up immigration-related arrests.

Bellingcat worked with our partners at Evident Media and CalMatters to gather and document social media and online footage of as many of the LA raids as possible.

We collected videos of just over 100 incidents starting on June 6, picking out sightings and what appear to be recurring trends and tactics used by officers. A full list of the incidents can be seen and [downloaded here](https://bellingcat-embeds.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2025-us-border-patrol/incidents_june_25.csv).

The footage shows officers from agencies including US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which operate under DHS, arresting people in public spaces, in places of work and outside residences. In some cases, it was unclear what agency officers were with due to a lack of clear identification.

In others, officers can be seen using significant force to detain people. In most cases officers keep their faces covered, concealing their identity. Unmarked vehicles were also used on numerous occasions.

The raids bear similarities to incidents previously investigated by [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/04/08/us-border-patrol-called-raid-300-miles-from-border-targeted-open-source-evidence-suggests-otherwise/), [CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/04/border-patrol-records-kern-county/) and [Evident Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m93xbICwsSM&ab_channel=EvidentMedia) in California. Earlier this year, agents from the El Centro Border Patrol Sector travelled over 300 miles from the US southern border to the city of Bakersfield to take part in what they said were targeted raids to apprehend immigrants with “criminal records”.

However, just how targeted that mission was became a point of significant tension, with rights and labour groups claiming it was anything but. Of 78 people arrested, only one had been flagged for prior removal.

In April, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the wake of the Bakersfield raids barring Border Patrol from [conducting warrantless raids](https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/04/border-patrol-injunction/) in California’s Eastern District, stating that “you just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers.’”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other industry and rights groups last week [requested a similar injunction](https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/la-immigration-raids-lawsuit/) be put in place in California’s Central District, which includes Los Angeles.

The head of the El Centro unit, Gregory Bovino, [is now in charge](https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/los-angeles-border-patrol-chief/) of the operations across Los Angeles. Agents from his El Centro Border Patrol unit have also [appeared](https://www.tiktok.com/%40chizzbizz/photo/7517789030281415950) in videos of raids in LA neighbourhoods seen by Bellingcat. Bovino even [appeared](https://x.com/billmelugin_/status/1942280433221484912?s=46) at a raid involving hundreds of officers in LA’s MacArthur Park on July 7.

To be clear, it is not possible to know exactly what transpired in every incident captured in our dataset. The vast majority of videos only offer snapshots of what occurred as most raids relied on the element of surprise. Witnesses, therefore, often did not appear to start recording until raids were under way. Similarly, many of the raids captured were in public spaces such as in parking lots or at strip malls. Others did occur at private residences, but incidents are more likely to be captured in places where more members of the general public are likely to be present, such as on busy thoroughfares. This is likely reflected in the data.

Judging by the number of people detained in LA over the last few weeks, the videos also only capture a portion of...
