Turn Alert Noise into Threat Insights without Leaving QRadar SOAR with ANY.RUN

IBM QRadar SOAR is a go-to platform for incident response. To make things faster and easier for SOCs to use this powerful tool with [ANY.RUN’s services](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=qradar_integration&utm_term=220725&utm_content=linktolanding), we built an [official app.](https://apps.xforce.ibmcloud.com/extension/06dbb4c6b59fc59ed9c277b0bb1a3f7d) Now you can seamlessly launch different playbooks directly inside SOAR to streamline threat analysis, speed up investigations, and reduce Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) in your SOC.

Here’s how your team can benefit from the new integration.

## Streamline Your SOC Workflows

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-10-1024x728.png)

The app [available on IBM Exchange](https://apps.xforce.ibmcloud.com/extension/06dbb4c6b59fc59ed9c277b0bb1a3f7d) allows SOC teams to start using ANY.RUN’s services in a more flexible and seamless way to detect threats and resolve incidents faster. The setup takes a few seconds as you only need an API key to connect your ANY.RUN account to QRadar SOAR, eliminating the need for custom development.

With this integration, you canget IOCs and verdicts from the sandbox and indicator context from TI Lookup to simplify triage and enrich incident data.

* **Early Threat Detection**: Real-time data from sandbox analyses and TI Lookup enable you to identify and respond to new attacks at their earliest stages.

* **Automation of Routine Tasks:** Prebuilt playbooks enable automatic or manual actions, saving time for Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysts.

* **Reduced Response Times:** Cuts incident analysis time by automating enrichment and analysis processes. Results feed directly into SOAR playbooks, enabling rapid isolation, blocking, or escalation based on your workflows.

## Proactive Threat Analysis with Interactive Sandbox

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image2-5-1024x587.png)

[ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](http://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=qradar_integration&utm_term=220725&utm_content=linktosandboxlanding) is a cloud-based service for analysis of suspicious files and URLs. It provides SOC teams with instant access to fully interactive [Windows, Linux, and Android](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-analyze-malware-threats/) virtual machines, allowing you to engage with the system and the sample at hand and detonate every stage of the attack, from opening an email attachment to solving a CAPTCHA.

The sandbox logs and marks malicious network traffic, processes, registry and file modifications, providing instant visibility into the threat’s behavior. For each analysis, it generates a comprehensive report with a threat level verdict, [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/iocs-iobs-ioas-explained/), and [TTPs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/).

With IBM QRadar SOAR integration, your SOC team can use the Automated Interactivity of the Sandbox to:

* **Triage Files and URLs**: Send suspicious files or URLs from IBM QRadar SOAR to ANY.RUN’s Sandbox for instant analysis, reducing manual effort.

* **Gain Deep Behavioral Insights**: Access detailed logs of malicious activities, including network traffic, processes, and file changes, for thorough threat understanding.

* **Auto-Detonate Multi-Stage Attacks**: Take advantage of Automated Interactivity for automated execution of user actions such as archive extraction, CAPTCHA solution, and payload launching to reach the final stage of the attack and ensure complete detection.

*For the most accurate results, it’s recommended to avoid manual interference during the sandbox session. Let the analysis run to completion, so all behavior stages can be observed and properly logged.*
