# Exploit Title: phpMyFAQ v3.2.10 - Unintended File Download Triggered by Embedded Frames
# Date: 13 Dec 2024
# Exploit Author: George Chen
# Vendor Homepage: https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/
# Software Link: https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/
# Version: v3.2.10
# Tested on: Mac, Win
# CVE : CVE-2024–55889

*Summary*
A vulnerability exists in the FAQ Record component of
https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ v3.2.10 where a privileged attacker
can trigger a file download on a victim’s machine upon page visit by
embedding it in an <iframe> element without user interaction or explicit
consent.

*Details*
In http://localhost/admin/index.php?action=editentry&id=20&lang=en, where a
FAQ record is either created or edited, an attacker can insert an iframe,
as “source code”, pointing to a prior “malicious” attachment that the
attacker has uploaded via FAQ “new attachment” upload, such that any page
visits to this FAQ will trigger an automated download (from the edit
screen, download is automated; from the faq page view as a normal user,
depending on the browser, a pop up confirmation may be presented before the
actual download. Firebox browser, for instance, does not require any
interactions).

*PoC*

   1. create a new FAQ record and upload a “malicious” file — in my case, I
   uploaded an eicar file. Take note of the uri, ie
   “index.php?action=attachment&id=2”
   2. in the FAQ record, insert a “source code” blob using the “< >” button
   3. insert in the following snippet and save FAQ record:
    <p><iframe src="index.php?action=attachment&id=2"></iframe></p> [image:
   image.png]
   4. Once the edit page reloads, the malicious code will be downloaded
   onto the local machine without user interaction:[image: image.png]

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search ...
