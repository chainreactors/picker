@ Winter,

Re : Any person legal or natural.

> “I will never again be able to prove I am human.”

Hey, if you could prove you were a corporation there are a couple of advantages,

1, You’ld not have to pay tax.

So… You could be onto a winner 😉

2, You could not be jailed.

Isn’t that what NonDom does?

iirc(badly) The current PM and Spouse (especially Spouse) are quite familiar with NonDom.

Lol! Can I phone a conservatory that might have humans?

*Yes, may I please speak with a human? Um, yes, a real-life human who knows the word decrescendo.* 😆

See this as a nice way to filter people contributing to a blog to discourage those not really interested in the subject of the blog (would it work here 😏?)

@ Ted,

Re : decrescendo

When I was quite young, and my mother had the notion I should learn to be musical…

Where as many kids lost their “sunday mornings” to “Church School”, I lost my “saturday mornings” to “music school”…

Where I was taught –but did not learn– all sorts of things of which “decrescendo” is but one I could vaguely remember[1] but never spell (dishlexia rluz KO).

There are many regrets I have from my more than six decades of existance, and yes my lack of adroitness with music is one of them. I could blaim many people easily, but honestly the failings were mine, others at most just nudged. The fact that a big chunk of my proffessional life has been associated with the engineering of sound via electronics and computers actually makes the regret keener not less.

[1] Broadly decrescendo is the same as diminuendo –that I can remember to spell– and it means to “turn down the volume or force” of the music gradually (see “Slaves Chorous” for an example). Both words come from Latin and have the same root as for Descend and Diminish respectively. Oh and cardiologists use decrescendo when talking about heart sounds in a stethoscope particularly with murmurs. And that is more than the common man realy needs to know, even if he or she is a crossword or scrabble fiend.

Or how about the more common ones depicting something like a hydrant, where behind the pics of “hydrants” that you are required to click on is actually installing a keylogger or some other nasty shyte that your FW/AV lets slide because it does not match any of the IDS/IPS since is a 0day whose creator does not want anyone to know about, hence not disclosing it. Because he thinks it’s more fun that way.

There’s a part of me that’s really hoping that the image part somehow becomes a “Spot the Saint” post on Ex Urbe.

With the first one, I know it can’t be any of the guys with halos. It’s probably just the dude at the bottom.

@Ted, Clive

I am a Captcha generating bot. In the placeholder you found decrescendo I could have put ralentando, glissando, or portamente.

Re: Decrescendo

That’s funny. My mom tinkered with the idea that I might pick up music too. I vaguely remember taking some group piano or rather electronic keyboard lessons.

The pinnacle of my young foray into electronic keyboard was learning a tune from the movie Big – Heart and Soul. In the movie Tom Hanks and his boss dance out the melody on a [giant keyboard](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LzvrzLJxnko) in an FAO Schwarz. Classic.

I see the YouTube channel Green Bean’s Music has a very comprehensible 2-minute video on Crescendo & Decrescendo. Your description was spot on, with a thought-provoking etymology no less 👍

Do you remember if playing music feels as wonderful as it sounds?
