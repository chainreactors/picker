Exploiting the Chrome browser with V8 JavaScript engine vulnerabilities has become increasingly difficult due to the V8 team’s continuous security improvements, especially for the introduction of V8 Sandbox. This presentation discloses the full V8 exploit chain used against Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge to break both V8 and V8 Sandbox at Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024, ending Chrome's three-year unbroken streak.

We will detail how a single JavaScript object creation can trick the V8 engine, discuss universal techniques for converting an out-of-bounds read vulnerability into a highly reliable exploit, and share our novel V8 Sandbox escape technique.
