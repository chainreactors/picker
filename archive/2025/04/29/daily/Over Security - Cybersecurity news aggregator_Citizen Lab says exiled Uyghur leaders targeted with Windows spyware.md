# Citizen Lab says exiled Uyghur leaders targeted with Windows spyware

Unknown hackers last month targeted leaders of the exiled Uyghur community in a campaign involving Windows spyware, researchers revealed Monday.

Citizen Lab, a digital rights research group based at the University of Toronto, [detailed](https://citizenlab.ca/2025/04/uyghur-language-software-hijacked-to-deliver-malware/) an espionage campaign against members of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an organization that represents the Muslim-minority group, which has for years faced repression, discrimination, [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/), and [hacking](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/governments-identify-dozens-of-android-apps-bundled-with-spyware/) from China’s government.

Google alerted some WUC members to the hacking campaign in mid-March, prompting the members to contact journalists and Citizen Lab’s researchers, the report said.

Citizen Lab investigated and found a targeted [phishing](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#phishing) email sent to members of WUC, impersonating a trusted contact who sent a Google Drive link for a password-protected compressed file containing a malicious version of a Uyghur language text editor.

The researchers said the campaign wasn’t particularly sophisticated and didn’t involve [zero-day exploits](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day) or [mercenary spyware](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government), but noted that “the delivery of the malware showed a high level of social engineering, revealing the attackers’ deep understanding of the target community.”
