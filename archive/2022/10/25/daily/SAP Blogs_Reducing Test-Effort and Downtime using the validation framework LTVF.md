# Approach for this blog

In this blog you will get an overview of:

* the options offered by the Landscape Transformation Validation Framework (LTVF) tool to reduce your testing efforts on various projects, including conversions and migrations to SAP S/4HANA.

* The opportunities to reduce the overall downtime during golive by automating validation/testing time.

# Summary

In the context of your transformation projects, the testing and validation of results is often an important effort driver:

For example, if you have many organisational units (e.g. company codes, plants) and/or different and complex accounting structures to validate, a purely manual approach to these activities is both costly and error-prone.

Furthermore, if this process is not automated, it can add unacceptable time to the actual downtime in the cutover phase.

In this blog, I would like to provide an overview of the LTVF Landscape Transformation Validation Framework that helps overcome the above challenges.

This blog is based on a presentation and further information material I received from the architect and developer of this tool, Mikhail Isupov. Thank you, Mikhail, for the valuable information you have provided!

# Structure of this blog

I will explain the concept of LTVF along the following topics:

* Business Value of LTVF

* Overview of projects, where LTVF can be used

* Which validations can be automated?

* Architecture of LTVF

* How is a validation project organised?

* Further topics to consider for an LTVF project

* Key Learnings for the use of LTVF

## Business Value of LTVF

LTVF automates your tests and validations, it:

* reduces the overall testing-effort and validation costs of a project.

* reduces the overall system downtime during the Golive-Weekend.

During a Golive weekend, some final tests need to be performed before you can put a changed system back into productive use.

These tests, if only done manually, can take more hours than are actually available during the downtime. If all testing is done manually, there is also a risk that some detailed testing will be sacrificed to save a few hours or simply out of time pressure.

The testing effort is an essential part of any project. The atomisation that LTVF offers for testing will therefore significantly reduce the overall project effort.

## Where can the automatic validation framework be used?

The automatic validation framework can be used in all projects where you need to compare a large number of values before and after a transformation.

Typical examples of such projects are:

* New implementation projects for S/4 Hana, including cases where the source system is not an SAP system.

* Selective Data Transition (SDT) projects
  <https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/16/options-for-your-sap-s-4hana-transition/>

* Transformation projects for SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA systems, e.g. changes to the chart of accounts, merging company codes, system merge projects or divestment projects in M&A scenarios. These projects are often also referred to as "DMLT" projects (Data Management and Landscape Transformation).
  [https://www.sap.com/germany/services-support/service-offerings/data-mgmt-landscape-transformation.ht...](https://www.sap.com/germany/services-support/service-offerings/data-mgmt-landscape-transformation.html)

* SAP S/4HANA System Conversion projects
  for SAP S/4HANA System Conversion projects as of release S/4HANA 2021 there is as well the Data Transition Validation (DTV) Tool available: <https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/28/an-introduction-to-the-data-transition-validation-tool/>
  However the DTV Tool has a more limited functionality compared to the LTVF tool, that can be adapted to specific customer needs.

The basic idea for the validation automation is as follows:

Part of the validation is always to prove the correctness of important figures, e.g. balances, stock values, etc... These figures are available e.g. in ALV reports, tables, text reports or files.

The LTVF tool extracts these data before and after transformation and compares them automatically. If transformation rules have been applied, they can of course be integrated into the LTVF tool so that the tool can also compare "oranges" with "apples". For a large part of the standard reports, there are already pre-configured solutions in the LTVF tool available, which only need to be configured with the organisational units to be tested/validated. For those areas where there are no preconfigured solutions yet, the SAP LTVF tool provides an effective framework to create new validation reports with little additional effort.

## Which validations can be automated?

LTVF supports the automatic comparison and validation of the following items:

* Reports with ALV output

* Reports with text output and Files

* Tables

Post-processing logic can be applied to all these comparisons, allowing the comparison of different tables or reports. Transformation logic used in a migration or conversion project can be integrated into LTVF.

A few more functions are also available:

* Filters can be applied to focus on relevant data.

* tolerances can be set, e.g. if rounding differences are expected.

* for merge scenarios a conditional merge including aggregation and replacement functionality is available.
