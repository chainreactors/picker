A Kansas City man is accused of hacking into local businesses, not to steal money, but to‚Ä¶ get a cheaper gym membership? A DNA-testing firm has vanished, leaving customers in the dark about what‚Äôs happened to their sensitive genetic data. And Australia mulls a social media ban for youngsters.

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Anna Brading.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
