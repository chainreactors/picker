The welcoming of a new year also welcomes the return of one of the most overused sayings in our shared lexicon: “New Year, New Me!” While there are countless overused resolutions like starting a workout regimen, the new year does provide an opportunity for additional self-improvement that most people never consider – bolstering cybersecurity protections.

If the beginning of the new year follows the trends of the last, there’s a good chance phishing will [spike in the first four months](https://community.webroot.com/news-announcements-3/nastiest-malware-2022-352579) of 2023. Rather than take a vacation to spend their holiday earnings, cybercriminals are using the new year as a prime opportunity to access bank accounts, install malicious software, and steal identities to commit fraud. These threats are especially prevalent as millions of people set up new devices, facilitate online shopping returns, and shop online with money and gift cards received throughout the holiday season.

Fortunately, through its new partnership with [Allstate Identity Protection](https://www.allstate.com/identity-protection) (AIP), Webroot will help you easily protect your devices, identity, and privacy. The partnership combines Webroot’s digital device protection with AIP, which shields the personal information and data you share online. Together, the two services offer multi-layer protection against cyber threats to protect your digital life.

Webroot Premium with AIP includes anti-virus protection for up to five devices, identity protection for one individual with up to $500,000 in fraud expense reimbursement\*, up to $50,000 in stolen funds reimbursement\*, and a password manager and secure browser for privacy. But the protection doesn’t stop there; additional benefits include:

Device protection:

Identity protection:

Privacy protection:
