# Netflix scammers target jobseekers to trick them into handing over their Facebook logins

Posted: August 14, 2025

In what seems a [phishing attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) targeted at a certain audience, scammers are impersonating Netflix and reaching out to marketing staff.

The initial mail looks like what you might expect from a headhunter or a human resources (HR) recruitment specialist.

“I hope this note finds you well,” the email begins. “Your reputation as a visionary marketing leader has caught out attention, and I’d like to share an extraordinary opportunity with you at Netflix.”

![Job opportunity with Netflix](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Netflix_offer_red.png?w=1024)

Undoubtedly this email is crafted by [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) and based on real-life examples. The role offered in the email as VP of Marketing would be a fitting role for the person that received this email, so it looks as if the scammers have done their research before reaching out.

Replying to the initial mail—which is not recommended, unless you like letting scammers know you exist and encouraging them to send you more phishes—got us one step closer to landing the exciting new job at Netflix.

We received an invitation to set up an interview with the ‘Netflix HR team’.

![Interview invitation](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Interview_invitation_red.png)

Following the link under “Schedule Interview” gets us a block by Malwarebytes web protection.

![Malwarebytes blocks hiring.growwithusnetflx[.]com](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/growwithusnetflixcomblock.png)

Again, not something we would want our readers to do but in the interest of learning more about the scam, we bypass that block and proceed to the website.

We find that there are 20 openings, all more or less in the same fields of social media and marketing.

![job openings in social media and marketing departments](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/several_marketing_media_jobs.png)

The website itself is a mix of content copied from the actual Netflix site and of the phishing campaign.

Back to scheduling our interview. We’re given an option to choose our interview slot:

![Two Schedule now buttons](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/schedule_already.png)

Regardless of which of the two buttons you use on the screen, you’ll be asked to sign in to your existing “Career Profile” or create a new one.

![Career profile login](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/sign_in.png)

At this stage, all red flags should go up. It doesn’t matter if you choose “Continue with Facebook” or whether you enter your email and click “Continue with Email” the next screen will ask you to sign in to your Facebook account.

The only difference is that the second option fills out your email in the login screen.

That doesn’t make a lot of sense—Facebook is not known to keep track of your calendar. It does [keep track of a lot of things](http://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/06/what-does-facebook-know-about-me-lock-and-code-s06e11), but your meeting schedule isn’...
