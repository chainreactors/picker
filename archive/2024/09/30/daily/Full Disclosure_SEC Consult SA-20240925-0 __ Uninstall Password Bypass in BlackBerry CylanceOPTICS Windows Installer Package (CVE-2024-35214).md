Vendor description:
-------------------
"CylanceOPTICS is an endpoint detection and response solution that collects
and analyzes forensic data from devices to identify and resolve threats
before they impact your organization’s users and data."

Source: https://docs.blackberry.com/en/unified-endpoint-security/blackberry-ues/overview/What-is-BlackBerry-Optics

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Uninstall Password Bypass (CVE-2024-35214)
Due to the quiet (un-)installation feature offered by the CylanceOPTICS
application, the uninstaller can be called directly without requiring
a previously set uninstall password.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local admin
rights.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Uninstall Password Bypass (CVE-2024-35214)
The path to the MSI uninstaller can be found by searching the
Windows Registry for "CylanceOPTICS" which results in the following
node containing uninstall information for the 64bit application:

HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{6e96194b-ca7b-40a4-badd-7eac94ea62c7}

To uninstall CylanceOPTICS without being prompted for a password,
the QuietUninstallString command is executed as privileged user on
the system.

"C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\{6e96194b-ca7b-40a4-badd-7eac94ea62c7}\CylanceOPTICSSetup.exe" /uninstall /quiet

Afterwards, the CylanceOPTICS application is successfully removed.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested by SEC Consult which was the most
recent version available at the time of the test:
* 3.2.2199.0

According to the vendor, all previous versions are affected:
* CylanceOPTICS <3.3 MR2
