# Roblox introduces age checks to use communication features

Posted: September 4, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Roblox is an online platform that allows users to build, play and share online worlds and 3D games. Unfortunately, it’s also a popular platform among predators reaching out to kids and seducing them using game features such as messaging, avatar customization, and role-play.

Over the years, the company has faced [several lawsuits and backlash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_safety_on_Roblox) for not doing enough to protect kids on its gaming services. Recently, [Louisiana sued the Roblox](https://abc7.com/post/louisiana-sues-roblox-accusing-site-allowing-sexual-predators-victimize-children/17577051), alleging the wildly popular site has perpetuated an environment where sexual predators “thrive, unite, hunt, and victimize kids.” And back in February Roblox, along with Discord, was [sued in California](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/roblox-called-real-life-nightmare-for-children-as-roblox-and-discord-sued). The law suit referred to it as a “real life nightmare for children.”

The initial response by Roblox’s CEO, Dave Baszucki, was “[if you’re not comfortable, don’t let your kids be on Roblox](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/dont-let-your-kids-on-roblox-if-youre-worried-says-roblox-ceo).” But apparently, the company thought better of it, and so yesterday Roblox [announced](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users) a plan to expand age estimation to all Roblox users who access its on-platform communication features by the end of this year.

Roblox [defines age estimation](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/39143693116052-Understanding-Age-Checks-on-Roblox) as follows:

> “We estimate your age by analyzing a selfie of your face and examining your facial features. Your estimated age helps place you in the appropriate age group (under 13, 13+ and 18+) to customize your experience on Roblox. If you are placed in the under 13 age group based on facial age estimation, certain personal data, including your email and phone number, will be removed from Roblox.”

While we understand the move, which aims to strengthen communication safety and prevent inappropriate interactions between adults and minors on the platform, we wonder if this will be enough to stop predators.

But the goal is clear: Limit communication between minors and adults that do no know each other in the real world. So, by using methods like facial age estimation, ID verification, and parental consent, Roblox aims to ensure users only access features and content suitable for their age group, and with that create a safer environment, ensuring that young users aren’t exposed to content or interactions that might be inappropriate for their developmental stage.

With governments demanding actual age verification on websites with adult content, and platforms like social media and Roblox introducing restrictions based on a user’s age, the [controversy](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/age-verification-child-protection-or-privacy-risk) about different types of age verification and those implications is growing.

While Roblox didn’t release any details about how its age estimation technology works, the age estimation processes we know are based on [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-i...
