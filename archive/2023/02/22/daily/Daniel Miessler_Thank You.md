Hi,

My name is [Daniel Miessler](/about/) and I'm a Cybersecurity / AI engineer and founder based out of the San Francisco Bay Area who's been writing online [since 1999](/archives/).

My goal is to help build a positive, *human*-based AI future, which I call [Human 3.0](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/how-my-projects-fit-together).

In order to do that, I am building AI products that *upgrade* people and organizations—rather than try to replace them.
