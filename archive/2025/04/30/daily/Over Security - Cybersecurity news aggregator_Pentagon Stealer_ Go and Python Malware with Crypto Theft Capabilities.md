Pentagon Stealer: Go and Python Malware with Crypto Theft Capabilities

The current article provides technical analysis of an emerging malware named Pentagon Stealer. The research has been prepared by the analyst team at [ANY.RUN](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pentagon_stealer&utm_term=290425&utm_content=linktolanding).

## Key Takeaways

* **Variants**: Exists in [Python](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/pre-installed-dev-tools/) (AES-encrypted, multi-stage) and Golang (unencrypted, part of attack chains) versions.

* **Data Theft**: Steals browser credentials, cookies, [crypto](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/crypto-malware/) wallet data (Atomic/Exodus), Discord/Telegram tokens, and specific files.

* **Debug Mode Exploitation**: Launches Chromium-based browsers in debug mode to extract unencrypted cookies, bypassing DPAPI [encryption](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/encryption-algorithms-in-malware/) for easier data theft.

* **Crypto Wallet Injection**: Replaces app.asar files in Atomic/Exodus wallets with patched versions to steal mnemonics/passwords, using a public proof-of-concept available on GitHub.

* **Evolution and Campaigns**: Spread via typosquatting, later under the names 1312, Acab, Vilsa, and BLX stealer. BLX adds clipboard, screenshot, and Steam/Epic data theft.

* **C2 Communication**: Uses HTTP requests with servers like pentagon[.]cy and *stealer[.]cy*; BLX uploads to gofile.io, sending links to C2.

* **Ongoing Threat**: Simple but persistent, with new variants showing minor updates, continuing to pose risks.

## How We Discovered Pentagon Stealer

In early March of this year, when browsing [Public submissions](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pentagon_stealer&utm_term=290425&utm_content=linktoservice), the ANY.RUN team came across an interesting malware sample written in Golang.

[View sandbox analysis of the sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/ee0a809d-1d42-4074-aa15-83a5ae6be6cb/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pentagon_stealer&utm_term=290425&utm_content=linktoservice)

The malicious program exhibited unusual behavior, first terminating and then restarting processes of popular web browsers (Image 1).

The malware also engaged in data theft, which was flagged by ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-1024x422.png)

To collect more context about this malware, we used [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) (Image 3) with queries like the following one:

[domainName:”pentagon.cy” OR domainName:”stealer.cy”](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=pentagon_stealer&utm_term=290425&utm_content=linktolookup#%7B%2522query%2522:%2522domainName:%255C%2522pentagon.cy%255C%2522%2520OR%2520domainName:%255C%2522stealer.cy%255C%2522%2522,%2522dateRange%2522:180%7D)

Among the search results, we identified a [sandbox analysis](https://app.any.run/tasks/804f96d2-5ed6-4a44-babd-0a7ada9ed80d) of a website hosted on the domain *pentagon.cy* that featured the admin panel of this malware. Thus, we named it Pentagon Stealer.

Exploring the website further, we discovered that there was also a Python-based version of this malicious program, available at *pentagon[.]cy/paste?userid=<n>*.
