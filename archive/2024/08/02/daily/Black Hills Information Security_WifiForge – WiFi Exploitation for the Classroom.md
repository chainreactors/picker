**BHIS had a problem.**

We needed an environment for students to learn WiFi hacking safely. Our original solution used interconnected physical network gear and computers to create the needed signals. The requirement for multiple such setups to properly run a class with was costly, however, and transport was a concern as well.

We discovered a program called Mininet, which creates an interactive virtual network, and began looking for ways to utilize it in labs and teaching material. Wondering if this might be the solution we were in sore need of, a project was started, and a team of interns was hired to research and test the limits.

The product of that project is WifiForge.

### **What is WifiForge?**

WifiForge is a program built on the foundation of the open-source [Mininet-Wifi](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file), itself being a branch from [Mininet](https://mininet.org/) that includes support for wireless networking. It automatically sets up the network and tools needed to perform a variety of exploits, all packed neatly into a Docker container. WifiForge eliminates the need for physical hardware, requiring only a docker install and the execution of a couple commands.

You can find a link to the project’s GitHub page [HERE](https://github.com/blackhillsinfosec/Wifi-Forge).

#### Disclaimer/Notes

* While it is strongly recommended to run WifiForge in a Docker container, you can run it on your base machine.

* Installing Mininet-Wifi on the base machine has been known to cause dependency nightmares.

* It is suggested to run WifiForge on Ubuntu version 14.04 and up or the latest version of Kali (when Mininet was built in 2017, Ubuntu 14.04 was bleeding edge).

* The WifiForge installation script may disrupt normal operating system use; it is suggested to use a fresh install, virtual machine, or preferably a Docker container.

### **OS Compatibility**

WifiForge should work on any Linux operating system using Docker. The following operating systems have been tested and are confirmed to work.

**Kali Linux**

**Parrot OS**

**Ubuntu**

### **Set-Up Guide**

Below is the guide to setting up a Docker container with all the required pieces and parts. We have guides for installing to a bare OS or from a Docker image. These instructions can be found on the project’s [GitHub](https://github.com/her3ticAVI/Wifi-Forge). The best and easiest option, however, is laid out below.

#### Docker (recommended)

Note: Dockerfile will fail if Mininet-Wifi is already installed locally

**Install from release**

1. Pull the Docker image from Dockerhub and start a new container

```
sudo docker run --privileged=true -it --env="DISPLAY" --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -v /sys/:/sys -v /lib/modules/:/lib/modules/ --name mininet-wifi --network=host --hostname mininet-wifi redblackbird/wififorge:v1.0.0 /bin/bash
```

Within the container, initiate the controller to simulate APs

```
service openvswitch-switch start
```

Run WifiForge.py

```
sudo python3 Framework/WifiForge.py
```

### **Labs and Featured Tools**

WifiForge provides pre-built labs that cover a variety of topics and tools including, but not limited, to:

* [Eaphammer](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/eaphammer)
* WPS Networks
* [Wifiphisher](https://wifiphisher.org/)
* WEP Networks
* Netntlm cracking with [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
* [Airgeddon](https://www.kali.org/tools/airgeddon/) Dos

Today, however, we would like to give you a taste of what this program can do through our WEP key-cracking lab.
