# Mobile Security Review 2025

13. June 2025

AV-Comparatives has released its latest Mobile Security Report 2025, featuring a detailed assessment of Android security apps. Ten products were put to the test in this year’s evaluation. <https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mobile-security-review-2025/>

### Independent Evaluation of Android Security Apps – 2025 Edition

AV-Comparatives, the renowned independent testing lab based in Innsbruck, Austria, has published its 2025 report on mobile antivirus solutions for Android. The comprehensive review includes six leading products from vendors such as Avast, AVG, Avira, Bitdefender, ESET, G DATA, Kaspersky, Norton, Securion, and Google’s built-in Play Protect.

The review was conducted using Android 15, and focused on real-world scenarios to evaluate protection against malware, false positives, anti-theft features, and battery usage.

Over 3,300 recent Android malware samples were used to measure the detection capabilities of each product. A separate false-positive test with 500 clean apps helped assess the accuracy and reliability of the scanners.

In addition, AV-Comparatives examined the anti-theft functions, testing whether lost or stolen devices could be remotely located or locked. The battery-drain impact of each app was also measured, simulating daily use cases like web browsing, video streaming, and emailing.

The report not only provides comparative results but also offers practical security tips for Android users. It includes an analysis of Android 15’s built-in protections and how these interact with third-party security software.
