=========================

I. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Check Point Gaia Portal is an advanced web-based interface designed for the configuration of the Gaia platform, a security operating system that combines the strengths of both SecurePlatform and IPSO operating systems. The Gaia Portal allows for nearly all system configuration tasks to be performed through this interface.

II. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Check Point Gaia Portal has a vulnerability which allows an authenticated user with write permissions on the DNS settings to inject commands in a cgi script, leading to remote code execution on the operating system. The vulnerability lies in the parameter hostname in the web request /cgi-bin/hosts_dns.tcl, which is susceptible to command injection. This can be exploited by any user with a valid session, as long as the user has write permissions on the DNS settings. The injected commands are executed by the user 'Admin'.

III. Proof of Concept
-------------------------
hostname=name|`COMMAND`&domainname=test.local&save=1

IV. Impact
-------------------------
Successful exploitation allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute commands on the operating system.
