## Blue Team – Defend, Detect, Protect

*by [Erik Goldoff](http://linkedin.com/in/egoldoff/) || CISSP, @ErikG*

“Blue team” is a high-level term covering defensive security, whose goals are to reduce attack surface, as well as detect and respond to threats.

Here are some, but not all, of the sub-topics under the umbrella of blue team operations:

* Defensive Security
* Infrastructure Protection
* End-User Education
* Incident Response (IR)
* Business Continuity/Damage Control
* Security Operations Center (SOC)
* Threat Hunting & Digital Forensics (DF)

Transitioning to blue team positions is easier for existing IT staffers (user support/help desk operations, or network team). You need to be able to understand what is normal for your environment in order to quickly recognize the abnormal (potential security events). Your existing IT jobs are a great place to gain understanding of your environment from various fundamental perspectives.

As part of defensive security and/or infrastructure protection, it is vital that security stack components be configured and deployed properly — so as to not ignore threats, but not so stringent as to prevent productivity. You do not want your security solution to present the denial-of-service you are trying to prevent. Endpoint security, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and security information and event management (SIEM) are tools used in defensive security.

End users are often the weakest link in any organization with regards to security threats. You need to help them understand not only what to do, but also why, in order to help increase cooperation. Publishing periodic phishing test results by department can be more motivational than just individual training.

Should your organization be breached by a cybersecurity attack, how do you proceed to mitigate the threat and damage while keeping your enterprise operating as it should? Your SOC and incident response teams can help identify the threat, the source, and the immediate remediation, while still maintaining “chain of custody” for any evidence found, as your organization may have legal requirements for cooperation with authorities and/or qualifying for insurance reimbursements.

Being reactive is not enough. A proactive approach to threats is imperative for an organization. The threat hunting teams may find evidence of incursion before a major incident evolves. Did they find IOCs and EOCs (indicators/evidence of compromise) that alerted the DF/IR teams? Digital forensics (DF) gathers data on the attack methods, points of entry, incursion path, and potential exfiltration targets, while incident response (IR) helps to lock down the environment as necessary by disabling accounts restricting network access, shutting down exfiltration paths, removing malware, etc. Different parts of cybersecurity work together to detect, identify, and eradicate attacks.

If you are going to defend against cybersecurity attacks, you needs to know about the tools and techniques available to defend with, as well as what tools and techniques your attackers are using. Knowledge is power!
