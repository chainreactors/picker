The latest installment of the National Crime Agency's (NCA) series of ransomware revelations from February's LockBit Leak Week emerges today as the agency identifies a man it not only believes is a member of the long-running Evil Corp crime group but also a LockBit affiliate.

The NCA claimed Aleksandr Ryzhenkov is a high-ranking Evil Corp member – and also [alleged](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/further-evil-corp-cyber-criminals-exposed-one-unmasked-as-lockbit-affiliate) he is the LockBit affiliate who has been known as "Beverley" since at least 2022. The revelation is the first-of-its-kind about a known crossover between the two Russian gangs.

The unmasking of Ryzhenkov follows the unveiling of the 194 total affiliates – the cronies that actually carry out ransomware attacks using the brand's name – registered with LockBit at the time of the disruption in February.
