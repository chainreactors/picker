In a first-of-its-kind coordinated action, the U.K. and U.S. governments on Thursday levied sanctions against seven Russian nationals for their affiliation to the TrickBot, Ryuk, and Conti cybercrime operation.

The individuals [designated](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20230209) under sanctions are Vitaly Kovalev (aka Alex Konor, Bentley, or Bergen), Maksim Mikhailov (aka Baget), Valentin Karyagin (aka Globus), Mikhail Iskritskiy (aka Tropa), Dmitry Pleshevskiy (aka Iseldor), Ivan Vakhromeyev (aka Mushroom), and Valery Sedletski (aka Strix).

"Current members of the TrickBot group are associated with Russian Intelligence Services," the U.S. Treasury Department [noted](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1256). "The TrickBot group's preparations in 2020 aligned them to Russian state objectives and targeting previously conducted by Russian Intelligence Services."

TrickBot, which is attributed to a threat actor named ITG23, Gold Blackburn, and Wizard Spider, emerged in 2016 as a derivative of the Dyre banking trojan and evolved into a [highly modular malware framework](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/gold-ulrick-hackers-still-in-action.html) capable of distributing additional payloads. The group most recently shifted focus to [attack Ukraine](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/trickbot-malware-shifted-its-focus-on.html).

The infamous malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform, up until its [formal closure](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/notorious-trickbot-malware-gang-shuts.html) early last year, served as a prominent vehicle for countless Ryuk and Conti ransomware attacks, with the latter eventually [taking over control](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/conti-ransomware-gang-shut-down-after.html) of the TrickBot criminal enterprise prior to its own shutdown in mid-2022.

Over the years, Wizard Spider has expanded its custom tooling with a set of sophisticated malware such as [Diavol](https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/researchers-find-new-evidence-linking.html), [BazarBackdoor](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/bazarcall-callback-phishing-attacks.html), [Anchor](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/trickbot-malware-gang-upgrades-its.html), and [BumbleBee](https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-using-bumblebee-loader-to.html), while simultaneously targeting multiple countries and industries, including academia, energy, financial services, and governments.

"While Wizard Spider's operations have significantly reduced following the demise of Conti in June 2022, these sanctions will likely cause disruption to the adversary's operations while they look for ways to circumvent the sanctions," Adam Meyers, head of intelligence at CrowdStrike, said in a statement.

"Often, when cybercriminal groups are disrupted, they will go dark for a time only to rebrand under a new name."

Per the Treasury Department, the sanctioned persons are said to be involved in the development of ransomware and other malware projects as well as money laundering and injecting malicious code into websites to steal victims' credentials.

Kovalev has also been charged with conspiracy to [commit bank fraud](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/russian-national-charged-bank-fraud-related-hacking-campaign) in connection with a series of intrusions into victim bank accounts held at U.S.-based financial institutions with the goal of transferring those funds to other accounts under their control.

The attacks, which occurred in 2009 and 2010 and predate Kovalev's tryst with Dyre and TrickBot, are said to have led to unauthorized transfers amounting to nearly $1 million, out of which at least $720,000 was transferred overseas.

What's more, Kovalev is also said to have worked closely on [Gameover ZeuS](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/u-s-u-k-sanction-7-men-tied-to-trickbot-hacking-group/), a peer-to-peer botnet that was temporarily dismantled in 2014. Vyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov, one of the operators of the Zeus malware, was [arrested](https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/fbi-wanted-leader-of-notorious-zeus.html) by Swiss authorities in November 2022.

U.K. intelligence officials further [assessed](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-cracks-down-on-ransomware-actors) that the organized crime group has "extensive links" to another Russia-based outfit known as [Evil Corp](https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/dridex-malware-now-attacking-macos.html), which was also sanctioned by the U.S. in December 2019.

The [announcement](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/ransomware-criminals-sanctioned-in-joint-uk-us-crackdown-on-international-cyber-crime) is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle to disrupt ransomware gangs and the broader crimeware ecosystem, and comes close on the heels of the takedown of [Hive infrastructure](https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/hive-ransomware-infrastructure-seized.html) last month.

The efforts are also complicated as Russia has [long offered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-ransomware-cyber-crime/2021/06/11/e159e486-c88f-11eb-8708-64991f2acf28_story.html) a [safe haven](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-ransomware-gang-connections/) for [criminal groups](https://duo.com/decipher/ransomware-safe-havens-reporting-inconsistencies-trouble-authorities), enablin...
