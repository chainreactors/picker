# Pirate IPTV Operator Destroys Evidence Then Agrees to Pay Sky €580,000

A man described by Sky as a "top level" pirate has agreed to pay the broadcaster €480,000 in damages. Sky's investigation of David Dunbar reportedly began on social media last November, but soon benefited from a timely anonymous tip from another country. In May 2025, Sky obtained a court order to secure evidence from Dunbar's home, but that didn't go according to plan. After being denied access to the premises, evidence was destroyed and funds were "dissipated".

Rightsholders call them *illicit streaming devices*, others prefer the catch-all term *pirate boxes*. Millions are happy with *Firesticks*, a name so well known that in some cases it’s used to describe other devices, regardless of manufacturer.

But of all names used to describe piracy-configured TV devices, the default option in Ireland – *dodgy boxes* – is short, descriptive, memorable, and on home soil, almost universally understood.

For broadcaster Sky, which according to media reports has 700,000 local subscribers, 400,000 local *dodgy box* users is a significant problem. Or, from a business perspective, the most significant obstacle between Sky’s shareholders and news of one million paying customers.

## Sky Ramps Up the Pressure

Whether Sky is seriously preparing to chase down users of *dodgy boxes*, or simply laying the groundwork in case that [becomes necessary](https://torrentfreak.com/sky-views-personal-data-as-new-weapon-in-iptv-piracy-war-250622/), is still uncertain. What is clear right now is Sky’s determination to suppress availability of *dodgy boxes*, the subscription packages purchased by consumers, and anyone involved in the supply, distribution, and sale of illegal streams fueling the entire system.

In June The Irish Times reported on a civil case at the High Court in Dublin that seemed to appear out of nowhere for a case of such significance. Plaintiff Sky claims that defendant David Dunbar of Wexford is a “top level” pirate who operates an illegal streaming service generating up to €450,000 a year. Such numbers are usually worth a closer look since they may offer clues on the size of the service involved and provide a rough idea of potential sentences.

## Big Money, Calculated Neatly

Sky’s underlying calculations aren’t provided but based on €450,000 in annual revenue, every month the service would need to generate exactly €37,500 based on Sky’s estimate of 5,000 subscribers overall. A monthly payment of exactly €7.50 for every subscriber, without any breaks for an entire year, would indeed yield exactly €450,000.

In this case, however, only the prices of annual packages appear in the initial report, one costing €80 and the other €100. If 50% of customers opted for the former, and the remainder only purchased the latter, that’s exactly €450,000 in annual revenue and perhaps a little too tidy to be based on real data.

Indeed, according to the initial report, Sky’s investigator could only show that Dunbar had “at least 1,682 customers” but believed it was likely much more than that. A 50/50 subscription split based on this figure would mean annual revenue of €151,380, just a third of the headline claim of €450,000, which still managed to retain its significance as the case moved on.

## The Luck of The Irish

The investigation into Dunbar’s activities reportedly dates back to November 2024, although it’s suggested that probably wasn’t recognized right at the beginning.

According to reports, Sky investigators had become aware of a social media account selling *dodgy boxes* which investigators subsequently linked to Dunbar. Separately, a perfectly-timed anonymous tip was received from across the water in the UK. As Irish Times explains:

*“Separately, Sky investigators were informed of an anonymous tip-off received by UK-based charity Crime Stoppers, alleging Mr Dunbar’s operation of the service.”*

Which service still isn’t clear, but the tip seems to have been quite valuable. Sources aren’t usually revealed in these types of cases, but this one received a prominent mention in The Irish Times and then a subsequent correction to clarify that the tip was received in the UK, not in Ireland itself. What followed next was a controversial move seen only rarely in piracy cases.

## Sky Obtains an Anton Piller Order

Whenever a plaintiff obtains an Anton Piller order, controversy is rarely far behind. Awarded by a court, Anton Piller orders allow a plaintiff to enter a defendant’s premises to search for and seize evidence relevant to their case, to prevent it from being destroyed or tampered with.

The execution of an Anton Piller order can be highly intrusive, so courts require the plaintiff to present a strong case. Equally, Anton Piller orders are sought only rarely, usually in the most important of cases, because when things go wrong, plaintiffs can risk significant penalties.

Plaintiffs also need to show evidence that any documents sought actually exist on the premises, and are likely to be destroyed if action isn’t taken. Applications are heard *ex parte* and in most cases, defendants are taken completely by surprise. That being said, Anton Piller orders are not supposed to be used to scoop up evidence as part of a fishing expedition, assuming the defendant even lets anyone inside.

## No Cooperation

After obtaining an Anton Piller order and others that aimed to secure evidence, an independent solicitor attended Dunbar’s home to explain what they meant and to clarify his obligations. According to The Irish Times, Dunbar refused to comply. He refused to allow the solicitor inside and then reportedly went about destroying evidence and “dissipating funds” that according to one of the orders, had been frozen by the court.

Counsel for Sky say that Dunbar knew exactly what he was doing, and he understood that failure to comply with orders issued by a court meant that he risked being held in contempt.

Dunbar said he only understood the seriousness of the situation after a full explanation from his own legal team. At that point, he immediately sought to comply.

## Dunbar Decides Not to Defend His Case

During a hearing at the High Court earlier this week, it was [revealed](https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/29/wexford-man-must-pay-480000-damages-for-dodgy-box-copyright-infringement-court-rules/) that Dunbar had decided not to fight Sky’s infringement lawsuit. Instead, after reaching an agreement with Sky, Dunbar consented to a judgment in Sky’s favor, meaning that he instantly lost the case. The judgment was accompanied by a damages award of €480,000 against Dunbar for provision of an illegal streaming service since 2018.

That’s a full six years before the anonymous tip, and a damages amount quite close to the re...
