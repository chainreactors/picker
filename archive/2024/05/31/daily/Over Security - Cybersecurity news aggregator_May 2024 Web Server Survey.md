In the **May 2024** survey we received responses from **1,097,398,145** sites across **268,137,699** domains and **12,898,459** web-facing computers. This reflects an increase of 4.4 million sites, 202,938 domains, and 26,168 web-facing computers.

Cloudflare experienced the largest gain of 4.4 million sites (+3.84%) this month, and now accounts for 10.8% (0.36pp) of sites seen by Netcraft. OpenResty made the next largest gain of 3.2 million sites (+2.91%).

nginx experienced the largest loss of 4.6 million sites (-1.92%) this month, reducing its market share to 21.5% (-0.51pp). Apache suffered the next largest loss, down by 2.2 million sites (-1.00%).

### Vendor news

* Amazon announced that [S3 will no longer charge for requests that fail](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/05/amazon-s3-no-charge-http-error-codes/) due to several HTTP error codes, following a blog post by engineer Maciej Pocwierz, who [received a $1,300 bill after creating an empty private S3 bucket](https://medium.com/%40maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1). The bucket unintentionally received almost 100 million requests in a day as it shared the same name as a placeholder used by a popular open-source backup tool.
* Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.89, 10.1.24 and 11.0.0-M20 were released.
* [LiteSpeed versions 6.0.12 and 6.1.2](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server/release-log) were released, containing security fixes, improvements, and bug fixes.
* Amazon announced a [new AWS edge location in Cairo, Egypt](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/05/new-edge-location-egypt/).
* Microsoft announced that [Azure no longer charges for data transfer between Availability Zones](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates/update-on-interavailability-zone-data-transfer-pricing/).
