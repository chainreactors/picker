## **INTRODUCTION**

In this blog, we discuss specific topics in supply chain planning associated with and derived from [major business trends affecting the value chain in chemicals](https://sap.sharepoint.com/teams/BTSChemicalsTeam/Shared%20Documents/Knowledge/Industry%20Specifics/Blog%20Series/1-Procurement/Link%20auf%20Ornulfs%20Papier). For details, we refer you to the initial blog where we introduced the overall value chain. We concentrate on the following areas in which we address those challenges in relation to both business considerations and SAP solutions:

* Margin pressure and supply chain resilience as a top priority topic, especially in volatile times

* Needs and benefits of business networks to enable you to achieve the next level in supply chain integration

* Sustainability considerations of global relevance for all enterprises

These areas require specific supply chain planning processes that can cope with the challenges involved. In this blog, those supply chain planning megatrends are explained and considered from the perspective of the following enterprise-wide planning and exeuction capabilities offered by SAP solutions:

* Touchless planning and seamless planning

* Synchronized planning and planner workspaces

* Holistic planning

* Planning the carbon footprint

## 1.1 Touchless Planning and Seamless Planning

Time is a constraint for a planner in the chemicals industry. We no longer live in an era in which planners review system-driven planning proposals or even fully loaded tabular planning sheets with all items. Planning proposals are now so close to reality that manual intervention is not needed – and they can be adopted by the planner without alteration. These kinds of planning flows are already possible in, for example, the demand planning domain. In this domain, all planning steps (historical data load, cleansing data, segmentation, automatic forecast model selection, and forecast generation and release) are automated without any intervention by the planner. Then a forecast is delivered with a best-in-class forecast accuracy. An illustrative picture of fully automated process steps (in blue) is shown in the table and supported by the SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain (SAP IBP) solution.

## 1.2 Synchronized Planning and Planner Workspaces

The planning flow is usually split into operational, tactical, and strategic windows. Every horizon normally serves different key performance indicators, such as balanced asset utilization, labor capacity checks, supply capacity feasability, and material component availability checks. Increasing the frequency of refreshing the plans in all windows improves the quality of the final plan. Specific process models are required to facilitate the refresh interaction between the tactical and operational supply chain windows. The chemicals planner needs not only clear demarcation of responsibility of plans but also refresh capabilities. A closed-loop process of tactical supply chain planning and execution working seamlessly across different planning horizons (from sales and operations planning to manufacturing operational planning) and time buckets is called synchronized planning. This can be seen in Figure 1, below.

Capabilities that are leveraged for the the life sciences industry in SAP IBP and SAP S/4HANA for advanced planning to support synchronized planning are:

* Planning modes (SAP IBP delegating scheduling to SAP S/4HANA (advanced planning also known as PPDS), or SAP IBP and SAP S/4HANA for advanced planning having a dual staged planning responsibility); see example in Figure 2

* Handover of tactical plan orders to detailed scheduling plan orders for advanced planning and scheduling in operative planning
