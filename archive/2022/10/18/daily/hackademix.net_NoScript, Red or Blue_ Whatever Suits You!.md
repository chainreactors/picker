# NoScript, Red or Blue? Whatever Suits You!

The dust has settled, all the rough edges have been smoothed, and NoScript’s new UI is better than ever.

Many usability and accessibility enhancements (from keyboard navigation to dark / light color schemes) have been added, and the result is just gorgeous, [on the website too](https://noscript.net/).

The default theme now is “Modern Red”, but the most nostalgic can easily switch to “Classic Blue” still keeping all the benefits, including dark mode.

Next step? By [popular request](https://twitter.com/ma1/status/1565031997134831616), a subtle logo refresh before the end of the year, to bring back some of the original evil energy to Jesse the JavaScript Worm :)
