# LinkedIn will use your data to train its AI unless you opt out now

Posted: September 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

LinkedIn plans to share user data with Microsoft and its affiliates for AI training. Framed as “legitimate interest”, it won’t ask for your permission—instead you’ll have to opt out before the deadline.

Microsoft has made major investments in ChatGPT’s creator OpenAI, and as we know, the more data we feed a Large Language Model (LLM) the more useful answers the AI chatbot can provide. This explains why LinkedIn wants your data, but not how it went about it.

The use of personal data for AI improvements and product personalization always raises privacy concerns and we would expect a much lower participation rate if users had to sign up for it. The problem in this case is that you were already opted-in by default and your data will be used up to the point where you opt out.

To opt out, you should go to your LinkedIn privacy settings:

* Navigate to Settings & Privacy > Data privacy > Data for Generative AI Improvement.
  ![Data privacy settings LinkedIn](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/settings_privacy.png)

* Toggle off Use my data for training content creation AI models.
  ![turned off](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/now_its_off.png)

* Optionally, file a Data Processing Objection request to formally object. To do this, access the [Data Processing Objection Form](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DPRO), select **Object to processing for training content-generating AI models**, and send a request. Non-members can also file an objection if their personal data was shared on LinkedIn by a member.

You should also review and clean up older or sensitive posts, profiles, or resumes to reduce exposure. Again, opting out only stops future training on new data; it does not retract data already used.

The data LinkedIn might share is pretty extensive:

* **Profile data**, which includes your name, photo, current position, past work experience, education, location, skills, publications, patents, endorsements, and recommendations.
* **Job-related data**, such as resumes, responses to screening questions, and application details.
* **The content you posted**, such as posts, articles, poll responses, contributions, and comments.
* **Feedback**, including ratings and responses you provide.

## Who is affected and how?

There are some contradicting statements going around about in which countries the new [update to LinkedIn terms](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a8059228) will apply. The official statement says members in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, Canada, and Hong Kong have until November 3, 2025, to opt out. (EEA is the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). Other [so](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/09/23/microsofts-linkedin-warns-it-will-auto-train-ai-models-on-your-data-but-you-can-opt-out)[urces](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/09/23/microsofts-linkedin-warns-it-will-auto-train-ai-models-on-your-data-but-you-can-opt-out) say that UK users are affected as well. We’d advise anyone who has that setting and doesn’t want to participate to turn the “Use my data…” setting off.
