**Last Modified:**March 10, 2023

**Hello SAP S/4HANA Cloud Community,**

Digital enablement assets for stay current and Certification exams are now available for **SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition** **2302** to ensure that you keep your knowledge and certification up-to-date. To make the most out of your learning investment, please select the learning journey that best meets your needs and go directly to the “Stay current” scenario of the selected SAP Learning Hub Learning Journeys if you are already certified. Otherwise, enjoy the journey journey on your way to certification.

**Fresh Starters**:

If you are just starting your journey with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition it is highly recommended that you begin by subscribing to the SAP Learning Hub and then joining the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Implementation Learning Room. Once subscribed, you can search for this room and assign it to yourself, or use the learning room tile in any learning journey below. You should then start your journey with the “Start with an overview” scenario and progressively work through the Become Competent scenario to get certified. On subsequent releases, you will only need to consume the digital ‘stay current’ delta content to stay up-to-date with your certification release over release.

**In-App Enablement & Tutorials:**

The 2302 release of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition comes with new innovations. SAP key and end-user enablement includes updated and new tutorial packages as well, available both in the SAP Learning Hub and In-App via Web Assistant. Below you will find the packages that have been updated and cover the most important key features and business processes. We also include other packages that may be of interest to you as a RISE with SAP professional.

**Support and Success Essentials for Cloud Solutions eLearning and Badge Program:**

In an effort to ensure that partners, customers and internal SAP consultants become knowledgeable about the SAP Support and Success resources available to them, we have created an eLearning and badge to properly educate and then validate a consultant’s knowledge of support related resources. The eLearning and badge are currently part of all the RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud learning journeys. To access the course and assessment, you can subscribe to any SAP Learning Hub edition that is cloud relevant.

* Knowledge Badge Assessment: [CLS01k Web Assessment](https://saplearninghub.plateau.com/learning/user/deeplink.do?OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=JHO9-VJP8-FEI9-RWC3-WL8L-6M0K-KMMQ-24E1&linkId=ITEM_DETAILS&componentID=CLS01k_EN_Col04&componentTypeID=EXAM&fromSF=Y&revisionDate=1357992000000)

* eLearning: [CLS01e – Support and Success Essentials for Cloud Solutions](https://saplearninghub.plateau.com/learning/user/deeplink.do?OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=JHO9-VJP8-FEI9-RWC3-WL8L-6M0K-KMMQ-24E1&linkId=ITEM_DETAILS&componentID=CLS01e_EN_Col04&componentTypeID=E-Learning&fromSF=Y&revisionDate=1357992000000)

**Stay Current with SAP Certification**

If you are currently certified in one or more of the lines of business, you MUST complete your most recent ‘stay current’ content and assessment by the deadline above to KEEP your certification credential and badge. If you are current on the 2208 release of the exam, please complete your 2302 Stay Current assessment by **May 10, 2023**. This gives you 3 ½ months after the major release date to complete your assessment. If you do NOT follow the ‘stay current with SAP Certification’ bi-yearly assessment requirement, you will have to re-certify and in the meantime your digital badge will show as ‘expired’.
