# The data on denying social media for kids (re-air) (Lock and Code S06E12)

Posted: June 16, 2025

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

Complex problems often assume complex solutions, but recent observations about increased levels of anxiety and depression, increased reports of loneliness, and lower rates of in-person friendships for teens and children in America today have led some school districts across the country to take direct and simple action: Take away the access to smartphones in schools.

Not everyone is convinced.

When social psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt proposed five solutions to what he called an “epidemic of mental illness” for young adults in America, many balked at the simplicity.

[Writing for the outlet Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/anxious-generation-jonathan-haidt-debate-critique/?ref=platformer-newsletter), reporter Zoe Schiffer spoke with multiple behavioral psychologists who alleged that Haidt’s book cherry-picks survey data, ignores mental health crises amongst adults, and over-simplifies a complex problem with a blunt solution. And in speaking on the podcast Power User, educator Brandon Cardet-Hernandez argued that phone bans in schools would harm the students that need phones the most for things like translation services and coordinating rides back home from parents with varying schedules.

But Haidt isn’t alone in thinking that smartphones have done serious harm to teenagers and kids today, and many schools across America are taking up the mantle to at least remove their access in their own hallways. In February, Los Angeles Unified School District did just that, and a board member for the school district told the Lock and Code podcast that he believes the change has been for the better.

But for those still in doubt, there’s a good reason now to look back.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we revisit a 2024 interview with Dr. Jean Twenge about her research into the differences in America between today’s teens and the many generations that came before. A psychologist and published author, Twenge believes she has found enough data tying increased smartphone use and social media engagement with higher strains on mental health. In today’s re-broadcast episode, Twenge explains where she believes there is a mental health crisis amongst today’s teens, where it is unique to their generation, and whether it can all be traced to smartphones and social media.

According to Dr. Twenge, the answer to all those questions is, pretty much, “Yes.” But, she said, there’s still some hope to be found.

> “This is where the argument around smartphones and social media being behind the adolescent mental health crisis actually has, kind of paradoxically, some optimism to it. Because if that’s the cause, that means we can do something about it.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
