# Unreleased Movie Screeners Leak Online, Including Star-Studded ‘In the Hand of Dante’

Just weeks before its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, Julian Schnabel's star-studded film 'In the Hand of Dante' has suffered a major setback after a high-quality screener copy leaked online. The leak is not an isolated incident as copies of other unreleased movies have also appeared online, some of which also have an Italian connection.

Next month, American filmmaker Julian Schnabel will be honored with the *Cartier Glory to the Filmmaker* award at the prestigious [Venice Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Venice_International_Film_Festival).

Schnabel’s latest film *[In the Hand of Dante](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333644/)* will have its world premiere at the festival, with a star-studded cast including Oscar Isaac, Al Pacino, Gal Gadot, Gerard Butler, Jason Momoa, and Martin Scorsese, who is also credited as executive producer.

So far, very little official footage from the film has been released to the public; not even a trailer. Yet through unauthorized channels, including public pirate sites, a full screener copy leaked online a few days ago.

The pirated copy lists “a friend” as the source, without further context. Aside from the opening and closing scenes, the film is in black and white and clearly lists a “for screening only” watermark, as shown below.

A high-profile leak of this nature is concerning, all the more so because it’s not the only screener that was released by over the past few days. Copies of other unreleased films including [*The Best Thing About Christmas*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36778421/), [*Agon*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt35890662/), [*Life Is*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt36850385/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1), and [*Extreme Family*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt37061136/) also appeared online.

These are mostly independent films with relatively small budgets and limited promotion.

What further stands out is that several titles have an Italian connection. *In the Hand of Dante* is based on a novel about the famous Italian poet and was filmed in Sicily, Venice, and Rome. *The Best Thing About Christmas* is a project from Italian director Paolo Genovese, while *Agon* is an Italian production directed by Michele Riondino.

*Life Is* by prominent Mexican director Lorena Villarreal doesn’t have an obvious Italian connection. Instead, the leaked screener copy has an “EFICINE Producción” watermark, referring to the fiscal stimulus program for movies in Mexico.

Finally, it’s worth highlighting that we also spotted an screener release of Michael Shanks’ horror movie [*Together*,](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31184028) which premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival and is currently in theaters.

What is clear is that someone with either authorized or unauthorized access to these screener copies is leaking them to the public. This is [reminiscent](https://torrentfreak.com/pirated-screeners-of-falling-and-my-salinger-year-leak-online-early-201021/) of [earlier](https://torrentfreak.com/toronto-film-festival-asks-google-to-remove-links-to-leaked-netflix-screeners-210915/) screener [leaks](https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-movie-screeners-leak-on-pirate-sites-before-official-premiere-210913/) by the group EVO, which shared similar advance copies before the group [was busted](https://torrentfreak.com/authorities-arrested-leaders-of-prolific-piracy-release-group-evo-230315/) in late 2022.

For these independent titles, a pre-release leak can be financially devastating, impacting potential distribution deals and box office returns. Understandably, the creators and rightsholders of the recently leaked films will be determined to find out where the current breach originated.
