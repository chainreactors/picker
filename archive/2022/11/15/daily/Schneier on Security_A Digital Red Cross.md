## A Digital Red Cross

The International Committee of the Red Cross wants some [digital equivalent](https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-cross-wants-digital-symbols-to-deter-hackers-from-healthcare-institutions-11667571607) to the iconic red cross, to alert would-be hackers that they are accessing a medical network.

> The emblem wouldn’t provide technical cybersecurity protection to hospitals, Red Cross infrastructure or other medical providers, but it would signal to hackers that a cyberattack on those protected networks during an armed conflict would violate international humanitarian law, experts say, Tilman Rodenhäuser, a legal adviser to the International Committee of the Red Cross, said at a panel discussion hosted by the organization on Thursday.

I can think of all sorts of problems with this idea and many reasons why it won’t work, but those also apply to the physical red cross on buildings, vehicles, and people’s clothing. So let’s try it.

Attribution and jurisdiction seem much more problematic for cybercrime than for traditional physical attacks. Even assuming a victim (or law enforcement) can definitely say that a ransomware attack originated in Elbonia, which is uncertain, what’s the recourse? Extraordinary rendition? Sanctions against the Elbonian government?

This sounds to me like a good idea. More generally there ought to be the equivalent of the Geneva conventions for what is and is not a legitimate attack on computing systems during wars. Obviously not everyone will follow such conventions, but that does not mean they wouldn’t have value. Not following them should be a war crime.

@ Bruce, ALL,

> “I can think of all sorts of problems with this idea and many reasons why it won’t work”

The primary reason it won’t work is that of lack of visceral shaming.

The Red Cross works because eventually the bodies get found and the evidence published in a news paper causes those who committed the acts to not just loose credability but an adverse reputation in the world.

It’s why the likes of Journalists are attacked by even Western Governments and portraid as spys or criminals. Worse much that should not be kept secret is and this becomes an even bigger boil to lance.

But there is another issue that needs to be considered,

“When is a medical network not a medical network?”

Take for instance what is probably the worlds largest spying organisation Palantir.

The UK Government amongst others think it’s fine to give them all the UK Citizens and others who have received medical treatment intimate medical records to Palantir.

Should Palantir be alowed the use of the Cyber-Red-Cross to hide all their activities behind?

I would hope not, but I’m fairly certain that “False Flaging” will become a major use of the Cyber-Red-Cross. So we need realy intrusive “oversight” with hard and easily enforcable penalties for misuse.

So with those considerations given real thought to we come to the,

> “So let’s try it.”

The question though is,

“How?”

One of the fitst lessons you get about “Abstract Data Types”(ADTs)

1, No bag of bits is unique.

The second is,

2, A bag of bits has no unique meaning, or any meaning without meta-data.

So the question of,

“How do we make the flag?”

Needs answering before we come to the even harder question of,

“How do we fly the flag so all can not fail to see it?”

There are several more questions but those two alone will keep a committee occupied for quite some time to come.

This is a replay of the “Evil Bit” RFC.

Dear hacker, please do not hack me!

Should be fine and as affective as a small can of a red paint.

@Mexaly
“Evil Bit”

Not really the same. The proposal clearly states that this is not supposed to grant protection on a technical level. Only a legal one by making attacking marked sites a war crime.
Similar as some red paint does not protect against any kind of military weapons.

Sure, as others have said there are still a couple of issues to be solved before it can be enacted.

Looks like they have one, create an NFT and sell it back to them.

But like the “banner of peace” dots flying at your gate
‘https://www.svgrepo.com/show/62485/peace-flag-center-of-three-dots.svg

or the “robots.txt” for a website, or waving a white flag…

compliance is optional in the minds of vultures without a conscience, and thats the “business model of the internet”.

Sociopaths don’t care. Pharmacies in North America put signs up out front telling would be burglars and junkies that there are no narcotics stored in their business overnight and they still get broken into.
