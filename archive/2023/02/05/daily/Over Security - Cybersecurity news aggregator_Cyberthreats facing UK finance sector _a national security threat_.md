# Cyberthreats facing UK finance sector “a national security threat”

Posted: February 3, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

As the reports covering all of 2022 start trickling in, we can see that cybercrime and other types of fraud had a major impact last year.

Take for example the 2022 half year fraud update by UK Finance, which tells us that criminals stole a total of £609.8 million (roughly $750 million) through authorized and unauthorized fraud and scams in the UK alone.

UK Finance is the collective voice for the UK’s banking and finance industry, representing around 300 firms across the industry. Its report states: “As we have warned previously, the level of fraud in the UK has reached a point where it must be considered a national security threat.”

Another report, called the ‘[State of cyber security in the UK](https://www.iomart.com/updates/state-of-cyber-security-in-the-uk-report-2022/)’, surveyed 500 UK-based cybersecurity strategy decision makers. It showed that financials are at significantly higher risk than the average UK business. More than half (58.2 percent) reporting between 40 and 60 cyber security incidents in the last 12 months.

## Businesses

Many financials not only carry the burden of protecting their customers, but are also at risk of falling victim to cybercrime themselves.

The threat which was mentioned the most in responses to the survey was [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing). Some 67 percent of respondents highlighted it as their main worry for their organization. This is no surprise as phishing is often the prelude to more serious threats like [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware), breaches, and [BEC scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/bec-scammers-go-after-more-than-just-money).

Other worries were the rise in premium prices for cyber insurance, and the security implications of the rise in flexible working. The advancing pace of technology (39 percent) also featured, as effects from the pandemic have complicated organizations’ ability to protect themselves from cyber threats.

The report based on the survey also shows a higher-than-expected number of breaches. Which made more organizations realize that having a recovery plan is almost as important as having effective preventive measures.

## Consumers

The main types of fraud targeting consumers were:

* Authorized push payment (APP) scams, which use [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) that tricks victims into authorizing payments to accounts belonging to the scammer. [Romance scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/02/romance-scams-ftc-reveals-304-million-of-heartache) and [investment scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/02/investment-scams-are-on-the-rise) operate this way, as do purchase scams, where people pay for goods that are never delivered.
* Unauthorized payment card fraud. This category covers fraud on debit, credit, charge, and ATM-only cards issued in the UK. Payment card fraud losses are organized into five categories: Remote card purchases, lost and stolen cards, cards that aren’t received, counterfeit cards, and card ID theft.
* Remote purchase fraud. This type of fraud occurs when a criminal uses stolen card details to buy something on the Internet, over the phone or via mail order. It is also re...
