## Experian Privacy Vulnerability

Brian Krebs is [reporting](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/01/identity-thieves-bypassed-experian-security-to-view-credit-reports/) on a vulnerability in Experian’s website:

> Identity thieves have been exploiting a glaring security weakness in the website of Experian, one of the big three consumer credit reporting bureaus. Normally, Experian requires that those seeking a copy of their credit report successfully answer several multiple choice questions about their financial history. But until the end of 2022, Experian’s website allowed anyone to bypass these questions and go straight to the consumer’s report. All that was needed was the person’s name, address, birthday and Social Security number.

@ ALL,

Re : When Personal is Public.

> *“All that was needed was the person’s name, address, birthday and Social Security number.”*

As far as I remember in the US all of those personal details are available online in one way or another already.

The fact that “all data brokers” not just the big three that includes Experian know this will not of course change the remediation from the stabdard nothing burger of,

“Use our product for a year so you can check your status”

But with that extra added poison pickle layers of,

“First enter required extra details including your mobile phone number, Email address, and all bank and financial account details.”

But also that effectively hidden small print of,

“Your account will be Auto converted to a premium paid service at the end of the year.”

Probably at 20/month… But also so that they can harangue you into paying $10/month this year so you will get sent “Text alerts” or “Email Alerts” of suspicious activity (or some other nonsense to get “new sales”)…

They then sell your info on for $50 or equivalent…

It surprises me that they are not also offering an online “Single Sign On” and “Password Manager”…

As best as I can tell, Krebs has managed at least one Experian data security screw-up story a year for over a decade. No one holds them to account so they don’t give a damn and nothing changes. Or worse, as Clive points out, lax security and losing your data is part of their business model.

Welp, at least thieves can’t get other peoples’ reports anymore by changing the URL from “/acr/oow/” to “/acr/report” during the identity verification process.

What is Experian doing with $2.6 billion a quarter?

I just took a look at all three of my credit reports via annualcreditreport.com and they were all fairly accurate if not a little out-dated. To tell you the truth, the reports seemed fairly anemic infowise.

I put freezes on my credit files at Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion back in 2018 when Brian announced a law had been passed to make them free. Glad to see Brian providing links to that guidance again.

Most of the coming in so far proves the thoughts I’ve been having. They are a little candid and nobody is going to like them.

* There’s chatter on Telegram.This is a known known hive of unlawful activity with the edgelord owner setting things up behind a claim of legal invincibility.
* Random researcher picks up chatter and goes racing to a “personality”.
* Said personality piles in to their ritual self promotion and grift to sell a story and make himself look like the man of the hour.
* Chummocracy in full swing as other “security professionals” cut and past the headline.
* Absolutely zero happens in the public policy domain which is the only thing that matters.

I’ve seen it all before. You need a policy position, politicians and regulators lined up, and NGO’s and lawyers to give them a prod. Best practice exists elsewhere i.e. EU and UK. Some of this may depend on a change of personality in the hierarchy or a change of government. Given the current political workload in the US this is not an easy task especially with various nutjobs and billionaire Christofascists always centering their egos in the discussion. As for the media they’re very little practical use at the moment. 24/7media has come with information overload and opinion masquerading as journalism and peddling gossip for clicks. The poor wounded dears nursing brittle masculinity, especially the younger ones, write of client journalism as “doing their best within the system they’re working in” which suggests a few problems at the editorial level. There are some, and I say some, good journalists (less so in the UK). None legacy media tends to be where the action is but is currently of limited reach.

From experience any hot button topic with buy in at the very top can see action within a year. If it’s a significant technical change with a large strategic impact it will take three years. A significant legislative change will take ten years. Structural change will take 20 years.

Anything else is just egos scratching itches.

And that’s why I get bored. When I see the same problem come around for the nth time I’m like yeah and?

Nobody has really commented on it but the most significant tweak so far uder the Biden administration has been to change the emphasis of business regulation. It’s not quote the same winner takes all monopolistic scheme (dating back to the writing of the US constitution) as it was. Not as far as Europe but a half step.

Privacy and other law isn’t as advanced as the EU or UK. As this issue is a US jurisdiction issue only it’s escaped the attention of GDPR and similar. But… Where a US citizen is abroad legal remedy is available in the EU and UK. I would go prodding around over there and seeing what levers can be pulled. An EU resident can write to the EU commission...
