# Background check provider data breach affects 3 million people who may not have heard of the company

Posted: February 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Employment screening company DISA Global Solutions has filed a [data breach notification](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/b823b27d-5fe2-4f09-8753-b362741d7f95.html) after a cyber incident on their network.

DISA says a third party had access to its environment between February 9, 2024, and April 22, 2024. The attacker may have accessed over three million files containing [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

DISA is a third-party administrator of employment screening services, including drug and alcohol testing and background checks. DISA discovered the breach on April 22, 2024, and has since conducted an investigation with the help of third-party forensic experts.

This is one of these cases where a company most people have never heard of has amassed a mountain of information about many people. These [data brokers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-brokers) gather information from several sources and sell them on to interested buyers. DISA provides these services to over 55,000 companies.

During the investigation, DISA was unable to determine the specifics of the stolen data, but everyone whose data may have been compromised will get a detailed breach notification letter, specifying the type of data.

This letter will also include details about free access to 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian for which you must enrol by June 30, 2025.

Given the field that DISA is active in, that information could interest cybercriminals for use as background information for targeted [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts or extortion. The [Massachusetts breach report tracker](https://www.mass.gov/doc/data-breach-report-2025/download) that at least some Social Security Numbers were involved.

![SSN Breached: yes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/SSN.png?w=1024)

[SSN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web) Breached: yes

DISA states that it’s not aware of any attempts to abuse the stolen information:

> “While we are unaware of any attempted or actual misuse of any information involved in this incident, we are providing you with information about the incident and steps you can take to protect yourself, should you feel it necessary.”

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](...
