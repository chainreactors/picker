## Key Data

This article explores Netcraft芒聙聶s research into the global growth of fake stores, including activity that makes use of the e-commerce platform SHOPYY to target Black Friday shoppers. Insights include:

* An increase of 110% in fake stores identified between August to October 2024
* Tens of thousands of fake stores utilizing the e-commerce tech platform SHOPYY
* More than 66% of SHOPYY-powered sites identified as fake stores
* More than 9,000 new and unique fake store domains detected by Netcraft between November 18芒聙聯21, hosted on SHOPYY alone
* Most activity attributed to threat actors likely operating from China
* Activity primarily targeting U.S. shoppers
* Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text for product listings

## Overview

Cyber Week, running from Black Friday to Cyber Monday (and often extending beyond), has become synonymous with holiday season shopping. Brands and e-commerce marketplaces offer significant discounts throughout November to entice consumers to buy products from their online stores. [Some forecasts predict](https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report.html) that 2024 Black Friday purchases will exceed those of 2023 by $1 billion. While legitimate brands go all out to provide the best offers, some too-good-to-be-true discounts are an indication of more malevolent activity 芒聙聰 fraudulent online stores.

[In 2023, we saw a 135% increase in fake online stores](https://www.netcraft.com/blog/fake-online-stores-see-black-friday-spike/) leading up to the holidays. This trend continues in 2024, with a 110% increase in domains hosting fake stores from August to October. This represents an all-time high, with more activity expected before the end of November 2024.

Since [free domain names ceased being available in 2023](https://www.netcraft.com/blog/impact-of-freenom-halting-registrations-on-cybercrime/), this growth represents a record investment in domain names for fake stores with each carrying a registration cost of $1 or more.

Powering the surge in volume is threat actors' use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate long- and short-form text for the product descriptions on these sites. We first observed [LLM-generated retail product descriptions in July 2024](https://www.netcraft.com/blog/llms-fueling-gen-ai-criminal-revolution/), and similar behaviors continue into the holiday shopping season. This includes examples of fake stores appropriating product listings directly from Amazon and using LLMs to rewrite the copy for enhanced search engine performance.

## Large Language Product Laundering

SHOPYY (also referred to as SHOPOEM) is a Chinese e-commerce platform offering a broad portfolio of technical solutions to help retailers build and optimize online stores, promote their products, and accept different payment types. SHOPYY also provides hosting and domain registration on behalf of store operators.

Unfortunately, the customization and convenience that benefits genuine retailers can be misused by cybercriminals. While some legitimate businesses use SHOPYY as their e-commerce platform partner, we芒聙聶ve detected thousands of SHOPYY-powered fake stores, increasing month-over-month since April 2024. Between November 18 to 21 alone, Netcraft芒聙聶s systems identified more than 9,000 new fake store domains hosted through SHOPYY.

These sites often impersonate established brands to take advantage of their intellectual property, brand reputation, and existing customer base. Instead of offering the same quality products and services, they trick unsuspecting shoppers into paying for fake, substandard, or non-existent products.

SHOPYY芒聙聶s sprawling store portfolio, which spans multiple hosting providers and domain registrars, creates opportunities for criminal exploitation. Such a large and distributed infrastructure means abuse reporting and effective controls are harder to orchestrate, which is likely why the majority of stores on SHOPYY appear to be fraudulent.

The spike since April 2024 can be mostly attributed to activities that catalog product listings scraped from Amazon. Since SHOPYY mainly serves Chinese-speaking users (the platform was founded in Xiamen, China, and offers documentation written exclusively in Mandarin Chinese), these threat actors are likely operating from the region. The activity targets English-speaking shoppers primarily in the U.S., with product listings scraped from Amazon芒聙聶s U.S. site that offers $USD pricing.

## Campaign Hallmarks

The following sections explore the hallmarks and behaviors exemplified by these SHOPYY threat actors.

### Low Code Black Friday Branding

In early November, Netcraft systems observed SHOPYY-powered fake stores using a new 芒聙聹Black Friday芒聙聺 widget. This widget adds new code to their websites, revealing the promotional text that reads 芒聙聹Get Early Access to Our Black Friday Deals & More!芒聙聺 and Black Friday-themed imagery. Shortly after the code was introduced, these promotions became visible to site visitors (on November 19).

### Copy and Paste Amazon Product Listings

All of the sites identified list products cloned from Amazon, going so far as to configure each product ID to match the original listing. In the example below, the listing is a near-exact clone (containing the same product identifier 芒聙聰 B08G8WTDR9 芒聙聰 in the URL). The only changes include new Teamfar product branding and a 30% discount.
