## Bottom Line Up Front

Common threats like malware, ransomware, web application hacking, insider and privilege misuse, and targeted intrusions don't have to spell disaster. Mid-market companies and small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) can cut through the confusion of how to build a solid security program. Our **Information Security Accelerator** service is designed to help your organization chart the right path forward.

## Security Doesn't Have to be Complicated

For mid-market companies and SMBs, building a solid Information Security program can seem impossible without the resources of a *Fortune 500* enterprise. Business email compromise, ransomware, data breaches… the threats in the headlines can seem overwhelming, leading to resignation and sleepless nights. But there is another way.

Your organization *can* build an effective Information Security program that protects your ability to do business on the hostile Internet. Achieving that effective security is more straightforward than most people think, if you have a good plan of action.

TrustedSec created the Information Security Accelerator service to help organizations build that strong foundation, and quickly. It is designed for those who may not have the most robust security capabilities yet *but that have a strong desire to improve*.

It might be just the help you are looking for, if:

* You have always wanted better security but never have the time or resources to figure out how.
* You are getting questions from customers or regulators.
* You have experienced a wake-up call.
* You are struggling to prioritize limited budgets, personnel, and time.

We know that business and IT leaders need an Information Security plan that delivers high-value benefits and broad protections for the organization. We know the plan needs to get into the *how*, not just the what, and be customized and realistic to the organization's size and resources. We know that a key security foundation is hardening your environment against the most common attack methods. And we know that sometimes, organizations need a little extra help to get the ball rolling.

> ***Achieving baseline Information Security is straightforward if you have a good plan of action.***

## How Does it Work?

We use a scalable 3-step process of Assessment, Roadmap, and Security Engineering:

### 1.    Assessment

Our process begins with a security controls assessment designed to show the current state of an organization's Information Security program and quickly highlight the m...
