In episode 52 of The AI Fix, our hosts watch a non-existent musical about garlic bread, Graham shares a summer reading list of books that don‚Äôt exist, Mark feels nauseous after watching a video of Sam Altman and Jony Ive waffling about products that don‚Äôt exist, some non-existent robots stack empty crates in a factory that doesn‚Äôt exist, and OpenAI releases Codex, an AI agent destined to make your software engineering job not exist.

Graham reveals how an AI called ‚ÄúThy‚Äù has ruined his childhood dream of becoming a late night radio DJ, and Mark looks at an experiment that showed groups of AI agents spontaneously create social norms‚Äîthe building blocks of a society.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
