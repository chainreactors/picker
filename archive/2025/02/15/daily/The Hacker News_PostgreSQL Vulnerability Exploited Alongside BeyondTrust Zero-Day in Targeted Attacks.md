# [PostgreSQL Vulnerability Exploited Alongside BeyondTrust Zero-Day in Targeted Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/postgresql-vulnerability-exploited.html)

[![PostgreSQL Vulnerability](data:image/png;base64... "PostgreSQL Vulnerability")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSsVzZMXE_YzNPyUX1Q0hPnz4RVdVaxj6x-DCGIcyLXfR1cRkaIHUcqr3ebiZ77EwqjgAYKfYlKZbT4dIs8ozRB2t2QK4JGEHtzzwS9f8ZRRhmzo_HJObKi8EaXfk_DpdXL4epfXXidevZocWqS0Zy6wZs_COxMIPDKdtVsWEibYa6EH7jiF8V6Kqf6qwv/s790-rw-e365/PostgreSQL-zeroday.png)

Threat actors who were behind the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access (PRA) and Remote Support (RS) products in December 2024 likely also exploited a previously unknown SQL injection flaw in PostgreSQL, according to findings from Rapid7.

The vulnerability, tracked as **[CVE-2025-1094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1094)** (CVSS score: 8.1), affects the PostgreSQL interactive tool psql.

"An attacker who can generate a SQL injection via CVE-2025-1094 can then achieve arbitrary code execution (ACE) by leveraging the interactive tool's ability to run meta-commands," security researcher Stephen Fewer [said](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2025/02/13/cve-2025-1094-postgresql-psql-sql-injection-fixed/).

The cybersecurity company further noted that it made the discovery as part of its investigation into [CVE-2024-12356](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/cisa-adds-critical-flaw-in-beyondtrust.html), a recently patched security flaw in BeyondTrust software that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution.

Specifically, it found that "a successful exploit for CVE-2024-12356 had to include exploitation of CVE-2025-1094 in order to achieve remote code execution."

In a coordinated disclosure, the maintainers of PostgreSQL [released](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2025-1094/) an update to address the problem in the following versions -

* PostgreSQL 17 (Fixed in 17.3)
* PostgreSQL 16 (Fixed in 16.7)
* PostgreSQL 15 (Fixed in 15.11)
* PostgreSQL 14 (Fixed in 14.16)
* PostgreSQL 13 (Fixed in 13.19)

The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL handles invalid UTF-8 characters, thus opening the door to a scenario where an attacker could exploit an SQL injection by making use of a [shortcut command "\!"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMAND-EXCLAMATION-MARK), which enables shell command execution.

"An attacker can leverage CVE-2025-1094 to perform this meta-command, thus controlling the operating system shell command that is executed," Fewer said. "Alternatively, an attacker who can generate a SQL injection via CVE-2025-1094 can execute arbitrary attacker-controlled SQL statements."

The development comes as the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/13/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog) a security flaw impacting SimpleHelp remote support software ([CVE-2024-57727](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/hackers-exploit-simplehelp-rmm-flaws.html), CVSS score: 7.5) to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by March 6, 2025.
