# Chlonium

Chlonium is an application designed for cloning Chromium Cookies.

From Chromium 80 and upwards, cookies are encrypted using AES-256 GCM, with a state key which is stored in the Local State file. This state key is encrypted using DPAPI. This is a change from older versions, which used DPAPI to encrypt each cookie item in the cookie database. What this means is that if you have the state key, you will always be able to decrypt the cookie database offline, without needing continual access to DPAPI keys.

This essentially makes cookie databases "portable", meaning they can be moved from machine to machine, provided you have dumped the state key. The cookies themselves need to be re-encrypted when they are imported, because the state keys will differ on each user profile & machine. This can be done using the same process as decryption, by first decrypti...
