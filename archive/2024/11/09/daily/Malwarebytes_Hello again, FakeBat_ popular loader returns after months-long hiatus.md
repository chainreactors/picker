# Hello again, FakeBat: popular loader returns after months-long hiatus

Posted: November 8, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

The web browser, and search engines in particular, continue to be a popular entry point to deliver [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) to users. While we noted a decrease in loaders distributed via [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) for the past 3 months, today’s example is a reminder that threat actors can quickly switch back to tried and tested methods.

After months of absence, Fakebat (AKA Eugenloader, PaykLoader) showed up on our radar again via a malicious Google ad for the productivity application Notion. FakeBat is a unique loader that has been used to drop follow-up payloads such as Lumma stealer.

In this blog post, we detail how criminals are targeting their victims and what final malware payload they are delivering post initial infection. The incident was found and reported to Google on the same day as this publication.

## Google Ads distribution

Last time we saw FakeBat was on July 25 2024, via a malicious ad for Calendly, a popular online scheduling application. In that instance, FakeBat’s command and control infrastructure ran from *utd-gochisu[.]com*.

Fast forward to November 8, 2024, and we have an ad appearing at the top of a Google search for ‘notion’. That sponsored result looks entirely authentic, with an official logo and website. We already know that criminals are able to impersonate any brand of their liking by simply using a click tracker — or tracking template — in order to bypass detection.

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_00e479.png?w=859)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_00e479.png)

According to Google’s Ads Transparency Center , the Notion ad was shown in the following geographic locations:

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_b7f9c2.png)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/image_b7f9c2.png)

Below is the network traffic from the ad URL to the payload. We can see the use of the tracking template (*smart.link*), followed by a cloaking domain (*solomonegbe[.]com*), before landing on the decoy site (*notion[.]ramchhaya.com*):

Why does this work and bypasses Google? Likely because if the user is not an intended victim, the tracking template would redirect them to the legitimate *notion.so* website.

## FakeBat drops LummaC2 stealer

After extracting the payload, we recognize the classic first stage FakeBat PowerShell:

Security researcher and long time FakeBat enthusiast [RussianPanda](https://russianpanda.com/) was kind enough to give us a hand by looking at this installer in closer detail.

After some fingerprinting to avoid sandboxes, we get this second stage PowerShell:

Of note, the threat actors are still using the same old RastaMouse AMSI bypass script from April 2024:
