Let’s be honest – nobody wants antivirus software that slows down their computer. You know the feeling: you install security software to protect yourself, but suddenly your laptop takes forever to start up, programs freeze, and you’re constantly waiting for things to load.

Well, we have some great news. A recent independent study by [PassMark Software](https://www.passmark.com/?srsltid=AfmBOor87isJvX7hfVNqNjNmxRC2nP4ukb0BDFuQI2pCazrsEdL59OKN) just proved what we’ve been saying all along: **Webroot Essentials gives you top-notch protection without the performance headaches**.

## We actually came out on top

PassMark tested nine popular antivirus programs (including big names like McAfee, Norton, and Microsoft Defender) to see which one performs best on Windows 11. Webroot Essentials scored the highest overall – but here’s what really matters to you as a user.

## The numbers that matter to your daily life

Instead of boring you with technical jargon, let’s talk about what these test results mean for your everyday computer use:

**Getting set up**

* Webroot installs 6.7 times faster than other antivirus programs
* Translation: You’ll be protected in under a minute, not sitting around waiting

**Using your computer**

* Our software opens 3 times faster when you need to check something
* Your computer stays snappy and responsive, just like it should

**Your hard drive space**

* Webroot takes up 33 times less space than the average competitor
* More room for your photos, music, and the stuff you actually care about

**Your computer’s memory**

* We use 5 times less memory when just running in the background
* Even during scans, we use 3.5 times less memory than others
* Your other programs won’t slow down or crash

**Security scans**

* Full system scans happen 6 times faster
* No more hour-long scans that make your computer unusable

## What this really means for you

Think about your typical day with your computer. Maybe you’re checking email, browsing the web, working on documents, or video chatting with family. You want protection running quietly in the background – not something that makes you want to throw your laptop out the window.

With Webroot Essentials, you get that peace of mind without any of the frustration. Your computer starts up fast, programs load quickly, and you’ve got plenty of storage space left for your files.

## Details of the study

PassMark Software ran this independent test in June 2025, putting nine antivirus products through 15 different performance tests. Every product was tested exactly the same way on fresh Windows 11 computers with default settings – so it was a fair comparison across the board.

## The bottom line

Here’s the thing: you shouldn’t have to choose between staying safe online and having a computer that actually works well. Webroot Essentials proves you can have both.

If you’re tired of antivirus software that feels like it’s working against you instead of for you, it might be time to make the switch. Your computer – and your patience – will thank you.
