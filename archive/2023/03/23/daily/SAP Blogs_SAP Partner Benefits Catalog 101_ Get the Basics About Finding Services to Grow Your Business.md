SAP offers partners a wide range of benefits at the global, regional, and market unit level, and the Partner Benefits Catalog is designed to help you easily find the SAP services relevant to your business. The catalog provides high-value sales, enablement, and marketing services via an all-in-one digital platform that saves you time and helps you ensure you aren’t missing any opportunities.

The catalog gives you direct access to benefits that are a part of the SAP PartnerEdge program. It also lists services that are available using market development funds (MDF) or business development funds (BDF). You can also purchase other premium fee-based services that will help you grow your business or upskill your staff.

With all partner benefits accessible from one easy-to-use platform, you have on-demand access to opportunities to expand your team’s capabilities and competencies. You’ll find services that help your business stay current with market trends and drive innovation. And if you’ve explored the catalog in the past, look again. SAP is continually updating its services and functionality on the Partner Benefits Catalog to make user experiences easier and more efficient.

**Key SAP Partner Benefits Catalog Features**

SAP has designed the catalog to help you find the services specific to your business. Services are tailored to your partner type and geographic location, and you can also apply filters to help you narrow your search and quickly find the services you need. For example, you can sort by category, solution focus, or eligibility to use MDF or BDF.

The catalog provides you with results that meet the criteria you’re searching for and a detailed description, including the service’s benefits and features, delivery method, and languages. You’ll also find ratings and reviews from partners to help you spend MDF, BDF, and your investments wisely. Additionally, when you consume services, you can use the catalog platform to leave ratings and reviews to help SAP continually improve partner services.

You can check out what services are trending on the homepage, create a “wish list” to save services you are interested in, and review your order history at any time.

**What’s New?**

The Partner Benefits Catalog recently launched two new features that will make taking advantage of services even easier.

* **MDF and BDF DirectPay**

Filter for services with the funds eligibility option: ‘MDF or BDF Direct Pay’. This feature eliminates the need for you to submit requests and claims for funds. Instead, funds are deducted directly from your MDF or BDF balances, making the process quicker and easier.

* **Check-Out Live**

SAP has optimized the checkout experience by including recommended services that may be helpful based on the services in your shopping cart. Those suggestions intelligently complement current services or offer logical next steps to enable you to continue to build competency and boost business growth.

**How Will The Partner Benefits Catalog Help You Grow Your Business This Year?**

There is a full suite of services available to you – regardless of the stage of your partnership journey, line of business, or solution focus. These services will keep you up to date on market trends while helping you nurture and boost your partnership skills and capabilities.
