As a website owner (and frequent website visitor), you might have encountered the notorious **ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR** at least once. This Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) error occurs when a browser fails to establish a secure connection with the website, usually due to issues with the website’s SSL certificate or its configuration or the client’s browser. The error varies and appears differently in popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.

Although the main reason behind the error *can* be difficult to identify, there are simple ways to fix it. In this article, I’ll discuss the causes of ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR, provide detailed steps on how to fix it for your website, and explore how this error appears differently on various browsers.

So, let’s dive in and learn how to tackle this common (yet frustrating) error.

  6. [Check for DNS issues](#step6)

## What is ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR?

The ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR is a common error that occurs when there is an issue with the SSL/TLS connection between a website and a user’s browser. This error typically occurs when the browser cannot establish a secure connection that is supported by the browser, or there is a mismatch between the browser and server settings. It can also appear when there is a misconfiguration of the website’s SSL certificate or when the browser fails to connect to an SSL-protected website.

Let’s take a look at a few examples of this error in some modern web browsers.

#### Example of SSL error in Chrome browser:

While ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR varies from browser to browser, it appears like this in Chrome:

#### Example of SSL error in FireFox browser:

In Firefox, when the browser encounters ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR it typically displays the following page. You’ll need to click on **Advanced** and then click on **View Certificate** to view more information about the problem.

## What causes ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR?

The ERR\_SSL\_PROTOCOL\_ERROR error usually appears when there’s an issue with the SSL certificate or the HTTPS protocol, which is essential for establishing a secure connection between a website and a user’s browser. Below are the top eight most common reasons for this error to occur.

1. **Recent changes in hosting, CDN, or SSL certificates:** If you’ve recently changed your web host, enabled a CDN or WAF like the Sucuri Firewall, or installed a new SSL certificate, this could be the primary cause of the error. Double-check your SSL installation and ensure proper server configuration.
2. **Missing name on the certificate:** While a certificate can be valid without the website name in the subject, it must be included in the SAN (Subject Alternative Name), domain.com does not equal www.domain.com, and the wildcard certificate \*.domain.com must also domain.com in the SAN for domain.com to work properly.
3. **Expired or missing SSL cer...
