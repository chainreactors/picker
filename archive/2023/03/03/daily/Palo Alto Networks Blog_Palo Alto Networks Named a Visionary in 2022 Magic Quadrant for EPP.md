[Gartner Magic Quadrant](/blog/tag/gartner-magic-quadrant/)

Palo Alto Networks is honored to be recognized by Gartner® as a Visionary in the 2022 Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP). We are pleased to have been placed at the furthest right for completeness of vision within the quadrant. This reflects our commitment to understanding the needs of the endpoint security market and our ability to innovate in response to the complex challenges our customers face.

We want to thank the thousands of customers who have trusted Palo Alto Networks as their cybersecurity partner of choice and have chosen [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) to protect their endpoints and digital way of life. We value your feedback as it helps us provide uncompromising endpoint security with the comprehensive extended detection and response capabilities you continue to request.

### An Ounce of Prevention

As Benjamin Franklin wisely advised, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” We believe the same holds true in security. As many security teams are overwhelmed with responding to “detections,” many vendors have focused their attention on automated remediation.

We continue to take a prevention-first approach as it takes much less effort to prevent a fire than to put one out. Our focus is on leveraging advanced machine learning in conjunction with our Unit 42 threat research to block malicious execution chains before they impact the business.

This begins by changing how we think about security data – the lifeblood of detection. Cortex XDR continually collects the right data to fuel AI-driven threat detection, which prevents attacks in real-time. While endpoint data is critical to this process, we believe additional data sources can provide the context and clues needed to distinguish between suspicious and normal behavior. In short, *data makes the difference*.

This strategy serves as the foundation for our comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR). Cortex XDR provides unparalleled visibility into endpoint activity to help ensure that sophisticated attacks do not go undetected. This gives investigators confidence that malicious activity is fully remediated. Our single agent fully equips incident responders with a complete forensic toolkit alongside our rich, interactive Live Terminal and scalable parallel script execution engine.

Gartner has ranked Palo Alto Networks 4th among all 18 vendors for Type A and Type B Use Cases and 5th for Type C Use Cases in their 2022 Gartner Critical Capabilities for EPP report.

As an essential companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant, this methodology provides deeper insight into providers’ product and service offerings by extending the Magic Quadrant analysis. Review the Critical Capabilities and the companion Magic Quadrant note together to gain a holistic view of the vendors in a market and the positioning of providers’ product and service offerings. You can easily compare product and service offerings against a set of critical differentiators to support your strategic decisions.

### Beyond the Endpoint

What sets Cortex XDR apart is our combination of endpoint, network, cloud and many other data sources. While many endpoint security vendors are trying to position themselves as XDR solutions and partnering with other vendors to incorporate non-endpoint data, Cortex is already years ahead in AI in the form of advanced analytics on many key data sources for threat detection.

Beyond the endpoint security capabilities evaluated by Gartner in the EPP Critical Capabilities report, Cortex and the broader Palo Alto Networks security offerings provide solutions for the majority of the technologies identified in the most recent Hype Cycle™ reports for both Security Operations and, more specifically, Endpoint Security.

We are proud to be named a Visionary. To learn more on how the industry’s most forward-thinking analyst firms recognize Cortex XDR, visit our [Results Matter page](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr-industry-validation?utm_source=panw&utm_medium=blog).
