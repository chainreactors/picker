# The one and only password tip you need

Posted: May 4, 2023
 by [Mark Stockley](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mstockley)

OK, it’s time for me to keep a promise.

Back in October 2022, I wrote an article called [Why (almost) everything we told you about passwords was wrong](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/10/why-almost-everything-we-told-you-about-passwords-was-wrong). The article summarizes how a lot of what you’ve been told about passwords over the years was either wrong (change your passwords as often as your underwear), misguided (choose long, complicated passwords), or counterproductive (don’t reuse passwords).

Most damningly of all, the vast effort involved in dispensing this advice over decades has generated little discernible improvement in people’s password choices. If it hasn’t quite been a wasted effort, it has certainly represented a galactically inefficient use of resources.

We know that this advice isn’t what it’s cracked up to be thanks to intrepid researchers, such as the folks Microsoft Research, who made it their business to discover what actually makes a difference to password security in the real world, and what doesn’t.

If you want the full, three-course meal version of why all the password advice you’ve been told stacks up to much less than the sum of its parts you can read the original article. Here’s the snack version:

How strong, long, and complicated your password is almost never matters in the real world. The most common type of password attack is credential stuffing, which uses passwords stolen in [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach). It works because it’s so common for people to reuse the same password in two places and it is completely unaffected by password strength. The next most common attack is password spraying, where criminals use short lists of very simple passwords on as many computers as possible. In both situations a laughably simple but unique password is good enough to defeat the attack.

There are rare types of attack—offline password guessing—where a strong password might help, but the trade-off is that strong passwords are far harder for people to remember, which leads them to use the same password for everything, which makes them much more vulnerable to credential stuffing. Notebooks are a really good, simple solution to the password reuse problem, but for years people were ridiculed for using them. [Password managers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) are also a good solution but they are much harder to use than notebooks and a majority of people [don’t use them, and don’t trust them](https://www.passwordmanager.com/password-manager-trust-survey/), despite years of positive press and advocacy.

OK, back to the promise I mentioned.

As somebody who has done his fair share of dispensing this kind of advice, I ended my *Why (almost) everything we told you about passwords was wrong* article with a mea culpa in the form of a promise. Never again would I dish out laundry lists of things you should do to your password. I would instead focus my energy on getting you to do one thing that really can transform your password security, which is using two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)):
