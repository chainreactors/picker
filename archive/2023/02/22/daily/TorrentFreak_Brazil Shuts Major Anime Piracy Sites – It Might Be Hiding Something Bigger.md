# Brazil Shuts Major Anime Piracy Sites – It Might Be Hiding Something Bigger

Brazil's Ministry of Justice says that an operation to protect Japanese anime content has shut down two of the largest anime piracy sites in the country. The names of the sites appear to be a secret, so inevitably that makes them much more interesting. What we found may be bigger than naming two sites. More sites are also offline - big ones too.

[![brazil operation anime](https://torrentfreak.com/images/brazil-anime-shut-s.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/brazil-anime-shut-s.png)‘Operation 404’ is an ongoing law enforcement initiative in Brazil that aims to disrupt the availability of pirated content online.

Operation 404 took on [pirate IPTV services](https://torrentfreak.com/new-phase-of-operation-404-targets-pirate-iptv-streaming-sites-220422/) in 2022, but earlier waves have targeted everything from [regular websites](https://torrentfreak.com/brazils-anti-piracy-operation-404-leads-to-arrests-shutdowns-and-site-blocking-210712/) to [popular Android apps](https://torrentfreak.com/huge-anti-piracy-operation-in-brazil-targets-hundreds-of-websites-apps-191104/).

According to a government announcement, authorities have just shut down “the two biggest digital anime pirate sites” in Brazil as part of Operation 404 offshoot, ‘Operation Anime’.

## Operation Anime

Information provided by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security states that Operation Anime was led by the Minas Gerais State Civil Police. The objective was to “repress crimes committed against intellectual property” on the internet, specifically piracy of Japanese cartoons, better known as anime.

“The action is part of a mobilization coordinated by the National Secretariat for Public Security, of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security (Senasp/MJSP), through the Cybernetic Operations Laboratory,” the announcement adds.

The Laboratório de Operações Cibernéticas, as it’s known in Brazil, is more closely associated with the mitigation of cyberattacks than it is piracy. However, since many crimes can have an online component, [preventing](https://www.gov.br/mj/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/ministerio-da-justica-e-seguranca-publica-ajuda-policia-civil-do-rio-de-janeiro-a-localizar-suspeito-de-planejar-ataque-contra-escola-1) serious crime and tracking down offenders is also part of the unit’s remit.

## “Two Biggest Digital Anime Piracy Sites Taken Down”

The Ministry of Justice notes that the operation received support from the Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA), an anti-piracy group that helps to protect anime content in Japan and overseas.

The statement indicates a significant operation; search and seizure warrants, blocking and/or suspension of websites, action against content in search engines, and the removal of profiles and pages on social networks.

“During the execution of the warrants, the objective is to seize computer equipment, including: internal HDs, computer devices, which demonstrate the materiality of the crime. The two biggest anime digital piracy sites have been taken down,” the government department adds.

Having supplied an abundance of information relating to who did what, where, and why, the names of the sites claimed to have been shut down are never mentioned, despite being the most important part of the story.

## Report on Brazilian TV

The TV report embedded below doesn’t name the sites either but does reveal some details of the operation. Speaking in Portuguese, a police officer says that a target was identified in Arapiraca, the second-largest city in the Alagoas region.

An unnamed 22-year-old computing student is suspected of running a large anime piracy site.

The officer explains that running a piracy site could lead to four years in prison, “and with this regulation here in Alagoas, this young man must be indicted for the crime of piracy.”

## Was BetterAnime Targeted?

When Brazilian authorities report Operation 404 successes, they rarely mention specific dates for individual actions. Indeed, there is some evidence to show that sites or applications may have been taken down or blocked over longer periods, weeks or even months.

Given the timing, some believe that BetterAnime.net was taken down as part of Operation Anime. The site enjoyed around six million visits each month, with users mostly complimentary regarding its speed and content selection.

A tweet published on the site’s official Twitter account yesterday confirms the closure of BetterAnime but says it had nothing to do with the government’s announcement.

“[F]or crying out loud. I wasn’t arrested,” the [tweet](https://twitter.com/BetteranimeO/status/1627586415692242945/) insists.

“It happened to be at the same time. I received a DMCA notice with a ‘request’ to shut down the site. If you don’t comply, the thing could lead to court, etc.”

A message on the now-shuttered site adds the following: “For copyright reasons, the BetterAnime website has been closed down. It was a good journey and full of learning, but the time has come to close the project. Thank you to everyone who has supported us during this time.”

Case solved? Probably not.

## Other Sites Targeted Recently?

With around five million visits each month and 95% of its traffic originating from Brazil, Animes-Vision has a similar profile to BetterAnime. Or rather it did, until recently.

A notice on the site [confirms](https://animes.vision/aviso) that its operators decided to close the platform down “for major and copyright reasons.”

[![anime-vision](https://torrentfreak.com/images/anime-vision.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/anime-vision.png)

There’s no direct information to confirm any arrests, but in any case, five million visits per month wouldn’t be anywhere near enough to claim the number one or even number two slots taken by the largest anime piracy sites in Brazil.

The recent shutdown of [Anbient.com](https://www.anbient.com/) provides few additional clues. With over 60% of its traffic hailing from Brazil but with around 100,000 visits per month, the site simply wasn’t big enough to match the profile mentioned by the authorities.

[![anbient](https://torrentfreak.com/images/anbient.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/anbient.png)

The shutdown notice displayed on the former anime platform (above) is mostly generic, but in sticky situations, that’s often the case. Especially so when compliance with a cease-and-desist notice offers a much simpler way out.

## Two Serious Contenders

Since anime-online.site is completely offline, there’s obviously no notice to report here. The site appears to have been popular in Brazil but with just a few hundred thousand vi...
