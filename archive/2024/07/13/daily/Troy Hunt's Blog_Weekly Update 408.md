# Weekly Update 408

12 July 2024

I get the frustration and anger those working at organisations that have been breached feel, and I've seen it firsthand in my communications with them on *so* many prior occasions. They're the victim of a criminal act and they're rightly outraged. However... thinking back to similar examples to The Heritage Foundation situation this week, I can't think of a single case where losing your mind and becoming abusive has ever worked out well. In fact, it usually just has the effect of losing the victim sympathy whilst an engrossed audience watches a slow-motion trainwreck get worse and worse. That it came from a spokesperson at an organisation that prides itself on religious righteousness makes the whole situation all the more perplexing. Perplexing, but admittedly, entertaining to watch.
