## Get Tails 6.19

### To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

* Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 6.0 or later to 6.19.
* If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an automatic upgrade, please try to do a [manual upgrade](https://tails.net/doc/upgrade/#manual).

### To install Tails 6.19 on a new USB stick

Follow our installation instructions:

* [Install from Windows](https://tails.net/install/windows/)
* [Install from macOS](https://tails.net/install/mac/)
* [Install from Linux](https://tails.net/install/linux/)
* [Install from Debian or Ubuntu using the command line and GnuPG](https://tails.net/install/expert/)

The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if you install instead of
upgrading.

### To download only

If you don't need installation or upgrade instructions, you can download Tails
6.19 directly:

* [For USB sticks (USB image)](https://tails.net/install/download/)
* [For DVDs and virtual machines (ISO image)](https://tails.net/install/download-iso/)
