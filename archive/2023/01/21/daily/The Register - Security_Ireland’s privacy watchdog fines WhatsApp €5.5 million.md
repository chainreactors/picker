Ireland's data protection authority has fined WhatsApp Ireland €5.5 million for breaches of the GDPR relating to its service and told it comply with data processing laws within six months.

Why Ireland? The Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) is the head regulator for several of the US tech giants, and this is because they have sited their operations in the European Union member state – with its Silicon Valley friendly 12.5 percent corporate tax rate.

Yesterday's ruling followed a 2018 complaint made by a German citizen about WhatsApp after it asked users to click "agree and continue" to indicate their acceptance of the updated Terms of Service in advance of 25 May 2018, when the GDPR came into operation.
