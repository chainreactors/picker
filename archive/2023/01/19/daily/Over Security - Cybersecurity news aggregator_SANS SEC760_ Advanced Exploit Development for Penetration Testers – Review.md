**Reading Time:**   13 minutes

In July 2022, I took the SANS SEC 760 class in Berlin. I always promised myself and some close friends to write a review, but I didn’t have the time until the Christmas break.

This blog post aims to be a day-by-day review of the SANS SEC760 course content and its CTF, NetWars tournament and on-demand package.

## SANS SEC760

Looking at SANS’s [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20230116202527/https%3A/www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/advanced-exploit-development-penetration-testers/), SEC 760 should teach skills required to reverse-engineer applications in order to find vulnerabilities, perform fuzzing and write complex exploits against targets such as the Windows Kernel and the modern Linux Heap, all while circumventing cutting-edge exploit mitigations.

Unfortunately, sometimes between premises and delivery, there’s a huge discrepancy.

### Day 1 – Exploit Mitigations and Reversing with IDA

* **Exploit mitigations**
* **Windows Defender Exploit Guard**

These sections were explained at an encyclopaedic and theoretical level only. These sections contained all public and easily gatherable information found on the web with a simple search. The mitigations were not contextualised, and most of the time bypasses options consisted of only 1/2 phrases. No added value more than having a single organised source containing an introductory “Wikipedia”-style paragraph of those mitigations. On top of that, these two sections took the entire morning: boring!

* **Windows Kernel Mitigations**

This section does not fit at all on this day, both from context and time perspective. It should be moved to day 5, even if just as a reference (without the instructor explaining it).

* **Introduction to IDA Pro**
* **Debugging with IDA Pro**

Why on earth are these topics on SEC760!? These sections are nothing more than a showcase of well-known and pretty basic IDA features (e.g., proximity view, dark mode theme… really!?). Among 760s listed prerequisites, there’s the following phrase: “Experience with reverse-engineering vulnerable code is also required, as is the ability to read x86/x64 disassembly from within a debugger or disassembler.”; basic IDA knowledge should be listed among those prerequisites. It is supposed to be an advanced course, after all.

* **FLIRT & FLAIR**

That’s a good topic that I’ve enjoyed, especially since the documentation about these two tools is scarce. It also contained an excellent exercise to “solidify” the newly acquired knowledge.

* **Scripting with IDAPython**

That’s probably the only real “meat” of the first day. Unfortunately, the content is too little (~30/274 pages). This section should be significantly extended with more IDA’s API documentation and usage. It should at least explain how to set up a proper IDA scripting debugging environment; using the notepad/IDA command line to test if a single line of code works before glueing all the pieces together is definitely not enough and a bit on the “cheap” side for a paid training course.

Some exercises, like “display\_tool”, are way too basic, and they should not be in SEC760 but instead put in SEC660. The included solution for some of the exercises didn’t work.

**Day 1 content score: 1/5**

### Day 2 – Linux Application Exploitation

* **Linux heap management, constructs, and environment**
* **Navigating the heap**
* **Abusing macros such as unlink() and frontline()**
* **Function pointer overwrites**
* **Off by One bugs**
* **TCache Poisoning**

All the above sections, heap-related content, and exercises were excellent, well-explained, and documented. Keep in mind that I’m a Windows guy, and I was able to follow through the content without any problem. These sections contained valuable information with some actionable exerci...
