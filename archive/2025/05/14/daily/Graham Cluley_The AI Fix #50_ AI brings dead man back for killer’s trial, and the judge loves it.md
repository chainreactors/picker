In episode 50 of The AI Fix, AI brings a slain man back from the dead so he can appear at his killer‚Äôs trial, Mark gets a mysterious phone call, Trump uses AI to become Pope Donald the First, Zuck ponders the nature of friendship, Apple says the quiet part out loud, xAI springs a leak, and a philosophy professor says ‚Äúso long weather forecasters!‚Äù

Graham explains why researchers in Oxford have made a digital twin of your grandmother, and Mark looks at the bizarre case of road rage victim Chris Pelkey.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
