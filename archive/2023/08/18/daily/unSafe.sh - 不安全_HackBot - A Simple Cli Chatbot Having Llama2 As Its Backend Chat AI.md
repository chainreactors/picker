## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you proceed with the installation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* Python (3.6 or later)
* `pip` package manager
* `Visual studio Code` - Follow the steps in this link [llama-cpp-prereq-install-instructions](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python "llama-cpp-prereq-install-instructions")
* `cmake`

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/morpheuslord/hackbot.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download the AI Model

The first time you run HackBot, it will check for the AI model required for the chatbot. If the model is not present, it will be automatically downloaded and saved as "llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4\_0.bin" in the project directory.

## Usage

To start a conversation with HackBot, run the following command:

HackBot will display a banner and wait for your input. You can ask cybersecurity-related questions, and HackBot will respond with informative answers. To exit the chat, simply type "quit\_bot" in the input prompt.

Here are some additional commands you can use:

* `clear_screen`: Clears the console screen for better readability.
* `quit_bot`: This is used to quit the chat application
* `bot_banner`: Prints the default bots banner.
* `contact_dev`: Provides my contact information.
* `save_chat`: Saves the current sessions interactions.
* `vuln_analysis`: Does a Vuln analysis using the scan data or log file.
* `static_code_analysis`: Does a Static code analysis using the scan data or log file.

**Note:** I am working on more addons and more such commands to give a more chatGPT experience

**Please Note:** HackBot's responses are based on the Meta-LLama2 AI model, and its accuracy depends on the quality of the queries and data provided to it.

I am also working on AI training by which I can teach it how to be more accurately tuned to work for hackers on a much more professional level.
