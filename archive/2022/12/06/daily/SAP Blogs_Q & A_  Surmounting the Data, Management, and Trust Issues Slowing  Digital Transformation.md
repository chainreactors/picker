**Dr. Thomas C. Redman, “the Data Doc,”** President of Data Quality Solutions, helps start-ups and multinationals; senior executives, Chief Data Officers, and leaders chart their courses to data-driven futures, with special emphasis on quality and analytics. To learn more, check out [www.dataqualitysolutions.com](http://www.dataqualitysolutions.com/)

**SAP**:  Most technology and business leaders are aware of the hype surrounding digital transformation.  They know the potential seems enormous but also know that the failure rate of digital transformation programs is very high.  Recently, Tom Redman published an important and interesting article titled, [“The Data, Management, and Trust Issues That Slow Digital Transformation”](https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/10/1090477e-4d7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) in which he described the factors that contribute to these failures.

We caught up with Tom to follow up, with an eye to understanding what leaders and companies should do about this.  Tom, first question.  Your article went into depth on several really important topics.  Can you sum it up for our readers more simply?

**Tom Redman (TCR):** I put the issues raised in the “tough, but surmountable” category.  By that I mean that companies could resolve them if they really wanted to. But most have not, which is why the failure rate is so high.  So, there is something deeper going on.  While all companies are different, I see three inter-related factors:  Shared vision, urgency, and courage.

Let’s start with courage.   Let’s face it.  Any change is hard.  Without sufficient courage, up and down the organization chart, it just isn’t going to happen.

Next, shared vision. People are right to ask, “I get that why you’re excited about this technology, but how is it going to affect me, my job or my customers?”  Unless you can get large numbers of people to buy in to your answer, it just isn’t going to happen.

Finally, urgency.  People are busy.  Unless there is something—a dogged competitor nipping at your heels, the promise of big raises, an existential threat—the effort won’t get the attention it requires.  Without real urgency, change just isn’t going to happen.

So ultimately, digital transformation is about people:  People who have the courage to try something new, the patience to build buy-in, and the business acumen to get the effort on people’s top-three list.

**SAP:**  How do you really measure the value of your digital transformation?

**TCR:**  There is an interesting paradox here.  Peter Drucker famously said, “You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”  It pushes one to want to put a dollar figure on digital transformation.

In contrast, W. Edwards Deming observed, “The most important things are unmeasured and unmeasurable.”  You can’t put a price tag on love, commitment to the organization, and lots of other things that really matter.

Now I personally have the utmost respect for both Deming and Drucker.  Thus, in evaluating digital transformation, it is important to apply the two in equal measure.    Let me give one example.  I was part of a team that transformed a financial assurance process at a large telecom.  The measured benefits, which came from a combination of better data and staff reductions, were over $100M per year.  Still, the head of the Division that benefited observed, “Don’t get me wrong—I really do appreciate the $100M.  But this means I can manage the business and that is worth way more.”

I want to build on this theme because it is so important.  We should look at technology through two lenses.  First, “*doing more with less*.”  Scaling up and driving unit costs down.   Probably everyone’s all-time favorite information technology is the printing press:  Number of books up, costs per book down.  Same with the loom and automated switching of telephone calls.  Capacity up, unit cost down.  I see the same pattern with all successful technologies.  Think spreadsheets and back office systems.  So far, this pattern is holding up with artificial intelligence and blockchain, though it may be too early to know definitively.  Companies should always evaluate new technologies, and track progress, through this *do more with less* lens.

The second lens is “*transformation*.”  It’s important because merely automating something is not. in and of itself, transformational.  Automating a customer help desk is a good example.  Scale goes up and unit cost goes down, but most would agree that this is not transformational.

Transformation is about people—how they think, feel, do their work and interact with one another.  The printing press and the loom changed all of these things.  When transformation is successful, the excitement is palpable.  You hear things like, “We’ve seen in.  We get it.  We’re doing it.  And let me tell you this—we’re n...
