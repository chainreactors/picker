Well done, ANY.RUN: Our Top Cybersecurity Awards in 2024

It’s December, and it’s high time to tell Santa how good girls and boys we’ve been at [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=2024_awards&utm_term=191224&utm_content=linktolanding). It’s time to reap acknowledgment from the industry, the community, and the customers. Here are the major tech awards we’ve received in 2024 as cybersecurity experts.

## Cybersecurity Excellence Awards from Cybersecurity Insiders

We [nailed it in the Threat Hunting category](https://cybersecurity-excellence-awards.com/candidates/any-run-2024/). And we are proud: the award is well respected throughout the industry. Winners are selected by both community votes and judging panel evaluations. This ensures that recognition reflects real-world impact and peer validation.

Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders:

> *With over 600 entries across more than 300 categories, the awards are highly competitive. Your achievement reflects outstanding commitment to the core principles of excellence, innovation, and leadership in cybersecurity.*

## Best Security Solution from World Future Awards

The entire suite of ANY.RUN’s services, including the [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/), [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/), and [TI Feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/inside-cyber-threat-intelligence-feeds/), [was recognized as](https://worldfutureawards.com/winners/?y=2024&c=security&sb=&n=) the “Best Threat Intelligence & Interactive Malware Analysis Platform.

That’s what the FWA team thinks of us:

> *ANY.RUN’s innovative, user-friendly malware analysis platform excels in its impact, value, and timeliness, making it a standout in the cybersecurity industry. The platform’s high quality and emotional quotient ensure it meets the evolving challenges of its users effectively.*

## Top 150 Cybersecurity Vendors by IT-Harvest

We are in the list of [Top 150 cybersecurity vendors](https://cyber150.com/List/index.html). It is a well-respected global industry benchmark supported by IT-Harvest. It gathers top-tier vendors in cybersecurity — which is, by the way, a highly competitive and densely populated field.

ANY.RUN “*managed to make an outstanding contribution to the cybersecurity landscape*”, Richard Stiennon, Chief Research Analyst at IT-Harvest, says.

## Best in Behavior Analytics by CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards

We are grateful to be recognized for delivering [quality behavior analytics](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-analysis-report/), as it is among the key features of the ANY.RUN sandbox. It implies detailed analysis of network activity, and the processes malware agents initiate and engage in.
