The governments of the [United States](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1256) and the [United Kingdom](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-cracks-down-on-ransomware-actors) have levied sanctions against seven Russian nationals for their role in the Trickbot cybercrime gang.

Both countries said the sanctions are part of a coordinated crackdown against the ransomware ecosystem.

The **Trickbot gang**, also known as **Wizard Spider**, is primarily known for its eponymous Trickbot malware botnet. In the past, Trickbot has rented access to computers infected by its malware to the Ryuk cybercrime group, which deployed its ransomware on corporate or government networks. In addition, Trickbot also developed its own ransomware strains, known as Conti and Diavol, which they also deployed on systems that were previously infected by their botnet.

The UK government said that in the UK alone, 149 organizations paid at least £27 million following attacks with the Conti and Ryuk ransomware strains.

> "There were 104 UK victims of the Conti strain who paid approximately £10 million and 45 victims of the Ryuk strain who paid approximately £17 million."

Over the years, the Trickbot botnet has grown to become one of the largest malware operations to date, and the gang's sub-group tasked with carrying out ransomware attacks has become one of the most despised ransomware gangs today after repeatedly targeting medical and healthcare facilities and disrupting their operations—even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> "Members of the Trickbot Group publicly gloated over the ease of targeting the medical facilities and the speed with which the ransoms were paid to the group."

The US and UK sanctions announcements also include the first formal statement linking the Trickbot gang with the Russian government. Both the US and UK governments say that members of the Trickbot gang are also associated and maintain links to Russian intelligence services, "**from whom they have likely received tasking**."

With Trickbot's inclusion on the sanctioned entities list, US and UK companies are now forbidden from paying ransoms to the group, and financial entities are mandated to freeze any of the group's assets.

Sanctions have proven very successful against ransomware gangs in the past, with the sanctions imposed against EvilCorp in 2019 effectively destroying their ransomware operation (Bitpaymer, Hades, WastedLocker) and making the group and its members pariahs in the cybercrime underground.

The seven sanctioned Trickbot members are:

* **Vitaly Kovalev**was a senior figure within the Trickbot group. Vitaly Kovalev is also known by the online monikers "Bentley" and "Ben."
* **Maksim Mikhailov** has been involved in development activity for the Trickbot Group. Maksim Mikhailov is also known by the online moniker "Baget."
* **Valentin Karyagin** has been involved in the development of ransomware and other malware projects. Valentin Karyagin is also known by the online moniker "Globus."
* **Mikhail Iskritskiy** has worked on money laundering and fraud projects for the Trickbot group. Mikhail Iskritskiy is also known by the online moniker "Tropa."
* **Dmitry Pleshevskiy** worked on injecting malicious code into websites to steal victims' credentials. Dmitry Pleshevskiy is also known by the online moniker "Iseldor."
* **Ivan Vakhromeyev** has worked for the Trickbot group as a manager. Ivan Vakhromeyev is also known by the online moniker "Mushroom."
* **Valery Sedletski** has worked as an administrator for the Trickbot group, including managing servers. Valery Sedletski is also known by the online moniker "Strix."

The US Justice Department has also [charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/russian-national-charged-bank-fraud-related-hacking-campaign) Trickbot's Kovalev with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and eight counts of bank fraud in connection with a series of intrusions into victim bank accounts that occurred in 2009 and 2010 and predated his involvement in the Trickbot gang.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**MTU ransomware attack:** The Munster Technological University from Cork, Ireland, has been hit by a ransomware attack. The [incident](https://www.mtu.ie/news/major-it-breach-mtu-cork-campus-feb-2023/) has impacted the university's phone and IT systems and has forced officials to close down all of its four campuses and cancel classes for two days. Officials said university campuses in Kerry were unaffected. [*More in the [Irish Examiner](http://-41066297.html)*]

**Convex leak:** More than 120 GB of data have been [leaked](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Convex) from Russian internet provider Convex. According to DDoSecrets, the data exposes details about Russian internet and phone surveillance activities, including a previously unknown surveillance program named Green Atom. The hack has been claimed by a hacking collective known as CAXXII in an interview with the *[Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/11706)*.

**Indigo incident:** Indigo, Canada's last remaining national bookstore chain, [says](http://web.archive.org/web/20230209125056/https%3A//www.chapters.indigo.ca/) it suffered a cybersecurity incident. According to [local](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/indigo-cybersecurity-1.6742230) [media](https://globalnews.ca/news/9473548/indigo-cybersecurity-incident/), the incident knocked the company's website and order processing systems. The company says cash transactions at its stores are still possible.

### **General tech and privacy**

**NIST IoT crypto:** The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has [announced](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/nist-selects-lightweight-cryptography-algorithms-protect-small-devices) that a group of cryptographic algorithms called Ascon will become its [lightweight cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography) standard later in 2023. Once officially published, Ascon will become NIST's recommended cryptography algorithm for lightweight electronics and IoT devices. NIST says Ascon was selected to become its new standard following a five-year selection process that received 56 other submissions. [Ascon](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at/) was developed in 2014 by a team of cryptographers from Graz University of Technology, Infineon Technologies, Lamarr Security Research, and Radboud University, and currently consists of seven algorithms (*Ascon-128, Ascon-128a, Ascon-Xof, Ascon-Xofa, Ascon-Hash, Ascon-Hasha, and Ascon-80pq*).
