## Fines as a Security System

Tile has an [interesting security solution](https://www.engadget.com/tile-thinks-a-1-million-fine-will-deter-stalkers-from-using-its-trackers-181857358.html) to make its tracking tags harder to use for stalking:

> The Anti-Theft Mode feature will make the devices invisible to Scan and Secure, the company’s in-app feature that lets you know if any nearby Tiles are following you. But to activate the new Anti-Theft Mode, the Tile owner will have to verify their real identity with a government-issued ID, submit a biometric scan that helps root out fake IDs, agree to let Tile share their information with law enforcement and agree to be subject to a $1 million penalty if convicted in a court of law of using Tile for criminal activity. So although it technically makes the device easier for stalkers to use Tiles silently, it makes the penalty of doing so high enough to (at least in theory) deter them from trying.

Interesting theory. But it won’t work against attackers who don’t have any money.

> Hulls believes the approach is superior to Apple’s solution with AirTag, which emits a sound and notifies iPhone users that one of the trackers is following them.

My complaint about the technical solutions is that they only work for users of the system. Tile security requires an “in-app feature.” Apple’s AirTag “notifies iPhone users.” What we need is a common standard that is implemented on all smartphones, so that people who don’t use the trackers can be alerted if they are being surveilled by one of them.

My bigger problem is with the “conviction”. Domestic Abuse victims who face this kind of problem already can’t bring themselves (for entirely understandable reasons) to take their abusers to court for physical violence. They will not get their partners convicted for “leaving” a “stray” tile on someone.

As a lawyer in the UK, I’d like to see more detail on the conditions, but I very much wonder whether that “fine” would be enforceable under the UK law in penalty clauses in contracts. At the very least I’d regard it as questionable.

It places all the trust into a single company, and all of the employees that work there.

The user/customers have no say in how it operates, or any control over the devices. They just have to trust company in all matters.

Just say no to anything that requires blind trust in an external entity whose real motive is profit. They aren’t doing it to help you, no matter how much they claim that.

The liability with computers making such decision and making life more trouble for innocent people is they lack judgment and rely on code. To some degree AI is worse as it creates the illusion of intelligence but is not much more than an amalgam of data.

What if the “tracker” is going to same location, regularly?

For example, as a tourist you don’t follow the normal activities of the locals and can easily end up behaving suspiciously in the eyes of locals, never mind some computer code.

To the degree you depend on automation to that degree you are not using your own senses. I rely on situational awareness, which is far more valuable to me. Though not everyone seem to be able to pay attention to their environment. But I think it would be more enumerative to learn how.

All these issues we have with illegal activities is a systemic failure in raising children in a sane fashion where they win when being good decent people. If everyone could earn a fair living and food security was available to all crime would drop significantly.

Of course that is not about to change anytime soon, I’m just trying to go to basics and look from that viewpoint rather than dreaming up a new automated solution to every situations in life.

For example, in Rome there were no juvenile delinquency as they were able to start their lives at an early age. They could work and start a family of their own instead hanging out on street corners looking for something interesting to do. Of course society was very different and so on, but there’s something to be said to be able to create your life early on.

It looks like the CEO of Tile was adding his thoughts to a similar article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34836694). I guess it’s really him. In further comments he adds a link to a [blog post](https://chrishulls.medium.com/tile-is-taking-a-different-approach-to-the-bluetooth-industrys-theft-and-stalking-problems-bd92d3ae4f3c).

> Life360/Tile CEO. I came up with this idea, not our lawyers, as they would be the first to say it is unclear how enforceable this is. But what IS clear, is that based on our new TOS, and because this is opt-in, we definitely could take a flyer in court, and who knows?

> Do you want us to unleash millions of dollars of lawyers on you? I don’t think many people will want to find out. I genuinely believe this plus a ID scanning will be a huge deterrent. Stalkers will go buy $30 real time stealth GPS trackers on Amazon instead.

How about: Make it illegal to make/import/trade/sell such “tracking devices” unless they automatically and without exception send a standard response to a standard query over bluetooth or another wireless protocol on a smartphone. This could be written into law, and anyone could make an app or device that could send the standard query and receive the specified response to identify any such tracker nearby.

IEEE could write the appropriate documentation, and any dev could write apps for the smartphone to send and receive the traffic. That way you’re not depending on the goodwill of anyone: (1) ...
