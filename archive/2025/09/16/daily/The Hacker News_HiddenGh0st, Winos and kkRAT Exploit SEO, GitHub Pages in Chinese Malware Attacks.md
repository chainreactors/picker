[![Chinese Malware Attacks](data:image/png;base64... "Chinese Malware Attacks")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzbGmgmAfezVfsHRcj1E675YNpcBlohGcXIJgIqGjygaEyrRJdDI4pkhaBdLUCZZZxxDiVwEg2ROXi3FPlOwCUhXQTkblNVhidmUHWHiwwvdCPyQhTzETF7m_XMapjQ_YuIInod-UGyElUqsCDq5bz8xQqqwXUujHdYRVjphgj0ZIsdJzxUm_06r5VwOUS/s790-rw-e365/cyberattack-china.jpg)

Chinese-speaking users are the target of a search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning campaign that uses fake software sites to distribute malware.

"The attackers manipulated search rankings with SEO plugins and registered lookalike domains that closely mimicked legitimate software sites," Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Pei Han Liao [said](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/seo-poisoning-attack-targets-chinese-speaking-users-with-fake-software-sites). "By using convincing language and small character substitutions, they tricked victims into visiting spoofed pages and downloading malware."

The activity, which was discovered by the cybersecurity company in August 2025, leads to the deployment of malware families like HiddenGh0st and Winos (aka ValleyRAT), both of which are variants of a remote access trojan called Gh0st RAT.

It's worth noting that the use of [Winos](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/silver-fox-exploits-microsoft-signed.html) has been attributed to a cybercrime group known as [Silver Fox](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/2500-truesightsys-driver-variants.html), which is also tracked as SwimSnake, The Great Thief of Valley (or Valley Thief), UTG-Q-1000, and Void Arachne. It's believed to be active at least since 2022.

In the latest attack chain documented by Fortinet, users searching for tools like DeepL Translate, Google Chrome, Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp, and WPS Office on Google are redirected to bogus sites to trigger the delivery of the malware using trojanized installers.

"A script named nice.js controls the malware delivery process on these sites," Fortinet explained. "The script follows a multi-step chain: it first calls a download link that returns JSON data, which includes a secondary link. That secondary link then points to another JSON response containing a link that redirects to the final URL of the malicious installer."

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

Present within the installer is a malicious DLL ("EnumW.dll") that carries out several anti-analysis checks to sidestep detection, including extracting another DLL ("vstdlib.dll") to overwhelm analysis tools by inflating memory usage and slowing their performance.

The second DLL is also engineered to unpack and launch the main payload, but not before ascertaining the presence of 360 Total Security antivirus software on the compromised host. If present, the malware uses a technique called [TypeLib COM hijacking](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/ai-powered-gamma-used-to-host-microsoft.html) to set up persistence and ultimately launch a Windows executable ("insalivation.exe")

[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0y0wGNYG_tbWJGtMG530hbUWPfnPuODrQT0BH9o8qOWpycmSHMJIbp25eehlL39H6WxRrU6gvjO6GOtTXujgOsF6OqSaC92qNM56jzSgrkFFPnnSB-qI7UDQx4xKDvbMkccZ7HzwLSDDwzp9cd75WIY9mguvgJtII4ORvVS9k0U4K7FQ2lb6OS5VlqAf6/s2600/360tray.jpeg)

In the event the antivirus software is not installed on the host, persistence is achieved by creating a Windows shortcut that points to the same executable. The end goal of the infection is to sideload a DLL ("AIDE.dll") that initiates three core functions -

* Command-and-Control (C2), to establish communication with a remote server and exchange data in an encrypted format
* Heartbeat, to collect system and victim data and enumerate running processes against a hard-coded list of security products
* Monitor, to evaluate the victim's environment to confirm persistence, track user activity, and beacon to the C2 server

The C2 module also supports commands to download additional plugins, log keystrokes and clipboard data, and even hijack cryptocurrency wallets associated with Ethereum and Tether. Some of the identified plugins are capable of keeping tabs on the victim's screen and have been previously identified as part of the Winos framework.

"The installers contained both the legitimate application and the malicious payload, making it difficult for users to notice the infection," Fortinet said. "Even highly ranked search results were weaponized in this way, underscoring the importance of carefully inspecting domain names before downloading software."

### Chinese Speakers Targeted by Malware Trifecta, Including New kkRAT

The development comes as Zscaler ThreatLabz flagged a separate campaign, also targeting Chinese-speaking users, with a previously undocumented malware called kkRAT since early May 2025, along with Winos and [FatalRAT](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/fatalrat-phishing-attacks-target-apac.html).

kkRAT "shares code similarities with both Gh0st RAT and Big Bad Wolf (大灰狼), a RAT typically leveraged by China-based cybercriminals," Zscaler researcher Muhammed Irfan V A [said](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-kkrat).

"kkRAT employs a network communication protocol similar to Ghost RAT, with an added encryption layer after data compression. The RAT's features include clipboard manipulation to replace cryptocurrency addresses and the deployment of remote monitoring tools (i.e. Sunlogin, GotoHTTP)."

Like the aforementioned activity, the attack campaign uses fake installer pages mimicking popular software like DingTalk to deliver the three trojans. The phishing sites are hosted on GitHub pages, allowing the bad actors to abuse the trust associated with a legitimate platfor...
