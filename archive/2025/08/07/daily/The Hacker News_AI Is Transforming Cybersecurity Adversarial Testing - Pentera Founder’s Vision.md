## **When Technology Resets the Playing Field**

In 2015 I founded a cybersecurity testing software company with the belief that automated penetration testing was not only possible, but necessary. At the time, the idea was often met with skepticism, but today, with 1200+ of enterprise customers and thousands of users, that vision has proven itself. But I also know that what we've built so far is only the foundation of what comes next.

We are now witnessing an inflection point with AI in cybersecurity testing that is going to rewrite the rules of what's possible. You might not see the change in a month's time, but in five years the domain is going to be unrecognizable.

As the CTO of Pentera, I have a vision for the company: one where **any security threat scenario you can imagine, you can test** with the speed and intelligence only AI can provide. We have already started to implement the individual pieces of this reality into our platform. This article portrays the full vision I have for Pentera in years to come.

AI isn't just another optimization layer for red team tools or security dashboards. It represents a change across the entire lifecycle of adversarial testing. It changes how payloads are created, how tests are executed, and how findings are interpreted. It is redefining what our automated security validation platform can do. Like your cellphone's touchscreen revolution, AI will become the intuitive interface, the engine behind execution, and the translator that turns raw data into decisions.

At Pentera **AI is transforming every layer of adversarial testing.**

## **Vibe Red Teaming**

Picture this. You're a CISO responsible for protecting a hybrid environment: Active Directory on-prem, production apps in Azure, and a vibrant dev team working across containers and SaaS.

You've just learned that a contractor's credentials were [accidentally exposed in a GitHub repo](https://pentera.io/blog/git-repo-security-exposed-secrets/?utm_source=THN&source=THN&utm_medium=Article&medium=Article&utm_campaign=AriksAIVision&campaign=AriksAIVision). What you want to know isn't buried in a CVE database or a threat feed, you need to test if that specific access could lead to real damage.

So, you open Pentera and simply say:

*"Check if the credentials john.smith@company.io can be used to access the finance database in production."*

No scripts. No workflows. No playbooks.

In seconds, the platform understands your intent, scopes the environment, builds an attack plan, and emulates the adversary, safely and surgically. It doesn't stop there.

It adapts mid-test if your defenses react. It bypasses detection where possible, pauses when needed, and reevaluates the path based on live evidence.

And when it's done?

You get a summary tailored for you; not a dump of raw data. Executives receive a high-level risk briefing. Your SOC gets the logs and findings. Your cloud team gets a remediation path.

That's **Vibe Red Teaming**: where security validation becomes conversational, intelligent, and instantly actionable.

It gets better - picture this as well:

Imagine that from any security application or agent, for example your SOC you want to test for acceptance of your new Cloud environment. Alternatively imagine that your devops team would like to roll your new LLM application model into production.

Those management applications, soon to turn agentic, will call the Pentera Attack-testing API and execute those tests as part of their workflow, assuring that any and every action in your infrastructure is inherently secure as from its inception.

That's a **callable testing sub-agent**: where any security application and any script can call on security validation operations from within and verify the efficacy and correctness of security controls on the fly.

## **Transforming Every Layer of Adversarial Testing**

To bring this future to life, we're reimagining the adversarial testing lifecycle around intelligence, infusing AI into every layer of how pentesting and red-teaming exercises are imagined, executed, adapted, and understood. These pillars form the foundation of our vision for a smarter, more intuitive, more human form of security validation.

### **1. Agenting the Product: The End of Clicks, the Rise of Conversation**

In the future, you won't build tests in a template; you'll drive them in natural language. And as the test runs, you won't sit back and wait for results, you'll shape what happens next.

*"Launch an access attempt from the contractor-okta identity group. Check if any accounts in that group can access file shares on 10.10.22.0/24. If access is granted, escalate privileges and attempt credential extraction. If any domain admin credentials are captured, pivot toward prod-db-finance."*

And once the test is in motion, you keep steering:

"Pause lateral movement. Focus only on privilege escalation paths from Workstation-203."

"Re-run credential harvesting using memory scraping instead of LSASS injection."

"Drop all actions targeting dev subnets, this scenario is finance only."

This is **Vibe Red Teaming** in action:

No rigid workflows. No clicking through trees of options. No translation between human thought and test logic.

You define the scenario. You direct the flow. You adapt the path. The test becomes an extension of your intent, and your imagination as a tester. Instantly you have the power of red-teaming at your fingertips. Work is already underway to bring this experience to life, starting with...
