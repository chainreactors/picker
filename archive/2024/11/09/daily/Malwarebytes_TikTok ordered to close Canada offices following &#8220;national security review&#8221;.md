# TikTok ordered to close Canada offices following “national security review”

Posted: November 8, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The Government of Canada [ordered](https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2024/11/government-of-canada-orders-the-wind-up-of-tiktok-technology-canada-inc-following-a-national-security-review-under-the-investment-canada-act.html) the TikTok Technology Canada Inc. to close its offices in the country following a national security review.

This decision was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may be injurious to Canada’s national security. Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry stated:

“As a result of a multi-step national security review process, which involves rigorous scrutiny by Canada’s national security and intelligence community, the Government of Canada has ordered the wind up of the Canadian business carried on by TikTok Technology Canada, Inc. The government is taking action to address the specific national security risks related to ByteDance Ltd.’s operations in Canada through the establishment of TikTok Technology Canada, Inc. The decision was based on the information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada’s security and intelligence community and other government partners.”

This does not mean Canadians will no longer have access to the popular social media platform. It just means the Chinese owned company will have to close its Canadian operations located in Toronto and Vancouver.

Canada says the decision whether citizens want to use the social media platform is a personal choice but it does encourage Canadians to consult [the guidance](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/protect-how-you-connect) issued by Communications Security Establishment Canada’s Canadian Centre for Cyber Security to help them assess these risks.

One of the key points of their guidance is the “security over convenience” guideline, which says:

“It may be convenient to have an app always know your location or be able to fetch your photos without approval, but this isn’t the most secure option. Be aware of the features and elements of your device that can be accessed by an app, and make sure you limit permissions.”

Another one that is important in this case is the “consider where your data is being stored” guideline which reminds people to think about which nation’s laws will apply to your information and your activity on the platform.

TikTok [responded](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-ca/our-response-to-canadas-order-to-shut-down-tiktok-canada-ca) that:

> “Shutting down TikTok’s Canadian offices and destroying hundreds of well-paying local jobs is not in anyone’s best interest, and today’s shutdown order will do just that. We will challenge this order in court.”

TikTok’s Chinese ownership has brought problems in other countries, as well. In April 2024, Malwarebytes Labs [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/tiktok-comes-one-step-closer-to-a-us-ban) on how the US Senate approved a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the country unless Chinese owner ByteDance gives up its share of the immensely popular app. That law is [currently being challenged in court](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/16/g-s1-23194/tiktok-us-ban-appeals-court) by the popular social media platform.
