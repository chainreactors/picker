## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Brains

Researchers have new evidence of how [squid brains develop](https://neurosciencenews.com/cephalopod-brain-21817/):

> Researchers from the FAS Center for Systems Biology describe how they used a new live-imaging technique to watch neurons being created in the embryo in almost real-time. They were then able to track those cells through the development of the nervous system in the retina. What they saw surprised them.
>
> The neural stem cells they tracked behaved eerily similar to the way these cells behave in vertebrates during the development of their nervous system.
>
> It suggests that vertebrates and cephalopods, despite diverging from each other 500 million years ago, not only are using similar mechanisms to make their big brains but that this process and the way the cells act, divide, and are shaped may essentially layout the blueprint required develop this kind of nervous system.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ SpaceLifeForm,

Re : A hole after implosion?

I’ve been told that “this is interesting”,

<https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101891137/what-elon-musks-shakeup-of-twitter-means-for-the-bay-area>

However I’ve not got the playback to work (a deliberate “fault” with their CMS appears to be the reason).

@ Clive

re: KQED podcast

I am listening. It is from 2022-11-02, so eons ago. I ate the cookie, but that probably was not the issue. It may be that you are geo-blocked.

So, far, nothing really of interest to report. Kind of negative, as in, the three talking seem to be resigned to accept that Twitter will die.

I do not believe that is the case.

But, I will continue to listen, and will update if any interesting stuff is discussed. They are discussing listener comments and questions now.

@ Clive

re: KQED podcast

Not much. Not worth listening to. Fluff.

Some topics mentioned, but not seriously discussed:

News aggregation, RSS, ListServs, Social Science Research, Emergency warnings and reports. No mention of NNTP. No mention of Mastodon that I can recall.

Side note: Check the timestamps on comments here. They do not seem to be as expected. At least, not how it worked last year when we did CDT to fallback to CST. It appears that the timezone has been changed on the servers to be EST.

Tell me if this comment shows up with timestamp of November 19, 2022 12:48 AM

Re: Twitter implosion

Someone at Twitter was thinking before they left the building.

The TLS Certificate was set to expire 2022-12-12.

Someone got a new cert rolled this past Monday, 2022-11-14, so the current cert will not expire until 2023-11-15.

@ Ted, Clive, ALL

Speaking of timestamps

Prescient defined here.

This was the tweet:

> I can’t wait till elon musk offers to buy twitter and delete it and everyone who calls it a “hellsite” has to pick sides for real

Make a guess as to how old that tweet is. Just a guess, say in months.

Approximately how many months ago was that tweet posted?

Hint: Obviously the answer is at least 7.

Then check the link for the timestamp. The answer will surprise you.

<https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2022/10/26/23424551/qatar-mandatory-covid-app-world-cup-tracking-personal-data> Every visitor to World Cup has to install a “COVID tracking app” that basically takes over the phone. Not even China would have dared do something like this.

@ SpaceLifeForm,

With regards,

> “Tell me if this comment shows up with timestamp of November 19, 2022 12:48 AM”

You got your wish, it does…

Speaking of time stamps, the KQRP NPR link I was told was interesting, was I was alleged to believe, about the effect on the Bay area economy etc of Twitter just shuting up shop.

Apparently a lot of that $3million/day of wages Musk is trying to save goes directly into that local economy. Pulling oh lets call it a round half billion a year out of a local economy that is also “bubble inflated” with “idiot investments” is going to hurt.

The question of interest is,

“How badly will it effect the bay area bubble, enough to deflate or even implode?”

Thus potentially leaving many of the idiots trying to ride it, high and dry…

You might remember my...
