Hacktivist gang Anonymous Sudan appears to have lost its anonymity after the US Attorney's Office on Wednesday unsealed an indictment identifying two of its alleged operators.

The [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1373581/dl?inline) [PDF] named Sudanese nationals Ahmed Salah Yousif Omer and Alaa Salah Yusuuf Omer as members of Anonymous Sudan. An [accompanying announcement](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/two-sudanese-nationals-indicted-alleged-role-anonymous-sudan-cyberattacks-hospitals) accused the pair of "operating and controlling Anonymous Sudan, an online cyber criminal group responsible for tens of thousands of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against critical infrastructure, corporate networks, and government agencies in the United States and around the world."

Both were charged with one count of conspiracy to damage protected computers. Ahmed Salah was also charged with three counts of damaging protected computers.
