# Lowe’s employees phished via Google ads

Posted: September 5, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

In mid-August, we identified a [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) campaign targeting Lowes employees via Google ads. Like many large corporations, Lowe’s has their own employe portal called [MyLowesLife](https://www.myloweslife.com/), for all matters related to schedule, pay stubs, or benefits.

Lowe’s employees who searched for “myloweslife” during that time, may have seen one or multiple fraudulent ads. The threat actor, who does not strictly limit themselves to Lowe’s but also targets other institutions, aims to gain access to the login credentials of current and former employees.

## My Lowe’s Life ads

Combining ads with a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) page is a proven recipe for success. Indeed, unsuspecting users often rely on Google Search to take them to the site they are looking for, rather than manually entering its full URL in the browser’s address bar. It is somewhat suspicious to see ads for an internal HR portal, but then again it could be easy to overlook that oddity.

We found two different advertiser accounts impersonating MyLowesLife, and in one instance, we even saw 3 malicious ads from both accounts one after the other. The URL listed for each ad is different, and does not match the legitimate one (myloweslife.com), a well-known technique of lookalikes criminals often employ.

## Phishing site built with AI

The threat actor registered several similarly looking domain names in order to trick their victims:

```
myloveslife[.]net
mylifelowes[.]org
mylifelowes[.]net
myliveloves[.]net
myloveslive[.]net
mylofeslive[.]net
myloweslove[.]com
```

What’s interesting is how the home page for each of those is not what you’d expect. In fact, what we see is a generic ‘retail store’ template which appears to have been built using [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet).

There is a simple reason for this: if anyone was to investigate those potentially fraudulent websites, they would not see anything malicious. As a result, it will be difficult to convince a domain registrar or hosting provider to take any action such as suspending the site.

## Phishing page

When victims click on the Google ad, they are taken directly to the phishing page, contained within a directory named ‘wamapps’, which interestingly matches the structure of the real Mylowe’s Life website:

```
https://lius.myloweslife.com/wamapps/wamlogin
```

This an exact replica of the real Lowe’s portal that prompts users for their Sales Number and Password:

Looking at the page’s source code, we can see how these two fields are being sent back to the threat actor using a POST request via xxx.php, the phishing kit. After collecting this data,...
