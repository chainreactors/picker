Cybersecurity leaders aren't just dealing with attacks‚Äîthey're also protecting trust, keeping systems running, and maintaining their organization's reputation. This week's developments highlight a bigger issue: as we rely more on digital tools, hidden weaknesses can quietly grow.

Just fixing problems isn't enough anymore‚Äîresilience needs to be built into everything from the ground up. That means better systems, stronger teams, and clearer visibility across the entire organization. What's showing up now isn't just risk‚Äîit's a clear signal that acting fast and making smart decisions matters more than being perfect.

Here's what surfaced‚Äîand what security teams can't afford to overlook.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Microsoft Fixes 5 Actively Exploited 0-Days** ‚Äî Microsoft [addressed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/microsoft-fixes-78-flaws-5-zero-days.html) a total of 78 security flaws in its Patch Tuesday update for May 2025 last week, out of which five of them have come under active exploitation in the wild. The vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-30397, CVE-2025-30400, CVE-2025-32701, CVE-2025-32706, and CVE-2025-32709. It's currently not known in what context these defects have been exploited, who is behind them, and who was targeted in these attacks.

## 2025 State of Code Security: Key Trends and Threats

In cloud-native environments, the security of your code repositories and development pipelines is critical. Do you know the most pressing risks facing your organization today? By analyzing hundreds of thousands of repositories, the Wiz Threat Research team uncovered key vulnerabilities and attacker strategies in the new **2025 State of Code Security Report**.

Key stats include:

* 35% of GitHub repositories are public, providing malicious actors with easy access to exploits if developers make critical mistakes
* 61% of organizations have cloud secrets, like API keys and access tokens, exposed in public repositories

## **üîî Top News**

* **Marbled Dust Exploits Output Messenger 0-Day** ‚Äî Microsoft [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/turkiye-hackers-exploited-output.html) that a T√ºrkiye-affiliated threat actor codenamed Marbled Dust exploited as zero-day a security flaw in an Indian enterprise communication platform called Output Messenger as part of a cyber espionage attack campaign since April 2024. The attacks, the company said, are associated with the Kurdish military operating in Iraq. The attacks exploited CVE-2025-27920, a directory traversal vulnerability affecting version 2.0.62 that allows remote attackers to access or execute arbitrary files. It was addressed in December 2024.
* **Konni APT Focuses on Ukraine in New Phishing Campaign** ‚Äî The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Konni APT has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/north-korean-konni-apt-targets-ukraine.html) to a phishing campaign targeting government entities in Ukraine, indicating the threat actor's targeting beyond Russia amidst the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Proofpoint, which disclosed details of the activity, said the objective of the attacks is to collect intelligence on the "trajectory of the Russian invasion." The attack chains entail the use of phishing emails that impersonate a fictitious senior fellow at a non-existent think tank, tricking recipients into visiting credential harvesting pages or downloading malware that can conduct extensive reconnaissance of the compromised machines.
* **Coinbase Discloses Data Breach** ‚Äî Cryptocurrency giant Coinbase [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/coinbase-agents-bribed-data-of-1-users.html) that unknown cyber actors broke into its systems and stole account data for a small subset of its customers. The activity bribed its customer support agents based in India to obtain a list of customers, who were then approached as part of a social engineering attack to transfer their digital assets to a wallet under the threat actor's control. The attackers also unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company for $20 million on May 11, 2025, by claiming to have information about certain customer accounts as well as internal documents. The compromised agents have since been terminated. While no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed, the attackers made away with some amount of personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, government ID images, and account balances. Coinbase did not disclose how many of its customers fell for the scam. Besides voluntarily reimbursing retail customers who were duped into sending cryptocurrency to scammers, Coinbase is offering a $20 million reward to anyone who can help identify and bring down the perpetrators of the cyber attack.
* **APT28 Behind Attacks Targeting Webmail Services** ‚Äî APT28, a hacking group linked to Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), has been [targeting](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/russia-linked-apt28-exploited-mdaemon.html) webmail servers such as Roundcube, Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra via cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The attacks, ongoing...
