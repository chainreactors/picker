## Introducing Malwarebytes Mobile Security for Business: How to find malware and stop phishing attacks on smartphones and ChromeOS

February 7, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Malwarebytes is excited to announce Malwarebytes Mobile Security for Business, [which extends our award-winning endpoint protection to mobile devices](https://www.malwarebytes.com/press/2023/01/24/malwarebytes-extends-award-winning-endpoint-protection-to-organizations-mobile-devices).

Don’t get it twisted: mobile devices may be small, but they have huge implications for your security posture. In fact, 73% of organizations experienced a mobile-related compromise that they [described as “major” in 2022.](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/mobile-security-index/)

To properly secure your mobile endpoints, you need to tackle two biggies: phishing and malware.

According to [Verizon’s 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report,](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) eighteen percent of clicked phishing emails in organizations come from a mobile device. What’s more is that [almost 50%](https://solutionsreview.com/endpoint-security/check-point-mobile-security-report-2021-97-percent-experienced-mobile-malware-attack/) of organizations had an employee download mobile malware that threatened their organization’s network and data.

We released Malwarebytes Mobile Security for Business to help organizations crush mobile threats like these on iOS, Android, and even ChromeOS.

Let’s dive in to see how it works!

## Deployment

We’re big fans of simplicity here at Malwarebytes (that might be why G2 users rated us the [#1 endpoint security product for ease of use](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/business/2023/02/malwarebytes-recognized-as-endpoint-security-leader-by-g2)), so designed deployment for Mobile Security to be as quick and easy as possible.

To that end, there are two ways to [activate the endpoint agent for your mobile devices](https://service.malwarebytes.com/hc/en-us/articles/13026721179027): Email (self-activation by end users) and via Mobile Device Management (MDM).

Using an MDM tool automates the deployment of Mobile Security for Business. To deploy via Email sharing, the end user must manually complete installation, activation, and grant system permissions for Malwarebytes Mobile Security.

Voila, you’re done.

## Protection

So you’ve got your mobile endpoints all set up, now it’s time to set a policy.

If you’re a current Nebula user, much of this next part will feel familiar. If you’re new to Nebula though, no sweat. All you need to know is that policies are what let us define how Malwarebytes behaves when using Mobile Security for Business.

After going to the Policy tab in Nebula, head on down to **Protection settings** to select Web protection and Ad block for IOS and Behavior protection for ChromeOS and Android.

Cool. To control how Malwarebytes behaves when running a scheduled scan, we have to check out the section right under, **Scan settings**.

Here you’ll find different options for scanning ChromeOS and Android devices for malware.

This policy is looking good! Let’s save and head over to our dashboard to get a bird’s eye view of anything going on with our mobile devices and Chromebooks.
