# 5 Dark Web Trends in 2023

![dark web trends image](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_2348709997-e1692287902447.jpg) It’s time for our annual peek behind the curtain into the recesses of the dark web! New developments on the dark web often reveal how—and why—attackers evolve their tactics and techniques. From darknet markets to ransomware gangs’ data leak portals, criminals are constantly innovating. Last year’s blog, [How the Dark Web Works](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/how-the-dark-web-works/), described the basics of the dark web, onion routing, how to access the dark web, and more, so this year we’ll focus on new dark web trends in 2023.

## 2023 Dark Web Trends

The dark web is designed to anonymize web traffic. This simple concept is fundamentally important for maintaining truly private web surfing and communications. For journalists, intelligence agents, and everyday citizens living in oppressive regimes, the dark web is a critical tool for supporting free speech and [open access to news](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50150981). Unfortunately, this same benefit is also useful for criminals, who routinely leverage the dark web to peddle illegal or stolen goods, obtain malware or other malicious tools, and coordinate their nefarious activities.

Let’s look at how criminals are using the dark web in 2023 and identify dark web trends so that cybersecurity teams can hone our techniques and defend effectively.

1. **Dark web activity is increasing.** In [2023 the dark web has over 2.5 million daily visitors](https://www.techbusinessnews.com.au/news/the-dark-web-has-a-alarming-27-million-daily-users-as-of-april-2023/), and it’s estimated that more than half of those visitors have participated in illegal activities. What’s even more alarming is that in April 2023, daily dark web visitors rose by 200,000 to reach 2.7 million.

Why is dark web use increasing? There’s speculation that the increase in extortion exposure attacks is driving more journalists and organizations to the dark web to check extortion exposure sites, and the increasing number of malware-as-a-service option continues to enable criminals with limited programming skills to engage in cybercrime. The anonymity of the dark web is also a big benefit for whistleblowers submitting sensitive information to news outlets. Some mainstream publications such as the New York Times maintain a presence on the dark web for just such tips, and other publications around the world maintain a presence to circumvent government-imposed internet censorship. For example, during the Russian-Ukraine conflict, citizens used dark web versions of social media to share information when traditional access was blocked.

The increased use of the dark web is also a boon to cyber extortionists, who feed off traffic to their data leak portals ...
