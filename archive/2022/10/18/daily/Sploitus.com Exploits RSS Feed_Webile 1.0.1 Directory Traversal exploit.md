Technical Details & Description:
================================
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the Webile v1.0.1 wifi mobile web application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to change the application path in performed requests to compromise the
local application or file-system of a mobile device. Attackers are for example able to request environment
variables or a sensitive system path.

The directory-traversal web vulnerability is located in the insecure web-server configuration. The path of the local user is not
secure restricted and validated. Thus allows an unauthenticated user with wifi access to request local web-server files without
secure permission. The bug itself is located in the filepath parameter of the change_upload_dir function.

Exploitation of the directory traversal web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in information leaking by unauthorized file access and mobile application compromise.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The directory traversal web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user account or user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
