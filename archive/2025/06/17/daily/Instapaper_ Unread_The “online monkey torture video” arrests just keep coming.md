Today's monkey torture videos are the products of a digitally connected world. People who enjoy watching baby animals probed, snipped, and mutilated in horrible ways often have difficulty finding local collaborators, but online communities like "million tears"—now thankfully shuttered—can help them forge connections.

Once they do meet other like-minded souls, communication takes place through chat apps like Telegram and Signal, often using encryption.

Money is pooled through various phone apps, then sent to videographers in countries where wages are low and monkeys are plentiful. (The cases I have seen usually involve Indonesia; read [my feature from last year](https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/08/thanks-internet-its-now-shockingly-easy-to-become-an-international-monkey-torturer/) to learn more about how these groups work.)

There, monkeys are tortured by a local subcontractor—sometimes a child—working to Western specs. Smartphone video of the torture is sent back to the commissioning sadists, who share it with more viewers using the same online communities in which they met.

The unfortunate pattern was again on display this week in an [indictment](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ohsd.302161/gov.uscourts.ohsd.302161.5.0.pdf) the US government unsealed against several more Americans said to have commissioned these videos. The accused used online handles like "Bitchy" and "DemonSwordSoulCrusher," and they hail from all over: Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.

They relied on an Indonesian videographer to create the content, which was surprisingly affordable—it cost a mere $40 to commission video of a "burning hot screwdriver" being shoved into a baby monkey's orifice. After the money was transferred, the requested video was shot and shared through a "phone-based messaging program," but the Americans were deeply disappointed in its quality. Instead of full-on impalement, the videographer had heated a screwdriver on a burner and merely touched it against the monkey a few times.

"So lame," one of the Americans allegedly complained to another. "Live and learn," was the response.

So the group tried again. "Million tears" had been booted by its host, but the group reconstituted on another platform and renamed itself "the trail of trillion tears." They reached out to another Indonesian videographer and asked for a more graphic version of the same video. But this version, more sadistic than the last, still didn't satisfy. As one of the Americans allegedly said to another, "honey that's not what you asked for. Thats the village idiot version. But I'm talking with someone about getting a good vo [videographer] to do it."

## Arrests continue

In 2021, someone leaked communications from the "million tears" group to animals rights organizations like Lady Freethinker and Action for Primates, which [handed it over to authorities](https://ladyfreethinker.org/us-man-who-sent-wish-list-of-monkey-torture-ideas-to-videomakers-in-indonesia-jailed-on-crush-charges/). Still, it took several years to arrest and prosecute the torture group's leaders.

In 2024, one of these leaders—Ronald Bedra of Ohio—pled guilty to commissioning the videos and to mailing "a thumb drive containing 64 videos of monkey torture to a co-conspirator in Wisconsin." His mother, in a sentencing letter to the judge, said that her son must "have been undergoing some mental crisis when he decided to create the website." As a boy, he had loved all of the family pets, she said, even providing a funeral for a fish.

Bedra was [sentenced late last year](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ohio-man-sentenced-creating-and-distributing-videos-depicting-monkey-torture-and-mutilation) to 54 months in prison. According to letters from family members, he has also lost his job, his wife, and his kids.

In April 2025, two more alleged co-conspirators were indicted and subsequently arrested; their cases were unsealed only this week. Two other co-conspirators from this group still appear to be uncharged.

In May 2025, 11 other Americans were [indicted for their participation in monkey torture groups](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/grand-jury-indicts-11-more-individuals-involvement-online-groups-dedicated-monkey), though they appear to come from a different network. This group allegedly "paid a minor in Indonesia to commit the requested acts on camera."

As for the Indonesian side of this equation, arrests have been happening there, too. Following complaints from animal rights groups, police in Indonesia have [arrested multiple videographers](https://ladyfreethinker.org/indonesian-suspect-arrested-for-torturing-monkeys-and-selling-the-videos/) over the last two years.

*Update: Showing the international nature of these torture groups, the Scottish Sun just ran a [rather lurid piece](https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14936863/sicko-scots-mum-jailed-monkey-torture/) about the "sadistic Scots mum jailed for helping to run a horrific global monkey torture network." The 39-year-old was apparently caught after US authorities broke up another monkey torturing network based around outsourcing the torture to Indonesia.*
