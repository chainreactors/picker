In the first timeline of December, I have collected 147 events (corresponding to 9.8 events/day), a result slightly higher, but substantially in line with the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/19/16-30-november-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/), which confirms the sustained level of activity that is characterizing this end of 2022.

Ransomware continues to characterize the threat landscape, but its percentage slides back under 30% (25.8% vs. 32.6% of the second timeline of November, corresponding to 38 out of 147 events). Quite the opposite of the exploitation of vulnerabilities that characterized 10.2% of events (corresponding to 15 out of 147 events), nearly the double of the second timeline of November.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

Another Decentralized Finance platform has joined the list of the ones suffering massive hacks: this time it was the turn of Ankr, which suffered a loss of $5M worth.

What is reallty crowded this month, is the cyber espionage front, with an (un)usual number of campaigns by well-known threat actors from the likes of China, Iran, and North Korea, such as: APT37, APT42 (AKA Charming Kitten), Cloud Atlas, Cobalt Mirage, Evilnum, MuddyWater and Mustang Panda. And of course even Ukraine was hit by a campaign by a threat actor named UNC4166, and by multiple wipers launched by the Belorussian threat actor Sandworm (but in this case we are crossing the boundaries of cyber warfare). By the way even Russian mayor’s offices and courts were hit by a wiper dubbed CryWiper. Of course the situation in Ukraine also affected the hacktivism, with several DDoS against targets in Italy launched by the Pro-Russian NoName057(16) group (but a DDoS attack launched by the IT Army of Ukraine hit the Russian VTB Bank.)

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
