## UNetLab v2: addressing limitations

In recent years, my focus has shifted towards network automation. I still need a unified network emulator platform, but the prerequisites have evolved. Before diving into the new requirements, let’s highlight the limitations of UNetLab:

* **Per Host Pod Limit:** Each host can run up to 256 independent pods due to the console port limit.
* **Per Lab Node Limit:** Each pod/lab can run up to 127 nodes due to the console port limit.
* **Per User Pod Limit:** Each user can run only one pod/lab at a time due to the console port limit.
* **Single Host:** No support for distributed installations of UNetLab (OVS can be used, but many frame types are filtered by default).
* **Config Management:** Using expect scripts for getting and putting startup-configs is slow, non-predictive, and cannot cover all node types.
* **No Support for Dynamips Serial Interfaces.**
* **No Topology Changes:** Topology changes are not allowed while the lab is running, by design.

The console port limit exists because each node console has a fixed port calculated as follows:

```
ts_port = 32768 + 128 * tenant_id + device_id
```

Additionally, no more than 512 IOL nodes can run in the same lab because the **device\_id** must be unique for each tenant.

UNetLab v2 must address these issues and meet new requirements:

* Run a distributed lab (across local or geographically distributed nodes).
* Support an unlimited number of nodes in a lab.
* Allow each user to customize a lab without affecting the original copy.
* Link serial interfaces between IOL and Dynamips.
* Configure nodes via Ansible/NAPALM/other tools.
