I have aggregated the statistics created from the cyber attacks timelines published during Q4 2022 ([October](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/11/24/october-2022-cyber-attacks-statistics/), [November](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/21/november-2022-cyber-attacks-statistics/), and [December](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/01/17/december-2022-cyber-attacks-statistics/).) In total I collected 817 events (vs. 875 in Q34, 694 in Q2, and 646 in Q1) corresponding to 8.88 events per day, despite the peak has been reached in q3, the level of activity remains pretty sustained.

**Cyber crime** continues to lead the **Motivations** chart with **81%**, ten points more than Q2 (**71%**), and Q1 (**70.3%**). Similarly, **malware** continues to lead the **Attack Techniques** chart with **36.1%** up from both Q2 (**30.7%**) and Q1 (**31.3%**). And the **Target Distribution**chart is once again led by **Multiple Industries** with **20.6%**,down from both Q2 (**24.4%**) and Q1 (**25.9****%**).

The statistics are also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Q3-Infographic.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.

Finally, please support my work, sharing the content, and of course follow [@paulsparrows](https://twitter.com/#%21/paulsparrows) on Twitter for the latest updates.
