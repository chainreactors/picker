In this blog post, I would like to give you an overview of SAP Mobile Start, our latest native mobile app for Apple iOS and Android, with a dedicated focus on finance users. This blog post will show you how this app might help you to access your financial data and business processes easily with a mobile device and steer your company from anywhere.

## **What is SAP Mobile Start?**

SAP Mobile Start is the new native entry point to the Intelligent Enterprise on mobile devices. It provides users with an enhanced mobile access to SAP applications, web content, data, and news feeds to quickly address their daily work – anywhere and anytime.

Users can benefit from persona-tailored content, which will be easy to consume and optimized for mobile situations. SAP Mobile Start can be set up and configured to user needs by IT administrators. It allows users to stay up to date on mobile devices and act immediately on critical business situations. The app offers integration with business applications, enabling higher productivity, and is a key asset to help ensure business continuity directly from mobile devices.

Furthermore, SAP Mobile Start offers a deep integration with native mobile device capabilities such as widgets, notifications or spotlight search.

## **Why is mobile relevant for finance?**

Obviously, many users in finance functions are heavy desktop users. Conducting complex financial accounting transactions, analyzing in-depth financial data and working with extensive tables are no use cases that make sense on a mobile device.

However, we still believe that mobile plays a crucial and increasingly important role in the daily life of finance users. The shift in everyone´s working habits after the pandemic and the move to flexible working models like work from home are significantly changing the way we will work. Mobile devices are an integral part in this.

Finance users rely on the ability to quickly react on business-critical events in order to ensure the financial health of the company. Also, it is important for them to stay informed about all relevant business data, whether they are in the office, in a meeting or sitting in in the train on the way to a customer meeting. Being able to make decisions quickly and well-informed is another important aspect of using modern mobile applications as part of your daily work life.

## **What does SAP Mobile Start have to offer for Finance users?**

SAP Mobile Start allows users to access both web and native mobile apps seamlessly from one place. This means that the users can decide for themselves, which apps they need while being away from their desks, travelling or working from home.

We have worked with several end-users and experts to define some example content for different mobile personas in the finance area. Using this example content makes it easy to start the SAP Mobile Start journey. Please note that the content is exemplary only and can of course be adapted and expanded to your specific needs and requirements (e.g. integration of custom apps, third-party apps).

## **What are example use cases for mobile finance users that are available in SAP Mobile Start?**
