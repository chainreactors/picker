# Two Supreme Court cases could change the Internet as we know it

Posted: February 17, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The Supreme Court is about to reconsider Section 230, a law that’s been the foundation of the way we have used the Internet for decades.

The court will be handling a few cases that at first glance are about online platforms’ liability for hosting accounts from foreign terrorists. But at a deeper level these cases could determine whether or not algorithmic recommendations should receive the full legal protections of Section 230.

The implications of removing that protection could be huge. Section 230 has frequently been referred to as a key law, which has allowed the Internet to develop to what it is now. Whether we like it or not.

The are two cases waiting to be heard by the Supreme Court are [Gonzalez v. Google](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gonzalez-v-google-llc/) and [Twitter v. Taamneh](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/twitter-inc-v-taamneh/). Both seek to draw big tech into the war on terror. The plaintiffs in both suits rely on a federal law that allows any USA national who is injured by an act of international terrorism to sue anyone who knowingly provided substantial assistance to whoever carried it out. The reasoning is that the platforms, Google and Twitter, provided assistance to terrorists by giving them the ability to recruit new members.

Section 230 is the provision that has, until now, protected those platforms from the negative consequences of user-generated content.

## Section 230

[Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230) is a section of Title 47 of the United States Code that was enacted as part of the [Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/section-230-and-the-future-of-content-5640056/), which is Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and generally provides immunity to websites from the negative effects of third-party content.

What’s in question is whether providers should be treated as publishers or, alternatively, as distributors of content created by its users.

Before the Internet, a liability line was drawn between publishers of content and distributors of content. A publisher would be expected to have awareness of the material they published and could be held liable for it, while a distributor would likely not be aware and as such would be immune.

> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

Section 230 protections have never been limitless though, and require providers to remove material illegal on a federal level, such as in copyright infringement cases.

It all became a bit more complicated when online platforms—and social media in particular—started using algorithms that are designed to keep us occupied. These algorithms make sure that we are presented with content we have shown an interest in. The goal is to make us spend as much time on that platform as possible while the platform earns advertising dollars. While the content was not created by the platform, the algorith definitely does the bidding of the platform.

In the early days ([cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont%2C_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co.) that played out before the turn of the century) moderation was seen as an editorial acti...
