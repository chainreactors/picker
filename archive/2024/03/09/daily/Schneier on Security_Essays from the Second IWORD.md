I sampled four items: “Democracy as approximation”, “Moving Beyond the Paradigm of Democracy”, and “Can We Talk?”, and “Experimentocracy”. I can’t endorse any one of them. All of them have too many problems. I didn’t look at the rest.

Zeroing on to “Can We Talk?” it simply doesn’t pass safeguarding or ethics considerations. It’s an argument for tenured egos to throw their weight around with license. It’s just neo-liberal “free speech” wriggling its way into institutions under the shield of “academic freedom” to hide the “War on woke” and the “Deep state”. In other words codified and indemnified institutional capture. It’s worse than this which a number of women can attest to. Too many UK universities have too many problems and are refusing to engage with the underlying causes both academically and professionally. Just because a woman wrote the essay doesn’t mean I’m going to accept it because “thumbs on the scale” have become adept at co-opting as a shield to disguise the agenda. That makes me start asking questions about the management and funding sources and what we are not being told.

The rest look equally dodgy and are not many steps removed from why I say NIST is useless.

Harvard has been suffering from some dark money thumbs on the scale recently one of which corrupted their law department.

I would tread very carefully with this lot and make sure the safety rope is secured firmly.

The Joe Evans, “Experimentocracy” paper is worth a quick read.

The first few paragraphs will explain to a lot of people the scattergun nature of tech “startups” and similar and some reasons why they fail.

Take that with the observation in the final paragraph about why groups of people rather than individuals can forecast better and you can get the feeling that there may be more to geometric voting than at first it appears.

More on geometric voting can be found at,

Would it correct Churchill’s maxim on democracy or not?

Well as Shakespeare noted “there’s the rub”.

@ Bruce,

A question,

Is it “Jon Evans” or “Joe Evans”

The Ash page you link to says Jon at the top but in the citation field “Joe”…

If I’ve got it wrong my apologies.

@Clive

> It is abundantly clear that you are carrying out an attack on me and trying to hide it with more of your “I say I am the expert bow down before me” nonsense.

My position is stated in the top post before you arrived in the topic. I disagree with you because we have different starting points. That’s it.

I can even post an article by a professor in related domains (see my first post in the current Friday topic before you arrived in the topic) and not a ripple off anyone. If you don’t want to listen to a qualified expert who is paid to do the job by a university there’s not much else I can say.

I explicitly named “Experimentocracy” in my top post as being a waste of space then when you commented later after I had posted that you though it was a good idea I went on to give a rough top level view of why I thought the “Experimentocracy” essay was a load of cack. It’s not easy as although simple on the surface it crosses multiple fields and can get quite complex so not a bad effort by someone who isn’t, like, an actual university professor in the subject. The author isn’t an expert. They’re a sci-fi author and could have done with reading Ursula Le Guinn’s essays. They’re available for free online. She actually wrote some relevant posts on the topic albeit more handwavy and poetic, and yes she’s coming at it from a more feminist theory point of view. I know because I went looking for them later to compare the two.

I’m posting a view or linking to a view by people with the required bells and whistles before you even arrive. Maybe just maybe I know things you don’t? You know things I don’t. We express ourselves differently and have lived different lives and have wildly diverging senses of humour and li...
