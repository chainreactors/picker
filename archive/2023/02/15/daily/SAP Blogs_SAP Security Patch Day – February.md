### Why your organization should take care:

Maintaining the security of installed SAP software is of critical strategic importance for the continuous protection of SAP business applications to defend against new types of cyber attacks and to close newly identified potential vulnerabilities. Therefore, SAP releases security patches every second Tuesday of the month. The patches should be applied in a timely manner according to the severity of the vulnerability CVSS score and system criticality. Needed configuration steps should be taken immediately after installation. Customers and Partners can find and review the content of current and previous patches via the SAP [Security Notes & News home page.](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base/security-notes-news.html)

### Where do you get the most relevant information:
