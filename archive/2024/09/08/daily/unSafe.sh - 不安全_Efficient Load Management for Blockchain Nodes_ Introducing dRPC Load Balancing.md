As blockchain technology continues to evolve, one problem blockchain developers face is managing traffic/payloads efficiently. Blockchain nodes, tasked with processing millions of transaction requests and payloads from APIs, are at risk of becoming bottlenecks because of unbalanced traffic. This can increase network latency, reduce transaction throughput, and ultimately affect the performance of your DApp. So, efficient load management is needed to prevent this problem.

dRPC load balancing solution addresses these issues. Designed specifically for the blockchain, the web3 infrastructure company has a lot of measures in place to intelligently manage payloads and traffic, even in peak periods. dRPC helps blockchain developers to maintain high availability, optimize network performance, and scale their DApp efficiently, ensuring seamless user experience.

This article explores[dRPC’s load-balancing technology](http://drpc.org/?ref=hackernoon.com), how it works, and its benefits. By understanding the fundamentals of this technology, you can be sure how to integrate them into your process, and ultimately influence user experience. So, whether you’re building a DApp, DeFi platform, or NFT marketplace, this article will help you learn the fundamentals of load balancing in blockchain technology and how it affects your DApp’s user experience.

Without ado, let’s get to it!

## What Is Load Balancing?

[Load balancing](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/load-balancing?ref=hackernoon.com) is an algorithm that helps distribute workload evenly across nodes in the blockchain network. It accepts incoming network traffic and decides which server can perfectly handle the request based on different factors like current load on each node, availability, node location,  and response time.

A load balancer contributes to improving network performance and availability. Assuming a node fails, the load balancer redirects the traffic to other underutilized nodes. It distributes the load evenly across all nodes, ensuring efficient request handling and optimal resource utilization.

Load balancer contributes to improving network performance and availability. It helps to prevent overloading/underutilization of RPC nodes. It also improves fault tolerance by assigning tasks to active nodes when RPC nodes fail. As a result, it can improve network throughput, and reduce latency and response time.

## Benefits of Load Balancing

A load balancer is an essential component of blockchain technology. It ensures efficient request handling and optimal resource utilization while enhancing system performance. Here are its benefits to blockchain technology.

### 1. Improved Reliability

Load balancing prevents performance bottlenecks by reducing the likelihood of downtime during network congestion. The load balancing algorithm can reroute traffic to other RPC nodes in case of node failure, which ensures continuous availability. It maximizes resource utilization and prevents any single service node from becoming a bottleneck.

### 2. Efficient Request Handling

The load balancer intelligently distributes requests to underutilized RPC nodes to increase efficiency. Instead of turning a node into a bottleneck, the balancer spreads the request to other underutilized nodes and prevents underutilization/overloading.

### 3. Improved Scalability

Load balancing helps scale the server infrastructure on demand without affecting the network. It allows easy addition of new RPC providers to accommodate increased demand, ensuring ecosystem smart growth.

### 4. Prevent Centralization

A load balancer helps distribute loads evenly across nodes on a blockchain network. Without a load balancer, there is usually a risk of loads/traffic being routed through a single node. This could lead to bottlenecks in high-traffic scenarios, which can overwhelm the node and cause service disruption.

Apart from being a bottleneck, this can lead to centralization, which can be easily exploited by bad actors and ultimately lead to a single point of failure. But with load balancer, loads are intelligently spread evenly across multiple nodes and even if there is a failure, the loads are automatically redirected to other available nodes.

## dRPC’s Load Balancing Solution: How Does it Work?

dRPC is a decentralized web3 infrastructure provider that focuses on decentralization. It’s a gateway for web3 developers and users to access a distributed network of independent third-party providers and public nodes.

dRPC uses open-source features and components to ensure the uttermost decentralization of the infrastructure. With features like load balancers, workloads are intelligently distributed among nodes, and requests are handled efficiently no matter the traffic congestion.

dRPC infrastructure consists of key components like Dshackle and Dproxy, which enhance and optimize DApps performance.

## Components of dRPC’s Load Balancing System

Let’s check out some of the core [components of dRPC](https://drpc.org/docs/howitworks/overview?ref=hackernoon.com).

### 1. Dshackle

[Dshackle](https://github.com/emeraldpay/dshackle?ref=hackernoon.com) is an open-source fault-tolerant load-balancing library by Emerald Pay. It ensures reliable routing to multiple nodes. It also ensures requests are executed by a suitable RPC node. dRPC has its [fork of Dshackle](https://github.com/drpcorg/dshackle?ref=hackernoon.com), meaning that it has improved on the Emerald pay’s version of for integration with their system.

This open-source load balancing tool provides standard blockchain JSON RPC over HTTP and WebSocket, advanced gRPC-based API, asynchronous execution, secure TLS, and intelligent routing based on data availability.

dRPC’s Dshackle provides useful features for routing and load balancing like the ability to track current chain heads, and prioritize and deprioritize nodes based on activeness. It also uses several other factors like the location of nodes, current height, and request method.

### 2. Dproxy

Dproxy is a central gateway proxy (a service gateway that receives blockchain requests and forwards them to endpoints) for dRPC’s network of independent RPC providers/public nodes. It intelligently distributes workload and ensures efficient request handling.

Dproxy receives users' requests from DApps and selects the best data provider to fulfill the request based on the providers' ranking. The providers' ranking is determined by a machine learning algorithm, which takes into account factors like current performance, current provider status, provider capabilities, and the amount of compute units that each provider has secured recently.

For efficient load distribution, Dproxy maintains a rating system that's calculated every second.
