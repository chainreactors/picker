The cyber world‚Äôs been buzzing this week, and it‚Äôs all about staying ahead of the bad guys.

**‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Critical Ivanti Flaw Comes Under Exploitation** ‚Äî A newly discovered critical security [vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/ivanti-flaw-cve-2025-0282-actively.html) has been exploited as a zero-day since mid-December 2024. The flaw (CVE-2025-0282, CVSS score: 9.0) is a stack-based buffer overflow bug that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. According to Google-owned Mandiant, the flaw has been exploited to deploy the SPAWN ecosystem of malware ‚Äì the SPAWNANT installer, SPAWNMOLE tunneler, and the SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor ‚Äì as well as two other previously undocumented malware families dubbed DRYHOOK and PHASEJAM. There is a possibility that multiple threat actor groups, including the China-linked UNC5337, are behind the exploitation.

* **Microsoft Pursues Legal Action Against Hacking Group** ‚Äî Microsoft said it's taking legal action against an unknown foreign-based threat-actor group for [abusing stolen Azure API keys](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/microsoft-sues-hacking-group-exploiting.html) and customer Entra ID authentication information to breach its systems and gain unauthorized access to the Azure OpenAI Service with the goal of generating harmful content that bypasses safety guardrails, as well as monetizing that access by offering it to other customers. It accused three unnamed individuals of creating a "hacking-as-a-service" infrastructure for this purpose.
* **Exploitation Attempts Recorded Against GFI KerioControl Firewalls** ‚Äî Threat actors are actively attempting to exploit a recently disclosed security [flaw impacting GFI KerioControl firewalls](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/critical-rce-flaw-in-gfi-keriocontrol.html) that, if successfully exploited, could allow malicious actors to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability, CVE-2024-52875, is a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection that could result in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Attempts to exploit the vulnerability commenced around December 28, 2024.
* **Updated EAGERBEE Malware Targets the Middle East** ‚Äî Internet service providers (ISPs) and governmental entities in the Middle East have been targeted using an updated variant of the [EAGERBEE](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/new-eagerbee-variant-targets-isps-and.html) (aka Thumtais) malware framework. The new variant is capable of deploying additional payloads, enumerating file systems, and executing command shells.

The attacks involve the use of Windows Shortcut (LNK), Windows Installer (MSI), and Microsoft Management Console (MSC) files, likely distributed via spear-phishing, as the first-stage component to trigger the infection chain, ultimately leading to the deployment of PlugX using DLL side-loading techniques.
