# Model Context Protocol Server For Cyber Security

## 项目简介

这是一个专注于网络安全领域的 Model Context Protocol Server (MCPs) 集合项目，包含两个主要目标：

1. 收集和整理现有的网络安全相关 MCP 服务器实现
2. 开发新的 MCP Server 实现

每个 MCP Server 都独立封装在各自的目录中，便于管理和使用。

## 实现列表

### 1. sqlmap-mcp

SQL注入测试工具的MCP服务器实现。基于TypeScript开发，提供了以下功能：

* 支持对目标URL进行SQL注入扫描
* 提供创建和管理测试笔记的功能
* 集成了调试工具支持

### 2. quake-server

基于360 Quake的网络空间搜索引擎MCP服务器实现。主要特点：

* 提供网络空间资产搜索能力
* 支持资源管理和笔记功能
* 基于TypeScript开发的现代化架构
