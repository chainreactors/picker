Have you ever found yourself in a bookstore, overwhelmed by the sheer number of titles and unsure of where to start? Well, let me make it easier for you. Here are five books that I highly recommend, as I found them to be absolutely brilliant.

**1. [FAIK](https://amzn.to/3ZWSNEK) by Perry Carpenter**

If you’re intrigued by the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, “FAIK” by Perry Carpenter is a must-read. This book delves into the concepts of AI fakeness and realness—how it operates, its limitations, and what the future holds. It’s incredibly comprehensive and offers a grounded perspective on the topic. Trust me, doing yourself the favor of picking this up will be worth it.

**2. [Confident Cybersecurity](https://amzn.to/3PilIhC) by Dr. Jessica Barker**

For those venturing into the realm of cybersecurity, Dr. Jessica Barker’s “Confident Cybersecurity” is indispensable. As a fan of Jess’s work, I can assure you this book is no exception. It serves as an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of cybersecurity and effectively covers all the essential bases. It’s a solid read for beginners and seasoned enthusiasts alike.

**3. [The Psychopath Test](https://amzn.to/3BXXPcd) by Ron Johnson**

Diving into the depths of psychology, “The Psychopath Test” by Ron Johnson offers a thrilling exploration of psychopathy. Are you a psychopath, or do you suspect someone you know might be? Ron’s incredible journey takes you through this intriguing subject matter, making for a captivating read. And, if you enjoy this, I also recommend his previous work, “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed.”

**4. [How I Rob Banks](https://amzn.to/3ZR8rBD) by FC**

“How I Rob Banks” by FC (Dr. Jessica Barker’s husband) is a riveting collection of tales from his experiences as a red teamer. Dive into stories of breaking into banks and buildings, evading high-tech security systems, and outsmarting advanced facial recognition technologies. The book’s engaging narrative will have you hooked.

**5. [The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared](https://amzn.to/3PdGTl7)**

While I’m not typically drawn to fiction, this book was a wonderful recommendation from a friend. This amusing story had me nearly finishing it in one go during a transatlantic flight. It’s a humorous and light-hearted read, ideal for travel and guaranteed to keep you entertained.

**A Personal Note and Recommendation**

While I’ve run out of copies to distribute, I couldn’t help but mention my own book, “[50 Ways to Survive and Thrive in Cybersecurity](https://amzn.to/41Qy6wU),” co-authored with Erich Kron.

And there you have it—five books that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed and wholeheartedly recommend. Whether you’re stuffing stockings this holiday season or simply looking for a new read, I hope these selections serve you well and perhaps even inspire a great start to the new year. Happy reading!
