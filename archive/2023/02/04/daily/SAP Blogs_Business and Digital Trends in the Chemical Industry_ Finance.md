## 1. INTRODUCTION

In this blog, we discuss the challenges that current external disruptions are creating for the chemical and life science industry more than for many other industries. The industry’s reliance on commodities and specialized chemical products that have increased dramatically in price has led to the emergence of new items on the CFO agenda.

The high rate of inflation is forcing companies to optimize their liquidity and streamline working capital management scenarios as they strive to secure their productive capabilities at a time when raw materials and intermediates are both rare and expensive. In this blog, we focus on a number of pertinent areas in which we address challenges from a business perspective as well as from the perspective of the Business Transformation Services group. We demonstrate how working capital and liquidity management solutions from SAP can help counteract recent shocks within the chemicals industry. Topics discussed include:

* **Inflation** as a top priority, especially with regard to the surge in commodity / raw material prices

* **Working capital** **management** to allow your firm to run efficiently and to reduce working capital cost

* **Liquidity management** as a necessary control element to meet current liabilities

## 2. BUSINESS TRENDS AND THEIR IMPACT IN FINANCE

### 2.1 Inflation and Steady Interest Rate Increases and How to Cope with Them

On February 2, 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced another 0.5 percent increase in its interest rate effective as of March. This increase of 50 basis points is already the fifth spike in the interest rate level within just a few months. This is undoubtedly an attempt to counteract an inflation level that remains too high for too long.

This inflation figure is especially critical for the chemical industry, as its dependence on raw material for chemicals and energy for production processes is usually high. Commodity prices for raw materials and intermediates, including energy, have experienced the sharpest price surges, and the war in Ukraine has led to shortages in the supply of gas and as a result significant higher energy cost. The current geopolitical disruptions harm the competitive position primarily in Europe in a way that firms rethink their future investment decisions. This could without a doubt push management’s favored location for production facilities away from Europe to other regions with more stable and cheap supply of gas and energy.

In fact, price surges for relevant commodities have risen to levels that threaten the core production operations of many chemical companies. These companies had previously expected that they would ride out the price increases, but this is no longer the case. They now find that they must adopt to the new inflationary figures and the resulting pressure on their margins. This is especially prominent for chemical companies with product portfolios focusing on high volume commodities with traditionally lower margins compared to firms selling higher margin specialty chemicals.

It’s important for companies to understand the financial impact of these factors so that they can react quickly and predict where the market is heading. These challenges force them to rethink their priorities with regard to the CFO agenda and explore opportunities to gain a competitive cost advantage.

We want to discuss two functions in detail, namely, working capital (especially inventory) and liquidity management.

### 2.2 Revival of Working Capital Management

In the future, it will be crucial for finance departments to steer their inventory properly so that they can keep their inventory level as low as possible to avoid external financing cost through banks and bonds. At the same time, they need to focus on a demand-oriented production while safeguarding an efficient, continuous production, without jeopardizing the on-time delivery towards the customers.

In finance, time value of money has traditionally been a key factor for financial models. Bound capital within a company bears interest. In recent years, with the interest rates being around the zero-interest rate level in most industrialized countries, borrowing money was cheap and working capital considerations with respect to low inventory levels had lost much of their previous relevance on the CFO agenda. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was low, as the risk-free interest rate was only narrowly above zero.

The rise of the interest level, in combination with other external price shocks for raw materials, has now increased the relevance of working capital from two sides. One contributing factor is that there is a h...
