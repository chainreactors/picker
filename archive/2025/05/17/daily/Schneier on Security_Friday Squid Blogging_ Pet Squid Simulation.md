## Friday Squid Blogging: Pet Squid Simulation

From [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2025/04/26/digital-squids-behavior-shaped-by-neural-network/), this is a [neural network simulation](https://github.com/ViciousSquid/Dosidicus) of a pet squid.

> Autonomous Behavior:
>
> * The squid moves autonomously, making decisions based on his current state (hunger, sleepiness, etc.).* Implements a vision cone for food detection, simulating realistic foraging behavior.* Neural network can make decisions and form associations.* Weights are analysed, tweaked and trained by Hebbian learning algorithm.* Experiences from short-term and long-term memory can influence decision-making.* Squid can create new neurons in response to his environment (Neurogenesis)

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

NZ Police are giving up their speed cameras. The function is being taken over by New Zealand Transport Agency, but the actual cameras “are operated by an external company, Acusensus,” who Wikipedia describe as “a technology company.”

Starlink: A Satellite system shaping modern warfare

operations. But control over the system lies with Elon Musk. How risky is that?=

Autonomous weapons: Machines decide over life and death

=Drones that attack on their own, robotic vehicles in combat—autonomous weapons are taking on more tasks. For now, humans have the final say. But how much longer will that be the case?=

Two short and good videos related to blog.

“Tesco has apologised after IT problems left some customers unable to alter online orders or access digital versions of their Clubcards.
…
There is no suggestion Tesco’s problems were due to hackers.”

Introducing oniux: Kernel-level Tor isolation for any Linux app

<https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-oniux-tor-isolation-using-linux-namespaces/>

When launching privacy-critical apps and services, developers want to make sure that every packet really only goes through Tor. One mistyped proxy setting–or a single system-call outside the SOCKS wrapper–and your data is suddenly on the line.

That’s why today, we are excited to introduce oniux: a small command-line utility providing Tor network isolation for third-party applications using Linux namespaces. Built on Arti, and onionmasq, oniux drop-ships any Linux program into its own network namespace to route it through Tor and strips away the potential for data leaks. If your work, activism, or research demands rock-solid traffic isolation, oniux delivers it.

“Apparent vandalism to fibre cables in Auckland fixed

Six cables were damaged on Thursday, the network operator saying it appeared to be deliberate.”

About 1000 users were taken offline. I suspect a nation state agent would not have been so crude. Selecting and cutting just one fibre in a bundle is bit tricky for your average vandal.

Pathology Without a Person
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-digital-self/202505/pathology-without-a-person>

=Where a narcissist once relied on a small social circle to validate their grandiosity, today they can perform to millions—with algorithms rewarding exaggeration and spectacle. Where a Machiavellian manipulator once needed face-to-face persuasion, now they can orchestrate deception behind screens, cloaked in anonymity. And for those with sadistic tendencies, cruelty is no longer hidden—it’s performative, often celebrated, and even viral.

The platforms flatten social hierarchies, remove interpersonal friction, and offer asymmetric power to those who might otherwise remain on the psychological margins. The cost of entry is low. The rewards—attention, influence, even monetization—are high. And in this way, digital spaces have lowered the friction for antisocial expression while often raising the reach. The very traits we diagnose in private can now thrive in public.

It’s the dark undercurrent of digital life. Studies link trolling to sadistic traits, but online, cruelty isn’t just tolerated; it’s content. Hate goes viral. Platforms don’t just permit this, they profit from it. Worse still, the culprits often hide behind playful or antagonistic aliases.

We’re now witnessing human darkness encoded and amplified. AI can gaslight, deceive, or churn out disinformation with no intent, no guilt, and no soul. That’s what makes it so dangerous. You can’t argue with code or guilt-trip an algorithm.

Here’s the shift: We’re no longer just facing malic...
