# Four things we learned when US intelligence chiefs testified to Congress

## US intelligence leaders gave their most recent — and frank — assessment of global cyber threats

Cyberattacks, regional conflict, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, commercial spyware, AI, misinformation, disinformation, deepfakes and TikTok. These are just some of the top perceived threats that the United States faces, according to the U.S. government’s intelligence agency’s latest global risk assessment.

The unclassified report published Monday — [sanitized for public release](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24475399-unclassified-threat-assessment-us-government-2024) — gave a frank annual window into the U.S. intelligence community’s collective hive mind about the threats it sees facing the U.S. homeland based on its massive banks of gathered intelligence. Now in an election year, the top U.S. spies increasingly cite emerging technology and cybersecurity as playing a factor in assessing its national security posture.

In an [unclassified session](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-worldwide-threats-4) with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, the top leaders across the U.S. government’s intelligence agencies — including the FBI, NSA, CIA and others — testified to lawmakers largely to answer their questions about the current state of global affairs.

Here’s what we learned from the hearing.

## At least 74 countries use commercial spyware

In the last few years, the U.S. government turned its attention to the government spyware industry, currently made of companies like [NSO Group](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/) and [Intellexa](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/us-sanctions-founder-of-spyware-maker-intellexa-for-targeting-americans/), and previously Hacking Team and FinFisher. In its annual report, the intelligence community wrote that, “from 2011 to 2023, at least 74 countries contracted with private companies to obtain commercial spyware, which governments are increasingly using to target dissidents and journalists.”

The report does not clarify where the intelligence community got that number, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to a request for comment asking to clarify.

But last year, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington, D.C. think-tank, [released a report on the global spyware industry](https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/03/14/why-does-global-spyware-industry-continue-to-thrive-trends-explanations-and-responses-pub-89229) that included the same number of countries as well as the same dates as the new intelligence community report. The Carnegie report, written by Steven Feldstein and Brian Kot, referenced [data that the two collected](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/csvhpkt8tm/10), which they said came from sources such as digital rights groups and security researchers that have studied the spyware industry like Citizen Lab, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Privacy International, as well as news reports.

It’s important to note that the Carnegie dataset, as [the authors explained last year](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/csvhpkt8tm/10), includes what we refer to as government or commercial spyware, meaning tools to remotely hack and surveil targets remotely, such as those that NSO and Intellexa make. But it also includes digital forensic software used to extract data from phones and computers that are physically in the possession of the authorities. Two of the most well-known makers of this type of tools are [Cellebrite](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/cellebrite-asks-cops-to-keep-its-phone-hacking-tech-hush-hush/) and [Grayshift](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/20/thoma-bravo-agrees-to-acquire-digital-forensics-firm-magnet-forensics-for-over-1b/), both of which are widely used in the United States as well as in other countries.
