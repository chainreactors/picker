In today’s world, security is more important than ever. As organizations increasingly rely on technology to drive business, digital threats are becoming more sophisticated, varied, and difficult to defend against. One of the most effective ways to safeguard an organization’s digital assets is through **penetration testing** (or just “pen testing” for short). In this blog, we will explore what penetration testing is, why it’s vital for modern businesses, and how it fits into an organization’s overall security strategy.

A Penetration Tester

### What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is a method used to evaluate security by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders (who do not have authorized access) or insiders (who have some level of authorized access). The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.

It should be noted that penetration tests are not necessarily always focused on technology. These tests can encompass other vectors, such as physical penetration testing and social engineering tests.

Penetration testing should be about more than just running automated scans—penetration testing involves the manual exploitation of systems by pen testers to assess how far they can breach a network, application, or system. Pen testers seek to mimic real-world attack techniques to uncover gaps in security that could otherwise go unnoticed.

#### Types of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing can be applied to a wide variety of environments, each with its own methodologies and tools. Some of the most common types include:

1. **Network (External, Internal, and Assumed Compromise) Penetration Testing:**
   Focuses on discovering vulnerabilities in internal and external network infrastructures, firewalls, and other network-based services. During this test, testers will perform activities such as port scans, mapping the network’s attack surface, and then performing attacks ranging from launching exploits against unpatched software services to relaying internal network traffic.
2. **Web Application Penetration Testing:**
   Examines the security of websites and web applications. Common vulnerabilities tested include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.
3. **Mobile Application Penetration Testing:**

Involves the testing of mobile applications against a variety of attacks. This can include authentication flaws, script-based attacks, and injections.

4. **Social Engineering Penetration Testing:**
   Involves manipulating or deceiving employees into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise the security of the organization, such as phishing attacks.
5. **Wireless Penetration Testing:**
   Tests the security of an organization’s Wi-Fi networks and connected devices. Popular attacks performed during this test include MAC address spoofing and deauthentication attacks.
6. **Physical Penetration Testing:**
   Evaluates the physical security controls of an organization by attempting to gain unauthorized access to buildings, servers, or other critical assets. During this test, you can expect a tester to try picking locks, social engineering employees, or cloning badges.
7. **Red Team Assessment:**An assessment where the tester assumes the role of an advanced threat. Red teaming exercises can involve any of the above techniques as a means of attempting to gain entry.
