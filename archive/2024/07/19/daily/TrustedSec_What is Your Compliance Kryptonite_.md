Have you ever felt frustrated about security compliance? Well, you're not alone. We've all got some kind of 'Kryptonite' when it comes to Compliance. I asked some of our InfoSec auditors to share their Kryptonite. Their answers focused on the pain du jour, PCI DSS new version 4.0 and 4.01. So, dear reader, let's get into it.

First up is **Chris Camejo**, Compliance Practice Lead:

## Never Been Asked

"My compliance kryptonite is when an organization asks why we’re making them do something for compliance that they never had to do before. Often these are security controls that were approved by previous auditors. It makes me question my understanding of the framework (and sometimes sanity). Saying “every other auditor you’ve talked to is wrong” seems egotistical, so I often go back to the source material to check my understanding, but I usually find myself looking at a fairly clear requirement backed up by guidance documents and FAQs that often contain specific relevant examples."

"I’ve come to the conclusion after many years, that there are auditors out there that fall into the same trap as the organizations they’re assessing: They make assumptions about what a requirement means without really understanding it in context or looking at additional guidance (I hate to say it, but I probably was that guy earlier in my compliance career). This does a disservice to organizations being assessed, as they are faced with sudden audit surprises if they get a new auditor with a better understanding of the requirements than their previous auditor. Sometimes this works the other way as well. I find organizations doing things that are not required ‘for compliance purposes’ due to a misreading of the requirements."

## There All Along

"There have always been misconceptions about how PCI DSS (and other compliance frameworks) define their scope and what is acceptable for certain requirements. Many of these misconceptions were addressed in a variety of guidance documents and FAQs that none but the most dedicated compliance nerds took the time to read and understand. I see many of the “changes” in the PCI DSS version 4.0 pulling information from the guidance documents and FAQs into the standard itself and thereby, consolidating what was always expected in one place where it is more likely to be seen. One example is the scope flowchart added to PCI DSS section 4 that has rearranged many organizations’ understandings of what is in and out of scope. The secret is this flowchart has been hiding in the PCI Scope and Segmentation Guidance document for years, where very few people noticed it and only now has it been brought over into the DSS itself."
