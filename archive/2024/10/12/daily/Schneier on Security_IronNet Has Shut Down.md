## IronNet Has Shut Down

After retiring in 2014 from an uncharacteristically long tenure running the NSA (and US CyberCommand), Keith Alexander founded a cybersecurity company called IronNet. At the time, he claimed that it was based on IP he developed on his own time while still in the military. That always troubled me. Whatever ideas he had, they were developed on public time using public resources: he shouldn’t have been able to leave military service with them in his back pocket.

In any case, it was never clear what those ideas were. IronNet never seemed to have any special technology going for it. Near as I could tell, its success was entirely based on Alexander’s name.

Turns out there was nothing there. After some crazy VC investments and an IPO with a $3 billion “unicorn” valuation, the company has shut its doors. It went [bankrupt](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/cybersecurity-company-founded-by-ex-nsa-director-files-bankruptcy-2023-10-13/) a year ago—ceasing operations and firing everybody—and [reemerged](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ironnet-successfully-completes-financial-restructuring-reforged-as-a-private-company-powered-by-collective-defense-302068841.html) as a private company. It now seems to be gone for good, not having found anyone willing to buy it.

And—wow—the recriminations are [just starting](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/collapse-of-national-security-elites-cyber-firm-leaves-bitter-wake/ar-AA1rFNXh).

> Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises.
>
> The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health.
>
> IronNet’s rise and fall also raises questions about the judgment of its well-credentialed leaders, a who’s who of the national security establishment. National security experts, former employees and analysts told The Associated Press that the firm collapsed, in part, because it engaged in questionable business practices, produced subpar products and services, and entered into associations that could have left the firm vulnerable to meddling by the Kremlin.
>
> “I’m honestly ashamed that I was ever an executive at that company,” said Mark Berly, a former IronNet vice president. He said the company’s top leaders cultivated a culture of deceit “just like Theranos,” the once highly touted blood-testing firm that became a symbol of corporate fraud.

There has been one [lawsuit](https://theintercept.com/2022/09/12/keith-alexander-nsa-spac-investment-scheme/). Presumably there will be more. I’m sure Alexander got plenty rich off his NSA career.

With regards,

*“[I]t was never clear what those ideas were. IronNet never seemed to have any special technology going for it.”*

Remember,

1, Bosses put their names on juniors patents and thus claim entitlement.

2, The NSA has peculiar rules that enable them to claim “prior art” without proof.

Thus stealing peoples ideas would be very easy for a man in his position, and he could talk about them confidentially to investors as if they were his own.

The hard part however would be actually using the ideas without those who actually thought them up finding out and “making claim”.

So I’m guessing he was not smart enough to “make product” on others IP in a way he could get away with it. But he sure could talk up a nice income out of it, didn’t he say a $million/month at one point?

Opps,

Left out the citation for the “$million per month” Keith Alexander claimed he was worth,

All payed for by investors…

Talk about “Laughing all the way to the bank” by walking on others and their work.

Not dead yet! (Cue the Monty Python skit.)

“Pienaar has since helped IronNet scale-down into a smaller, private outfit and believes the company still can still play a crucial role in the cybersecurity space, despite its difficulties in the public market.

“The mission with IronNet continues,” Pienaar said. “It’s back under private ownership as it should have been. It’s kept all its customers. It’s doing some very important work to defend us, both the U.S. and U.S. allies from cyberattacks and we are optimistic about the company’s future.”

“he developed on his own time while still in the military. That always troubled me. Whatever ideas he had, they were developed on public time using public resources”

Well, his *claim* is that he developed it on his time using his resources, not on duty using military resources. Lots of people in the military have side gigs.

I strongly disagree with the idea that it is impossible for someone to develop independent ideas while also in full-time employment – even employment in the military.

I’ve worked at places where I came up with relevant ideas and the executives made a specific decision to not develop them. It happens, I have no doubt that it also happens in military service, and there’s nothing wrong with developing them independently.

Of course, independently means using your own machinery and your own time but there is nothing preventing full-time service members from having at least some of both, the same way I owned home computers and laptops that I never connected to my workplace’s systems.

That said, if your “independent idea” is simply to say you’ve developed independent intellectual property and sucker a bunch of people into investing in it, that doesn’t really test the question of whether it is possibl...
