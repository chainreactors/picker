[![State-Sponsored Hackers](data:image/png;base64... "State-Sponsored Hackers")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhok_TU1q_ef7jFtgA7FUogFfvD8fqA2JJ2FjE2woGwe7YG0kYEnu4zus-A5TS-jtveMeZyRcxGEZuUdOb976gAmcxVgF1NbFsbdkPGJbqdYr_upAJhsNkGDPwtRQVAedzXfTCD59WnsRfq_oBvTo_t2sAJ6HBr1cDeVZD4afjjtqC_L3kqQux-9zQ7_VGV/s790-rw-e365/clickfix.jpg)

Multiple state-sponsored hacking groups from Iran, North Korea, and Russia have been found leveraging the increasingly popular ClickFix social engineering tactic to deploy malware over a three-month period from late 2024 through the beginning of 2025.

The phishing campaigns adopting the strategy have been attributed to clusters tracked as [TA427](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-apt-kimsuky-uses-lnk-files.html) (aka Kimsuky), [TA450](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/iranian-hackers-deploy-new-bugsleep.html) (aka MuddyWater), UNK\_RemoteRogue, and [TA422](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/cert-ua-identifies-malicious-rdp-files.html) (aka APT28).

ClickFix has been an initial access technique primarily affiliated with cybercrime groups, although the effectiveness of the approach has led to it also being adopted by nation-state groups.

"The incorporation of ClickFix is not revolutionizing the campaigns carried out by TA427, TA450, UNK\_RemoteRogue, and TA422 but instead is replacing the installation and execution stages in existing infection chains," enterprise security firm Proofpoint [said](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/around-world-90-days-state-sponsored-actors-try-clickfix) in a report published today.

[ClickFix](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-clickfix-phishing.html), in a nutshell, refers to a sneaky technique that tricks users into infecting their own machine by following a series of instructions to copy, paste, and run malicious commands under the pretext of fixing an issue, completing a CAPTCHA verification, or registering their device.

Proofpoint said it first detected Kimsuky using ClickFix in January and February 2025 as part of a phishing campaign that targeted individuals in less than five organizations in the think tank sector.

"TA427 made initial contact with the target through a meeting request from a [spoofed sender](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/nsa-fbi-alert-on-n-korean-hackers.html) delivered to traditional TA427 targets working on North Korean affairs," the Proofpoint research team said.

"After a brief conversation to engage the target and build trust, as is often seen in TA427 activity, the attackers directed the target to an attacker-controlled site where they convinced the target to run a PowerShell command."

The attack chain, the company explained, initiated a multi-stage sequence that culminated in the deployment of an open-source remote access trojan named Quasar RAT.

The email message purported to originate from a Japanese diplomat and asked the recipient to arrange a meeting with the Japanese ambassador to the United States. Over the course of the conversation, the threat actors sent a malicious PDF that contained a link to another document with a list of questions to be discussed during the meeting.

Clicking on the link directed the victim to a fake landing page mimicking the Japanese Embassy website, which then prompted them to register their device by copying and pasting a command into the Windows Run dialog in order to download the questionnaire.

"The ClickFix PowerShell command fetches and executes a second remotely hosted PowerShell command, which displayed the decoy PDF referenced earlier in the chain (Questionnaire.pdf) to the user," Proofpoint said. "The document claimed to be from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan and contained questions regarding nuclear proliferation and policy in Northeast Asia."

The second PowerShell script is configured to create a Visual Basic Script that runs every 19 minutes by means of a scheduled task, which, in turn, downloads two batch scripts that create, decode, and execute the Quasar RAT payload. It's worth pointing out that a variation of this attack chain was [previously documented](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-hackers-exploit-powershell.html) by Microsoft in February 2025.
