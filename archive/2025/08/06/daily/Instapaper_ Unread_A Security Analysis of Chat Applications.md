Choosing the right messaging app is more important than ever. With increasing concerns over how data is hanadled, many users turn to secure messaging platforms to protect their communication. Among the most popular are **Signal**, **WhatsApp**, and **Telegram**, all of which offer some level of end-to-end encryption. However, the depth of their security features, encryption implementation, and overall privacy protections vary widely.

In this blog post, we want to delve into the detailed security analysis of these three apps based on an [article](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/071.pdf) published by researchers from Politehnica University of Bucharest to understand some details related to app security.

### **Signal**

Signal has earned a reputation as the most secure messaging app available. It uses the **Signal Protocol**, widely regarded as the most secure encryption protocol. This protocol ensures that only the sender and the intended recipient can read the messages, effectively shielding the communication from prying eyes, including hackers and even the service provider.

**Key Security Features**:

* **End-to-End Encryption by Default**: Signal encrypts messages before they leave your device and only decrypts them when they reach the recipient.
* **Open Source**: Signal's code is publicly available, allowing security experts to scrutinize it and identify any vulnerabilities.
* **Advanced Privacy Tools**: Signal offers features like disappearing messages, which automatically delete after a set period, and contact verification to ensure you are communicating with the right person.

While Signal’s encryption is highly robust, forensic analysis has revealed that certain types of data can still be vulnerable if physical access to the device is gained. For example, if an attacker gains physical control of the user’s phone, they may be able to retrieve deleted messages, timestamps, and contact information. However, Signal’s developers are constantly working to patch these types of vulnerabilities, maintaining the app’s position as the leader in secure messaging.

#### Forensic Analysis of Signal:

Forensics on Signal require advanced tools like **the UFED Physical Analyzer**. While Signal’s secure encryption keeps data safe from external attacks, physical attacks on the device can reveal deleted information, making physical security of devices essential. Certain smartphone models and operating systems may also have different levels of vulnerability.

### **WhatsApp**

With over 2 billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app, but popularity comes with its own set of risks. WhatsApp also uses **end-to-end encryption**, but unlike Signal, it employs the **WhatsApp Protocol**, which is a slightly modified version of the **XMPP protocol** (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). While encryption is strong during communication, WhatsApp has been the subject of scrutiny for its connection to Meta (formerly Facebook), a company with a well-known history of data collection.

**Key Security Features**:

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Like Signal, WhatsApp ensures that messages are encrypted from sender to receiver.
* **User-Friendly Encryption**: Encryption happens by default, without the need for users to enable any special features.
* **Backup Encryption Concerns**: While WhatsApp encrypts messages in transit, backups stored on the cloud may not always be encrypted, especially when saved to services like Google Drive or iCloud.

The security issues with WhatsApp largely stem from its massive user base and its association with Meta. In recent years, vulnerabilities in the app have been discovered that allow attackers to execute malicious code via video calls or exploit flaws in the app’s memory management. This, combined with Meta’s data collection practices, can leave users feeling uneasy about their privacy, even though their messages are encrypted.

#### Forensic Analysis of WhatsApp:

WhatsApp stores backups locally and in the cloud. These backups can be decrypted if attackers manage to gain access to the backup files and encryption keys. Forensic analysis has shown that chat logs, contact information, and other personal data can be extracted from WhatsApp backups using tools like **UFED Physical Analyzer**. Vulnerabilities in **AES encryption** have also been exploited in the past, highlighting potential risks in Android-based WhatsApp implementations.

#### Notable Security Breaches:

In 2022, a massive data breach occurred when an API vulnerability allowed hackers to scrape and sell the phone numbers of active WhatsApp users, which were later used for phishing and vishing attacks. Other vulnerabilities include:

* **CVE-2021-24043**: Out-of-bounds heap read during video calls.
* **CVE-2020-1909**: A use-after-free error, potentially leading to code execution.

### **Telegram: Convenience with Security Trade-offs**

Telegram is widely recognized for its speed and user-friendly interface, but it has faced criticism for its approach to security. Unlike Signal and WhatsApp, Telegram does not enable end-to-end encryption by default. Only its **Secret Chats** feature provides true end-to-end encryption, which means that most users’ regular chats are stored on Telegram’s servers and encrypted using the **MTProto protocol**. While MTProto provides encryption, storing encryption keys on the server introduces a potential vulnerability, as attackers could gain access to those keys.

**Key Security Features**:

* **MTProto Protocol**: Telegram's custom encryption protocol secures communication between clients and servers, but not between users unless Secret Chats are enabled.
* **Cloud-Based Messages**: Regular chats are stored in Telegram’s cloud, allowing users to access their messages from multiple devices. However, this raises concerns about data privacy.
* **Optional End-to-End Encryption**: Only Secret Chats are encrypted from device to device, which means that users must manually enable this feature for enhanced security.

Forensics shows that Telegram stores a significant amount of user data in its internal memory, including chat logs, voice call logs, contact lists, and media files. This makes Telegram less secure than its competitors in cas...
