Chipmaker Nvidia to invest $5bn in rival Intel

=Nvidia, the leading manufacturer of artificial intelligence chips, said it will buy a $5bn stake in Intel – a lifeline for its struggling rival on the heels of a separate investment from the US government.

The deal, announced on Thursday, will involve a partnership between the two American companies to make personal computer and data centre chips, as demand for AI continues to surge and companies seek to power massive data centres.

It will make Nvidia one of of Intel’s biggest shareholders, with a roughly 4% stake in the troubled semiconductor company.

> Intel’s stock surged more than 25% on news of the deal, which could boost the once-dominant chipmaker. Shares in Nvidia rose roughly 3%.

Nvidia is motivated to invest in Intel in order to diversify some production away from other competitors – notably, Taiwan’s TSMC, said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. The chip giant is “now in the mode of investing in other companies in the AI ecosystem in order to keep the momentum for the emerging technology,” Mr Luria said.=

Can one of those academic type smart people prove and write paper on this plz so i can say i was right though

“While Google Scholar contains research on social media echo chambers contributing to polarization and radicalization, no studies directly link echo chambers to protesters being run over. Research shows echo chambers reinforce like-minded opinions, increase susceptibility to radicalization and extremist violence by amplifying extremist narratives, and may lead to physical confrontations. However, a direct causal link to specific violent acts like protesters being run over has not been established in the academic literature found. ”

Im pretty sure that all these things can be linked to active warfare and all but im lazy and also get no benefit from proving it so

@ not important, ALL,

**QR codes have less security than URLs**

With regards the “Quick Response”(QR) codes they are simply a “Display / Printing technology” “for easy of machines” not humans. Because they were designed in times before security was even considered necessary in “Display technology”.

So two things apply,

1, There is NO security implicit in their design.
2, They are deliberately designed NOT to be read by humans[1].

Whilst the first also applies to URLs the second does not, in fact the opposite.

These two fundemental QR Code design issues combined actually mean,

3, QR Codes are implicitly LESS secure than human readable URLs and always will be.

If people go back on this web site they will find I was well aware of this,

“‘Human can not read’ security issue”

Decades ago.

As I’d run head first into it with “Transaction Authorisation Codes”(TACs not TANs) back before the start of this century[2] when most people had not even seen a QR Code in use.

As is normal with any new technology, QR Codes failings with regards,

“Surveillance on and security of the user.”

Whilst clear to one or two, will not be seen by the majority of humans. However they majority will see “Convenience” and it’s that which drives technology take up (not novelty or ‘keeping up with the Jetsons’).

Then after a short while of increasing use of a new technology, somebody with nefarious intent will abuse it for their personal gain at the expense or harm of others.

And once more “widely known” the increase in the abuse of a new technology generally grows at a rate greater than the that of the new technology growth increases[3].

But the real problem with QR Codes like any “Domain conversion code” is it is the equivalent of a “Transducer” that carries information objects from one physical measurement domain to another. The fundamental laws of nature say that any such process must be “inefficient”. Thus information will escape as a “side channel”. From the “redundancy” needed to carry information it logically follows that such a side channel carries information both overtly and covertly.

Consider QR Codes as not “Black and white” but “All shades of grey” unlike human eyes where the nerves have a logarithmic response, the sensors in an electronic device like a video camera tend to be designed for linear sensitivity in a given range.

The human will see the QR Code as just a pattern of “dark and light squares”. The camera however will see each small square as a value of grey. As these values can be reliably determined by the use of differential coding and forward error correction then considerably more data can be hidden in a QR Code than most would even have realised. That is each square acts not as a single bit, but the equivalent of four or five bits. Such is the fun of “covert channels”.

[1] This “can not be read by humans” was actually seen as a “security benefit” by some… This was because it was argued it would reduce “stock loss” because only authorised people with very expensive readers would be able to know what was in the shipping container / box / bag.

[2] Back last century as part of “On Line Banking” I was looking to “Authenticate the transaction” not rely on the totally insecure “authenticate the communications channel” that was easily defeated by,

2.1, “Man In The Middle”(MITM) attacks.
2.2, “Covert Side Channel”(CSC) attacks.

So I needed a reliable way to knock both issues out of the “Authenticate the transaction but make it easy for human use, to “ensure that”,

“Humans were IN the authentication loop/chain, not forced out.”

So I was looking for in effect the opposite of a QR Code, that is I wanted a,

“Difficult to read by machine, easy to read by human authentication cod...
