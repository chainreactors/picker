Integrate ANY.RUN Threat Intelligence Feeds with Your Security Platform

The ANY.RUN [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_integration&utm_term=110624&utm_content=linktotifeeds) provide data on the known indicators of compromise: malicious IPs, URLs, domains, files, and ports.

The data is collected and pre-processed from malware and phishing samples analyzed by our community of 500,000 researchers in the [ANY.RUN sandbox environment](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_integration&utm_term=110624&utm_content=linktolanding).

## How ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds Help Organizations

Cyber Threat Intelligence Feeds from ANY.RUN extend the threat coverage of your SIEM and TIP systems. They provide IOCs of recently seen cyber threats so you can proactively prepare to defend your infrastructure against them, as well as:

* **Expand Threat Coverage**: Improve system’s ability to detect emerging malware and phishing attacks.

* **Improve Incident Response**: Enrich incident response processes with contextual data, providing deeper insights into threats and their behaviors.

* **Strengthen Security Posture**: Ensure proactive defense against new and evolving threats.

* **Optimize Threat Hunting**: Streamline threat hunting activities, identifying and investigating potential threats more effectively.

Feeds are easy to use. It’s practically a plug and play solution (as long as your team is already using a SIEM or TIP system).

## Indicators Provided by ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds

The IOCs include information on malicious IP addresses, domain names, and URLs, enriched with contextual details such as related files and ports.

### IP addresses

IP addresses are important for detecting and preventing malicious network activity. They serve as digital markers of cybercriminal operations, often linked to Command-and-Control (C2) servers or phishing campaigns.

By analyzing IP addresses, cybersecurity teams can identify and block malicious sources, trace attack origins and monitor threat patterns.

### Domains

Domains are often used as staging points for cyberattacks. They provide a higher-level view of malicious activity, often connecting multiple IPs or malware instances within a single campaign.

ANY.RUN’s TI feeds provide comprehensive information about domains, including all the details available for IP addresses, such as threat names, types, detection timestamps, and related file hashes.

### URLs

URL addresses serve as gateways to distribute malware, execute phishing campaigns, or redirect users to malicious content. Their flexibility and ease of use make them a preferred tool for attackers.

By analyzing URLs, cybersecurity teams can uncover attack patterns, block harmful traffic, and prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.

## Key Features of ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds

* **Fresh Indicators:** Mined from the latest samples uploaded to our interactive sandbox by a global network of over 500,000 security professionals and updated in real time.
* **Contextual Information**: Offer more than just IOCs by providing direct links to sandbox sessions that include memory dumps, network traffic, and events.
* **Rigorous Pre-Processing**: Advanced algorithms and proprietary technology used for data filtering and validation.
* **STIX and MISP Formats**: Deliver threat intelligence feeds in the STIX and MISP formats, making it easy for security teams to integrate our data into their existing infrastructure.
