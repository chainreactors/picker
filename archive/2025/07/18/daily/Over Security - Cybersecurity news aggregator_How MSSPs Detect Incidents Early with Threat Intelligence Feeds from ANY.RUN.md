How MSSPs Detect Incidents Early with Threat Intelligence Feeds from ANY.RUN

Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) are tasked with protecting multiple clients simultaneously while maintaining cost efficiency, rapid response times, and customer trust. The key to success lies in early threat detection, which requires access to high-quality, actionable threat intelligence that can be immediately applied across diverse client environments.

## Main MSSP Challenges

MSSPs operate in a complex environment where they must deliver consistent security outcomes across varied client infrastructures.

Resource constraints create additional pressure. False positives consume valuable analyst time, while missed threats can damage client relationships and business reputation.

The heterogeneous nature of client environments means MSSPs must work with different security tools, network architectures, and threat landscapes. Additionally, MSSPs must [demonstrate clear value to clients](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/expertware-success-story/) while competing on both service quality and cost.

## Threat Intelligence Feeds: Boosting MSSP Performance

Threat intelligence turns raw data into actionable insights, helping MSSPs prioritize threats, streamline workflows, and [respond quickly](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-feeds-in-incident-response/). Real-time, high-quality intelligence reduces false positives, improves detection accuracy, and optimizes resource use, enhancing client outcomes.

High-quality threat intelligence feeds are crucial for MSSPs to stay ahead of threats. They provide:

* **Timely Data**: Fresh indicators of compromise ([IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-we-process-iocs/)) enable rapid action before threats spread.

* **Contextual Insights**: Detailed threat behavior data supports informed decision-making.

* **Scalable Integration**: Feeds must work seamlessly across varied client systems.

* **Automation Support**: Automated integration speeds up responses and reduces manual effort.

## How ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds Help MSSPs Keep Ahead

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_for_mssps&utm_term=170725&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_for_mssps&utm_term=170725&utm_content=linktofeedslanding) empower Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to [detect threats early](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-investigate-phishing-attacks/) across diverse client infrastructures, delivering real-time, context-enriched indicators of active threat campaigns.

By integrating these feeds, MSSPs can optimize their workflows and directly support their clients’ business objectives. The key benefits of ANY.RUN’s feeds are designed to enhance operational efficiency and drive measurable business outcomes for MSSPs and their clients.

### **Expanding Threat Monitoring and Detection Across All Clients**

ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds draw from a vast, reliable data source, collecting threat indicators from live sandbox investigations of the latest threats by security teams at [15,000 organizations worldwide](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/). Updated in real time, these feeds provide fresh malicious IPs, domains, and URLs that have been used by threat actors for only a short period.

This near-instant delivery ensures MSSPs can spot threats that are still active right now across all client systems, whether they’re cloud-based or traditional setups. By catching threats early, MSSPs protect clients’ operations, prevent disruptions, and maintain trust across their customer base.

Improve threat visibility across all clients with TI Feeds
