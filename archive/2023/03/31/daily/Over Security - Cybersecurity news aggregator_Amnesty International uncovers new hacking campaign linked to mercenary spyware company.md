# Amnesty International uncovers new hacking campaign linked to mercenary spyware company

A sophisticated hacking campaign by a mercenary spyware company targeting Google’s Android operating system has been exposed by Amnesty International’s Security Lab.

The technical findings were shared with [Google’s Threat Analysis Group,](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/spyware-vendors-use-0-days-and-n-days-against-popular-platforms/) which focuses on countering government-backed cyberattacks. As a result, Google along with other affected vendors, including Samsung, were able to release security updates protecting billions of Android, Chrome and Linux users from the exploit techniques used in this attack.

Amnesty International is not naming the company while the Security Lab continues to track and investigate its activity. However, the attack showed all the hallmarks of an advanced spyware campaign developed by a commercial cyber-surveillance company and sold to governments hackers to carry out targeted spyware attacks.

> Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of Security Lab, Amnesty International

“Unscrupulous spyware companies pose a real danger to the privacy and security of everyone. We urge people to ensure they have the latest security updates on their devices,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab.

“While it is vital such vulnerabilities are fixed, this is merely a sticking plaster to a global spyware crisis. We urgently need a global moratorium on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until robust human rights regulatory safeguards are in place, otherwise sophisticated cyberattacks will continue to be used as a tool of repression against activists and journalists.”

Amnesty International’s Security Lab actively monitors and investigates companies and governments who proliferate and abuse cyber-surveillance technologies which pose a fundamental threat to human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society.

On Monday, in a significant step to address the spyware crisis, US President Biden signed an executive order restricting the government’s of use of commercial spyware technology that poses a threat to human rights. The move sends a strong message to other governments to take similar action.

## Zero-day attack

The Security Lab’s findings allowed Google, in December 2022, to capture a new zero-day exploit chain used to hack Android devices.  Zero-day exploits are particularly dangerous as they enable attackers to compromise even fully patched and updated phones, as the vulnerability is unknown to the developer.

The newly discovered spyware campaign has been active since at least 2020 and targeted mobile and desktop devices, including users of Google’s Android operating system. The spyware and zero-day exploits were delivered from an extensive network of more than 1000 malicious domains, including domains spoofing media websites in multiple countries.

Amnesty International has [published](https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/tree/master/2023-03-29_android_campaign) details of the domains and infrastructure it identified as associated with the attack on GitHub to aid civil society in investigating and responding to these attacks.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group found that Android users in the United Arab Emirates were targeted with one-time attack links sent over SMS which, if clicked, would install the spyware on the target’s phone. Human rights defenders in the UAE have long been victimized by spyware tools from cyber-surveillance companies such as NSO Group and Hacking Team over the past decade, including [Ahmed Mansoor](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/uae-ahmed-mansoor-unlawfully-detained-in-solitary-confinement-for-three-years-must-be-released/), who was targeted with spyware from both companies, and subsequently jailed by UAE authorities in response to his human rights work.
