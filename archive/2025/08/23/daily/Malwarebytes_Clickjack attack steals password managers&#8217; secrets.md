# Clickjack attack steals password managers’ secrets

Posted: August 22, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

Sometimes it can seem as though everything’s toxic online, and the latest good thing turned bad is here: Browser pop-ups that look like they’re trying to help or authenticate you could be programmed to steal data from your password manager. To make matters worse, most browser extension-based [password managers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) are still vulnerable to the attack.

This issue affects password managers like 1Password, LastPass, NordPass, and Enpass. They’re online services that store all your access credentials in an encrypted vault, and they use browser extensions to automatically fill in those passwords on web forms when you need them. Because they use extensions, you have to install them separately in your browser.

These extension-based password managers are more secure than those built natively into your web browser in some ways. Browser-based password managers tend to encrypt information using your browser access credentials. Malicious infostealer software can steal the files and decrypt them easily when you’re already logged in.

Browser extension-based password managers store encrypted vaults in memory or in other locations on your computer. They auto-lock after activity and instead of using operating system-level encryption, they use a separate master password. But while they have their benefits, nothing’s ever completely safe.

## Clickjacking’s back

At the DEFCON security conference this month, cybersecurity researcher Marek Tóth [presented an attack](https://marektoth.com/blog/dom-based-extension-clickjacking/) that works on most browser extension-based password managers. It uses malicious code to manipulate the structure of the site in the browser, changing the way it looks and behaves.

Tóth, who was just demonstrating the attack to highlight the vulnerability, used this capability for a new version of an old attack called [clickjacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/adult-sites-trick-users-into-liking-facebook-posts-using-a-clickjack-trojan). It persuades a victim to click on one thing on a web page but then uses that action to click something else.

Messing with the structure of the site enabled him to make certain things invisible. One of these is a drop-down selector that extension-based password managers use to select and fill in account login credentials.

He used this trick to put an invisible overlay on top of a seemingly legitimate clickable element on the screen. When the user clicks it, they’re actually clicking on the overlay—which is their password manager’s dropdown selector.

The result: the password manager gives up the victim’s secrets without their knowledge.

## Think twice about what you click

What would a decoy popup look like? These days, thanks to regulations from the EU, web sites often throw up permission banners that ask you if you’re OK with them using [cookies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies). Most of us just click ‘yes’, but no matter what you click, an attack like this could put you at risk. Or an attacker could use an [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) button, or a “This content is sensitive, click yes if you rea...
