# How to work from home securely, the NSA way

Posted: February 27, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

People working remotely is no longer unusual, so the National Security Agency (NSA) has produced a short [Best Practices PDF document](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Feb/22/2003165170/-1/-1/0/CSI_BEST_PRACTICES_FOR_SECURING_YOUR_HOME_NETWORK.PDF) detailing how remote workers can keep themselves safe from harm. In fact, the guide can also be applied to people using computers at home generally and is written in a way that’s easy to understand.

## Back to basics

The NSA’s three main executive summary points are:

* Upgrade and update all equipment and software regularly, including routing devices
* Back up your data and disconnecting any devices you can
* Limit administration to the internal network only

You may be surprised by how seemingly basic these suggestions are given the source, but this simplicity is in its favour. Consider how many folks will only decide to start making backups once they’ve lost everything for the first time. You have to start somewhere, and not every organisation asking employees to work from home has necessarily considered these opening talking points due to budget, resources, or other factors. They may not even *have* a budget for work-owned devices, and may instead be relying on employees using their own devices.

Even thinking about who has access to what on a home network is beneficial—there’s nothing wrong with limiting access to guests on the home network, for example. Some routers and packages allow you to isolate guests on their own little network, away from the main one. This can help reduce the spread and impact of an infection, and keep all of those valuable work and / or home documents safe.

Much of the NSA’s advice leans heavily into ensuring all the little things are taken care of:

* **Keep your software up to date.** From Windows to your web browser, everything needs to be updated regularly.
* **Keep your router updated**. This may sound odd if your router is supplied by your ISP, as many of those update automatically. But if you run an off-the-shelf router you may be fully responsible for its overall wellbeing. This isn’t mentioned, but you should consider changing the default password when you first boot up the router. Without some hunting around on the Internet, you may never know if what’s shipped is a default applied to multiple routers, or if it’s unique to you.
* **Use a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) and two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa))**. The guide highlights that while some form of 2FA is better than nothing, [some types of 2FA are better than others](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication-on-twitter-using-a-hardware-key).
* **Separate work and life activities**. It’s a lot easier to figure out where a breach happened if you don’t have sensitive work documents scattered across 3 personal devices.
* **Connect to your office with a [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn)**. Using a work-supplied VPN makes your computer part of the work network, keeping data safe as it travels over the Internet.

## Getting physical about security

There’s a strong focus on physical device security of one kind or another too, which...
