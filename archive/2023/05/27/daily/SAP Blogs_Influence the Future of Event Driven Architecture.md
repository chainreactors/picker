[Customer Engagement Initiatives](https://www.sap.com/germany/about/customer-involvement/influence-adopt.html) are a great option to learn, practice and influence at the same time. Soon you will get this opportunity for SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh in specific and EDAs, in an SAP context¬† and beyond, in general.

## SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh

SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh is a fully managed event streaming and management service that enables enterprise-wide and enterprise-grade event-driven architecture.

AEM offers enterprise-grade performance, reliability, security and governance. It scales up to very large use cases. SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh offers¬†**deployment options across different hyperscalers and in private cloud**¬†environments.

It can be configured to form a distributed mesh of event brokers deployed across environments in private or public clouds. A¬†full purpose set of eventing services including event streaming, event management and monitoring is provided and on top advanced features like dynamic message routing and fine-grained filtering.

Advanced Event Mesh is the infrastructure to distribute events and to effectively manage this distribution. On top, you need content (events!) that can get exposed from event sources. And you need event consumers that register to be informed on significant changes for example in an SAP business application.

In short: event driven architecture is about more than the event broker. At the same point in time the event broker is the heart of it all.

## Upcoming Customer Engagement Initiative

In order to jointly, with our customers and partners, explore event driven architecture, we plan to start a customer engagement initiative on Advanced Event Mesh and on event driven architecture in an SAP context.

The goals of this upcoming CEI are to:

* Validate Event driven use cases across industries

* Get feedback about current and future planned product functionalities and features

* Validate the integration with SAP Event Sources, Event Consumers and SAP Integration Suite

The main focus will be Advanced Event Mesh and SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP SuccessFactors solutions as event sources. This will include a deep dive into the new SAP S/4HANA event enablement options based on RAP.

## Details and Registration

You can learn about the details of the customer engagement initiative [here](https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3446).¬† This is where you can register as well if you are interested in participating.

The registration is open for customers and partners until June 16th 2023.
