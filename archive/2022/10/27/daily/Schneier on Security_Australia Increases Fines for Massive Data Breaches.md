## Australia Increases Fines for Massive Data Breaches

After suffering [two](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-25/medibank-breach-ahm-osch-cyber-attack-data-what-to-do/101574200) large, and embarrassing, data breaches in recent weeks, the Australian government [increased](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-21/data-breach-fines-increase-after-medibank-optus-hacks/101564614) the fine for serious data breaches from $2.2 million to a minimum of $50 million. (That’s $50 million AUD, or $32 million USD.)

This is a welcome change. The problem is one of incentives, and Australia has now increased the incentive for companies to secure the personal data or their users and customers.

EDITED TO ADD (10/15): I got the details wrong. One, this is a proposed increase. Two, the amount of $50 million AUD is only applicable in very few cases.

@All

per a MSM report on the Medibank Health Insurer, the data breach appears to be not just exfiltration of data but ransom-ware demand for non-disclosure of the information.

What was taken was the complete health records of ALL 3.9 million customers

The standard echo of “Here’s what you can do to protect yourself now…” clearly is the barn leaving the horse.

There isn’t anything a person can do to protect themselves, because we no longer have any control whatsoever about the data kept about us in every possible digital format, in every repository, by any government.

@All

re: *The problem is one of incentives…*

Incentives implies the DESIRE to do something additional provided there is COMPENSATION in alignment with the task at hand.

Penalties are applied as PUNISHMENT for non-conforming practices as defined by jurisdiction and social norms and REDUCE COMPENSATION.

Penalties are not Incentives.

* Incentives would be if companies see better profits and larger market shares if they did Better Security then they would get more money.
* Penalties are applied because there isn’t any added revenue for doing better. It’s all cash out-of-their-corporate-pockets.

It’s such a small amount of cash in relation to their profits, companies are more than able to pay fines and penalties or to challenge these in courts. They pay large retainers for legal services so they might as well get their money’s worth.

There are many arguments about whether penalties reduce non-compliance. In many studies the answer is not-by-much.

@ Bruce,

Re : “to a minimum of $50 million”

> “This is a welcome change. The problem is one of incentives, and Australia has now increased the incentive”

And a nice little revenue earner and sound bite platform for politicians

And a nice little revenue earner in the short term, but not for the victims but for the Government, and sound bite platform for politicians. Of a Government who are known to be run by a bunch of crooks…

Minimum fines, are a “No No” they are not justice but an oportunity to “strut” and fill the gap left by diminishing tax base.

Because of that the long term effect will be the victims will be left more vulnerable. Because data will go abroad, and jobs will go abroad. Any company left in Australia with data concerns will in effect become a shell with losses not assets so the fine becomes irrelevant, and Australia will be the poorer just for a little crooked polititian vanity…

Fines are not the way to get “corporate responsability” they are tax deductable so not real, and they do not in any way change corporate behaviour.

Mandatory minimun fines will only encorage the likes of the large accounting and law partnerships who are “limited liability” anyway to sell schemes to negate the effects of the fines. We know this because we’ve seen similar before in various other Western Nations the UK and US being just two amongst many.

Like “insurance” has been a failure for victims of such corporate irresponsability “minimum fines” are just not going to change short term thinking corporate behaviour.

The only way to start stoping it is to have “people own their own data” and all Directors and their advisors getting lengthy prison sentances and the only way that is going to happen is when the fiction of,

“Any person “legal” or natural”

Is dropped and one or two other changes such as getting rid of certain tax alowances that “natural persons” do not get but “legal person” corporates do get.

Someone will no doubt point out that the majority of poliricians are “bought and payed for” by corporate lobbyists and political funders and the like, with money that comes via those tax advantages “legal person” corporates have… So they will say that polititians/legislators will never pass the legislation…

Which is the point realy and why this “Minimum Fine” is going to be a nonsense and do more harm than good.

Mmm, yes let’s punish the victim; that will teach them a lesson!

Who does the Australian government pay when they have a data breach?

…to hide data breaches better.

Fines are not incentives to change. When people get fined for speeding they buy a radar detector so they don’t get caught again.

This is government protecting their corporate pals while everyone’s personal information hangs in the balance.

Complete nonsense.
