Spain's National Court has [agreed](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/en/Judiciary/National-High-Court/Judicial-News/La-Audiencia-Nacional-accede-a-extraditar-a-EE-UU--a-un-joven-por-jaquear-Twitter-de-Biden--Obama-y-Bill-Gates-y-por-extorsion-a-traves-de-redes-sociales) to extradite a 23-year-old UK national to the US for his role in the 2020 Twitter hack.

Joseph James O'Connor was [arrested](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-arrested-connection-alleged-role-twitter-hack) by Spanish authorities at the request of the US government in July 2021 and has fought his extradition since.

He is accused of working together with three other individuals to hack into Twitter's internal network in July 2020.

The group gained access to one of Twitter's internal Slack channels, where they found credentials for Twitter's moderation panel.

The group used this panel to access and post tweets promoting a cryptocurrency scam on 130 Twitter accounts belonging to high-profile politicians, celebrities, and companies, such as Apple, Uber, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and US presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.

Two weeks after the hack, the FBI and Justice Department [arrested and charged](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/three-individuals-charged-alleged-roles-twitter-hack) three individuals connected to the hack, two from the US and one from the UK.

* **Nima Fazeli**, aka "Rolex," 23, of Orlando, Florida.
* **Graham Ivan Clark,** aka "Kirk," 18 of Tampa, Florida.
* **Mason Sheppard**, aka "Chaewon," 20, of Bognor Regis, in the United Kingdom.

Infosec reporter Brian Krebs [identified](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/07/whos-behind-wednesdays-epic-twitter-hack/) O'Connor (who went online as "[PlugwalkJoe](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/plugwalkjoe-does-the-perp-walk/)" or "j0e") as one of the hackers immediately after the original hack.

Besides hacking Twitter, the DOJ also charged O'Connor with hacking TikTok and Snapchat user accounts and cyberstalking an unnamed victim.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**GoDaddy data breach:** Web hosting provider GoDaddy has discovered a multi-year breach, the company said in [SEC filings](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971123000031/gddy-20221231.htm) last week. GoDaddy says a sophisticated threat actor installed malware on its systems and even managed to steal some of its source code. The company says it discovered the breach in December 2022, when it found the group's malware on its cPanel hosting servers. GoDaddy says the malware was being used to redirect traffic from some customer websites to malicious sites.

**FBI breach:** The FBI is investigating a potential breach of its internal network. The breach allegedly involves an FBI computer system used in investigations of images of child sexual exploitation. The FBI described the incident as "malicious cyber activity" and told *[CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/17/politics/fbi-cyber-incident-computer-network/index.html)* the breach had been contained.

**Crypto-heist #1:** DeFi trading service Platypus says an attacker [stole $8.5 million](https://archive.ph/NQh9q) worth of cryptocurrency assets after exploiting a [flash loan attack](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-flash-loan-attacks) in its service. Platypus says the exploit targeted a logic error in its implementation of USP, a token issued by Polaris Finance. Just like all respectable cryptocurrency platforms, Platypus says it contacted the hacker to beg and grovel for its money back. Apologies, we mean "negotiate a bounty in exchange for return of the funds."

**Crypto-heist #2:** On the same note, DeFi platform Dexible was [hacked](https://archive.ph/E6YAe) as well. The platform allegedly lost $2 million after an attacker exploited a vulnerability in a recent trading contract Dexible added to its service. So glad the cryptocurrency community incessantly brags about how they're superior to the old-fashioned banking system, yet they get hacked every time they update their platforms.

**Applied Materials indirect losses:** Semiconductor technology company Applied Materials expects to lose around $250 million in the next quarter after a ransomware attack on one of its suppliers has disrupted its supply chain. Applied Materials didn't name the supplier, but *[The Record](https://therecord.media/applied-materials-supply-chain-mks-ransomware-attack/)* believes the company may be engineering firm MKS Instruments after the firm postponed an earnings call a week before due to a ransomware attack.

### **General tech and privacy**

**DMCA and GDPR abuse:** Spanish company Eliminalia is behind a wave of fake GDPR and DMCA complaints that have flooded tech companies over the past year and have been used to remove articles and stories exposing financial fraud and corruption. The company advertises its services to the rich and wealthy, such as politicians, business moguls, and shady companies. According to a [report](https://forbiddenstories.org/story-killers/the-gravediggers-eliminalia/) from investigative journalism outfit Forbidden Stories, tech giants have often sided with Eliminalia and enforced their takedown requests, even if they were blatantly fake.

> "In January 2020, Gallardo filed a claim with Digital Ocean, Pagina 66's US-based hosting provider, alleging that Sánchez had copied his content illegally. As proof, Gallardo linked to a third-party site that had published a replica of Sánchez's piece, but with a falsified earlier publish date and fake author: Humberto Herrera Rincón Gallardo.
>
> This time, the strategy worked. Digital Ocean ordered Sánchez to remove his article from Página 66's site, or it would go black. He appealed to Digital Ocean but was unsuccessful."

**Meta Verified rolls out:** Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has [announced](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114993498750111) a paid verification feature that will let Facebook and Instagram users verify their accounts using a government ID. Zuckerberg says this feature, named [Meta Verified](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/testing-meta-verified-to-help-creators/), will allow users to add a verified blue badge to their accounts, get extra protections against impersonation attacks, and direct access to customer support representatives. The feature is expected to launch later this year in Australia and New Zealand and will cost $11.99/month on the web or $14.99/month on iOS.

**Twitter 2FA drama:** Twitter will disable SMS-based two-factor authentication for anyone who has not paid for Twitter Blue on March 20, 2023. After that date, norm...
