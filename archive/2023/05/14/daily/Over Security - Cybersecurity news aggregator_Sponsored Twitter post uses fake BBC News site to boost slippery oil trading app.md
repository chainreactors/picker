# Sponsored Twitter post uses fake BBC News site to boost slippery oil trading app

Posted: May 12, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A sponsored post on Twitter promises to offer the benefits of obtaining citizenship, but really just wants to lure you into some form of Forex trading [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) scheme. This tangled web also includes faked BBC web pages and suspicious-looking website reviews to round the whole thing off. Shall we take a look?

Sponsored posts are adverts in the form of a Tweet. They’re paid for by the advertiser, and can end up in a variety of locations on your Twitter timeline. As the sponsored post FAQ [mentions](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/overview/what-are-promoted-ads.html), you won’t necessarily find them on the profile page of the advertiser. This is something scammers may take advantage of, as rogue ads become a bit of a needle in a haystack to find.

This [particular sponsored Tweet](https://twitter.com/JenClone/status/1656216249142067203) has been impacted by Twitter’s community notes feature, where users can add [collaborative corrections](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/community-notes) to mis / disinformation and scams. The tweet is also from a Twitter Blue subscriber, which can grant [additional visibility](https://www.slashgear.com/1147584/musk-expands-twitter-blue-perks-with-more-visibility-and-longer-video-uploads/) as a subscriber perk.

![A sponsored tweet claiming to illustrate the benefits of being British.](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/easset_upload_file90470_266028_e.jpg)

The Tweet reads as follows:

> “Check out what benefits you can get if you are British”

The Community Notes added to this tweet state:

> The link, via many redirects, goes to a fake BBC news page promoting an ‘automated trading platform’ scam.

Clicking the link while using [a VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) or the TOR browser, which places you outside the UK, results in an “advertorial” for an article promoting a UK-based immigration advice firm. It is listed on the UK’s Law Society website as a recognised legal practice so that, at least, is on the level.

Clicking the link while appearing to be located in the UK gives an entirely different result, in the form of the previously mentioned fake BBC news article. This kind of scam page has been popular with fraudsters for years. Nothing beats the appearance of credibility like aping a major news organisation!

The focus of the fake site is a get rich quick scheme, via the medium of big oil profits and a supposedly withheld TV show. From the article:

> “Dragons’ Den” makes Brits rich with oil! The episode may not be broadcast – the broadcaster is furious!

The popular program Dragons’ Den—the UK equivalent of the US show “Shark Tank”, a talent show-style competition for inventors and business people in the UK—is the initial hook.

From the site text:

> (BBC) – The Dragons Den Series 17 is over and viewers can once again look forward to very interesting products and ideas. However, one episode of the show may not be broadcast. This episode is about a system with which Brits people can easily earn £7393.39 f...
