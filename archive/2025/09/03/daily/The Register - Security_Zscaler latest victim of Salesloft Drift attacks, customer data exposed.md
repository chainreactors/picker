Zscaler is the latest company to disclose some of its customers' data was exposed in the recent spate of Salesloft Drift attacks affecting Salesforce databases.

"Following a detailed review as part of our ongoing investigation, we have determined that these credentials have allowed limited access to some Zscaler Salesforce information," the cloud security shop's VP and Chief Information Security Officer Sam Curry [said](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/company-news/salesloft-drift-supply-chain-incident-key-details-and-zscaler-s-response) in an August 30 blog.

The stolen information includes Salesforce-related content including names, business email addresses, job titles, phone numbers, regional/location details, Zscaler product licensing and commercial information, and plain text content from certain support cases — although Zscaler noted "this does NOT include attachments, files, and images."
