## DarkGate reloaded via malvertising and SEO poisoning campaigns

August 23, 2023

[Jerome Segura](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/jseguramalwarebytes-com/)

In July 2023, we observed a malvertising campaign that lured potential victims to a fraudulent site for a Windows IT management tool. Unlike previous similar attacks, the final payload was packaged differently and not immediately recognizable.

The decoy file came as an MSI installer containing an AutoIT script where the payload was obfuscated to avoid detection. Upon analysis and comparison, we determined that this sample was an updated version of DarkGate, a multi purpose malware toolkit first identified in 2018.

Since the malware’s obfuscation and encryption features have been recently documented by other researchers, we will focus on two of its web delivery methods, namely the use of malicious ads and search engine poisoning.

The campaigns we observed coincide with an announcement from DarkGate’s developer in June as well, boasting about the malware’s new capabilities and limited customer seats.

## New DarkGate

In its debut back in 2018 and later in 2020, DarkGate (also known as [MehCrypter](https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/complex-obfuscation-meh/)) was distributed via torrent sites and mostly focused on [European victims and Spanish users](https://decoded.avast.io/janrubin/meh-2-2/) in particular. The original [blog post](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/enter-the-darkgate-new-cryptocurrency-mining-and-ransomware-campaign) from enSilo (now Fortinet) also notes that its author may have been using email to spread malicious attachments.

In June 2023, a threat actor going by the handle RastaFarEye posted an advertisement in the XSS underground forum about a project known as DarkGate. As [detailed](https://www.zerofox.com/blog/the-underground-economist-volume-3-issue-12/) by the ZeroFox Dark Ops intelligence team, the new version includes certain key features to evade detection while offering the expected credential stealing capabilities. The cost ($100K/year) and limited availability (10 customers) make DarkGate somewhat of an elusive toolkit.

Two blog posts came out in early August, identifying new DarkGate attacks:

* Aon’s Stroz Friedberg Incident Response Services [details](https://www.aon.com/cyber-solutions/aon_cyber_labs/darkgate-keylogger-analysis-masterofnone/) how they encountered a recent incident from a group similar to ScatteredSpider (UNC3944) that was using this new version of DarkGate.
* Researcher 0xToxin [wrote](https://0xtoxin.github.io/threat%20breakdown/DarkGate-Camapign-Analysis/) about phishing emails distributing a loader leading to DarkGate, with a complete technical analysis of the malware.

## Malvertising

While investigating malvertising campaigns, we observed the following Google ad on on July 13, 2023:

![](https://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/easset_upload_file6536_275963_e.webp)

Advanced IP Scanner is a popular tool used by IT administrators. Victims who click on the ad are presented with a decoy site:

The downloaded file (*Advanced\_IP\_Scanner\_2.5.4594.1.msi*) is an installer that contains the legitimate Advanced IP Scanner binary but also some extra files that are unpacked in the %temp% folder upon execution:

We recognize the familiar use of AutoIT which was already present in the very ...
