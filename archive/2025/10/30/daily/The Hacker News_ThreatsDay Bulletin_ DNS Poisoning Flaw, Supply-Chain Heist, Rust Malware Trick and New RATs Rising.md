The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone. Attackers are scaling down, focusing tighter, and squeezing more value from fewer, high-impact targets. At the same time, defenders face growing blind spots — from spoofed messages to large-scale social engineering.

This week’s findings show how that shrinking margin of safety is redrawing the threat landscape. Here’s what’s making headlines.

1. Hijack Loader expands its reach in Latin America

   [LATAM Targeted by PureHVNC](https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/latam-baited-into-delivery-of-purehvnc)

   Phishing emails containing SVG file attachments targeting Colombian, Spanish-speaking individuals with themes relating to the Attorney General's office of Colombia have been used to deliver [PureHVNC RAT](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/researchers-expose-svg-and-purerat.html). "The emails entice the user to download an 'official document' from the judicial information system, which starts the infection chain of executing a [Hijack Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/hijack-loader-malware-employs-process.html) executable that leads to the PureHVNC Remote Access Trojan (RAT)," IBM X-Force [said](https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/latam-baited-into-delivery-of-purehvnc). The activity was observed between August and October 2025. The findings are notable because this is the first time Hijack Loader has been used in campaigns targeting the region, in addition to using the loader to distribute PureHVNC.
2. Insider sells U.S. cyber weapons to Russia for crypto

   [Former Defense Contractor Employee Pleads Guilty to Selling Trade Secrets to Russia](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-pleads-guilty-selling-stolen-trade-secrets)

   Peter Williams, 39, an Australian national, pleaded guilty in the U.S. in connection with selling his employer's trade secrets to a Russian cyber-tools broker. Williams pleaded to two counts of theft of trade secrets stolen from U.S. defense contractor L3Harris Trenchant between 2022 and 2025. This included national-security-focused software that included at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit components that were meant to be sold exclusively to the U.S. government and select allies. "Williams sold the trade secrets to a Russian cyber-tools broker that publicly advertises itself as a reseller of cyber exploits to various customers, including the Russian government," the U.S. Department of Justice [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-pleads-guilty-selling-stolen-trade-secrets). The defendant received payment in cryptocurrency from the sale of software exploits and used the illicit proceeds to buy luxury watches and other items. Charges against Williams [came to light](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/weekly-recap-wsus-exploited-lockbit-50.html#:~:text=U.S.%20Accuses%20Former%20Government%20Contractor%20of%20Selling%20Secrets%20to%20Russia) last week. While the name of the exploit broker was not disclosed, evidence points to Operation Zero, which has previously offered up to [$4 million](https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1902665005675295186) for Telegram exploits and [$20 million](https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1706762507631677760) for tools that could be used to break into Android and iPhone devices. Operation Zero [advertises](https://opzero.ru/en/prices/) itself as the "only Russian-based zero-day vulnerability purchase platform." Earlier this August, another United Arab Emirates-based startup named Advanced Security Solutions also [announced](https://advance-sec.com/#bounty) rewards of up to $20 million for hacking tools that could help governments break into any smartphone with a text message.
3. Spoofed calls drive global fraud epidemic

   [Europol Calls for Coordinated Action Against Caller ID Spoofing](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-events/publications/position-paper-caller-id-spoofing)

   Europol has highlighted the urgent need for a coordinated, multi-faceted approach to mitigate cross-border caller ID spoofing. "Caller ID spoofing drives financial fraud and enables social engineering scams, resulting in substantial economic and societal damage, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide annually," the agency [said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-events/publications/position-paper-caller-id-spoofing). "The primary attack vectors are phone calls and texts, which allow malicious actors to manipulate the information displayed on a user's caller ID, to show a false name or number that appears legitimate and trustworthy." The technique, which accounts for roughly 64% of reported fraud cases involving phone calls and text messages, underpins a wide range of online fraud schemes and social engineering scams, costing an estimated €850 million ($990 million) worldwide each year.
4. Chrome takes final step toward full HTTPS web

   [Google Chrome to Default to HTTPS Connections Starting April 2026](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/https-by-default.html)

   To improve the security of users, Google said it will change Chrome's default settings to navigate only to websites that support [HTTPS](https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en). "We will enable the 'Always Use Secure Connections' setting in its public-sites variant by default in October 2026, with the release of Chrome 154," the tech giant [said](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/https-by-defau...
