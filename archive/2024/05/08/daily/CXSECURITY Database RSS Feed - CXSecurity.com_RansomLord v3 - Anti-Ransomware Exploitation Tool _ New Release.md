RansomLord generated PE files are saved to disk in the x32 or x64 directories where the program is run from. Goal is to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in certain strains of Ransomware by deploying exploits that defend the network! The DLLs may also provide additional coverage against generic and info stealer malwares.
RansomLord v3 release notes:
Adding six more Ransomware to the victim list for a grand total of 49
StopCrypt, RisePro, RuRansom, MoneyMessage, CryptoFortress and Onyx.
Windows event log now includes SHA256 hash of the intercepted malware.
