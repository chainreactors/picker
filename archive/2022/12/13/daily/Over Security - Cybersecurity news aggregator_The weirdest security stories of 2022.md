# The weirdest security stories of 2022

Posted: December 12, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

There’s been a lot of weird and frankly bizarre attacks over the course of 2022, nestled in amongst the usual [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) outbreaks and [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach).

Whether we’re talking social media, email, or even [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), there’s been a mind bending tale of tall behaviour in almost every corner. It’s time to forget about nation state attacks and the nagging sensation that every single piece of data ever created has ended up on a TOR site somewhere.

For one brief moment in time, we’re going to wallow in weirdness.

## 419 scams…in spaaaaaaaaaace

There’s not many individual scams which can put “18 years and counting” on their resume. However, what we have here is something very odd and very special. Way back in 2004, a spam email claimed that assistance was needed for a lost astronaut. Supposedly trapped on a top secret Soviet space station, the astronaut’s cousin implored recipients to help bring the missing astronaut home. Of course, this was tied into a nonsensical scam about recovering lots of lost money should he be brought safely back.

So yes, it’s weird…but it’s just a one off. Right?

Well, no. Turns out this baffling attempt at parting people from their money would [come back around every so often](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/10/an-18-year-scam-odyssey-of-stranded-astronauts). To be more precise, 2010, 2016, and now 2022 with a whole *new* astronaut to recover. This feels like less of a final frontier and more of a never ending, he’ll be back again in a few years frontier. See you in 2026?

## A dance off of destruction

If you’ve ever pondered how certain people give off bad vibes, you’ll be one step closer to understanding how other types of bad vibes stand a chance of destroying your hard drive. If you happened to be one of the few people running a certain type of OEM hard drive on a Windows XP desktop, Janet Jackson was someone to avoid.

How so? Because the video for Rhythm Nation [matched a resonant frequency identical to those hard drives](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/bad-rhythm-janet-jackson-song-resonates-poorly-with-some-old-hard-drives). When the two clashed, there would be only one winner and it wasn’t the hard drive.

Amazingly, it was possible to crash a second device in the same room while playing the video on the first. Even Michael wasn’t able to pull something like that off.

## Monkeying around with digital artists

Apes! NFTs! Cyberpunk! Wait, what?

In May, artists offering their wares on several platforms were approached by individuals claiming to represent the “[Cyberpunk Ape Executives](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/05/fake-cyberpunk-ape-executives-target-artists-with-malware-laden-job-offer)”, because of course they were. The “executives” claimed to have wonderful ape-related [NFT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-nft) projects waiting in the wings. $200 to $350 per day is not an untidy sum for artists, many of who may not pull in anything close to that from commissions.

Sadly, it was all a large ape-shaped lie. The supposed promo zip for the project contained a number of ape pictures and a...
