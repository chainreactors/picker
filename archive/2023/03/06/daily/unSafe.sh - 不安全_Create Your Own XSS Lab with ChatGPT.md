## Get up and running quickly with this easy-to-follow tutorial on creating and running your own custom XSS lab with ChatGPT.

Having trouble learning a vulnerability type? Just have ChatGPT make you a lab!

## 1. What do you want to learn?

DOM XSS is a popular vulnerability type to hunt for because they’re everywhere, hard to scan for, and typically have high rewards.

**Prompt:**

> Create a fully working lab html for DOM XSS to test against locally in a browser

## 2. Run the XSS Lab

Now that you have the HTML code, copy the code and paste it into your favorite text editor. Save the file as a `.html` file and open it in a browser.

## 3. Play with It

Just like a real target in the wild, interact with the page as a normal user first. In this case, anything entered in the search box is reflected on the page and becomes a GET request parameter in the URL:

## 4. Open Developer Tools

Open the developer tools panel of your browser by right-clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect” if using Chrome. You can manipulate the `q` parameter value directly in the URL bar of the browser. Try different probes or XSS payloads to test how they reflect.

## 5. Pop that XSS alert()

For this lab, any basic XSS payload such as `<script>alert()</script>` will work, but also try other ones to see them in action in this context.

## 6. More Labs

* XSS labs for different contexts such as injecting directly inside javascript.
* More complex XSS labs involving different types of filters and character restrictions.
* Other vulnerability types such as CSRF, IDOR, and XXE. As you try these other labs, it may require a web server to function. Try asking ChatGPT for instructions if you’ve never done it before.
