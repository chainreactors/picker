# Registrar Snubs DMCA Subpoena, Claims Passive Conduit Immunity

In a case being heard at a California court, domain registrar Dynadot has partially declined to cooperate with the disclosure requirements of a DMCA subpoena, claiming immunity as a conduit service provider. In response, a copyright holder has asked the Court to issue an order clarifying service providers' safe harbor protection. The case is certainly unusual but also forms part of a more complex set of events, that may ultimately culminate in a potential moment of clarity.

Obtaining a DMCA subpoena to identify an alleged infringer is relatively easy, fairly cheap, and doesn’t require a judge to get involved.

A case in California has already stomped all over that general theory, but how far it will be allowed to progress and where any effects will be felt, currently hang in the balance.

## Subpoena Application Considered Sufficient

In an application dated June 2, 2025, the *pro se* applicant systematically ticks the required boxes. The aim was to obtain a DMCA subpoena under [17 U.S. Code § 512(h)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512) to compel domain registrar Dynadot Inc. to hand over information sufficient to identify one or more alleged infringers.

To meet the requirement at 2(A), the applicant provided a DMCA takedown notice sent to an email address at the domain MyPornvid.fun. The takedown notice references four original copyright works on YouTube, and corresponding URLs on MyPornvid.fun where the applicant alleges his videos could be viewed without authorization.

This wasn’t the full scale of the alleged infringement; the notice mentions that since “numerous” other videos from the applicant’s YouTube channel were also present on the site without permission, all should be removed for breach of copyright.

*Note:*
*a) The DMCA takedown notice sent to MyPornvid.fun is dated **August 21, 2023**
b) Nothing appears in the application to show whether the content was taken down or not
c) Out of an abundance of caution, any redactions are for reasons that will soon become clear*

## Information to Be Disclosed According to the Subpoena

The disclosure requests concern a single period that starts three years ago and ends at the date of the current subpoena. They relate to potential identifying information connected to Dynadot accounts (only one account is identified) used in connection with the domain mypornvid.fun, specifically:

The application concludes with the usual DMCA declarations and with that, the California court granted the subpoena. Deadline for production: June 30, 2025.

## Dynadot Partially Complies

In a filing dated June 30, 2025, the applicant informs the court that Dynadot provided registration data for the person who held the domain during the period when the alleged infringement occurred (June through December 2023).

Those details include a full name, an email address, a phone number, and a physical address in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Apparently in response to the specific request to supply “last known” address and “last known” telephone number, Dynadot handed over the details of an entity/company called Name Management Group, which appears to be the current owner of the domain.

According to public records NMG has connections to around 78,000 domains. In a recently concluded dispute with Charter Communications *([pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5321344ae4b0c16d073164b9/t/5c5c82f1ee6eb05bcb4d8834/1549566708361/Spectrum%2BDecision.pdf))*, the entity was represented by an agent in India and described as a ‘domain investor’.

## Dynadot Declines to Disclose IP Address Logs

Whether the obtained information will prove useful is unknown, but Dynadot’s reported refusal to fully comply with disclosure of IP address logs is an issue, the applicant writes.

Dynadot is reportedly claiming protection under the “transitory communications safe harbor under the DMCA” and has stated that they “will not provide any other user data absent an applicable court order.”

The applicant does note, however, that Dynadot “will not object to this order so long as no amounts are sought against Dynadot.”

Other than that, the registrar is said to have declined to engage in any “meaningful discussion.”

## Domain Registrars “Are Not Transmission ISPs”

Citing various cases including *[Visual Supply Company v. Khimji](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69495313/visual-supply-company-v-khimji/), [Recording Indus. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Verizon Internet Servs., Inc.](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2499836/recording-industry-assn-of-america-v-verizon-internet-services/), and [Charter Commc’ns, Inc., Subpoena Enf’t Matter](https://torrentfreak.com/eff-sides-with-cox-to-protect-piracy-accused-internet-users-from-copyright-trolls-250109/)*, the applicant arrives at the following conclusions:

“This Court’s explicit finding that those precedents are not applicable when dealing with domain name registrars provides direct support for rejecting Dynadot’s identical safe harbor claim. Multiple federal courts across different circuits have consistently issued and enforced § 512(h) subpoenas against domain name registrars without analyzing claimed transmission safe harbor defenses.”

## Court in Illinois Granted DMCA Subpoenas Against ISPs

To emphasize his position that “domain name registrars occupy a different legal position than pure transmission ISPs,” the applicant cites a 2019 case in the Northern District of Illinois.

*[CME Grp. Inc. v. Nagovskiy](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/14876187/authorities/cme-group-inc-v-dmitro-nagovskiy/)* was a trademark and copyright action in which the plaintiff reportedly requested a DMCA subpoena pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(h). In response, the Court granted one, “compelling Defendants GoDaddy, OVH, and Webzilla to expeditiously disclose..[.]…information sufficient to identify Defendants.”

“If domain name registrars such as GoDaddy ‘enjoy[..] the transitory communications safe harbor under the DMCA,’ the court could not and would not have acceded to such a prayer for relief,” the applicant states.

## “A Matter of Public Interest”

With those details established, the applicant asks the Court to enter “as a matter of public interest” the following order :

*1. Declare that domain name registrars qualify as providers of “Information Location Tools” under 17 U.S.C. § 512(d) and are therefore subject to identification subpoenas under 17 U.S.C. § 512(h) regardless of any claimed safe harbor protections under other DMCA provisions; and*

2. Based upon that determination, grant this unopposed motion and order Dynadot to provide complete complia...
