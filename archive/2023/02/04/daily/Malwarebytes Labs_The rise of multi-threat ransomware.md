## The rise of multi-threat ransomware

February 3, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

Today we have a ten minute YouTube expedition into the murky world of ransomware.

In the video, “The rise of multi-threat ransomware” (embedded below), I cover a couple of key talking points that always seem to come up in conversation.

## Single, double, triple?

The video covers how ransomware made the leap from “just” encrypting your files to double- or even triple-threat ransomware. The threats, the blackmail, the possibility of leaking data, and more.

## A timeline of ransomware

It also examines attacks of interest from 2017 to the present day, looking at some of the key incidents from the last couple of years, and the brutal real world impact of ransomware attacks that increasingly affect the spaces and services around us. Schools, hospitals, housing associations, everyone is a potential target.

## Keeping the enemy at the gate

The video finishes with a run through some of the ways organisations can avoid the perils of ransomware, and the realisation that cyber insurance may not solve every problem.

The video covers the importance of locking down your remote desktop access and VPNs, rolling out multi-factor authentication, and keeping a tight handle on repeated login attempts.

A determined attacker may find a way through despite your best efforts, but in many cases they’ll give up and look for a less resilient target. If you’re causing ransomware gangs to shrug and go elsewhere, you’re doing OK.
