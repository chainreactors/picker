A DDoS-for-hire site described by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) as the world's most prolific operator in the field is out-of-action following a law enforcement sting dubbed Operation Power Off.

The NCA, together with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and FBI, today announced the closure of digitalstress.su – a platform responsible for tens of thousands of DDoS attacks every week - and the arrest of its suspected admin.

The arrest was made on July 2 but authorities haven't named the suspect. DDoS-for-hire platforms, aka booters, allow budding cybercriminals to take their first step toward the dark side with what is essentially a point-and-click tool to [flood](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/29/ddos_internet_archive/) a domain of choice.
