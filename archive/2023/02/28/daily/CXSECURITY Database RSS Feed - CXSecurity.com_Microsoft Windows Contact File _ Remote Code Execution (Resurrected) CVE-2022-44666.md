[-] Microsoft Windows Contact file / Remote Code Execution (Resurrected 2022) / CVE-2022-44666

[+] ISR: ApparitionSec
Back in 2018 I discovered three related Windows remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting both VCF and Contact files.
They were purchased by Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (@thezdi) from me and received candidate identifiers ZDI-CAN-6920 and ZDI-CAN-7591.
Microsoft as usual denied a fix and it was subsequently dropped as a zero day on January 10, 2019 in coordination with the ZDI program.
Almost five years passed, until researcher j00sean resurrected the flaws to add additional protocol vectors LDAP etc.
Microsoft finally decided to patch and assign CVE-2022-44666 even though the vulnerabilities are exactly the same.
