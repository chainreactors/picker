# Understanding the challenges of securing an NGO

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Recently, I was invited to sit on a panel at the [CIO4Good Conference](https://blackbaud.swoogo.com/cio4good2025/) here in Washington D.C., where I talked about incident response and cyber preparedness to a room full of CIOs who help lead wonderful missions to help others. I’m incredibly fortunate to be able to volunteer for the NGO community. I’ve been involved with them for a few years now, and it has been a singular experience.

I sit in a uniquely blessed situation. Cisco Talos is resourced to help protect our customers — we have expertise, tooling and a huge array of diverse security skillsets. A humanitarian assistance or non-governmental organization (NGO) usually has none or very few of these luxuries. If I can take some of my time and experience here at Talos and help others who provide housing to the homeless, protect refugees or feed the hungry, damn right I’m gonna do it. And NGOs? They really need help.

In today’s global humanitarian funding climate, money and grants are very scarce to come by*.* This means the competition for the dollars that remain is fierce, and that things like cybersecurity can fall by the wayside. But security in an NGO is incredibly important. We're talking about incredibly vulnerable and marginalized people who deserve aid, and the amazing volunteers who should have privacy without malicious interference.

The hard truth is that cybersecurity can be a bleak space. We as professionals do not operate in the “good news” business. We work, and thrive, in adversarial conditions — actively searching for what the bad guys are doing and learning how they are coming after the good guys. They’re launching ransomware. They are extorting [and causing real harm to others](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/hospital-ransomware-attack-led-infants-death-lawsuit-alleges). This is day in and day out, and it can wear you down mentally. You have to endure and focus on the mission. After all, that’s the gig.

This is why I enjoy volunteering by either giving some of my time and expertise to a mentee or to an NGO that has an outstanding mission to help others. It puts fuel in your soul and reminds you that others are fighting their own good fights. These organizations are some of the best. They have a thankless, often dangerous, mission to help others have better lives. The way I see it, volunteering is the least I could do.

If you want to join me, there are some places that could use your help. Check out the [Cyber Peace Institute](https://cpb.ngo/volunteers), or [Defcon Project Franklin](https://defconfranklin.com/).

## The one big thing

This week is bittersweet because we’re discussing the final section of Talos' [2024 Year in Review](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2024yearinreview/) report. Let’s jump into the abyss of [AI-based threats](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/year-in-review-ai-based-threats/) together.

### Why do I care?

AI may not have upended the threat landscape last year, but it’s setting the stage for 2025, where agentic AI and automated vulnerability discovery could pose serious challenges for defenders. The future may bring:

1. The use of agentic AI to conduct multi-stage attacks or find creative ways to access restricted systems
2. Improved personalization and professionalization of social engineering
3. Automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation
4. Capabilities to compromise AI models, systems and infrastructure that organizations around the world are building

### So now what?

Continue to stay informed and alert, and for more information, read Talos’ [blog post](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/year-in-review-ai-based-threats/) about these threats or download the full [Year in Review](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2024yearinreview).

## Top security headlines of the week
