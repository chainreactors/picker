## Quick reminder: The law that banned the app is called ‘Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act’

The Trump administration is set to again waive the 2024 law that requires the made-in-China social network TikTok to either sell its US operations to a local company or stop operating on US soil.

A [widely reported](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/trump-to-extend-tiktok-deadline-for-third-time-another-90-days.html) statement from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump intends to “sign an additional Executive Order this week to keep TikTok up and running.”

“As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” Leavitt added. “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.”
