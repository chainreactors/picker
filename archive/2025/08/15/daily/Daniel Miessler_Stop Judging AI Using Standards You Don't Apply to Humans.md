# Stop Judging AI Using Standards You Don't Apply to Humans

Why we hold AI to impossible standards while giving humans a pass for the same limitations

[![AI Double Standards - Why we judge AI and humans differently](/images/ai-double-standards.png)](/images/ai-double-standards.png)

The same errors, different judgments

I know AI is stupid because it can't count the b's in "blueberry" the same way I know Einstein was stupid because he could barely dress himself.

Stop judging AI using standards that you don't apply to humans.

Some examples

# Argument: Their output is non-deterministic!!! [​](#argument-their-output-is-non-deterministic)

* Ask 100 security experts about how to do a security assessment
* Or ask the same expert to do 10 security assessments of the same target over the course of a few months (with the target not changing much)

In both cases you get massive variation.

Humans experts don't agree with each other. They rarely even agree with themselves over any significant span of time.

## Other examples [​](#other-examples)

* Remembering your favorite songs
* Your favorite foods
* All the different trips you've gone on

Any time you have to search across your whole life and provide a structured list, it comes out erratic and lumpy. You forget items, you emphasize some over others for whatever reasons.

It's best-guess *at that particular moment*, and nobody questions it or thinks less of you.

Humans are extremely non-deterministic, and nobody seems to notice.

# Argument: They're just making things up as they go along!!! [​](#argument-they-re-just-making-things-up-as-they-go-along)

* Ask someone—mid-sentence—what their next word is going to be
* Ask them to make a list of their top 11 restaurants

In both cases, they have no idea how they came up with the output.

I had no idea how I was going to finish this sentence either.

People usually have no idea how they are going to finish any sentence they start when they're talking. It just streams out of them. Like tokens almost!

When you make a list of your favorite restaurants on Monday, completely from memory, and someone asks you to do it again on Wednesday, you might make a completely different list.

Why? Because you forgot some. Or you remembered a preference or an experience that you forgot on Monday.

How transparent is that? How dependable is that? It's not. It's human.

## Other examples [​](#other-examples-1)

* Remembering some of the lyrics to a song you knew from your childhood, but not all
* Reading your writing later and not remembering the wording or phrasing you used
* Giving the same talk or pitch to multiple people and realizing they were quite different from each other

Thoughts and words just fall out of us. We have no idea where they came from. They spew out of a magic box containing the sum of our experiences, our memories, and our physical and mental state—**at that exact moment**.

And if try to recreate it 10 minutes later that state is now changed, and you'll probably do it differently.

*Almost like an AI.*

# Argument: AI output is trash!!! [​](#argument-ai-output-is-trash)

Fair enough, but:

* Have you talked to phone customer service in the last 20 years?
* Have you used the internet prior to 2022?
* Have you seen daytime talk shows?

They're generally cesspools.

## OTHER EXAMPLES [​](#other-examples-2)

* Read most fan fiction or amateur writing
* Watch most low budget movies
* Watch any true crime show

A large percentage of stuff humans do and make is total garbage. But some stuff we do is *spectacular*.

*Same with AI.*

Stop judging AI using standards that you don't apply to humans.
