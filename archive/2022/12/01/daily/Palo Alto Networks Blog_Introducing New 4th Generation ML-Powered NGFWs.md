Cyber threats are increasing in volume and complexity, making it difficult for network defenders to protect their organizations. Threat actors are constantly evolving their tools and techniques, finding new ways to avoid detection and exploit vulnerabilities. To successfully protect against modern-day threats, organizations require network security solutions that are purpose-built. They need to apply decryption and use the power of machine learning and inline deep learning to analyze vast amounts of data in order to block sophisticated attacks, which requires stopping zero-day attacks and preventing known threats across the many threat vectors. More than ever, cybersecurity innovation is needed, and Palo Alto Networks has never been in a better position to deliver for our customers. Today, we’re proud to announce the release of five, new fourth-generation [ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)](/network-security/next-generation-firewall-hardware) that bring [PAN-OS 11.0 Nova](/blog/2022/11/stop-zero-day-malware-with-nova/) and its ability to help stop highly evasive threats to every part of your organization – from the smallest branch offices to the largest campuses and data centers.

With the release of the PA-1400 Series and new additions to the PA-5400 and PA-400 Series ML-Powered NGFWs, we are delivering our NGFW capabilities to branches, campus locations and data centers with up to 5x higher performance compared to the previous generation. The new NGFWs mark the near completion of our fourth-generation hardware rollout, joining our PA-5450 NGFWs, PA-5400 Series, PA-3400 Series, and PA-400 Series NGFWs to provide unprecedented protection for the data center, campus, branch and enterprise edge. We’re proud to continue a legacy of innovation and excellence that has garnered recognition as a [10-time Leader in network firewalls](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/2021-gartner-mq-for-firewalls.html).

***“Palo Alto Networks, long known as the inventors of the next-generation firewall (NGFW), demonstrate real innovation across multiple criteria in the network security space.” –*** [***The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewalls, Q4 2022 Report***](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/leader-in-forrester-wave.html)

## New Hardware Platform Releases

This release expands the portfolio of our firewalls by adding five new hardware platforms. Register for our January 31, 2023 launch event, [Stop Zero-Day Malware with Zero Stress](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/nova.html), to learn how our newest innovations are pushing the boundaries of network security.

PA-5440

### Meet the PA-5440

For large campus locations and data centers, we are launching the highest performing, fixed-form factor 2RU PA-5440. This platform increases the performance of the PA-5400 Series up to 61.5 Gbps of Threat Prevention throughput, over a 2x increase over PA-5260. The PA-5440 is designed to perform in large campus locations and data centers where your Zero Trust architecture dictates the need for complete content inspection at Layer 7.

PA-1420

### Meet the PA-1400 Series: PA-1420 and PA–1410

The new PA-1400 Series, with two models delivering 9.5 Gbps and 6.8 Gbps App-ID performance, offers up to 5x the performance and 7x the session capacity compared to the previous generation. The PA-1400 Series is ideal for protecting large branch locations and small enterprise campuses with support for virtual systems (VSYS), high-speed 5 Gbps copper ports (mGig ports), fiber ports and Power over Ethernet (PoE). Power over Ethernet (PoE) powers downstream devices, such as access points, IP cameras and IP phones, without the need for additional supporting infrastructure.

PA-445

### Meet the PA-445 and PA-415

Two new models in the PA-400 Series (the PA-445 and PA-415) will bring the flexibility of fiber and Power over Ethernet (PoE) ports to distributed enterprises and small and medium businesses. Both models offer enterprise-grade resiliency with redundant power inputs, local log storage and a highly reliable fanless design.

Our fourth-generation NGFWs use [Nova, the 11.0 release](/blog/2022/11/stop-zero-day-malware-with-nova/) of our industry-leading PAN-OS software, to help stop the most evasive phishing, ransomware and DNS-based threats more effectively and efficiently. In a threat environment where evasive attacks make detection much more difficult, our ML-Powered NGFWs use [inline deep learning](/blog/2022/02/inline-deep-learning/) to stop zero day threats in zero time. Our fourth-generation NGFWs support [Advanced Threat Prevention](/network-security/advanced-threat-prevention), [Advanced URL Filtering](/network-security/advanced-url-filtering) and Advanced WildFire, among other [Cloud-Delivered Security Services](/network-security/security-subscriptions), allowing them to help stop zero day threats in zero time.

With our unique [Single Pass Parallel Processing (SP3) Architecture](/resources/whitepapers/single-pass-parallel-processing-architecture) running on all of our fourth-generation ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls, organizations get consistent performance regardless of the number of security services enabled. This allows consolidation of multiple products over time without having to resize the firewalls or choose between performance or security.

The new innovations in PAN-OS 11.0 Nova are immediately available on all of our supported ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewalls.

To learn more about our newest innovations and how we’re pushing the boundaries of network security, register for our launch event, [Stop Zero-Day Malware with Zero Stress](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/nova.html), on January 31, 2023.
