# Meta smart glasses can be used to dox anyone in seconds, study finds

Linking Meta smart glasses to a face search engine can ID strangers in a glance.

Two Harvard students recently [revealed](https://x.com/AnhPhuNguyen1/status/1840786336992682409) that it's possible to combine Meta smart glasses with face image search technology to "reveal anyone's personal details," including their name, address, and phone number, "just from looking at them."

In a [Google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWCqmaOUKhKjcKSktIwC3NNANoFP7vPsRvcbOIup_BA/preview), AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio explained how they linked a pair of Meta Ray Bans 2 to an [invasive face search engine called PimEyes](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/search-engine-that-scans-billions-of-faces-tries-blocking-kids-from-results) to help identify strangers by cross-searching their information on various people-search databases. They then used a large language model (LLM) to rapidly combine all that data, making it possible to dox someone in a glance or surface information to scam someone in seconds—or other nefarious uses, such as "some dude could just find some girl’s home address on the train and just follow them home,” Nguyen [told 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/someone-put-facial-recognition-tech-onto-metas-smart-glasses-to-instantly-dox-strangers/).

This is all possible thanks to recent progress with LLMs, the students said.

"This synergy between LLMs and reverse face search allows for fully automatic and comprehensive data extraction that was previously not possible with traditional methods alone," their Google document said.

Where previously someone could spend substantial time conducting their own search of public databases to find information based on someone's image alone, their dystopian smart glasses do that job in a few seconds, their [demo video](https://x.com/AnhPhuNguyen1/status/1840786336992682409?ref=404media.co) said.

The co-creators said that they altered a pair of Meta Ray Bans 2 to create I-XRAY to raise awareness of "significant privacy concerns" online as technology rapidly advances.

## Meta Ray Bans “creepiest way” to test tech

They said that they chose Meta Ray Bans 2 for their project because the smart glasses "look almost indistinguishable from regular glasses." Nguyen told 404 Media that using Meta smart glasses was "the creepiest way" they could think of for a bad actor to try to scan faces undetected.

To prevent anyone from being doxxed, the co-creators are not releasing the code, Nguyen [said on social media site X](https://x.com/AnhPhuNguyen1/status/1840846354555289828). They did, however, outline how their disturbing tech works and how shocked random strangers used as test subjects were to discover how easily identifiable they are just from accessing with the smart glasses information posted publicly online.

Nguyen and Ardayfio tested out their technology at a subway station "on unsuspecting people in the real world," 404 Media noted. To demonstrate how the tech could be abused to trick people, the students even claimed to know some of the test subjects, seemingly using information gleaned from the glasses to make resonant references and fake an acquaintance.

Dozens of test subjects were identified, the students claimed, although some results have been contested, 404 Media reported. To keep their face-scanning under the radar, the students covered up a light that automatically comes on when the Meta Ray Bans 2 are recording, Ardayfio [said](https://x.com/CaineArdayfio/status/1841150604359651352) on X.

## Opt out of PimEyes now, students warn

For Nguyen and Ardayfio, the point of the project was to persuade people to opt out of invasive search engines to protect their privacy online. An attempt to use I-XRAY to identify 404 Media reporter Joseph Cox, for example, didn't work because he'd opted out of PimEyes.

But while privacy is clearly important to the students and their demo video strove to remove identifying information, at least one test subject was "easily" identified anyway, 404 Media reported. That test subject couldn't be reached for comment, 404 Media reported.

So far, neither Facebook nor Google has chosen to release similar technologies that they developed linking smart glasses to face search engines, The New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/technology/google-facebook-facial-recognition.html).

But other players in the AI world are toying with the tech, 404 Media noted, including Clearview AI, a company behind a face search engine for cops that "has also explored a pair of smart glasses that would run its facial recognition technology." (That's concerning for several reasons: because Clearview's goal is to [put almost every human in their facial recognition database](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/02/clearview-ai-aims-to-put-almost-every-human-in-facial-recognition-database/), cops have already unethically [used the tool without authorization to conduct personal searches](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/c...
