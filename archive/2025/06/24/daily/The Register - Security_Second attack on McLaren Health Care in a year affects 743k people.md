McLaren Health Care is in the process of writing to 743,131 individuals now that it fully understands the impact of its July 2024 cyberattack.

The attack was carried out on Karmanos Cancer Institute, an independent organization that's part of McLaren's network, on July 17, 2024, but was not detected until August 5, according to the letters being sent to affected individuals.

Filing the [breach notification](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/79a56f34-ffbe-4621-a74c-9b1e49477904.html) with Maine's attorney general on behalf of Karmanos, McLaren did not mention the involvement of ransomware by name, but the attack was claimed by INC in August, at which time social media users [posted what appeared to be printed ransom notes](https://x.com/thomasbarzaf/status/1820500522379698289/photo/1).
