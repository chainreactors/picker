A.B. 412, the flawed California bill that threatened small developers in the name of AI “transparency,” has been delayed and turned into a [two-year bill](https://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/learn/about-the-government/life-cycle-of-a-bill/). That means it won’t move forward in 2025—a significant victory for innovation, freedom to code, and the open web.

EFF [opposed this bill from the start](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/californias-ab-412-bill-could-crush-startups-and-cement-big-tech-ai-monopoly). A.B. 412 tried to regulate generative AI, not by looking at the public interest, but by mandating training data “reading lists” designed to pave the way for new copyright lawsuits, many of which are filed by large content companies.

Transparency in AI development is a laudable goal. But A.B. 412 failed to offer a fair or effective path to get there. Instead, it gave companies large and small the impossible task of differentiating between what content was copyrighted and what wasn’t—with severe penalties for anyone who couldn’t meet that regulation. That would have protected the largest AI companies, but frozen out smaller and non-commercial developers who might want to tweak or fine-tune AI systems for the public good.
