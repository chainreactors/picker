# Exploit Title: XWiki Platform - Remote Code Execution
# Exploit Author: Al Baradi Joy
# Exploit Date: April 6, 2025
# CVE ID: CVE-2025-24893
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.xwiki.org/
# Software Link: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform
# Version: Affected versions up to and including XWiki 15.10.10
# Tested Versions: XWiki 15.10.10
# Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
# CVSS Score: 9.8 (Critical)
# CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
# Description:
# XWiki Platform suffers from a critical vulnerability where any guest user
can
# execute arbitrary code remotely through the SolrSearch endpoint. This can
lead
# to a full server compromise, including the ability to execute commands on
the
# underlying system. The vulnerability impacts the confidentiality,
integrity,
# and availability of the XWiki installation. The issue has been patched in
XWiki
# versions 15.10.11, 16.4.1, and 16.5.0RC1.
# Proof of Concept: Yes

The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making i...
