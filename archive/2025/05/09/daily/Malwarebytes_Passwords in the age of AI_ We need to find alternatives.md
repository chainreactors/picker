# Passwords in the age of AI: We need to find alternatives

Posted: May 8, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

For decades, passwords have been our default method for keeping online accounts safe. But in the age of [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai), this traditional security method is facing challenges it was never built to withstand.

A team at [Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/security/password-leak-study-unveils-2025-trends-reused-and-lazy/) conducted a study of over 19 billion newly exposed passwords which showed we’re looking at a “a widespread epidemic of weak password reuse.” It shows that despite years of trying to educate users about the dangers of using weak, lazy passwords, and re-using them across different sites and services, we have hardly made any progress.

But our opponents have. They can use new tools, faster computers, and because of both these developments, they ended up needing less effort for a greater yield. Because our digital presence in life has grown enormously and with that the number of passwords and the importance of the information they can unlock.

## Enter AI

Artificial Intelligence ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet))-powered tools are now capable of [cracking passwords faster](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexvakulov/2025/03/04/beyond-password123-secure-your-digital-life-in-the-age-of-ai-risks/) and more efficiently than ever before. What once took days or weeks using [brute force](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/brute-force-attack) can now be accomplished in minutes. Tools like PassGAN (Password Generative Adversarial Network) use deep learning to predict and generate likely passwords based on leaked data sets. Unlike traditional dictionary attacks, AI doesn’t rely solely on existing word lists. AI is able to learn patterns from [billions of compromised passwords](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/07/rockyou2024-nearly-10-billion-passwords-leaked-online) and create new ones that closely mimic real human behavior.

This represents a huge advantage to the attackers. While a human [hacker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) might guess that someone used their pet’s name followed by the year they were born, an AI can deduce that “Fluffy2023!” is statistically probable based on thousands of other similar combinations. And it can do this millions of times per second.

AI’s password-cracking capabilities are further supercharged by powerful hardware. Graphics processing units (GPUs), which are commonly used in gaming and scientific computing, can now be harnessed to run password-cracking algorithms at scale. Combined with AI, these machines make [short work of weak or even moderately complex passwords](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/how-to-pick-passwords-that-take-millennia-to-crack).

The result is a world where even passwords once considered strong, like for example “Tr33House!” may no longer provide meaningful protection.

## Does that make the password obsolete?

Tech companies are already betting on a [passwordless](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/passkey) future. [Passkeys](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/05/on-world-password-day-microsoft-says-fewer-passwords-more-passkeys), biometrics, and [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-f...
