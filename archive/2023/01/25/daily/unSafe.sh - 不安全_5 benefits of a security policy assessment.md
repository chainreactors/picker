Security is one of the most important feelings for people. Since the dawn, humans have sought to feel safe from looming threats and unpredictable events. The search for security remains fundamental in the digital age. For this reason, a company or public administration must carry out a **security policy assessment** to analyze their compliance and effectiveness.

This verification will **assess the organization’s security level** and strengthen its protection in a volatile context plagued by cybersecurity challenges.

The rise of IoT devices, the proliferation of mobile apps, the use of software to perform multiple business and professional tasks and processes, the migration of data to the cloud… These processes have brought with them a host of benefits for companies and individuals. But also threats. Hence, **cybersecurity has become a crucial issue for companies**, institutions and citizens.

The design and **evaluation of an organization’s security policies** are a central element in its security strategy.

It stipulates **how information is managed** within the organization and what measures must be implemented to protect the company’s data and assets against attacks and the development of security incidents.

This article will analyze the **keys to evaluating security policies** and the benefits they bring to companies.

## 1. What are security policies?

An organization’s security policies are a set of guidelines that regulate the treatment of information and the **protection of an organization’s systems**.

The security controls and measures to be carried out to guarantee the organization’s security are established through a series of procedures and protocols. These measures range from purely technical aspects to the good practices to be followed by all organization members in their relationship with IT resources and information management.

The two main **objectives of security policies** are:

* To guarantee the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.
* To **protect the assets**, processes and systems of the organization.

To **design security policies** and ensure their effectiveness, companies must:

* First, **identify critical assets**, systems and processes.
* Second, collect and select the best practices in cybersecurity at a global level.
* Third, establish security objectives, considering the company’s characteristics.
* Fourth, **define the most appropriate security protocols** and mechanisms to meet the objectives.
* Finally, continuously analyze the **effectiveness of the implemented security policies**.

What do security policies include? Best practices, the establishment of responsibilities, system access procedures, security permission levels, actions to be taken when managing security incidents, business continuity and disaster recovery procedures, training actions, and protocols for the transfer of information.

## 2. What does the security policy assessment consist of?

The purpose of any **security policy assessment** is to check their level of implementation and the accuracy with which they have been carried out. It is also to analyze the validity of the company’s security policy, considering the sector’s best practices and the **emergence of new threats**.

To do so, companies and institutions can hire [**security policy compliance verification services**](https://www.tarlogic.com/compliance-security-verification-automation/) from professionals specialized in cybersecurity. This type of service makes it possible to:

* Study the technical compliance with security policies in each one of the information systems that are part of the organization.
* Validate that all organization members comply with cybersecurity guidelines to protect the company or institution against threats.
* **Use verification tools** capable of identifying weaknesses or security breaches.
* **Continuously adapt security policies** and infrastructure protection, considering the emergence of new technologies and the development of new cyber-attack methodologies and techniques.

### 2.1. A comprehensive analysis of strategic value for companies

All this means that the **security policy assessment** must be a holistic analysis that takes into account the technical measures implemented to **ensure the security of an organization’s** **information** and assets and the role played by the people who make up the organization, from senior management and those responsible for security to professionals with a lower level of permissions to access data and systems.

This allows the **security policy assessment** to take into account two realities of great relevance in the field of cybersecurity:

* Digitization and the phenomena we noted earlier, such as the spread of IoT devices, have increased the attack surface on which criminals can impact to breach a company’s systems.
