## What your peers said: G2 comparison of top Endpoint Security vendors

April 20, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Navigating the world of endpoint security is challenging, with numerous vendors stoking FUD and making bold claims that are difficult to verify. In times like these, the honest opinions of real users are invaluable for busy IT teams.

Enter G2, an industry-leading peer-to-peer review site. Each quarter, G2 releases reports highlighting the products with the highest customer satisfaction and strongest market presence.

In the G2 Spring 2023 Grid Reports, **Malwarebytes earned the title of ‘Leader’ in 24 categories, including the #1 spot in Endpoint Protection, the Best ROI for EDR, and #1 for EDR implementation in the mid-market segment.**

Let’s take a closer look at how organizations evaluated solutions and what they said about using Malwarebytes.

## #1 Endpoint Protection: Highest Rated for Results, Relationship, and More

Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection (EP), the essential foundation of our EDR and MDR offerings, won dozens of awards based on receiving the highest customer satisfaction score across a range of areas, including “Ease of setup,” “Ease of admin,” “Quality of support”, and more.

Dashboard for [Nebula](https://www.threatdown.com/products/), the cloud-hosted security platform for EP and EDR

For example, Malwarebytes EP won the “**Best Results**” badge (highest overall Results score) by having the highest combination of estimated ROI, meets requirements, and likelihood to recommend scores. What some of our customers had to say:

> “Malwarebytes is easy to install and configure. It integrates with Windows 10 and runs silently in the background. Infection rate of Malware has dropped dramatically. If I run across a machine that has Malware, installing it cleans it up almost 100% of the time.”
>
> [Chris S.](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/malwarebytes-for-business-review-4223464)

> “Malwarebytes was able to detect and block a virus that our previous AV was not able to. Wish we had moved to this product sooner.”
>
> [Robert S.](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/malwarebytes-for-business-review-4537057)

> “I consider myself faithful to this software because Malwarebytes has taken me out of problems that other antivirus programs have not been able to solve. It is not a very heavy software and can run in the background without even noticing it thanks to the updates.”
>
> [Verónica M.](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/malwarebytes-for-business-review-2449167)

Customers also praised Malwarebytes for its friendly staff and exceptional support, for which we won the “**Best Relationship**” badge by having the highest combination of “Likely to Recommend” , “Ease of business,” and “Quality of Support” ratings. Here’s what some of our customers had to say:

> “The support team started us off on the right track by getting us up and running in no time. Any questions I had before and after setup were answered quickly and thoroughly.”
>
> [Gary P.](https://www.g2.com/survey_responses/malwarebytes-for-business-review-5142563)

> “Highly recommended, and their support team is the best you can ask for!.”
