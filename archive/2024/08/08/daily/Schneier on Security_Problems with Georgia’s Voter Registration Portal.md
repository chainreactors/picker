## Problems with Georgia’s Voter Registration Portal

It’s possible to [cancel](https://www.propublica.org/article/georgia-voter-registration-cancellation-portal-mtg-raffensperger) other people’s voter registrations:

> On Friday, four days after Georgia Democrats [began warning](https://x.com/GASenateDems/status/1817949715234717988) that bad actors could abuse the state’s new online portal for canceling voter registrations, the Secretary of State’s Office acknowledged to ProPublica that it had identified multiple such attempts…
>
> …the portal suffered at least two security glitches that briefly exposed voters’ dates of birth, the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and their full driver’s license numbers—the exact information needed to cancel others’ voter registrations.

I get that this is a hard problem to solve. We want the portal to be easy for people to use—even non-tech-savvy people—and hard for fraudsters to abuse, and it turns out to be impossible to do both without an overarching digital identity infrastructure. But Georgia is making it easy to abuse.

EDITED TO ADD (8/14): There was [*another* issue](https://www.propublica.org/article/cybersecurity-expert-finds-another-flaw-in-georgia-voter-portal) with the portal, making it easy to request cancellation of any Georgian’s registration. The elections director said that cancellations submitted this way wouldn’t have been processed because they didn’t have all the necessary information, which I guess is probably true, but it shows just how sloppy the coding is.

I move there 8 years ago and was astounded at the login security. Our only option is to check it regularly.

Georgia has lots of political problems. Gerrymandering of election maps is still happening here. A few weeks ago, a court order required a new election for county commissioners due to a bad map drawn to favor Republicans. This has been happening since the DoJ stopped overseeing political maps in the south. It is really blatant again, like in the 1950s.

The idea that everyone legally able to vote should be allowed to vote is NOT what the leaders in Georgia believe. They are doing everything they can to stack the deck AND remove legal voters from registration if they think they won’t vote for their party. The last few years, about 313K voters have been removed from registration without any notification. Approximately 200K of those removals were invalid. <https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/georgia-voter-rolls-report/index.html> Through a lawsuit, about 22K of those removals were reinstated.

In my area, the House district lines were drawn to split 1 district between who existing districts controlled by the long-time opposing party. Further, the existing representative had to move to a different location to even run for election in the slightly less leaning district.

Politics is very dirty in Georgia and it appears it will remain that way for the foreseeable future, unless the Feds jump back in to ensure 1-person, 1-vote and gerrymandering district lines isn’t allowed. The Georgia House and Senate can do almost anything they want with a compliant governor. The parties – and outsiders have far too much power these days. I want to vote for an individual, not someone forced to spout whatever the party says.

Sigh.

@ Bruce,

To some not news.

One of the supposedly simplest interfaces we have is the “Automatic Teller Machine”(ATM) for people to get cash out.

The reality is it’s only security,

1, Holding onto a plastic card.

Yes it’s a “Two Factor” authentication system yet it fails thousands of times every day.

Some years ago now the first Female Director of the UK’s MI5 made it perfectly clear to the UK Government and public that chose to listen, that there was no reliable way to tie people as “bodies with agency” to “Information”.

As was once observed by a senior Met Police Detective about a man jailed under a false identity he gave whilst under oath,

“You are who you say you.”

As a society we went through major changes in the Victorian Era with the ability to store and use what we would now call “Biometric Identities” via finger prints and photographs, with even early voice recordings.

But we’ve not actually in any real way improved them just what surrounds them.

The simple fact is between the “body with agency” and the stored “Biometric Identities” lies a method of linking, call it a “proof” or a “Test”. And none are perfect they all have false positives and false negative. But more importantly they are all falsifiable or gameable in some way, so will always fail one way or the other, for better or worse depending on the “Directing mind” or the “independent observer”.

A hundred or so years ago people understood this and society reflected that. Now we have people who will not accept the fact of it and treat technology as some omnipotent deity that can be made omnipresent. And where ever there is an idiotic belief in place you will find a charlatan, huckster, or crook taking advantage.

> But Georgia is making it easy. [to cancel voter registration]

Together with seeing that a *New Georgia Law Spurs Bogus Challenges to Voter Eligibility* [1] and the way *Georgia election board clears county officials to delay vote certification with information demands* [2], there might be a trend?

Maybe this is related a recent speech where *Trump Reveals Plan To Subvert Georgia’s Elections* [3]?

In other words, the ease with whi...
