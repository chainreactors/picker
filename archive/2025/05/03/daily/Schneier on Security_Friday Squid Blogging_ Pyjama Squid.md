## Friday Squid Blogging: Pyjama Squid

The small [pyjama squid](https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/marine-animals/theres-an-adorable-animal-in-australia-that-looks-like-its-wearing-striped-pyjamas-but-its-cuteness-conceals-a-toxic-weapon) (*Sepioloidea lineolata*) produces toxic slime, “a rare example of a poisonous predatory mollusc.”

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

[…] “what I’d REALLY like is something better than CLAMAV for anti-virus on Linux.”

There are other AV’s for Linux. However, they are all proprietary and cost money, IIRC. There was one free one, while still being proprietary it was free money wise, but it was sneakily sending mail from your system to theirs with a bunch of information, I don’t recall to what extent but it was information about your system and such that shouldn’t be sent out. It wasn’t even anonymized! I had to block it just to briefly use it before I wiped it.

While I don’t know the current count, as I haven’t checked in awhile, there should be a few free AV LiveCD/DVDs available from some AV companies. While these LiveCD/DVDs run Linux, they may or may not scan for Linux specific malware.

What we need is better, FOSS tools for rootkit detection. Chkrootkit and Rkhunter are good programs but a) they are not updated often enough and b) there are TONS of rootkits out there for Linux which these tools DO NOT INCLUDE DETECTION OF!

Someone needs to hire some developers and fund/kick start some alternative to those two programs.

Yes, I know there’s also Lynis and Yara and a few other tools but we need better rootkit detection.

“AI models routinely lie when honesty conflicts with their goals”

<https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/ai_models_lie_research/>

This is just what humans would do and is therefore completely expected in the AI. The training data being a “grab everything” includes all those exchanges where humans prevaricate in the course of a project.

All AI eerie presentation disconnects are explainable the same way. We are used to human intentional behavior, but it is at first startling when encountered from a mindless machine.

@ ResearcherZero, ALL,

You note,

> “Mike Waltz is using an app named TeleMessage, a less secure fork of Signal.”

As I’ve noted before Signal is not a secure messaging system.

But as importantly for what it can claim a measure of security for, all the “forks of Signal” appear to be less secure than Signal.

I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty of why this might be, people can look it up. That is why the Signal app does not a secure system make, and it’s code is apparently so brittle or fragile. I’ll leave that to others who are young enough to have the stamina to deal with those who will come screaming out of the wood work and who are in effect unquestioning “FanBois and Shills” of insecure systems.

As has been said,

“Been there, done that, have the blood stained T-Shirt”.

@ResearcherZero, ALL

This TM SGNL looks rather deadly. End-run around “encrypted” msgs, archiving “vanishing” msgs in plaintext, but requires to be setup by your sysadmin … Who is really running that govt?

@Lurker,
If the US can’t even make their own dunny paper, then they are doomed.

Of course we are doomed. Exporting jobs for decades, exporting manufacturing for decades so now if there’s a conflict with Gyna – they can just cut off supplying anything they ever want to the USA. It is a National Security RISK! But of course, those who do not give a damn about the United States, they will come here and tell me how stupid I am. I understand that the FAILURE of CRONY Capitalism was to allow this to happen, or one of its downsides/shortcomings. I am not suggesting Socialism or Communism but what happened was that the Board of Directors, Chairmen (basically those owning the largest shares of big US companies aka Shareholders) they sat down and said: hey, let’s go make s...
