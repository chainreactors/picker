# Dynamic Pirate Site Blocking Injunctions and the Transparency Illusion

When a major rightsholder obtains a site blocking order to counter rampant piracy, transparency is not always guaranteed. More often than not, the public isn't routinely updated. Draft legislation in the U.S. would see initial blocking orders published in the spirit of transparency. As a recent order obtained in India by DAZN illustrates, the true scale can only be appreciated by observing what comes next.

Will the United States introduce a pirate site blocking program? Depending on who one asks, the answer could go either way.

A slightly different and potentially more complex question isn’t whether the United States will adopt such a program, but whether it should. Is limiting communications absolutely necessary and the only option left? Is it still absolutely necessary after considering how quickly the UK is [descending into censorship](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-govt-finds-ideal-pirate-bay-poster-boy-to-sell-blocking-of-non-pirate-sites-250824/), with the equipment standing by to take things to the next level?

No matter how the topic is presented, and whether for or against site blocking, definitive answers are always elusive. Yet, extend the timeline to the horizon and a little beyond, and whether the United States will *ever* introduce a site blocking program has a straightforward answer; It is absolutely inevitable; only the timing, framing, and eventual implementation are in doubt.

## Transparency is Not an Option, It’s Absolutely Necessary

Murphy’s law posits that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, and almost every prediction from 2012 about how site blocking could go wrong, has gone wrong in the period since. There has been no wholesale [collapse of the internet](https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-ceo-football-piracy-blocks-will-claim-lives-i-pray-no-one-dies-250526/), yet, but try telling that [to the Spanish](https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-threatens-cloudflare-customer-for-using-an-ip-address-linked-to-piracy-250826/) who, incidentally, were simply ignored when they called out for help.

No system is perfect, but a transparent system helps to build trust. The recent site blocking proposals in the U.S. recognize that transparency is important, but there’s a pretty big caveat. Since relatively few people are aware of the true scale of worldwide site-blocking due to a general lack of transparency in most countries, how does one assess the value of transparency that isn’t comprehensive?

The recently introduced [Block BEARD draft](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-senators-introduce-new-pirate-site-blocking-bill-block-beard/) does not mention public transparency, but both [FADPA](https://torrentfreak.com/new-bill-aims-to-block-foreign-pirate-sites-in-the-u-s-250129/) and [ACPA](https://torrentfreak.com/unveiled-new-u-s-anti-piracy-bill-acpa-proposes-alternative-site-blocking-path/) envision publication of site blocking orders once granted by the court. For scale, that’s more or less equivalent to reading the opening paragraph of a detailed news article.

In other jurisdictions where orders made public, they typically outline the justification for blocking and detail why the target sites meet the threshold for blocking under relevant law. At this crucial stage, [shining a spotlight on anomalies](https://torrentfreak.com/how-a-court-order-to-block-internet-archives-open-library-was-put-on-hold/) is essential because people may act quite differently when free from scrutiny.

The limited transparency outlined in the FADPA and ACPA proposals can be put into perspective with help from a practical example.

## DAZN Obtains a Local Blocking Order With Global Impact

The Indian legal system may not always deliver the results major U.S. rightsholders expect, but when it comes to site blocking, the High Court of Delhi has shown an enthusiasm for blocking up to tens of thousands at once. More recently, the issue of jurisdiction has received liberal treatment too, with blocking orders under Indian law reaching into other countries with instructions for registrars to suspend domains, among other things.

An [order obtained in June](https://torrentfreak.com/the-superlative-injunction-indias-pirate-site-blockades-go-next-level/) by Disney subsidiary Star India is the latest example of the High Court going the extra mile for rightsholders. With maximum freedom to block domains quickly, limited oversight was temporarily suspended in favor of no oversight at all while the Court was on holiday.

This dynamic+ injunction grants permission to block domains that don’t yet exist, and if content is delivered by apps instead of sites, no problem; blocking is not only authorized but must take place in real-time. Domain suspensions are part of the package too, including those linked to American companies such as Namecheap, which is [known to comply](https://torrentfreak.com/namecheap-suspends-zorox-to-upmovies-to-and-other-pirate-to-domains-240305/). Try that in the United States, and it could easily take one or two years.

After obtaining global broadcasting rights to the FIFA Club World Cup 2025, selecting India as the venue for its site-blocking measures would’ve been a [no-brainer for DAZN](https://torrentfreak.com/indian-fifa-club-world-cup-piracy-blocking-order-felt-globally-250624/).

With no question of who owns the rights anywhere on the planet, the High Court of Delhi granted an injunction that required local ISPs to block six sites: buffsports.me, sporthd.me, piratemedia.me, vipbox.lc, strimsy.top and vipstand.pm.

Despite the popularity of the domains, the list of six domains was pretty mild by most standards. That the sites lacked popularity in India made things more interesting but not exactly a surprise given the potential for global impact.

## Transparency Ends Here in the U.S. Proposals

India’s blocking measures are roughly equivalent to those suggested in the United States drafts and, up to this point, offer the same level of transparency.

In India, once one knows where to look, most details are available for scrutiny, from the initial order to any follow-up measures. In the United States (as far as we know), only the information in the initial order would be made public; nothing beyond that would ever see the light of day.

*A Modest Beginning, the Calm Before the Storm*

The dynamic order was issued on May 28, 2025, and very quickly at least three of the original domains were suspended by 1API Gmbh, NETIM and Namecheap. Suspensions aren’t part of the current proposals in the United States but may not be required either, not with an offshore service like this available.

## DAZN Comes Up With a Few More Domains

On June 2, DAZN filed its first ‘List of Additional Domains’, all of which are...
