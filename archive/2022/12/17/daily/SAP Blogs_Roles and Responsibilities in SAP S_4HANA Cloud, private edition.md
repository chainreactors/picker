In my role as product expert within our SAP S/4HANA Customer Care and Regional Implementation Group I have had the opportunity to work with several customers on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and have noticed that responsibilities during implementation and operations of the system are often not clear.

Our private cloud product offers significant advantages to a more traditional on-premise based ERP solution. However, despite the term “cloud” in the title, this should not be regarded as a full Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud solution. Although being a cloud hosted solution, it is not a full public cloud offering, and hence, clarity needs to be provided on who is responsible for what, in a deployment.

The introduction of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition sees the lines starting to blur with regards to deployment and support activities for the end-to-end solution. That’s why I wrote this blog, to try and provide the required visibility around where roles and responsibilities lay.

The concept of hosting an ERP solution in the cloud, albeit a private cloud, brings about many questions around who might be responsible for the varying tasks associated with:

* Implementation

* Data Base support

* System operation support

* Release cycles upgrades

* Governance

* Security

* Performance

* Sizing

* Capacity planning

* System Availability

* Integration

* and more…

I will attempt to answer these questions, by outlining the various roles and responsibilities for an SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition deployment.

On occasion, you may see reference to PCE (private cloud edition) when researching SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. As this is not an official SAP branded term, I will refrain from any reference to this acronym.

SAP is offering customers a pathway to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition via an offering termed RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

For those looking for a more detailed and technical view on roles and responsibilities for RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, refer to the following link: [Roles and Responsibilities RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/policies/hec-services.html?sort=latest_desc&tag=agreements:product-policy/ecs/roles-responsibilities&tag=language:english&pdf-asset=445e20f9-387e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&page=1)

The SAP Trust Centre can also be used as the single source of truth for Product and Polices, refer to the following link: [SAP Trust Centre](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center.html).

## What is RISE with SAP?

RISE with SAP is not a product. RISE with SAP is a curated offering centred around SAP S/4HANA. This package aims to accelerate, streamline, and motivate organisations with their journey to a cloud centric intelligent enterprise.

RISE with SAP is centred around 6 core components:

1. Business Process Intelligence Discovery Reports

2. SAP Business Technology Platform CPEA Credits

3. SAP Business Network Starter Pack

4. Custom Code Analyzer, Readiness Check, Learning Hub

5. SAP S/4HANA with Deployment of Choice (Public or Private)

6. Infrastructure Provision of Choice

RISE with SAP also offers the concept of “one”. One SAP contract covering all components, in addition to secondary contracts with Partners for services or add-on packages if applicable.

## Roles

RISE with SAP comprises fundamentally 3 stakeholders, each taking shared or discrete ownership of specific deliverables within the RISE implementation transition.

These 3 stakeholders include the following:

1. SAP Subscription Services

2. Customer

3. Partner (or SAP Services)

These 3 stakeholders own and contribute to various components through the Activate methodology life cycle, which includes the following:

* Discover

* Prepare

* Explore

* Realize

* Deploy

* Run

Each of the above phases comprises swim lanes that span across all phases. These swim lanes include the following:

* Project Management

* Team Enablement

* Technical Architecture / Infrastructure

* Application Design and Configuration

* Extensibility

* Integration

* Testing

* Data Management

* Operations & Support

* Solution Adoption

* Analytics

When we represent these phases by swim lanes, we can visualise a matrix of deliverables, where we can then start assigning roles (ownership) to each deliverable (intersection of phase and swim lane).

## Adoption Framework

The following diagrams have been drawn from the Adoption Framework. The Adoption Framework is part of the SAP Activate methodology for SAP RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition and is found in the Roadmap Viewer. You can find the Adoption Framework here (note: access to the framework may be restricted to Partners only for now):

## SAP Subscription Services

Let us look at an example of the above Activate phases in combination with the deployment swim lanes. For ease of explanation, let’s represent these in a matrix format. For now, we will focus only on those activities where SAP...
