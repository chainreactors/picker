The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/04/cisa-adds-four-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) four security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, citing evidence of active exploitation in the wild.

The list of vulnerabilities is as follows -

* **[CVE-2024-45195](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45195)** (CVSS score: 7.5/9.8) - A forced browsing vulnerability in Apache OFBiz that allows a remote attacker to obtain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the server (Fixed in [September 2024](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/apache-ofbiz-update-fixes-high-severity.html))
* **[CVE-2024-29059](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29059)** (CVSS score: 7.5) - An information disclosure vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework that could expose the ObjRef URI and lead to remote code execution (Fixed in [March 2024](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-29059))

* **[CVE-2018-19410](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-19410)** (CVSS score: 9.8) - A local file inclusion vulnerability in Paessler PRTG Network Monitor that allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to create users with read-write privileges (Fixed in [April 2018](https://www.paessler.com/prtg/history/prtg-18#18.2.39))

Although these shortcomings have since been addressed by the respective vendors, there are currently no public reports about how they may have been exploited in real-world attacks.

Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies have been urged to apply the necessary fixes by February 25, 2025, to safeguard against active threats.
