KL-001-2024-003: Artica Proxy Unauthenticated File Manager Vulnerability

Title: Artica Proxy Unauthenticated File Manager Vulnerability
Advisory ID: KL-001-2024-003
Publication Date: 2024.03.05
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2024-003.txt

1. Vulnerability Details

Affected Vendor: Artica
Affected Product: Artica Proxy
Affected Version: 4.40 and 4.50
Platform: Debian 10 LTS
CWE Classification: CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an
Alternate Path or Channel, CWE-552: Files
or Directories Accessible to External
Parties
CVE ID: CVE-2024-2055

2. Vulnerability Description

The "Rich Filemanager" feature of Artica Proxy provides a
web-based interface for file management capabilities. When
the feature is enabled, it does not require authentication by
default, and runs as the root user.

3. Technical Description

The Artica Proxy can be installed with a small amount of
"Features" enabled. Within the administrative web interface,
additional features can be installed, enabled, and disabled. The
"Rich Filemanager" feature is disabled by default. Enabling
this feature will spawn a listener on port 5000/tcp bound to
0.0.0.0. By default, when this feature is enabled, authentication
is not required to access the web interface. The "Rich
Filemanager" runs as the root user. This provides an
unauthenticated attacker complete access to the file system.

root@artica:~# ps -efww | grep -i File
root 1888 1885 0 09:13 ? 00:00:00 php-fpm: pool RICHFILEMANAGER
root 1889 1885 0 09:13 ? 00:00:00 php-fpm: pool RICHFILEMANAGER

This can be exploited by an attacker to add entries in to
/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, and /etc/ssh/sshd_config to create
an additional root-level account that has the ability to SSH
in to the system.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

No response from vendor. Rich Filemanager feature is disabled
by default. Leave it that way.

Step 3: Move /tmp/shadow back to /etc/shadow as not to create a DoS condition
