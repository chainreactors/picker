The inner London borough lies northeast of the city center and is home to "Silicon Roundabout", a cluster of high-tech companies

During the attack, thieves stole data of 280,000 Hackney residents, council employees and more, and some of the system's backups were deleted after the crooks broke into a server using an insecure password on a dormant account. The attack exposed "deeply personal information" as well as throwing multiple systems used by locals offline for extended periods.
