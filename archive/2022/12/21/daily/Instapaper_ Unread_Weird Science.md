# [Weird Science](/blog/index.php?/archives/976-Weird-Science.html)

## Sunday, 11 December 2022

Over at [FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/), we see pictures that are related to scientific journals almost daily. These stand out because they are not your common social media, celebrity, or conspiracy images that we typically receive. We often see photos of cells, western blots, gel assays, things growing in petri dishes, and related results from science experiments. Sometimes these images come from people who are trying to validate the authenticity of the images, while other times the pictures seem to come from researchers who are intentionally making altered images.

### Just Flesh and Blood

Fraud in scientific publications is a serious problem. This includes the widespread use of [altered pictures](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/29/opinion/science-fraud-image-manipulation-photoshop.html) in journal papers. The alterations may be simple, like copying the same picture and claiming it is from different experiments. However, they can also include editing, creative cropping, or "touching up" photos. The wholesale fabrication of "proof" pictures is also becoming more common. (And this is before we get to outright plagiarism.)

When this fraud is discovered, the journals sometimes issue [retractions](https://retractionwatch.com/). However, any retraction can be too late. Subsequent research papers may [continue to cite](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629243/) the previously retracted articles.

Sometimes these retractions are associated with a bunch of papers from one set of researchers, while other times it is a systemic problem within a particular research field. For example, the [NIH identified](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6644205/) four anaesthesiologists who had articles retracted due to "research misconduct". Some of their articles had been retracted, while others had not. (One of the authors, Yoshitaka Fujii, tops the leaderboard at [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/). They note that he has had 183 total article retractions.)

Back in 2014, RIKEN (a Japanese institute) began [investigating](https://www.science.org/content/article/riken-check-20000-papers-doctored-images-and-plagiarism) over 20,000 papers for doctored images and plagiarism. During that same time, FotoForensics began to receive a large number of altered cell photos. Here's a small sample that were uploaded by someone at the Research Organization of Information and Systems, National Institute of Informatics in Japan:

![](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=fac69274f7bddbd6075d4954723e3a3c88560734.267631&fmt=orig&size=600)

Most of the pictures show cells and nearly all were digitally altered. Looking at the sequence of preview images, you might notice the same cells in the same positions but with more cells appearing in subsequent photo uploads. For example, here's one of the images:

[![](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=975877e2e3f34d0b7cb8c753eef2da87b5ff4315.526608&fmt=orig&size=600)](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=975877e2e3f34d0b7cb8c753eef2da87b5ff4315.526608)

With a little experience, you can probably tell that these are cells photographed through a microscope. With a some biology background, you might be able to tell that they are blood cells. With a lot of advanced education, you might be able to tell that these are fish blood cells.

At FotoForensics, we don't need marine biology lessons to know that something's fishy. It's faint, but FotoForensics shows the boxes around every cell that was pasted into the picture:

[![](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=975877e2e3f34d0b7cb8c753eef2da87b5ff4315.526608&fmt=ela&size=600)](https://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=975877e2e3f34d0b7cb8c753eef2da87b5ff4315.526608)

The commercial FotoForensics service includes more ways to highlight the alterations. (Ignore the colors; just focus on the edges of the colored regions.)

This one example is from the series of cell pictures where the "researcher" continually added cells and adjusted their positions in the picture. However, even without the sequence of images, advanced tools permit detecting the alterations from a single picture. These are not artifacts from some background lighting. This is a composite image where someone tried to blend the different cells into one picture.
