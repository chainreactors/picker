Consumer Protection laws and regulations pop up in multiple geographical regions. In Australia, this process currently passed a consultation round. Ken Palla summarizes the specifics of the Australian approach, how telcos and Big Tech fit in, and the differences between the UK Mandatory Reimbursement law.

## Very Short Summary

In September 2024, the Australian Government introduced the Scam Prevention Framework (SPF) to combat financial scams through mandatory controls for financial institutions, telecommunications providers, and digital platform services. This legislation, which amends the Competition and Consumer Act of 2010, mandates these sectors to implement specific scam prevention measures. Non-compliance can result in fines up to AU$ 50 million or 30% of turnover, and victims may seek reimbursement if proper controls are not in place. Unlike the UK, Australia’s framework involves multiple sectors to ensure comprehensive scam prevention. The initiative builds on existing measures like the “Safe-Scam Accord” and the “Reducing Scam Calls and SMS Code”, aiming to reduce financial losses from scams significantly.
