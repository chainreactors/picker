ANY.RUN Now Integrates with Splunk!

We have some thrilling news to share with you today. Our team at [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=splunk_integration&utm_term=120924&utm_content=linktolanding) is happy to announce the launch of our [new integration with Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/7474)!

## How this integration benefits you

![Official page of ANY.RUN’s connector for Splunk](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Снимок-экрана-2025-03-12-в-12.17.40-1024x787.png)

If you’re a Splunk user, you can now leverage ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/) and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) directly from your Splunk SOAR environment.

This means that you can analyze potentially malicious files and URLs in the [sandbox](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=splunk_integration&utm_term=120924&utm_content=linktoservice) and enrich your investigations with threat data from [TI Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=splunk_integration&utm_term=120924&utm_content=linktolookup) without leaving the familiar Splunk interface.

Our main goal with this integration is to give you more options and help you make the most out of ANY.RUN while working with familiar systems.

The integration supports a wide range of actions, from simple reputation checks to full detonation and analysis of suspicious objects.

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Threat Intelligence

The integration allows analysts to query ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence database directly from Splunk SOAR.

### Automated Malware Analysis

One of the most powerful features of this integration is the ability to automatically detonate files and URLs in ANY.RUN’s sandbox.

This process can be triggered as part of a Splunk SOAR playbook, allowing for analysis of attachments in phishing emails or suspicious downloads detected by network monitors. You can also access any analysis session you launch in the sandbox to perform manual actions or gain a deeper understanding of the threat.

### Detailed Reporting and IOC Extraction

The ‘get report’ action retrieves key analysis details, including the verdict on the sample’s threat level. You can also see the rest of the analysis results by navigating to the corresponding part of the interface.

### Advanced Threat Hunting

If you have ANY.RUN’s TI License, you can use the ‘get intelligence’ action to perform complex queries against ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence database.

Search for specific file hashes, IP addresses, domains, or even MITRE ATT&CK techniques you uncover in previous analyses.

### Real-World Application

Consider a scenario where a Splunk SOAR playbook is triggered by a potential phishing email.

The playbook could automatically extract any URLs and attachments from the email, then use the ‘url reputation’ action to check if the URLs have been previously analyzed by ANY.RUN.

* For new or suspicious URLs, the playbook could use the ‘detonate url’ action to analyze them in a sandbox environment.

* Similarly, for attachments, the ‘detonate file’ action could be used to safely execute and analyze them.

The playbook could then retrieve detailed reports and IOCs using the ‘get report’ and ‘get iocs’ actions.

Finally, it could use the extracted IOCs to automati...
