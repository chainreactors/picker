üìù üëæ Want to play along?

As ‚ÄúSharing is Caring‚Äù I‚Äôve uploaded the malicious binary [LockBit](https://github.com/objective-see/Malware/raw/main/LockBit.zip) to our public macOS malware collection. The password is: infect3d

...please though, don't infect yourself!

### Background

Late Saturday (April 15the), [@MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/) tweeted about a new LockBit ransomware variant targeting macOS:

> "locker\_Apple\_M1\_64": 3e4bbd21756ae30c24ff7d6942656be024139f8180b7bddd4e5c62a9dfbd8c79
> As much as I can tell, this is the first Apple's Mac devices targeting build of LockBit ransomware sample seen...
> Also is this a first for the "big name" gangs?

As shown in the tweet, the ransomware binary initially was undetected by any of the anti-virus engines on VirusTotal:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x75/VT.jpeg)

Good news, if you refresh the [page on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3e4bbd21756ae30c24ff7d6942656be024139f8180b7bddd4e5c62a9dfbd8c79/detection) the AV engines are now starting to pick up the file as malicious.

Shortly after [@MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/)‚Äôs tweet, the fine folks of [@vxunderground](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1647424861810065410) added their thoughts and shared samples:

> Lockbit ransomware group has created their first MacOS-based payload. We believe this is the first time a large ransomware threat group has developed a payload for Apple products.
>
> We have samples.

The relevance of this macOS specimen is well articulated in their tweet:

> ‚ÄúLockbit ransomware group has created their first MacOS-based payload. We believe this is the first time a large ransomware threat group has developed a payload for Apple products.‚Äù vx-underground

["The Unrelenting Menace of the LockBit Ransomware Gang"](https://www.wired.com/story/lockbit-ransomware-attacks/) (Wired/Lily Hay Newman).

Ok, so even though it‚Äôs the weekend, we have what appears to be a new macOS malware specimen from one of the more notorious ransomware gangs! Coupled with the fact that this may be, (as noted by @VXUnderground), ‚Äú*the first time a large ransomware threat group has developed a payload for Apple products*‚Äù ‚Ä¶I was intrigued to decided to dig right in!

In this blog post we‚Äôll tear apart the sample, showing that ultimately, while yes it can indeed run on Apple Silicon, that is basically the extent of it‚Äôs impact. Thus macOS users have nothing to worry about ‚Ä¶for now!

### Triage

The (SHA-1) hash for the binary (aptly named `locker_Apple_M1_64`) is `2D15286D25F0E0938823DCD742BC928E78199B3D`

While we're only focusing on the macOS sample, it appears the LockBit group has compiled this sample for a host of other OS's:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x75/samples.png)

Using macOS‚Äôs `file` utility, we see the `locker_Apple_M1_64` binary is a 64-bit arm64 Mach-O:

```
% file LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64
LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

And what about it‚Äôs code signing information? Let‚Äôs take a peek via macOS‚Äôs `codesign` and `spctl` utilities:

```
% codesign -dvv LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64
Executable=LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64
Identifier=locker
Format=Mach-O thin (arm64)
CodeDirectory v=20400 size=3295 flags=0x20002(adhoc,linker-signed) hashes=100+0 location=embedded
Signature=adhoc
Info.plist=not bound
TeamIdentifier=not set
Sealed Resources=none
Internal requirements=none

% spctl -a -vvv -t install LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64
LockBit/locker_Apple_M1_64: invalid signature (code or signature have been modified)
```

The `codesign` utility shows that though it‚Äôs signed, it‚Äôs signed ‚Äúad-hoc‚Äù (say vs. an Apple Developer ID). This means if downloaded to a macOS system (i.e. deployed by the attackers) macOS won‚Äôt let it run. This is confirmed by the `spctl` utility which shows ‚Äúinvalid signature‚Äù ‚Ä¶or if you‚Äôre brave enough to try run it:

![](../images/blog/blog_0x75/blocked.png)
An invalid signature means macOS will block it

Let‚Äôs now run the `strings` command (with the `"-"` option which instructs it to scan the whole file), we find a few strings that appear to be related to standard ransomware activity including:

* Encryption
* File Extensions
* A file path, perhaps containing ransom instructions

```

iconcache.db
```

Also interesting are the strings related to Windows artifacts (e.g. `autorun.inf`, `ntuser.dat.log`, etc‚Ä¶). This may indicate the ransomware was originally written to target Windows platforms.

This wraps up our triage of the `locker_Apple_M1_64` binary. Time to dive in deeper with our trusty friends: the disassembler and debugger!

### Analysis of `locker_Apple_M1_64`

In this section we‚Äôll more deeply analyze the malicious logic of the `locker_Apple_M1_64` binary ‚Ä¶which is simplified by the fact that the binary‚Äôs symbols aren‚Äôt stripped. (So function and method names are left intact ‚Ä¶.yay!)

First, we pointed out that the `locker_Apple_M1_64` is an arm64 binary (`Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64`). This means we better have at least a cursory understanding of AArch64. If you‚Äôre not familiar with this instruction set, here‚Äôs two of my favorite resources to get you up to speed:
