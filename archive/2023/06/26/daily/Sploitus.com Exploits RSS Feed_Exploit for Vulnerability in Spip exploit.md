### Ethical Note & Caution ⚠️

This tool's primary ambition is scholarly assessment and to assist users in gauging their own setups. Unauthorized deployments or inflicting intentional harm is stringently disapproved. Users must ensure they're in tune with local legal guidelines. The creators dissociate from any misapplications or legal contraventions. The integration with LeakIX through LeakPy aims to expedite the scanning chore by curating potential vulnerable URLs. Always validate your rights to access and assess the URLs you harness. 🚫🚨
