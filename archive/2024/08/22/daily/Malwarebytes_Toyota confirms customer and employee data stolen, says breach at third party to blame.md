# Toyota confirms customer and employee data stolen, says breach at third party to blame

Posted: August 21, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Last week, a cybercriminal using the handle ZeroSevenGroup dumped 240GB of data on the infamous stolen data site BreachForums, that they said came from a hack on the US branch of car manufacturer Toyota.

ZeroSevenGroup claims the dump includes customer and employee data.

![Data offered in BreachForums post](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/BreachForums.png)

ZeroSevenGroup posted the data

> “We have hacked a branch in United State to one of the biggest automotive manufacturer in the world (TOYOTA).
> We are really glad to share the files with you here for free.
> Contents: Everything like Contacts, Finance, Customers, Schemes, Employees, Photos, DBs, Network infrastructure, Emails, and a lot of perfect data.
> We also offer you AD-Recon for all the target network with passwords
> We’re not kidding, we have been on the network for a long time..”

Toyota told [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/toyota-confirms-breach-after-stolen-data-leaks-on-hacking-forum/) that a breach at a third party had led to the data theft. After they looked at the files, BleepingComputer concluded that they had been stolen or at least created on December 25, 2022.

The car vendor has already notified impacted individuals, but it did not provide technical details about the incident. According to Toyota:

> “We are aware of the situation. The issue is limited in scope and is not a system wide issue. We have engaged with those who are impacted and will provide assistance if needed.”

Toyota and Toyota Financial Services have suffered several breaches in the past, so it’s hard to tell where and when the information was obtained more precisely.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.
* **Watch out for fake vendors.** The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the vendor website to see if they are contacting victims, and verify the identity of anyone who contacts you using a different communication channel.
* **Take your time.** [Phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attacks often impersonate people or brands ...
