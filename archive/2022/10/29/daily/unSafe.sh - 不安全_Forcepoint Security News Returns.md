Here are some top recent security stories getting our attention:

**[CISA adds Apple zero-day, Cisco and Gigabyte bugs to exploited vulnerabilities list](https://therecord.media/cisa-adds-apple-zero-day-cisco-and-gigabyte-bugs-to-exploited-vulnerabilities-list/)**

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/)) added several vulnerabilities that affect Apple, Cisco and Gigabyte to its list of bugs currently being exploited by hackers. Per an [advisory Apple issued](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/x-labs/The%20Cybersecurity%20and%20Infrastructure%20Security%20Agency%20%28CISA%29) earlier this week, a kernel vulnerability allows for an application to potentially ‘execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges’. It affects iPhone 8 and later, all iPad Pro models and various iPad and iPad mini models CISA [also recently added](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) four Gigabyte vulnerabilities and two more from Cisco. The Cisco vulnerabilities affected their AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows, both of which have been patched.

**[White House announces 100-day sprint on chemical sector cybersecurity](https://therecord.media/white-house-announces-100-day-sprint-on-chemical-sector-cybersecurity/)**

On Wednesday, the Biden Administration unveiled plans aimed to protect the United States chemical sector from cyberattacks. The ‘Chemical Action Plan’ is an expansion of the government’s Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Cybersecurity Initiative—the chemical sector represent the fourth sector in the initiative. This plan  was based on best practices previously learned during action plans for electric, pipeline and water sectors. CISA will lead the 100-day sprint. According to a [White House fact sheet](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-public-private-cybersecurity-partnership-to-chemical-sector/) on the topic, since the majority of chemical companies are privately owned, the Chemical Action Plan requires collaboration between the private sector and the government.

**[Cybercriminals Used Two PoS Malware to Steal Details of Over 167,000 Credit Cards](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/cybercriminals-used-two-pos-malware-to.html)**

Hackers recently used two malware variants, Treasure Hunter and its more advanced successor MajikPOS, to steal the details of 167,000 credit cards from payment terminals. Both malware items can either ‘brute force their way into a POS terminal,’ or can ‘purchase access from other parties known as initial access brokers.’ Many of the cards stolen were issued by banks in the United States, U.K, Canada, France and a handful of other countries. The hackers behind the scheme have not been identified.

**[Cybersecurity Workforce Gap Grows by 26% in 2022](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/global-security-skills-shortage/)**

According the [(ISC)2 2022 Cybersecurity Workforce Study](https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study), the cybersecurity workforce gap grew by 26% so far in 2022. In 2021, (ICS)2 estimated the gap to be a shortage of 2.72 million cybersecurity professionals. Of that, the APAC region makes up the biggest percentage of that shortage, at 1.4 million. In comparison, the workforce gap in North America is over 400,000 and about 200,000 in the United Kingdom. Organizations are taking steps to close the gap through training, implementing more flexible working and investing in diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
