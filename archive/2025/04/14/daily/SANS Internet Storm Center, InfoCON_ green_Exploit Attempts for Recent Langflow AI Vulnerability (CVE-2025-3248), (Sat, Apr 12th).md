Two weeks ago, version 1.3.0 of Langflow was released. The release notes list many fixes but do not mention that one of the "Bug Fixes" addresses a major vulnerability. Instead, the release notes state, "auth current user on code validation." [1]![](https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20at%2011_44_22%E2%80%AFAM.png)

Its website states, "Langflow is a low-code tool for developers that makes it easier to build powerful AI agents and workflows that can use any API, model, or database." It can be installed as a Python package, a standalone desktop application, or as a cloud-hosted service. DataStax provides a ready-built cloud-hosted environment for Langflow.

The vulnerability went somewhat unnoticed, at least by me, until Horizon3 created a detailed writeup showing how easy it is to exploit the vulnerability and provide proof of concept exploit. Horizon3 published its blog on April 9th [2]. We saw a first hit to the vulnerable URL, "[/api/v1/validate/code](https://isc.sans.edu/weblogs/urlhistory.html?url=L2FwaS92MS92YWxpZGF0ZS9jb2Rl)", on April 10th. Today (April 12th), we saw a significant increase in hits for this URL.

The requests we are seeing are vulnerability scans. They attempt to retrieve the content of "/etc/passwd" to verify if the target system:

> `POST /api/v1/validate/code HTTP/1.1
> Host: [redacted]
> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_3) AppleWebKit/617.2.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.3 Safari/617.2.4
> Connection: close
> Content-Length: 125
> Content-Type: application/json
> Accept-Encoding: gzip`
>
> `{"code": "@exec('raise Exception(__import__(\\"subprocess\\").check_output([\\"cat\\", \\"/etc/passwd\\"]))')\\ndef foo():\\n  pass"}`

Not all of our honeypots report request bodies. So far, this is the only request body we recorded. So far, all of the requests originate from TOR exit nodes.
