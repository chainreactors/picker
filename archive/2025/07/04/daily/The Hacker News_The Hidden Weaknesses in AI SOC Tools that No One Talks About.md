If you're evaluating AI-powered SOC platforms, you've likely seen bold claims: faster triage, smarter remediation, and less noise. But under the hood, not all AI is created equal. Many solutions rely on pre-trained AI models that are hardwired for a handful of specific use cases. While that might work for yesterday's SOC, today's reality is different.

Modern security operations teams face a sprawling and ever-changing landscape of alerts. From cloud to endpoint, identity to OT, insider threats to phishing, network to DLP, and so many more, the list goes on and is continuously growing. CISOs and SOC managers are rightly skeptical. Can this AI actually handle all of my alerts, or is it just another rules engine in disguise?

In this post, we'll examine the divide between two types of AI SOC platforms. Those built on adaptive AI, which learns to triage and respond to any alert type, and those that rely on pre-trained AI, limited to handling predefined use cases only. Understanding this difference isn't just academic; it's the key to building a resilient SOC that is ready for the future.

## What is a pre-trained AI model?

Pre-trained AI models in the SOC are typically developed by training machine learning algorithms on historical data from specific security use cases, such as phishing detection, endpoint malware alerts, and the like. Engineers curate large, labeled datasets and tune the models to recognize common patterns and remediation steps associated with those use cases. Once deployed, the model operates like a highly specialized assistant. When it encounters an alert type it was trained on, it can quickly classify the alert, assign a confidence score, and recommend the next action, often with impressive accuracy.

This makes pre-trained AI particularly well-suited for high-volume, repeatable alert categories where the threat behavior is well-understood and relatively consistent over time. It can dramatically reduce triage times, surface clear remediation guidance, and eliminate redundant work by automating common security workflows. For organizations with predictable threat profiles, pre-trained models offer a fast track to operational efficiency, delivering value out-of-the-box without requiring deep customization.

But do such organizations exist? If they do, they are certainly far and few in between, leading us to our next section. The limitations of pre-trained AI.

## Limitations of a pre-trained AI model for the SOC

Despite their initial appeal, pre-trained AI models come with significant limitations, especially for organizations seeking broad and adaptable alert coverage. From a business standpoint, the most critical drawback is that pre-trained AI can only triage what it has been explicitly taught, similar to SOARs that can only execute actions based on pre-configured playbooks.

This means that AI SOC vendors relying on the pre-trained approach must develop, test, and deploy new models for each individual use case, an inherently slow and resource-intensive process. As a result, their customers (i.e. SOC teams) are often left waiting for broader coverage of both existing and emerging alert types. This rigid development approach hinders agility and forces SOC teams to fall back on manual workflows for anything not covered.

In fast-changing environments where security signals evolve constantly, pre-trained models struggle to keep pace, quickly becoming outdated or brittle. This can create blind spots, inconsistent triage quality, and increased analyst workload, which undermines the very efficiency gains the AI was meant to deliver.

## What is an adaptive AI model?

In the context of SOC triage, adaptive AI represents a fundamental shift from the limitations of pre-trained models. Unlike static systems that can only respond to alerts they were trained on, adaptive AI is built to handle any alert, even one it has never seen before. When a new alert is ingested, adaptive AI doesn't fail silently or defer to a human; instead, it actively researches the new alert. It begins by analyzing the alert's structure, semantics, and context to determine what it represents and whether it poses a threat. This capability to research novel alerts in real-time (which is what experienced, higher-tier analysts do) is what allows adaptive AI to triage and respond across the entire spectrum of security signals without requiring prior training for each use case.

This capability holds true both for alert types the adaptive AI has never seen before, as well as for new variations of threats (e.g. a new form of malware).

Technically, adaptive AI uses semantic classification to assess how closely a new alert resembles previously seen alerts. If there's a strong match, it can intelligently reuse an existing triage outline: a structured set of investigative questions and actions tailored to the alert's characteristics. The AI performs a fresh analysis, which includes verifying the results of each step in the triage outline, assessing these results, identifying additional areas to investigate and finally compiling a conclusion.

But when the alert is novel or unfamiliar, the system shifts into discovery mode. Here, **research agents,** just like senior SOC analysts, will search vendor docs, threat intelligence feeds, as well as reputable websites and forums. They then analyze all the information and compile a report that defines what the new alert represents, e.g. is it malware or some other threat type. With this, the agents dynamically...
