Chris Krebs, the former head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and a longtime Trump target, has resigned from SentinelOne following a recent executive order that targeted him and revoked the security clearances of everybody at the company.

Krebs, a Republican who Trump appointed to lead US cybersecurity operations in 2017, was famously [fired via tweet](https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/18/trump_fires_krebs/) five years ago after he publicly contradicted Trump's false claims of election fraud. Krebs declared the 2020 US presidential election "the most secure in American history."

Krebs joined SentinelOne as Chief Intelligence and Public Policy Officer in November 2023 after the security shop snapped up his consultancy, Krebs Stamos Group.
