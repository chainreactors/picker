**Introduction:**

As an abapper most of us might be new to calling external APIs from the ABAP environment. There are lots of APIs on cloud foundry or deployed elsewhere which we can use as per as our need. Most of them use the OAuth 2.0 authentication and other authentication processes.

You must have heard about SAP Workflow Management Triggering the workflow and getting in my In Box. But What about cancelling the running workflow instance from the ABAP environment.

In this blog we not only learn how to cancel the workflow instance but also we can use this to call any APIs which uses OAuth 2.0 authentication.

**Scenario:**

Let's imagine a scenario where I triggered a workflow for some PR amount. But I need to change the PR amount and retrigger new workflow with the new amount, also cancelling the previous workflow instance, so the users are in sync with the new approval amount. In this case there are APIs that are available and documented on the Cloud Foundry.

The workflow API is documented and available in the API hub [Workflow API for Cloud Foundry](https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/resource)

The prerequisites for calling the API are:

1. Workflow Instance Id.

2. Client Id, Client Secret, URL of workflow service instance for generating Bearer token

3. Workflow API of cloud foundry to update the status of the workflow instance.

Below in the workflow instance created for workflow service in service marketplace and your workflow must be bound to this instance.

Workflow Instance

Use the credentials of the service key of the above workflow instance.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/service-key-credentials.png)

Service Key Credentials

Client Id, Secret and URL are used to generate the Bearer token required for OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Now we are all set to call the workflow Api from the Abap environment.

**Code:**

Below is the code for your reference.
