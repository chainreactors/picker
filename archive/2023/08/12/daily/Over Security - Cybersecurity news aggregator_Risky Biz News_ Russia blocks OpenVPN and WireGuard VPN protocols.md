Russian internet users are reporting that VPN clients using the OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols have stopped working as of this week.

The unofficial ban has been reported primarily by users of Russian mobile internet operators, such as Beeline, Megafon, MTS, Tele2, Tinkoff, and Yota.

OpenVPN and WireGuard traffic does not appear to be blocked on landline connections and especially on business accounts, where they're most likely to be used by the few foreign companies still doing business in Russia.

The Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications watchdog, has not formally confirmed the block, but [the](https://t.me/usher2/2859) [massive](https://ntc.party/t/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-openvpn-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D1%81-31052023/4576/155) [number](https://dtf.ru/s/terona/2015141-blokirovka-wireguard) [of](https://zona.media/article/2023/08/08/vpnbattle) [user](https://appleinsider.ru/tips-tricks/v-rossii-blokiruyut-openvpn-i-wireguard-kak-nastroit-shadowsocks-na-iphone-gde-vzyat-server-i-kak-im-polzovatsya.html) [complaints](https://twitter.com/merr1k/status/1688501776876441600) suggests the ban is more than a test and most likely applied nationwide.

Most reports say OpenVPN and WireGuard clients won't connect to foreign servers, but some [scant reports](https://t.me/na_svyazi_helpdesk/190) also claim similar issues with ShadowSocks, another VPN protocol.

Two other protocols, IPSec and IKEv2, were [blocked](https://t.me/globalcheck/78) in May 2022, with similar blocks following for L2TP and PPTP.

According to Russian IT expert [ValdikSS](https://ntc.party/t/%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D1%85%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2-05082023-08082023/5124/5), the bans are enforced differently per Russian region, most likely related to local internet filtering and blocking capabilities.

VPN connections trying to connect to foreign servers are what's getting blocked. VPNing from abroad inside Russia still works, most likely not to disturb the operations of foreign business.

The Roskomnadzor has been actively trying to block VPN services inside Russia since the country's invasion of Ukraine. Access to VPN services has been seen as a major threat to the Russian government, which has tried to limit its citizens' access to accurate news about its military effectiveness in Ukraine, its war crimes, and the breakdown of its economy.

Initially, the Roskomnadzor tried outlawing VPN services, but when that didn't work, it began blocking the VPN protocols themselves.

Russian government officials have repeatedly stated they do not intend to criminalize the use of a VPN, but they have made it illegal to share advice on how citizens can skirt the VPN blocks. This way, Russian officials avoid the mess of criminalizing the IT departments of foreign companies but still get to go after unruly individuals and privacy advocates still opposing their draconic regime.

At one point, the government also launched an [anti-VPN media campaign](https://torrentfreak.com/russia-launches-anti-vpn-scare-campaign-to-support-blocking-230411/) meant to scare away users from using the services.

On most Russian IT forums and Telegram channels, users are now flocking to tools used to evade China's Great Firewall and testing as alternatives.

### **Breaches, hacks, and security incidents**

**PSNI breach:** The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has suffered what it called a monumental [data breach](https://www.psni.police.uk/latest-news/update-data-breach-investigation) after it mistakenly published a list of all police officers on its website. The file exposed the names, ranks, roles, and locations of more than 10,000 offers and civilian staff. Officials blamed the leak on a human error after a spreadsheet containing the sensitive data was uploaded on its Freedom of Information (FoI) websites. Even if the file was available online for only three hours, the PSNI is now looking to relocate some of its staff, especially officers that had been working with the MI5 intelligence service on sensitive investigations.

**Hundred Finance shuts down after hack:** The Hundred Finance cryptocurrency platform is shutting down after it got hacked and lost [$7.4 million](https://archive.ph/XvdcS) worth of customer assets in April this year. The shutdown is part of a [community-voted plan](https://archive.li/m8ncg) to compensate victims of the hack. The company says the hack impacted its "ability to effectively perpetuate [its lending] protocol."

**Steadefi crypto-heist:** The Steadefi crypto platform has lost almost [$1.1 million](https://archive.ph/lYEjb) after a hacker obtained a private key for one of its wallets. The company says it recovered around [$418,000](https://archive.ph/6BGJ2) worth of stolen assets, but the rest remain under the hacker's control.

**Dallas ransomware attack:** The Dallas City Council approved [$8.6 million](https://www.govtech.com/security/dallas-approves-8-6m-in-ransomware-response-payments) in payments for services related to a [ransomware attack](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2023/05/03/dallas-websites-affected-by-outages-possible-ransomware-attack/) the city's IT network suffered earlier this year, in May. At the time, the city refused to pay the attackers and chose to restore its IT systems. The payments approved this week cover costs with new hardware, software licenses, consulting, forensics, and credit monitoring for individuals who had their personal data stolen. The city is planning to file insurance claims to cover the costs. The Royal ransomware operation took credit for the intrusion.

### **General tech and privacy**

**RCS goes E2EE:** Google has [announced](https://support.google.com/messages/thread/229405182/your-rcs-conversations-are-now-fully-end-to-end-encrypted) that all RCS conversations in its "Messages by Google" app are now end-to-end encrypted.

**Project IDX:** Google has released [Project IDX](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/08/introducing-project-idx-experiment-to-improve-full-stack-multiplatform-app-development.html), a cloud-based IDE with today's favorite hype technology, AI.

**Yandex leak:** Ad security platform Confiant has published an [analysis](https://www.confiant.com/news/the-yandex-leak-how-a-russian-...
