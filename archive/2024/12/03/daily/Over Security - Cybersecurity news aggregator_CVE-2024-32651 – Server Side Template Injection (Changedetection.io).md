### CVE-2024-32651 – Server Side Template Injection (Changedetection.io)

## TL;DR

A Server Side Template Injection in changedetection.io caused by usage of unsafe functions of Jinja2 allows Remote Command Execution on the server host. Update changedetection.io to version 0.45.21 or later.

A huge thanks to the mantainer (<https://github.com/dgtlmoon>) that was very responsive and collaborative to fix the issue, request a CVE number and inform the users.

## What is Changedetection.io

Changedetection.io is a tool designed to monitor web pages for changes. It’s extremely useful for being notified on changes for news articles, product updates, or any other online content.

It’s a fully open-source product, you can check the source code on GitHub: <https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io> (about 15k stars at the time of writing). It’s possible to deploy a self-hosted or a cloud-hosted version (<https://changedetection.io/>).

Some of its key features:

* Notification Support: Whenever a change is detected, Changedetection.io notifies you using a plenty of different formats (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Rocket.Chat, Email, Matrix, NTFY, Office 365… more than 85 formats in total).
* Target Elements: Select only what you need, easily choose elements to monitor. The tool highlights the specific modifications made to the webpage since the last check, making it easy to spot changes at a glance.
* Browser Steps: Perform searches, Log in with username and password, Add to cart, Interact with fields, buttons and many more possibilities.
* Re-stock alerts: Monitor out-of-stock products and get alerts when those products are back in stock.
* Archive: Changedetection.io maintains an archive of the monitored web pages, enabling you to view the historical changes over time.

## Vulnerability Details

SSTI, or Server-Side Template Injection, represents a security vulnerability where an attacker inserts harmful content into a server-side template. When the server processes this template to create dynamic web pages, it executes the injected code too. This poses serious risks such as data exposure, unauthorized entry, and even remote code execution on the server.

The following examples illustrate the dangers of SSTI vulnerabilities and why it’s crucial for developers to properly validate and sanitize user input to prevent such attacks.

****Remote Code Execution**:** In more severe cases, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting template code that triggers server-side commands. For example: `{{ 3*3 }}`. If the server evaluates this input as Python code, it would execute `3*3` and return `7` (joking, 9 obviously).
Now, imagine if an attacker injects more complex Python code to perform malicious actions, like deleting files or accessing system resources. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.

**Web page Manipulation**: SSTI can also be used to manipulate the page presented by the application. For instance, an attacker might inject template code to alter the layout of the page, insert malicious Javascript code, or redirect users to phishing sites:

```
{% if user.is_admin %}
<script>alert('admin pwned');</script>
{% endif %}
```

In this example, if the attacker can inject this code into a template and the server evaluates it, every user viewing the page might be subjected to a malicious script, potentially leading to further compromise or unauthorized actions.

**Accessing Sensitive Data**: Let’s say a web application uses templates to display user profiles. The template might include code to fetch the user’s information from a database and render...
