## Using Wi-FI to See through Walls

This [technique](https://www.engadget.com/wifi-security-hole-see-through-walls-152138038.html) measures device response time to determine distance:

> The scientists tested the exploit by modifying an off-the-shelf drone to create a flying scanning device, the Wi-Peep. The robotic aircraft sends several messages to each device as it flies around, establishing the positions of devices in each room. A thief using the drone could find vulnerable areas in a home or office by checking for the absence of security cameras and other signs that a room is monitored or occupied. It could also be used to follow a security guard, or even to help rival hotels spy on each other by gauging the number of rooms in use.
>
> There have been attempts to exploit similar WiFi problems before, but the team says these typically require bulky and costly devices that would give away attempts. Wi-Peep only requires a small drone and about $15 US in equipment that includes two WiFi modules and a voltage regulator. An intruder could quickly scan a building without revealing their presence.

So now I have to “Spidey” stick my laptop to the ceiling of my hotel room? …If there is another floor. You are making this really, really, amazing.

@ “-”

It’s not unsolicited advertising. Are you thinking that sentence was paid for by Amazon? It’s a rather interesting point, that’s all. Not all Roomba’s do that, I believe. Mine does, but it’s one of the lower end models that has that feature, and to be fair… it does an “ok” job at best.

Soon to be used by employers on their work from home employees across ‘Murica. Heck it’s probably coming soon to a police department near you.

> WiFi’s friendliness to other devices might pose a significant threat in the wrong circumstances.

What is the business case for “security” cameras to broadcast on wifi? I even caused consternation in a previous location when I pointed out the wired cameras were visible to anyone who knew the IP Nr (which was trivial to deduce). Shifting them to a dedicated VLAN was one step up, still findable to a dedicated opponent.

But a camera spewing its pictures openly into the sky gives new meaning to “friendly”.

just like a predator drone

@Scott Lewis:

The link is to an IT company. The single sentance is indicative of such posts.

Have a look on the current 100 comments page for quite a few of that form flagged up today.

Because of the sentance was sort of vaguely related I said,

‘Looks like,’

Rather than ‘is’.

This is why the only real security you’ll ever have is inside your head and they are coming for that space too!

There are some practical hurdles to be overcome if one to fly a drone.
– Drones operators must has line of sight to the drone. This means if a drone is in sight but the operator can be seen, then alarms are set of in knowledgeable persons that something fishy is going on.
– Drone operators must respect the privacy of persons and properties where they are flying. Do a drone on a clandestine mission will raise red flags as its flight path will not respect the privacy of persons and properties. The drone will raise alarms that something unlawful is being conducted using the drone.
– There are plenty of flight restrictions to limit the use of drones. Usability of drones that follows the law would be at the mercy of drone flight restrictions. Any flights ignoring the restrictions only draws attention that something unlawful is be carried out.
– USA and other countries now mandate drones have identification transmitters.

So the regulations of drones are a huge hurdle against using drones for eavesdropping using Wifi.

@Aaron, the US Army War Collage already has, in 1998:

I thought this was going to be about this old project

<http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/wivi/index.html>

and their extension of “passive radar”

@ Wait, ALL,

Re : assumed physical hurdles.

> “Drones operators must has line of sight to the drone.”

Not true at all, drones even very inexpensive drones can fly a GPS way-point course. You can drmonstrate theis on many drones by cutting the operators TX signal and the drone flys back under GPS to it’s point of origin…

> “Drone operators must respect the privacy of persons and properties where they are flying. “

And how is that enforced technically?

Let me think, err it’s not…

> “USA and other countries now mandate drones have identification transmitters.”

And what’s to stop...
