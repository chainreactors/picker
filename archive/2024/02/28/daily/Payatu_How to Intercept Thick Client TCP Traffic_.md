This blog covers how we went about solving the issues that come with traditional proxies when pentesting thick client applications.

## What are Thick Clients?

A “[Thick Client](https://payatu.com/blog/pentesting-linux-thick-client-applications/)” (also called “Fat Client”) is an application that has most of its resources installed locally. These applications are capable of working offline since most of the computation is handled locally, and maintaining a constant co...
