[Application security](/burp/application-security-testing) teams are under pressure. With expanding application estates, growing API usage, and faster release cycles, many teams struggle to keep up. Backlogs grow, releases are delayed, and sometimes apps ship without proper testing.

Earlier this year we surveyed AppSec leaders across several industries and regions, and more than half of them told us they were struggling with the complexity of modern applications.

Yet one thing remains constant: security professionals trust **[Burp Suite Professional](/burp/pro)** for its accuracy, depth, and flexibility. The question isâ€”how can teams scale that same level of trusted testing across hundreds of apps and APIs, without slowing down workflows?

**Watch the webinar below** or read on to see how [Burp Suite DAST](/burp/dast) helps answer that challenge:
