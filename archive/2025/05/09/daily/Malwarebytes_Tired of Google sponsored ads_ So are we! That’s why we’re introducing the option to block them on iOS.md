# Tired of Google sponsored ads? So are we! That’s why we’re introducing the option to block them on iOS

Posted: May 8, 2025

Sponsored ads on Google search don’t just irritate users—they also provide a dangerous opportunity for cybercriminals to spread [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) and scams to their unsuspecting victims. What looks like a harmless search result can be a carefully disguised trap.

At Malwarebytes, our researchers have uncovered a variety of threats hiding in plain sight within these sponsored ads, including [Mac stealers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/poseidon-mac-stealer-distributed-via-google-ads) distributed through Google Ads, [scams targeting popular utility software](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/large-scale-google-ads-campaign-targets-utility-software), and [tech support traps](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2024/12/repeat-offenders-drive-bulk-of-tech-support-scams-via-google-ads).

[In some cases](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/deepseek-users-targeted-with-fake-sponsored-google-ads-that-deliver-malware), scammers use advanced [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) tools like DeepSeek AI to create convincing ads and web pages, increasing the risk to unsuspecting users.

That’s why we’re excited to roll out a brand new feature in Malwarebytes for iOS: the ability to block Google sponsored ads directly on Safari.

If you’ve used our iOS app before, you already know it blocks ads on webpages and ad trackers. But with our newest feature, we’re extending protection to cover those annoying and potentially dangerous sponsored ads listed on search results.

Now, with just a simple toggle, you can make those annoying sponsored ads disappear from your Safari browsing experience.

**Try it for yourself**: [Download Malwarebytes for iOS](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile) and enjoy this feature—alongside scam text filtering, a privacy [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn), and call protection—with a free seven-day trial.

Existing users should already have this feature option in their app—check it out now!

**Don’t have an iOS device?** Download our [free Browser Guard extension](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard) for ad blocking and scam protection while browsing on your desktop.
