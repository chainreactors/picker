Researchers can disclose two brand-new vulnerabilities in OpenSSH now that patches have been released.

Qualys discovered the bugs in January, per its disclosure timeline. These vulnerabilities allow miscreants to perform machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on the OpenSSH client and pre-authentication denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Patches for CVE-2025-26465 and CVE-2025-26466 were released this morning. Although their respective severity scores (6.8 and 5.9 out of 10) don't necessarily scream "patch me right away" – it certainly doesn't seem as bad as last year's [regreSSHion](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/01/regresshion_openssh/) issue – they're both likely to raise some degree of concern given the tool's prominence.
