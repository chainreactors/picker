#
# CVE-2023-1389 is an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the web
# management interface of the TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800), specifically, in the
# *country* parameter of the *write* callback for the *country* form at the
# "/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=/locale" endpoint. By modifying the country parameter it is
# possible to run commands as root. Execution requires sending the request twice;
# the first request sets the command in the *country* value, and the second request
# (which can be identical or not) executes it.
#
# This script is a short proof of concept to obtain a reverse shell. To read more
# about the development of this script, you can read the blog post here:

# Before running the script, start a nc listener on your preferred port -> run the script -> profit
