# SoS - State of the Space 2024

## Where we at, where we going

Posted by ceres-c

Hi everyone, ceres-c here, the newly elected president of MuHack. I’m here to
give a brief overview of the current state of the space and what we have in
store for the future.

*This post is essentially going to be a human-parsable version of the minutes*
*from the last general assembly.*

## State of the Space

First things first: this year we celebrated our **10th anniversary**, rejoice!
The party was a blast, filled with nostalgia too: old faces showed up, and we
revisited a decade of hacking through old photos.

Thing is, in 10 years we never learned how to properly manage our space. We
still have a lot of stuff that we don’t use, and don’t have a proper inventory
of what we have. That will be fixed.

We’ve started by cleaning up the space, and we’ve made some good progress in
throwing away all the useless stuff/junk we had lying around. There are still
some things to give away, so don’t be shy and ask if you need a magnetic door
lock, some bug spray or bubble liquid (why do we even have these?). They will
be thrown away pretty soon if no one claims them.

Some space has been freed up, and we were able to fit our new toys in the
“main” cabinet. We now have a **hot plate**, an **infrared camera** and an
**ultrasound cleaner** that will be helpful when fixing electronics.

## Future

We have a lot of ideas for the future, and we’re going to need your help to
make them happen. Here’s a brief list of what we’re planning to do:

* **Electronic parts inventory**: We will finally keep track of what we have,
  and what we need. Up to this point, we relied on our memory, which frankly
  failed us more often than not.

  Hence, we’re going to use **[PartsBox](https://partsbox.com)** which I
  (ceres-c) have been using for a while at home, and I’m very happy with. It’s
  free for individuals, but we were gifted a free organization account by the
  kind folks at PartsBox. Thanks a lot Jan, you’ll be single-handedly holding
  back a fair amount of our chaos.

  The inventory will be available online (read-only), and you’ll be able to see
  what the space has in stock at any time. There will be a computer in the
  space near the parts cabinet, so you can check/modify the inventory on the
  spot. Everything will be barcoded, and people are already making fun of me
  for how excited I am about this. More details in the next weeks.
* **Soldering bench**: Our soldering bench already got a big upgrade and now is
  in a much better shape. We still need a better hot air station, but that’s
  coming soon enough. The microscope will also be installed on a VESA arm, so
  it can be moved around easily. However, it is definitely usable as it is now.

* **Server**: We’re finally going to get the server we’ve been talking about
  for a year up and running. It is kinda old, but still rather beefy
  machine that will be used for various purposes, including hosting our own
  [wiki](#wiki). Maybe it’s also time for a mailing list? (old timers will
  get this)

  We need some SSDs to put in it, so this is a bit expensive: it will have to
  wait until next year when subscriptions will come in.
* **Wiki**: We’re going to set up a wiki for the space,
  where we’ll keep track of all the projects we’re working on, how to use our
  tools (think 3d printer configs), and all the knowledge we’re gathering.
  This will be a great resource for new members, and for old members that
  forget things alike (like me). It will be a MediaWiki instance, since
  everyone is familiar with the interface.

  Please fill the wiki with info about your projects once it’s up. Just use it,
  please.
* **Tindie**: It might be a good idea to open a Tindie store for the space, to
  sell stuff made by our members
  ([[1]](https://github.com/MrMoDDoM/MuHack-Badge),
  [[2]](https://github.com/MrMoDDoM/MuTag)) and gadgets/shirts made for the
  space. We’ll see how it goes, and feel free to hit us up if you have a
  hardware project you’d like to share.
* **Bank account**: The future is coming to MuHack: we’ll be able to accept
  wire transfers and pay for stuff online. It’s almost like we’re adults now!
  This will definitely make our (board) life easier.

## Upcoming events

We’re in the process of asking the University for funds to organize this year’s
MuHackademy and, hopefully, a new edition of the
[Build-n-Smash](/news/hack-n-smash-2k19/). No dates yet, but
we’ll keep you posted.

More events are likely to happen, and we’re always open to new ideas. If you
have something in mind, don’t be shy and tell us about it.

## Conclusion

We have a lot of stuff planned for the near future, and we’re going to need the
help of all of you to make it happen. Let’s make this hackerspace amazing
together!

Federico / ceres-c, out.
