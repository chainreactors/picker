## Location Tracking App for Foreigners in Moscow

Russia is [proposing a rule](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/russia-to-enforce-location-tracking-app-on-all-foreigners-in-moscow/) that all foreigners in Moscow install a tracking app on their phones.

> Using a mobile application that all foreigners will have to install on their smartphones, the Russian state will receive the following information:
>
> * Residence location* Fingerprint* Face photograph* Real-time geo-location monitoring

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen this. Qatar [did it](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/11/world_cup_security/) in 2022 around the World Cup:

> “After accepting the terms of these apps, moderators will have complete control of users’ devices,” he continued. “All personal content, the ability to edit it, share it, extract it as well as data from other apps on your device is in their hands. Moderators will even have the power to unlock users’ devices remotely.”

I suppose it is worth pointing out that whenever a government tries to gain information in a way that is transparently obvious, it generally results in that attempt being gamed?

An example was a cafe in London in the 1970s. The cafe was known for being a meeting-place of various political dissidents of all stripes and for that reason the police had seen fit to install a fairly obvious tap on the telephone.

As a result of realising this the cafe owner had decided upon a cunning plan to foil this tapping. Anyone leaving the cafe would be given a coin, perhaps 10 pence, and told to phone back and ask where the riot would be. On being told when and where, they should on no account even leave their house on that day.

This went on for some weeks with the police becoming more and more convinced that a huge political riot was due. Phrases such as “…and remember to bring your Sten gun” and “…don’t forget the petrol” helped the police along with this belief.

On the day of the riot the proposed site, a small park, was surrounded by huge numbers of police. The only civilian present was an elderly and exceedingly puzzled pensioner slowly walking an equally decrepit dog, which occasionally wagged its tail at police officers and showed no other interest in proceedings. After the pensioner had gone home the police were left completely alone to ponder the source of their intelligence.

The wire tap was removed soon afterwards.

What about Palestine? Israel was also intercepting and controlling everything.

What about those who don’t have phones that can install apps?

@Vesselin: I’m guessing those folks would have to borrow one for the trip.

@ Bruce, ALL,

The bullet point list you’ve quoted as to what Russia can do is as far as we know woefully incomplete.

The intent is almost certainly as bad if not worse than the quote about the Qatar “World Cup” App.

Also people need to remember that both Apple and Google built in a tracking / contact capability via “beaconing” for Covid and the “base of the system” is still present (as is similar for “client side scanning”).

The only safe thing to do would be to buy the cheapest and nastiest phone at the departure airport, don’t even bother putting a SIM in and dump the phone shortly before you come home or at the return airport.

Oh and leave it “on charge” “SIM out” in your hotel room as much as possible in a locked briefcase or bag you can easily make “tamper evident” to limit those “Evil Maids” who might decide theft is the best thing to do.

A subtlety from Clive’s comment is that what the Russian State is expecting to get from the app is probably similar from what USA can get right now through their relationships with Apple and Google.

@TimH

Another subtlety from @Clive’s comment would be the reason why my pre-Covid phone is not white-listed for 4G/VoLTE when our much delayed 3G shutdown happens later this year. The maker’s specs, and the online handbook clearly show the device is capable, but this is a Five Eyes nation and the local telco seems to have removed the function in an OTA “Security” update.

I’d suggest just making everyone wear tracking anklets like violent criminals let out of prison on parole do… but I guess such a thing is very old fashioned. Phones give out much much more detailed and invasive information, and everyone has mostly accepted broadcasting all such information to everyone who wants it. Panopticon.

I suspect it is simply a tool of intimidation.

It is the old panopticon: All foreigners know they can be seen and heard at any time, but they are never sure when they are observed and when not.

The same holds for any Russian who speaks or contacts a foreigner. They know everything they say, write, or do can be observed. But they don’t know what is actually observed and stored.

It intimidates all foreigners and all Russians who come into contact with them. It extends the practice that is already working in telecommunication where Russians are afraid to tell family members outside Russia what they think over the phone.

I think that this intimidati...
