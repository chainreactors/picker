*Update July 22, 2024: Shortly after we published this post, Google announced it's no longer deprecating third-party cookies in Chrome. We've updated this blog to note the news.*

The latest update of [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) opts users out of ad tracking through Google’s “Privacy Sandbox.”

Privacy Sandbox is Google’s way of letting advertisers keep targeting ads [based on your online behavior](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/ban-online-behavioral-advertising) without using third-party cookies. Third-party cookies were once the [most common form of online tracking technology](https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror), but major browsers, like Safari and Firefox, [started blocking them several years ago](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking). After [pledging to eventually do the same](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html) for Chrome in 2020, and after several delays, today Google backtracked on its privacy promise, announcing that third-party cookies are here to stay. Notably, Google Chrome continues to [lag behind other browsers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening) in terms of [default protections against online tracking](https://www.computerworld.com/article/1639403/online-privacy-best-browsers-settings-and-tips.html)...
