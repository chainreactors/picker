Usually the first thing comes to mind when facing an unexpected behaviour while working with SAP Cloud for Customer is to open a case to SAP Support. However, sometimes this situation could be a more straightforward error or a simple behaviour confirmation.

Those incidents are going to go through the whole case lifecycle and it can take longer than what is necessary to have an answer to your question. Besides the incident, the most common process that you are used to, SAP Support offers a few different real-time support channels.

[Real-Time Support](https://d.dam.sap.com/a/4szDSDc/RTS_68738_Onlineversion_58700.pdf) is an approach which uses innovative tools and services to help you get assistance anytime, anywhere from any device. Our goal is to help you work more effectively with our software by simplifying solutions, providing accessible knowledge tools, and offering access to support experts.

Now that the real-time support concept is clear, let's explore all three different channels SAP Support offers to all customers:

**![829Us33.png (85×85)](https://i.imgur.com/829Us33.png) Expert Chat:** Differently from most support chat models, SAP Expert Chat connects you directly with the same SAP Support experts who would analyze your traditional case. The Expert Chat service is available to customers of every support-level subscription.The chat is recommended for medium and high priority scenarios, especially for how-to questions where system access is not necessary for SAP Support to be able to help you.

You can launch Expert Chat directly from SAP Cloud for Customer by following the steps below:

1. After logged in, click on your avatar at the top-right corner.

2. Then, click on the Help button.

4. Login with your S-User and you will be redirected to SAP for Me "Get Support" screen.

5. Type the Issue Description.

6. Select the language, affected system and the Product Function.

7. Select the appropriate priority (please be aware that Expert Chat won't be available for Very High priority scenarios).

It reaches a resolution quicker than an average low/medium case and provides the opportunity to screen share for a better understanding of the scenario. The scheduled appointments require 3 days notice to allow the expert to prepare for the session. Tell us your support-related question, the product area that you want to discuss and we'll find an available expert to assist you, at a time of your choice. Schedule an Expert also versatilely allows you to request help for both new issues or for open incidents.
