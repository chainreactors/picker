Detect ARM Malware in Seconds with Debian Sandbox for Stronger Enterprise Security

[ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=introducing_debian_arm&utm_term=310725&utm_content=linktolanding) provides SOC teams with the fastest solution for analyzing and detecting cyber threats targeting [Windows, Linux, and Android](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-analyze-malware-threats/) systems. Now, our selection of VMs has been expanded to include Linux Debian 12.2 64-bit (ARM).

With the rapid rise of ARM-based malware, the sandbox helps businesses tackle this threat through proactive analysis and early detection.

## Why ARM-based Malware is a Serious Threat to Your Company

ARM processors are widely used in resource-constrained IoT devices, embedded systems, and even low-power servers, often deployed with weak security. These devices become prime targets for attackers looking to build massive botnets, steal resources, or gain unauthorized access. The three most popular types of ARM-based malware include:

* [Botnets](https://any.run/malware-trends/botnet): Turning devices into “zombies” for DDoS attacks.

* [Cryptojackers](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/crypto-malware/): Hijacking CPU for cryptocurrency mining.

* [Backdoors](https://any.run/malware-trends/backdoor/): Maintaining persistent unauthorized system access.

By expanding the capabilities to identify these threats, companies can prevent large-scale incidents in their infrastructure and reduce costs associated with downtime, recovery, and incident response.

## Launch Your First Malware Analysis in Linux Debian (ARM) VM

The new OS is now available to all [Enterprise users](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-enterprise-plan/), unlocking deeper analysis capabilities for ARM-based threats.

To select the Linux Debian VM, follow these simple steps:

1. Open [ANY.RUN’s Interactive sandbox](https://app.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=introducing_debian_arm&utm_term=310725&utm_content=linktoregistration).

2. Navigate to the *New analysis* window.

3. Open the *Operating system* menu

3. Click on *Linux Debian 12.2 (ARM, 64 bit)*

4. Upload a file/URL you want to analyze, configure the rest of your settings, and run your analysis.

The update further empowers your security team to detect malware and phishing early with ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox:

* **Ensure fast analysis**: Accelerate triage, incident response, and threat hunting with a dedicated ARM environment for instant insights into any threat’s behavior.

* **Cut costs**: Analyze ARM-based malware along with Windows, Android, Linux x86 threats directly in ANY.RUN’s sandbox, eliminating the need for multiple platforms.

* **Improve incident escalation**: Gather rich, actionable data during Tier 1 analysis to enhance informed handoffs to Tier 2 to mitigate active attacks more effectively.

* **Grow team’s expertise**: Help your SOC analysts enhance their skills by analyzing real-world ARM threats, building confidence and knowledge through hands-on investigations.

## Real-World Use Case: Kaiji Botnet

To demonstrate how ANY.RUN’s Linux Debian 12.2 (ARM, 64-bit) Sandbox operates, we analyzed a real-world sample of the Kaiji botnet, malware specifically compiled for the ARM architecture.

Kaiji is a botnet that targets Linux-based servers and IoT devices. Once executed, it performs system reconnaissance, masks its presence, disables security mechanisms ...
