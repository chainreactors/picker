# Amazon’s Evil Pirate Fire Stick Survives 18 Months of Free Viral Advertising

Aggressive pricing led to Amazon's Fire TV Stick being installed in millions of homes. By tearing down a key barrier to entry, Amazon hoped to profit from subsequent sales of premium content. Two decades earlier, Jeff Bezos stressed the importance of strong branding to fend off copycats. In 2023, that theory would be put to the test when one of Amazon's strongest brands was dumped in mud, then dragged through it for the next 18 months.

On a Saturday afternoon when everything runs to plan, the referee blows his whistle and for the next 105 minutes, nothing matters more than *this* game in *this* magnificent stadium.

Yet, viewed from almost any other vantage point, top tier professional football faces problems in every direction.

At the Financial Times’ Business of Football Summit on Wednesday, DAZN’s head of global rights Tom Burrows spoke of the sports rights industry “getting to the stage where it’s almost a crisis.” Coming from a company that has already spent billions on TV rights and plans to spend billions more, “crisis” takes a different shape when considering the £8.7 billion deficit in DAZN’s latest set of accounts.

Broadcasting rights are necessary but, as costs cascade from rightsholders to broadcasters and ultimately down to the fans, prohibitively high prices eliminate loyal fans from the top-tier football business equation. At a time of “almost crisis” when the majority of clubs continue to report losses, ideally fans should be traveling in the other direction.

Unsustainable business models have a direct effect on fans’ ability to financially support the game. At clubs around Europe, the cause of today’s crisis is clear, and something on which they all agree: the root of the industry’s woes is rampant online piracy.

What caused piracy to run rampant in the first place is rarely discussed. Fans, on the other hand, consistently cite the same motivations to pirate, year in and year out.

## Piracy is Illegal and Simply Has to Stop

Expecting fans to comply with the law is not unreasonable but, since prevention is better than cure, shaping public perceptions in advance is also an option for rightsholders.

In Italy, public awareness campaigns are a legal requirement but, with so many moving parts, whether these efforts make much difference is up for debate. Even if an awareness campaign moved an entire nation to tears, a couple of 30-second videos are no basis for the scale and persistence of change the situation demands.

According to the FT report, the piracy situation in the UK is “not believed to be as bad” as those faced in Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. Sky Group COO Nick Herm nevertheless spoke this week of a “never-ending battle”, while initially declining to put a figure on the cost to the business.

When asked to estimate how much piracy costs the business, Herm said it was difficult to quantify as very few people are willing to admit accessing pirated content. He nevertheless added that “hundreds of millions of dollars” go ‘missing’ from the company’s revenue streams due to piracy.

An estimate in the low hundreds seems to fit the bigger picture. Determining the nature of this ‘gray’ audience would help to separate potential lost sales from the folly of chasing lost causes.

## Making Piracy Attractive

From any UK vantage point *outside* a Premier League stadium mid-Saturday afternoon, matches are unavailable to view live, *at any price*. The ‘3pm blackout’ is regularly cited as a prime reason for fans turning to illegal streams.

When the Premier League broadcasts 3pm games and every other game in countries including Canada, the prices are significantly lower than those available to fans in the UK, for a more restricted content offering. UK fans clearly have an issue with that, but the bigger question is whether the policy contributes to overall piracy.

When the Premier League denies access to live broadcasts of some of the most significant games, that creates demand for a highly desirable product that doesn’t exist in the UK. This not only acts as an incentive to supply pirated content to an underserved market, but also provides the conditions for profit.

People have spent time in prison in the UK for fulfilling that demand. And since pirate IPTV packages aren’t only available for use on Saturdays, those who ‘beat the blackout’ have zero incentive to maintain any legal package for viewing during the week.

## Adjusting Customer Attitudes to Match Terms of Supply

[![bestreamwise](https://torrentfreak.com/images/bestreamwise-s.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/bestreamwise-s.png)Crafting an awareness campaign to mitigate the Canadian example above would face obvious hurdles, yet with decades of experience, probably not impossible for a company like Sky. The BeStreamWise anti-piracy campaign involving Sky, Premier League, BBC, ITV, DAZN, and others, [launched in September 2023](https://torrentfreak.com/bestreamwise-police-bbc-dazn-quietly-added-to-iptv-piracy-campaign-241028/).

The campaign’s focus on malware provided no specific advice. With no security vendors on board to add credibility to its claims, any awareness raised seemed limited to the claims, not the underlying threats. None of the threats were publicly named for awareness or avoidance purposes, but it didn’t take long for an innocent sore thumb to stand out as a possible scapegoat.

## Throwing the Baby Out With the Bathwater

Amazon’s Fire TV Stick hit the market in 2014 and was soon recognized as the cheapest way to transform an existing dumb TV into something smarter. Amazon was happy to see its competitors’ products competing alongside its own on Fire TV. Streaming market leader Netflix went head-to-head with Prime Video, while Spotify jostled for business against Amazon Music, for example.

Yet, in common with most Android-based devices on the market, Fire Sticks were capable of a much more. Since they were comparatively cheap, well-made and in constant supply, Fire Sticks became the go-to device for pirates and non-pirates alike.

At a time when Amazon held the rights to show a limited number of live Premier League matches, and was gifting them to Prime customers for no additional cost, the demonization of ‘firesticks’ stepped up a gear. With plenty of assistance from elements of the UK tabloid media, an entirely legal Amazon product found itself elevated to pirate boogeyman status.

*DANGER: LEGAL STREAMING*

In what would become a recurring theme, public warnings concerning piracy found themselves coupled with serious but non-specific malware threats. Then by coincidence or design, references to Fire TV Stick-based devices and even Ama...
