## Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and pals promise clarity on cybercrew naming, deliver alias salad instead

Opinion Microsoft and CrowdStrike made a lot of noise on Monday about teaming up with other threat-intel outfits to "bring clarity to threat-actor naming."

It's a great idea that would benefit network defenders tasked with keeping track of the 200-plus nation-state, financially motivated, and hacktivist crews that all the major security vendors and government agencies call by different names. Take Cozy Bear, also dubbed Midnight Blizzard, APT29, or UNC2452, depending on who you ask.

"Our mutual customers are always looking for clarity," Microsoft Security corporate VP Vasu Jakkal [wrote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/06/02/announcing-a-new-strategic-collaboration-to-bring-clarity-to-threat-actor-naming/). "Aligning the known commonalities among these actor names directly with peers helps to provide greater clarity and gives defenders a clearer path to action."
