# Victoria’s Secret hit by outages as it battles security incident

Fashion retail giant Victoria’s Secret said it is addressing a “security incident,” as its website and online orders face ongoing disruption.

Victoria’s Secret posted the brief statement on its website Wednesday. The company’s outages began earlier on Monday, as [users have reported](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1kwn99o/whats_going_on_with_the_victorias_secret_it/) not being able to access the Victoria’s Secret website.

“We immediately enacted our response protocols, third-party experts are engaged, and we took down our website and some in store services as a precaution,” a spokesperson for Victoria’s Secret said in response to TechCrunch’s inquiries. The spokesperson did not provide their name nor describe the nature of the cybersecurity incident.

“We are working to quickly and securely restore operations,” the spokesperson said. The company said its stores remain open.

Victoria’s Secret closed down 7% on the news of the security incident.
