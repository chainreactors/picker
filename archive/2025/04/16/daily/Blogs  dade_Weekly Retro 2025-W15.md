I’m a day late, and it’s going to be a erratic one. You see, I spent most of my weekend away from the computer, which included not setting aside the time to write this that I normally would. I can’t say it was entirely intentional, at least not at first. But by the end of Sunday, it was definitely a conscious choice I was making, to not jump on the computer. To not feel the pressure I put on myself with great frequency to be “productive.”

Instead, I spent the weekend relaxing. I binge watched both seasons of [SAS Rogue Heroes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10405370/), which I enjoyed quite thoroughly. It was a nice mix of “feels like history” and entertainment. I haven’t historically enjoyed watching many things that take place around World War 2, but I feel like this one was great. It’s from the makers of Peaky Blinders, which I also haven’t watched, but that I might watch now that I watched and enjoyed this.

When I wasn’t relaxing watching this show, I took time to go outside and enjoy the weather. I went out for multiple walks, both weighted and not, and got about 10 miles in between Friday and Sunday.

I feel like this was an important thing to do, because for the last several weeks I have been working practically non-stop, in order to finish some projects I set out to do. I am heading home to see my family next week, and I wanted to get as much done as I could before I leave for that. And so I spent probably 60 hours a week for the last month working on things. I would not recommend it, but I will say that I always feel a remarkable sense of accomplishment when I’m able to buckle down like that and really get things done.

Speaking of that, I’m a day late on this post and I will unfortunately be skipping the retro slated for April 20th, since I won’t have any of my personal computers with me, and I keep a hard boundary between work and personal devices, so won’t be writing this post on my work laptop.

I also found myself, earlier in the week, thinking about my personal values. I don’t think I’m ready to expound on these too much at this time, but when I was younger I would sometimes think about this idea of personal values to live by, and felt like I had none. I didn’t know who I was at 17, 18, 19 years old. I’m not so sure I know now, either, but I do feel like I can look back and identify certain themes that have been consistent. I thought this was sort of unexpected, as it’s not something I’d thought of in quite a long time. But it was nice to capture some of my thoughts on it when the moment struck, even if it was nearly 1am and I was trying to sleep.

## Interesting Links

Honestly I don’t think I really read much of anything to share this week, which might be the first time I’ve left this section blank.

## Upcoming Projects

* [Defcon Call for Music/Tracks](https://defconmusic.org/def-con-33-call-for-music-tracks/) - I’ve submitted to the call for artists, but unfortunately still haven’t made much progress on my soundtrack song. The verse I have is okay, but I feel like it’s not my best work.
* **I want to do more live shows at hacker cons.** I’ll do it for the cost of getting to the con and the hotel room. If you, or someone you know, is organizing hacker cons and wants some new live nerdy rap shows, [please reach out via any of the platforms on my page](https://0xda.de/).
