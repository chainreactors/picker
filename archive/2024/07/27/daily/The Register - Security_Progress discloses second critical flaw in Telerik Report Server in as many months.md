Progress Software's latest security advisory warns customers about the second critical vulnerability targeting its Telerik Report Server in as many months.

CVE-2024-6327 is an insecure deserialization vulnerability (CWE-502) carrying a 9.9 CVSS score. Successful exploits can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on servers running all versions prior to 10.1.24.709.

These are the kinds of bugs that in an ideal world should be fixed in double quick time, but you should pay special attention to this one in particular because of attackers' history with this type of vulnerability in this suite of products.
