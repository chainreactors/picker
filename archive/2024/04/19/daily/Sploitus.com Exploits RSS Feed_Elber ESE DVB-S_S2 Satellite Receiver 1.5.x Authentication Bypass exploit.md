Elber ESE DVB-S/S2 Satellite Receiver 1.5.x Authentication Bypass

Vendor: Elber S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.elber.it
Affected version: 1.5.179 Revision 904
1.5.56 Revision 884
1.229 Revision 440

Summary: ESE (Elber Satellite Equipment) product line, designed for the
high-end radio contribution and distribution market, where quality and
reliability are most important. The Elber IRD (Integrated Receiver Decoder)
ESE-01 offers a professional audio quality (and composite video) at an
excellent quality/price ratio. The development of digital satellite contribution
networks and the need to connect a large number of sites require a cheap
but reliable and performing satellite receiver with integrated decoder.

Desc: The device suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability through
a direct and unauthorized access to the password management functionality. The
issue allows attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the set_pwd
endpoint that enables them to overwrite the password of any user within the
system. This grants unauthorized and administrative access to protected areas
of the application compromising the device's system security.
