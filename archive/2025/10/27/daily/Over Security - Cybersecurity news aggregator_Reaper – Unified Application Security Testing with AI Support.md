# Reaper – Unified Application Security Testing with AI Support

October 27, 2025

The open-source framework Reaper is designed for application security (AppSec) testing. Created by Ghost Security, Reaper positions itself as “a modern, lightweight, and deadly effective open-source application security testing framework—engineered by humans and primed for AI.” It aims to consolidate reconnaissance, traffic proxying, tampering, fuzzing, reporting, and collaboration into a single workflow.

## Overview

Most application security testing toolchains remain fragmented: a proxy tool (for example, [Burp Suite](https://www.darknet.org.uk/2007/01/burp-proxy-burp-suite-attacking-web-applications/) or [OWASP ZAP](https://www.darknet.org.uk/2010/10/owasp-zap-zed-attack-proxy-web-application-penetration-testing/)) here, a separate fuzzing engine there, distinct reporting tooling elsewhere. For red teams and bug-bounty hunters under time pressure, this fragmentation adds overhead. Reaper attempts to address this by providing one framework that spans multiple phases of the testing lifecycle. The repository README notes the goal of being “usable by humans and AI Agents alike”. Ghost Security’s blog describes Reaper as part of “autonomous application security” built around reconnaissance scanning, proxying, tampering, active fuzz testing, and detailed reporting.

## Features

Key features of Reaper as documented in the source:

* **Reconnaissance and Enumeration:** Enumerates targets through intelligent domain scanning.
* **Request Proxying, Intercepting and Tampering:** Captures HTTP/S traffic for inspection and modification.
* **Active Fuzz Testing:** Fuzzes request parameters to uncover vulnerabilities in workflows and APIs.
* **Workflow Automation:** Supports drag-and-drop nodes such as Request, Fuzzer, Sender and Extractor for reusable test chains.
* **AI Agent Integration:** Designed for use by human testers or autonomous AI Agents.
* **Lightweight, Extensible Platform:** Modular architecture allowing future integrations and extensions.

## Installation

The repository README references a “getting started” guide for detailed setup. The following base commands are safe to execute locally for cloning and exploration:

If you have Docker 19.x or above, you can do this to get started:

docker run -t --rm \
-e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
-e PORT=8000 \
-e PROXY\_PORT=8080 \
-e OPENAI\_API\_KEY=sk-your-key-here \
-p 8000:8000 \
-p 8080:8080 \
ghcr.io/ghostsecurity/reaper:latest

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 | docker run -t --rm  \  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \  -e PORT=8000 \  -e PROXY\_PORT=8080 \  -e OPENAI\_API\_KEY=sk-your-key-here \  -p 8000:8000 \  -p 8080:8080 \  ghcr.io/ghostsecurity/reaper:latest |

Reaper supports running as a local binary or via Docker. Consult the live documentation for the latest verified commands and configuration options.

## Usage

The workflow system enables testers to define sequences of proxy, fuzz, and reporting actions. Typical usage involves:

**Example workflow**
1. Start Reaper and create a workspace for your target domain.
2. Capture HTTP/S traffic through the built-in proxy.
3. Import a request and insert variables for parameters to test.
4. Add a Fuzzer node with payloads or patterns.
5. Connect Sender and Extractor nodes to analyze responses.
6. Run the workflow and export results for review.

All actions can be assembled visually in the Reaper interface, stored, and shared with other testers for repeatability.

## Attack Scenario

Consider a target endpoint such as `https://target.example.com/api/user?id=123`. Using Reaper, a penetration tester could:

* Create a workspace scoped to `target.example.com`.
* Capture the request via proxy.
* Import it into a workflow and replace the `id` value with a placeholder.
* Add a Fuzzer node with payloads like 0,1,-1,9999,10000.
* Attach Sender and Extractor nodes to process responses.
* Run the workflow and identify enumeration or logic flaws.

This replicates traditional manual fuzzing but automates the process within a single visual workflow.

## Red Team Relevance

Reaper is especially relevant for red-team and bug-bounty professionals who want to reduce toolchain friction. Its benefits include:

* **Unified environment:** Consolidates reconnaissance, interception, fuzzing and reporting.
* **Repeatable workflows:** Enables standardized procedures across engagements.
* **AI readiness:** Provides a foundation for integrating automated or agent-based security testing in the future.

The approach suits rapid, iterative offensive testing cycles, particularly in organizations exploring continuous application security testing.

## Detection and Mitigation

From a defender’s standpoint, use of Reaper may manifest as systematic fuzzing or replay activity. Blue teams can detect such activity through:

* Unusual request repetition or parameter sequencing.
* Certificate injection for proxy interception.
* Automated traffic patterns or replayed payloads.

Mitigation includes enforcing strict access scopes, monitoring outbound proxy traffic, and auditing the tools used within controlled testing environments.

## Comparison

**Versus Burp Suite:** Burp is commercial and feature-rich, but Reaper offers a free open-source option with AI-agent extensibility.

**Versus OWASP ZAP:** ZAP provides proxy and scripting functions but lacks native workflow automation and AI integration.

**Versus standalone fuzzing tools:** Tools such as Subfinder or FFUF focus narrowly on scanning; Reaper links multiple stages together into a cohesive testing chain.

## Conclusion

Reaper represents a promising evolution in application security tooling. Its unified design simplifies traditional multi-tool workflows and introduces AI-ready automation for offensive testers. As the project matures, it could become a core utility for penetration testers and red-team operators seeking faster, more integrated methods of discovering vulnerabilities.
