## Amazing that these two bugs got into a production appliance, say researchers

Palo Alto Networks (PAN) finally released a CVE identifier and patch for the zero-day exploit that caused such a fuss last week.

The vendor dropped details of two vulnerabilities exploited as zero-days. The first, tracked as CVE-2024-0012, an authentication bypass bug, has a 9.3 (critical) severity rating, and users are encouraged to upgrade to one of the many patched maintenance versions of PAN-OS with the highest degree of urgency.

The second, CVE-2024-9474, carries a less severe 6.9 (medium) severity rating and is classified as a privilege escalation bug. Like the first bug, it also affects the PAN-OS management interface but also allows attackers to gain admin access and perform actions as root.
