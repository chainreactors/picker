Fireworks burning in the night sky

Hi everyone,

This year has been challenging for everyone, though we’ve still had a year filled with new achievements and goals to celebrate.

Let’s review some previous releases!

For **inbound invoicing option**, the team has released the following legal requirements for:

* NF-e Technical Note 2020.005

* CT-e Technical Note 2020.002

* CT-e Technical Note 2022.001

We’ve also released the **Receiver Acknowledgment** overall solution.

During this year, we’ve delivered approximately 40 SAP Notes about new features and improvements for inbound invoicing option, and you can check them in the SAP Note [2776753](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/%20%202776753).

For **outbound invoicing option**, the team has released the following features and improvements:
