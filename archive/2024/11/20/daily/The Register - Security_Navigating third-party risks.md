Webinar As organizations increasingly rely on third-party contractors, vendors, and service providers, the security risks associated with third-party access can become a top priority.

Unauthorized access by external parties can introduce significant vulnerabilities into IT infrastructure, threatening sensitive data, operational continuity, and compliance efforts. On [December 3rd at 11AM ET, SailPoint will host a webinar](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32858/protect-yourself-from-third-party-risk) in which Steve Toole, Principal Solutions Consultant at SailPoint, will be talking to the Reg's Tim Phillips about how to manage and mitigate third-party risk so that you can improve security and compliance.

This session will cover a comprehensive range of risk management strategies for protecting your organization from external access threats. Key topics include:

**- Identifying vulnerable access points:** Gain a thorough understanding of where third-party risks originate and how various external parties can introduce new vulnerabilities.

**- Implementing effective access controls:** Learn best practices for managing third-party identities, from assigning appropriate access permissions to implementing robust monitoring solutions that limit unauthorized access.

**- Establishing a culture of compliance and security:** Explore strategies to extend security and compliance practices to all third-party partners, ensuring they adhere to your organization's security standards and minimize the risk of exposure.

Attendees will leave with actionable insights which could help them fortify their data and system defenses, ensuring a proactive approach to third-party risk management.
