# Threat Informed Defense Series

A great, in depth series on threat modeling with ATTACK
![screen capture of Threat Informed Defense series title slide](/images/blog/img/2025/citd-1000w.png)

Tiffany Bergeron is Chief Architect at MITRE’s Mappings Program. We did a four part series, diving deep into threat modeling using ATT&CK. This is a deeper insight into the set of conversations that Kyle Wallace and I previewed at an [RSAC Virtual Seminar: Building Resilient Systems](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/virtual%20seminar/hds18-building-resilient-systems) (our video starts [here](https://youtu.be/XmIW4lC1yWM?feature=shared&t=4523).)

And while I’m always happy to be collaborating with my long-time colleagues from MITRE, I’m especially happy that we had this chance to dive, really deeply, into a specific threat modeling approach and the places we aligned and diverged. This sort of deep dive is still rare because, frankly, most organizations are still in the crawl phase of threat modeling: They’re starting, and they’re finding it to be hard to coordinate, hard to get where they’re going, and they fall down after eagerly standing up.

These deeper conversations are at the [Center for Threat Informed Defense](https://ctid.mitre.org/videos/threat-modeling-series/).

The other 3 videos can be a little tricky to find, there’s a menu at the top of the first one, on the upper right, with a little triangle in it:
