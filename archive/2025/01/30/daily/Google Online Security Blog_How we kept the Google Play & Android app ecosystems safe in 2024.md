Android and Google Play comprise a vibrant ecosystem with billions of users around the globe and millions of helpful apps. Keeping this ecosystem safe for users and developers remains our top priority. However, like any flourishing ecosystem, it also attracts its share of bad actors. That’s why every year, we continue to invest in more ways to protect our community and fight bad actors, so users can trust the apps they download from Google Play and developers can build thriving businesses.

Last year, those investments included AI-powered threat detection, stronger privacy policies, supercharged developer tools, new industry-wide alliances, and more. As a result, **we prevented 2.36 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play and banned more than 158,000 bad developer accounts that attempted to publish harmful apps.**

But that was just the start. For more, take a look at our recent highlights from 2024:

### Google’s advanced AI: helping make Google Play a safer place

To keep out bad actors, we have always used a combination of human security experts and the latest threat-detection technology. In 2024, we used Google’s advanced AI to improve our systems’ ability to proactively identify malware, enabling us to detect and block bad apps more effectively. It also helps us streamline review processes for developers with a proven track record of policy compliance. Today, **over 92% of our human reviews for harmful apps are AI-assisted**, allowing us to take quicker and more accurate action to help prevent harmful apps from becoming available on Google Play.

That’s enabled us to stop more bad apps than ever from reaching users through the Play Store, protecting users from harmful or malicious apps before they can cause any damage.

### Working with developers to enhance security and privacy on Google Play

To protect user privacy, we’re working with developers to reduce unnecessary access to sensitive data. **In 2024, we prevented 1.3 million apps from getting excessive or unnecessary access to sensitive user data.** We also required apps to be more transparent about how they handle user information by launching [new developer requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13327111?hl=en) and a new [“Data deletion”](https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/279819114/control-your-app-account-data-with-the-updated-data-safety-section) option for apps that support user accounts and data collection. This helps users manage their app data and understand the app’s deletion practices, making it easier for Play users to delete data collected from third-party apps.

We also worked to ensure that apps use the strongest and most up-to-date privacy and security capabilities Android has to offer. Every new version of Android introduces new security and privacy features, and we encourage developers to embrace these advancements as soon as possible. As a result of partnering closely with developers, **over 91% of app installs on the Google Play Store now use the latest protections of Android 13 or newer.**Safeguarding apps from scams and fraud is an ongoing battle for developers. The [Play Integrity API](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/12/making-play-integrity-api-faster-resilient-private.html) allows developers to check if their apps have been tampered with or are running in potentially compromised environments, helping them to prevent abuse like fraud, bots, cheating, and data theft. Play Integrity API and Play’s [automatic protection](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10183279) helps developers ensure that users are using the official Play version of their app with the latest security updates. **Apps using Play integrity features are seeing 80% lower usage from unverified and untrusted sources on average.**

We’re also constantly working to improve the safety of apps on Play at scale, such as with the [Google Play SDK Index](https://play.google.com/sdks). This tool offers insights and data to help developers make more informed decisions about the safety of an SDK. Last year, in addition to adding 80 SDKs to the index, we also worked closely with SDK and app developers to address potential SDK security and privacy issues, helping to build safer and more secure apps for Google Play.

### Google Play’s multi-layered protections against bad apps

To create a trusted experience for everyone on Google Play, we use our [SAFE principles](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/04/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-bad-actors-in-2023.html) as a guide, incorporating multi-layered protections that are always evolving to help keep Google Play safe. These protections start with the developers themselves, who play a crucial role in building secure apps. We provide developers with [best-in-class tools](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/overview), [best practices](https://developer.android.com/security), and on-demand training [resources](https://playacademy.withgoogle.com/courses/design) for building safe, high-quality apps. Every app undergoes rigorous [review and testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxFU9D4EtMc&t=1s), with only approved apps allowed to appear in the Play Store. Before a user downloads an app from Play, users can explore its user reviews, ratings, and [Data safety section](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11416267?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) on Google Play to help them make an informed decision. And once installed, [Google Play Protect](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en), Android’s built-in security protection, helps to shield their Android device by continuously scanning for malicious app behavior.

### Enhancing Google Play Protect to help keep users safe on Android

While the Play Store offers best-in-class security, we know it’s not the only place users download Android apps – so it’s important that we also defend Android users from more generalized mobile threats. To do this in an open ecosystem, we’ve invested in sophisticated, real-time defenses...
