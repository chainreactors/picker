**Update 6/1/23:**After overwhelming opposition, this bill did not get a floor vote before the Texas Legislature adjourned on 5/31/23. Thank you to EFF supporters, and all supporters of free speech and strong anti-SLAPP, for this victory.

**Update 5/18/23**: [News reports](https://www.kcbd.com/2023/05/18/free-speech-advocates-oppose-new-bill-texas-senate-deadline-nears/) indicate that this bill's language has also been added to a separate bill, Texas House Bill 3129. Texas lawmakers should vote no.

Some states’ legislatures, including California and Texas, have taken action to protect everyday peoples’ First Amendment rights by passing anti-SLAPP laws. These laws limit invasive discovery while a judge first determines if a case qualifies as a SLAPP. If it is a SLAPP, it can be thrown out quickly and, depending on the law, the person or company who filed the SLAPP can be made to pay legal fees of the party they sued. Anti-SLAPP laws have proven to be crucial tools in vindicating the rights of everyday people to speak out on issues of public concern.
