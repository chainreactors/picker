New customers have access to various Build entitlements based on their adopted SAP S/4HANA Cloud solution. If you want to learn more about what’s included in your new bundle, reach out to your Account Executive to clarify the correct entitlement package.

## **Below is a step-by-step guide on how to activate each Build product from the BTP cockpit:**

## **1- SAP Build Process Automation:**

1. First navigate to [SAP BTP Cockpit,](https://cockpit.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/cockpit/) on the left-hand side from the menu list, and click on “**Boosters**”.

2. Once the Boosters overview page opens, in the search field type “**SAP Build Process     Automation**” (1) and under Set up account for SAP Build Process Automation click the “**Start**” button (2).

3. SAP Build Process Automation overview page will open up, you can then proceed forward by clicking on “**Start**”.

4. The booster will then automatically perform a prerequisite test to confirm the service and your credentials. Once the two green boxes show to confirm the test has been completed successfully, you can click on “**Next**” at the bottom of the page.

5. On this page you can choose if you want to create a new sub-account or use an existing one. In this example we will choose “**Create sub-accoun**t" scenario (1). Click on “**Next**” (2) to configure account.

6. On this page you assign the quota for this sub-account. You will first delete the marked services as they are not required before you click on “**Next”**.

7. On this page you can add the users who will access SAP Build Process Automation tool, administrators (standard users) and developers (advanced users).  Note that any user who will be added as a developer will automatically be added as an administrator as well, but the opposite is not true. You can always add or edit users later.

Click on “**Next**” (3) to confirm users added.

8. In the last step you can review the summary of your setup. Once you confirm all information is accurate, click on “**Finish**”.

9. To get the service up and ready for you, the booster will then start the deployment process which can take **up to five minutes**. In the meantime, pamper yourself with a cup of coffee, you deserve a break!
