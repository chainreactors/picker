###### In the early hours of Monday, 10 October 2022, Russia pummelled Ukraine’s largest cities with missiles killing at [least 20 people and wounding more than 100](https://suspilne.media/292840-kilkist-zagiblih-pid-cas-raketnih-udariv-10-zovtna-zrosla-do-20-ludej-dsns/), according to Ukraine’s national emergency service. Russia has boasted about the surgical precision of its cruise missiles and claimed the [attacks](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-defence-ministry-all-targets-hit-massive-missile-strikes-ukraine-2022-10-10/) on 10 October targeted Ukraine’s military, security command centres and the national energy grid. However, [open-source evidence shows](https://ukraine.bellingcat.com/?id=CIV1573&id=CIV1524&id=CIV1512&id=CIV1511&id=CIV1510&id=CIV1508&id=CIV1507&id=CIV1506&id=CIV1505&id=CIV1504&id=CIV1525&id=CIV1560) that multiple missiles struck non-military targets, damaging [residential buildings](https://www.voanews.com/a/latest-developments-in-ukraine-oct-10/6783022.html) and hitting kindergartens and [playgrounds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1579413266094125056).

The 10 October attacks marked Russia’s largest coordinated missile strikes since the beginning of the war. Yet the destruction didn’t end there. Missile strikes continued the next day with at least [28 launched](https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1579821227027230720) on 11 October. The strikes left large numbers of civilians in Kyiv, Lviv, Vinnytsia, and Dnipro with no or sporadic access to electricity.

Cruise missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure continued into a second week on 17 October 2022, when Ukraine reported shooting down three cruise missiles flying towards Kyiv. On the morning of 18 October, new missile attacks were reported in [at least three cities](https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2022/10/18/7372381/) leaving some of them with no electricity. As of 18 October 2022, international prosecutors [were investigating](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strikes-ukraine-investigated-possible-war-crimes-prosecutor-2022-10-12/) the targeting of civilian buildings and critical civilian infrastructure as [potential war crimes.](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-nato-kyiv-business-76dba1ecb9c1d3ff04ec4609740c2283)

Remnants of a Kalibr missile found near impact craters on 10 October in Konotop, Ukraine, ([Source](https://t.me/operativnoZSU/47525): Ukraine’s Defence Ministry). The fuselage wreckage shows the Kalibr’s [tell-tale black broken stripes](https://en.missilery.info/files/styles/article_image/public/m/3m14e/3m14.jpg) (top right image) and the bottom shows partly the 3M-14 inscription that adorns the weapon and can be seen in greater detail [here](https://en.missilery.info/files/styles/article_image/public/m/3m14e/3m14.jpg)).

Visual evidence and [photographs](https://t.me/operativnoZSU/47525) of remains of the missiles show that many that were launched on 10 and 11 October 2022 were winged cruise missiles, of the sea-launched Kalibr (3M-14), the land-launched R-500 (9M728) for the Iskander system, and air-launched Kh-101 types. These missiles are [touted by Russia](https://rg.ru/2022/10/10/udar-vozmezdiia.html) as high-precision weapons that only destroy relevant military targets. However, since the start of Russia’s invasion, long-range cruise missiles have repeatedly destroyed [civilian infrastructure](https://defence-blog.com/bellingcat-identified-missile-that-russia-used-to-strike-on-kharkiv/) and caused hundreds of civilian deaths and injuries – for example when a cruise missile hit residential areas in [Odesa](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/world/europe/missile-strikes-odesa-ukraine.html) and [Mykolaiv](https://news.yahoo.com/russian-missiles-strike-mykolaiv-day-093500698.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAISMl60b3pKz1owtCSad7gHLA0xBmgr-sEDVGHuUVN8HuMxlA8JPNXCQaITfbVMfDClPvvvyAMmYrSCr97p_kCh6O2j2_LRu7N5LansGM6uiN1H4nueUtO17TBdcFuVwZxVKVupicZ3DTCZiN3IayVVMD_9dqqJP7r6enmTsSGOi) earlier this summer.

In one single day in July, cruise missile attacks on the city of Vinnytsia are reported to have killed [27 civilians](https://24tv.ua/ru/raketnyj-udar-po-vinnice-14-07-2022-pogibshee-chislo-zhertv_n2096773). These strikes, that hit non-military targets, suggest either that the missiles failed to follow their pre-programmed flight path, that targeting was based on defective intelligence information, or that civilian harm was intentional. In at least two cases in [April and early June](https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-cruise-missile-flows-extremely-115300550.html), Russian cruise missiles flew dangerously low above nuclear power stations, creating the risk of a nuclear accident in the event of a misfire or falling debris.

## **Russia’s Cruise Missiles**

Despite hundreds of open-source images and [videos](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1521624030511603712) showing the flight and deadly impact of cruise missiles, little is known about who exactly is responsible for setting their targets and for programming their flight paths. Attribution of the programming of the flight-path of these allegedly high-precision weapons is relevant as the deliberate or indiscriminate targeting of Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure [could constitute](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113782) potential war crimes.

**Following a six-month-long investigation, Bellingcat and its investigative partners The Insider and Der Spiegel were able to discover a hitherto secretive group of dozens of military engineers with an educational and professional background in missile programming. Phone metadata shows contacts between these individuals and their superiors spiked shortly before many of the high-precision Russian cruise missile strikes that have killed hundreds and deprived millions in Ukraine of access to electricity and heating. The group, which works from two locations – one at the Ministry of Defence headquarters in Moscow and another at the Admiralty headquarters in St. Petersburg – is buried deep within the Russian Armed Forces’ vast “Main Computati...
