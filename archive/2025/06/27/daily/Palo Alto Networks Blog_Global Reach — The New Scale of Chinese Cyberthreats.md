**After decades of tracking Chinese nation-state actors, cybersecurity veterans have never witnessed the scale and sophistication of threats we're seeing today. Organizations must fundamentally rethink their defensive posture to counter this escalating campaign.**

## **The New Reality of Attacks at Unprecedented Scale**

In a recent conversation on the [Threat Vector podcast](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/threat-vector/65/notes) with host David Moulton, Chief Security Intelligence Officer Wendi Whitmore, of Palo Alto Networks, puts today's threat landscape in stark historical perspective:

> I have been conducting investigations in this space specifically toward nation-state actors for almost 25 years. It's been a while, and we have never seen during that time frame, the scale of persistent threat activity that we're seeing today from Chinese nation-state threat actors.

Recent data validates this assessment. Chinese cyberattacks on Taiwan government departments doubled in 2024 from the previous year to an [average of 2.4 million attacks a day](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/chinese-cyberattacks-taiwan-government-averaged-24-mln-day-2024-report-says-2025-01-06/), while China-nexus activity has surged by 150% overall. The numbers tell only part of the story – attackers now operate with unprecedented speed.

"We're looking at within hours, and in some cases *minutes,* of mass vulnerabilities being identified and then systems, applications and services being identified for future exploitation," Whitmore explains. This acceleration mirrors data from the [Unit 42 Incident Response Report](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-incident-response-report-2024-threat-guide/), which shows software and API vulnerabilities now account for 38.60% of initial access in attacks, up from 28.20% the previous year.

## **Testing Infrastructure for Future Conflict Beyond Traditional Espionage**

Chinese threat actors aren't just stealing data, they're positioning themselves strategically. Whitmore describes operations that span entire governments: "Last year, we released research on about 23 different government organizations in Cambodia being compromised at nearly the same time. So we're looking at whole-of-government scale operations."

The targeting extends globally with calculated precision. "If you're an ally of the Chinese government, you are just as likely to be impacted by espionage as people who are not on the top of that ally list," Whitmore notes. Attacks by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) backed groups into U.S. critical infrastructure have been used periodically to test access to systems and see whether vulnerabilities get patched, indicating threat groups are lying in wait.

Additionally, the geographic focus reveals strategic intent. Many of the attacks have targeted critical infrastructure in Guam and the West Coast of the U.S., likely indicating the CCP's focus on Taiwan and ensuring the U.S. cannot efficiently respond to potential conflict scenarios.

## **Where Technology Meets the Human Factor**

Whitmore emphasizes that cybersecurity challenges extend far beyond technical solutions. The human element creates both vulnerabilities and opportunities that organizations must address comprehensively.

##### Critical Human Vulnerabilities

* **Password reuse across environments**: "What you have is administrators who have a tough job to do. They're pulled in a million different directions, and so what happens? They sometimes reuse passwords both within the corporate IT environment, as well as the industrial control systems environments."
* **Operational priorities conflict**: Legacy systems "were not designed with security in mind. They were designed with uptime and availability as their primary goal."
* **Cultural resistance to change**: Organizations need "a cultural mindset shift" to effectively integrate security into operational technology environments.

##### The Human Solution Framework

* **Comprehensive stakeholder involvement**: Effective preparation "cannot be just security professionals who are involved in that. It really needs to be from the boardroom to the security operations center."
* **Extended ecosystem engagement**: Include "Partners, vendors, external counsel, law enforcement, and even better yet, bring the regulators into the dialogue."
* **Relationship building before crisis**: "The most prepared organizations we see are having that level of dialogue, preparedness and making sure that those relationships are in place in advance of an attack."

## **The Indiscriminate Data Grab Strategy**

Today's attackers have abandoned selective targeting for wholesale collection. The Unit 42 report reveals that 93% of cases investigated revealed indiscriminate data theft in 2023, up from 81% in 2022 and 67% in 2021. This shift reflects both automated tool availability and attackers' recognition that bulk data often reveals valuable targets when analyzed later.

Whitmore describes the threat actors’ scale:

> Their ability to operate and collect information and data at scale – whether it's from critical infrastructure entities, whether it's for corporate espionage purposes, whether it's simply data collections to be used for a later time.

## **Breaking Down Barriers Through Human Connection**

Despite escalating threats, Whitmore identifies effective intelligence sharing as a significant improvement driven by human relationships and crisis catalysts. "I do think intel sharing is happening more effectively than ever before," she explains. "People are in Slack channels together. They're on the phone together on a daily basis, sharing information in real time."

The transformation stems from a shared purpose of overcoming competitive barriers. "The Russia-Ukraine invasion really was a catalyst for a lot of that," Whitmore notes. "When it actually came time to say, ‘Wow, okay. There are people's lives we need to protect here.’ I think a lot of those barriers broke down between competitors in particular."

For intelligence sharing to succeed, Whitmore emphasizes it "needs to be contextualized and actionable, and it can't be slow and gated and working through bureaucratic means."

## **Preparing for AI-Accelerated Threats**

[Generative AI](/cyberpedia/what-is-generative-ai-security) played a pivotal role in enabling many malicious attacks during 2024, from creating convincing fake job candidates to disrupting elections. Whitmore advocates for defensive AI adoption but clarifies the human role: "Organizations should be fighting AI with AI, but that term can be misinterpreted or it can be kind of ambiguous."

Her vision balances automation with human expertise:

> Organizations need to be looking at, on the defensive side, how they implement AI into their workflows to give them increased visibility and increased speed to detect threats. There is no way that we are going to defeat these adversaries if we are working at manual speed and not taking as many of the manual tasks away from humans – letting machines do those and letting humans do what we do best, which is work on solving the most challenging problems.
