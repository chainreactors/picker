As Cybersecurity Awareness Month wraps up, we’re focusing on one of today's most pervasive digital threats: mobile scams. In the last 12 months, fraudsters have used advanced AI tools to create more convincing schemes, resulting in over $400 billion in stolen funds globally.**[¹](#fn1)**

For years, Android has been on the frontlines in the battle against scammers, using the best of Google AI to build proactive, multi-layered protections that can anticipate and block scams before they reach you. Android’s scam defenses protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month**[2](#fn2)**. In addition, Google continuously performs safety checks to maintain the integrity of the RCS service. In the past month alone, this ongoing process blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers from using RCS, stopping potential scams before they could even be sent.

To show how our scam protections work in the real world, we asked users and independent security experts to compare how well Android and iOS protect you from these threats. We're also releasing a new [report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/android_2025_text_based_scams_report.pdf) that explains how modern text scams are orchestrated, helping you understand the tactics fraudsters use and how to spot them.

**Survey shows Android users’ confidence in scam protections**

Google and YouGov**[3](#fn3)** surveyed 5,000 smartphone users across the U.S., India, and Brazil about their experiences. The findings were clear: Android users reported receiving fewer scam texts and felt more confident that their device was keeping them safe.

* Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to say they had not received any scam texts in the week prior to the survey. The advantage was even stronger on Pixel, where users were 96% more likely than iPhone owners to report zero scam texts.
* At the other end of the spectrum, iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report receiving three or more scam texts in a week. The difference became even more pronounced when comparing iPhone to Pixel, with iPhone users 136% more likely to say they had received a heavy volume of scam messages.
* Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device’s scam protections as “very effective” or “extremely effective.” When comparing Pixel to iPhone, iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their device was not effective at all in stopping mobile fraud.

**Security researchers and analysts highlight Android’s AI-driven safeguards against sophisticated scams**

In a recent [evaluation](https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/assessing-the-state-of-ai-powered-mobile-security-blog) by Counterpoint Research**[4](#fn4)**, a global technology market research firm, Android smartphones were found to have the most AI-powered protections. The independent study compared the latest Pixel, Samsung, Motorola, and iPhone devices, and found that Android provides comprehensive AI-driven safeguards across ten key protection areas, including email protections, browsing protections, and on-device behavioral protections. By contrast, iOS offered AI-powered protections in only two categories. You can see the full comparison in the visual below.

*Counterpoint Research comparison of Android and iOS AI-powered protections*

Cybersecurity firm Leviathan Security Group conducted a funded [evaluation](https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/october-2025-mobile-platform-security-amp-fraud-prevention-assessment)**[5](#fn5)** of scam and fraud protection on the iPhone 17, Moto Razr+ 2025, Pixel 10 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Their analysis found that Android smartphones, led by the Pixel 10 Pro, provide the highest level of default scam and fraud protection.The report particularly noted Android's robust call screening, scam detection, and real-time scam warning authentication capabilities as key differentiators. Taken together, these independent expert assessments conclude that Android’s AI-driven safeguards provide more comprehensive and intelligent protection against mobile scams.

**Why Android users see fewer scams**

Android’s proactive protections work across the platform to help you stay ahead of threats with the best of Google AI.

Here’s how they work:

* **Keeping your messages safe:** [Google Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) automatically filters known spam by analyzing sender reputation and message content, moving suspicious texts directly to your "spam & blocked" folder to keep them out of sight.
