Back in 2019, I penned an earlier version of this guide to Bug Bounty Hunting ([Mirror 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20230813220535/https%3A//whoami.securitybreached.org/2019/06/03/guide-getting-started-in-bug-bounty-hunting/)) & ([Mirror 2](https://archive.vn/BN7p8)), aiming to provide aspiring hunters with a solid foundation. The response was overwhelmingly positive accompanied by a large amount of questions from newcomers. While the previous version of this guide served its purpose well, the ever-evolving landscape of the Bug Bounty Market has ushered in changes and innovations that necessitate a fresh perspective. In light of these transformations and the continued enthusiasm of the bug bounty community, I have decided to craft an update for this guide. Drawing on both the wisdom gained from the past and the insights garnered from the present, this new version aspires to be an even more valuable resource for those venturing into the world of bug bounty hunting.
