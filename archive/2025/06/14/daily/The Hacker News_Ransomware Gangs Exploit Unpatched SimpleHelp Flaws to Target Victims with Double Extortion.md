[![Ransomware Gangs Exploit Unpatched SimpleHelp Flaws](data:image/png;base64... "Ransomware Gangs Exploit Unpatched SimpleHelp Flaws")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZ26no1sWZJGIZ72kPi6-DHdO8GB8uJJ0ZfwTyFHwLrtqvdZLwH6XXs75KWSDg2F20z6TroWVOj9RfkEavWS5q0T09bccZR12TrmD6qzoELMrQwQFMBJAZNtIbmJJSQ3EbhwfwBtpcjKOPpZH0JDzP5AWYMX2668bYsuh4WAszPeSu5MlqoqCgqkI5zd33/s790-rw-e365/ransomware-malware.jpg)

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday disclosed that ransomware actors are targeting unpatched SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) instances to compromise customers of an unnamed utility billing software provider.

"This incident reflects a broader pattern of ransomware actors targeting organizations through unpatched versions of SimpleHelp RMM since January 2025," the agency [said](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/06/12/cisa-releases-cybersecurity-advisory-simplehelp-rmm-vulnerability) in an advisory.

Earlier this year, SimpleHelp [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/critical-simplehelp-flaws-allow-file.html) a set of flaws (CVE-2024-57727, CVE-2024-57728, and CVE-2024-57726) that could result in information disclosure, privilege escalation, and remote code execution.

The vulnerabilities have since come under [repeated](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/hackers-exploit-simplehelp-rmm-flaws.html) [exploitation](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/dragonforce-exploits-simplehelp-flaws.html) in the wild, including by ransomware groups like DragonForce, to breach targets of interest. Last month, Sophos revealed that a Managed Service Provider's SimpleHelp deployed was accessed by the threat actor using these flaws, and then leveraged it to pivot to other downstream customers.

CISA said that SimpleHelp versions 5.5.7 and earlier contain multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-57727, and that the ransomware crews are exploiting it to access downstream customers' unpatched SimpleHelp instances for double extortion attacks.

The agency has outlined the below mitigations that organizations, including third-party service providers that make use of SimpleHelp to connect to downstream customers, can implement to better respond to the ransomware activity -

* Identify and isolate SimpleHelp server instances from the internet and update them to the latest version
* Notify downstream customers and instruct them to take actions to secure their endpoints
* Conduct threat hunting actions for indicators of compromise and monitor for unusual inbound and outbound traffic from the SimpleHelp server (for downstream customers)
* Disconnect affected systems from the internet if they have been encrypted by ransomware, reinstall the operating system, and restore data from a clean backup
* Maintain periodic clean, offline backups
* Refrain from exposing remote services such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the web

CISA said it does not encourage victims to pay ransoms as there is no guarantee that the decryptor provided by the threat actors will help recover the files.

"Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities," CISA added.

### Fog Ransomware Attack Deploys Employee Monitoring Software

The development comes as Broadcom-owned Symantec detailed a [Fog](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/critical-veeam-vulnerability-exploited.html) ransomware attack targeting an unnamed financial institution in Asia with a combination of dual-use and open-source pentesting tools not observed in other ransomware-related intrusions.

Fog is a ransomware variant [first detected](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/lost-in-the-fog-a-new-ransomware-threat/) in May 2024. Like other ransomware operations, the financially motivated crew [employs](https://www.halcyon.ai/raas-mq/power-rankings-ransomware-malicious-quartile-q1-2025) compromised virtual private network (VPN) credentials and system vulnerabilities to gain access to an organization's network and encrypt data, but not before exfiltrating it.

Alternate infection sequences have employed Windows shortcut (LNK) files contained within ZIP archives, which are then distributed via email and phishing attacks. Executing the LNK file leads to the download of a PowerShell script that's responsible for dropping a ransomware loader containing the Fog locker payload.

The attacks are also characterized by the use of advanced techniques to escalate privileges and evade detection by deploying malicious code directly in memory and disabling security tools. Fog is capable of targeting both Windows and Linux endpoints.

According to Trend Micro, as of April 2025, the Fog threat actors have claimed [100 victims](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/d/fog-ransomware-concealed-within-binary-loaders-linking-themselve.html) on its data leak site since the start of the year, with a majority of the victims associated with technology, education, manufacturing, and transportation sectors.

"The attackers used a legitimate employee monitoring software called [Syteca](https://www.syteca.com/en) (formerly Ekran), which is highly unusual," Symantec [said](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/fog-ransomware-attack). "They also deployed several open-source pen-testing tools – GC2, [Adaptix](https://github.com/Adaptix-Framework/AdaptixC2), and Stowaway – which are not commonly used during ransomware attacks."

While the exact initial access vector used in the incident is unknown, the threat actors have been found to use Stowaway, a proxy tool [widely used](https...
