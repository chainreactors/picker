Behind every security alert is a bigger story. Sometimes it's a system being tested. Sometimes it's trust being lost in quiet ways‚Äîthrough delays, odd behavior, or subtle gaps in control.

This week, we're looking beyond the surface to spot what really matters. Whether it's poor design, hidden access, or silent misuse, knowing where to look can make all the difference.

If you're responsible for protecting systems, data, or people‚Äîthese updates aren't optional. They're essential. These stories reveal how attackers think‚Äîand where we're still leaving doors open.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Google Releases Patches for Actively Exploited Chrome 0-Day](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-chrome-zero-day-actively-exploited.html)** ‚Äî Google has released Google Chrome versions 137.0.7151.68/.69 for Windows and macOS, and version 137.0.7151.68 for Linux to address a high-severity out-of-bounds read and write vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that it said has been exploited in the wild. Google credited Clement Lecigne and Beno√Æt Sevens of Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) with discovering and reporting the flaw on May 27, 2025. "Out-of-bounds read and write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 137.0.7151.68 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page," according to a description of the flaw. It's currently not known how the flaw is being exploited in the wild, although it's likely to be highly targeted in nature.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[PathWiper Used in Attack on Ukraine](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-pathwiper-data-wiper-malware.html)** ‚Äî An unnamed critical infrastructure entity within Ukraine was targeted by a previously unseen data wiper malware named PathWiper, which shares similarities with another wiper codenamed HermeticWiper that was used by the Russia-linked Sandworm hacking group at the outset of the Russo-Ukrainian war in early 2022. "The attack was instrumented via a legitimate endpoint administration framework, indicating that the attackers likely had access to the administrative console, which was then used to issue malicious commands and deploy PathWiper across connected endpoints," Cisco Talos said.
* **[BladedFeline Targets Iraq with Whisper and Spearal Malware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/iran-linked-bladedfeline-hits-iraqi-and.html)** ‚Äî An Iran-aligned hacking group dubbed BladedFeline has been attributed to a new set of cyber attacks targeting Kurdish and Iraqi government officials in early 2024. BladedFeline, believed to be active since at least September 2017, is suspected to be a sub-cluster within [OilRig](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/trustwave-blog/inside-apt34-oilrig-tools-techniques-and-global-cyber-threats/), a well-known state-sponsored threat actor that's assessed to be affiliated with Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security ([MOIS](https://www.trellix.com/en-in/blogs/research/the-iranian-cyber-capability/)) and operational for over a decade. The attacks leverage an as-yet-undetermined initial access vector to deliver backdoors like Whisper (aka Veaty), Spearal, and Optimizer.
* **[Vishing Group UNC6040 Targets Salesforce with Fake Data Loader App](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/google-exposes-vishing-group-unc6040.html)** ‚Äî A previously undocumented threat actor known as UNC6040 has leveraged voice phishing techniques reminiscent of Scattered Spider to breach targets of interest by posing as IT support personnel and trick employees into installing a modified version of Salesforce's Data Loader app in order to obtain unauthorized access to their Salesforce data and exfiltrate it. The attacks are said to overlap with a loose-knit cybercrime collective known as The Com, of which the Scattered Spider threat actor is a part. Salesforce said the observed incidents primarily relied on manipulating end users, and that it did not involve the exploitation of any security vulnerability in its systems.
* **[Chrome to Distrust Certs Issued by Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/google-chrome-to-distrust-two.html)** ‚Äî Google's Chrome security team has announced plans to distrust digital certificates issued by Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock citing "patterns of concerning behavior observed over the past year." The changes are expected to be introduced in Chrome 139, which is scheduled for public release in early August 2025. "Over the past several months and years, we have observed a pattern of compliance failures, unmet improvement commitments, and the absence of tangible, measurable progress in response to publicly disclosed incident reports," Google said. "When these factors are considered in the aggregate and considered against the inherent risk each publicly-trusted CA poses to the internet, continued public trust is no longer justified." It's worth noting that Apple has already moved to distrust root CA certi...
