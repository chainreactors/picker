Today’s modern software applications simply would not exist, or be as powerful, without the use of open source software (OSS). Developers design open source software with source code that is accessible for anyone to use, modify, and learn from, and they release the code with specific licensing rights.

OSS easily integrates with other code, enabling developers using it for their own applications to focus on their core strengths and on building innovative and creative solutions for their enterprise and its customers. But developers are often not aware of all the open source components and dependencies it adds to their own software. OSS is a key part of the software supply chain—96% of the codebases analyzed contained open source software, according to the 2023 Synopsys “[Open Source Security and Risk Analysis” (OSSRA) report](/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html). With the incredible value it brings to enterprises, OSS also brings risks that can be costly if not properly managed. “With some effort, it’s entirely possible to manage these risks and realize the full benefit of OSS,” said Anthony Decicco, principal at GTC Law Group and founder of the firm’s open source software practice.

## Reward versus risk

Modern applications are made up of a mix of proprietary and open source code, APIs, user interfaces, databases, operating systems, and various configurations. And the software supply chain is made up of every bit of code that touches an application or plays a role in its assembly, development, or deployment. Weakness in the code anywhere along the chain can create risk for the applications and the enterprises that use them. And since the OSSRA research shows that 84% of the codebases have at least one vulnerability, ensuring secure code is critical.

The benefits of using OSS include
