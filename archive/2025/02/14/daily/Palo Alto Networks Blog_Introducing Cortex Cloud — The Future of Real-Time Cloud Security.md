*Cortex® Cloud merges the next version of Prisma® Cloud with best-in-class CDR for real-time cloud security.*

Nearly every organization runs in the cloud, driven by promised outcomes, like [65%](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/assets/power-of-cloud-for-bus-model-innovation.pdf) faster product and service delivery. AI has only accelerated cloud investment, with [63%](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cloud/cloud-ai-business-survey.html) of top-performing companies citing AI for their decision.

But the cloud comes with risks. Up to [80%](/resources/research/2023-unit-42-attack-surface-threat-report) of security exposures occur in the cloud, compounded by a recent [66%](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-incident-response-report-2024-threat-guide/) surge in attacks and the reality that cloud-native risks shift regularly.

Security teams struggle to keep up, facing off against adversaries who appear to thrive[​​](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-threat-report-expanding-attack-surface/). One alert, on average, takes [145 hours](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-threat-report-expanding-attack-surface/) to resolve. Meanwhile, attackers exploit new vulnerabilities [within 15 minutes](/resources/research/2023-unit-42-attack-surface-threat-report) of disclosure and exfiltrate data [in half the time](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-threat-report-expanding-attack-surface/) they did last year​​.

## Peace-Time Cloud Security Isn't Enough

Traditional security approaches leave organizations exposed. Posture management has been the foundation of cloud security, helping teams identify misconfigurations and enforce compliance. Security risks, however, don’t stop at misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Organizations need more than “peace time” security. They need real-time prevention.

## A New Approach

Palo Alto Networks, the pioneer of Code to Cloud™ security, has spent years shaping how organizations protect cloud environments. Prisma Cloud [redefined cloud security posture](/blog/2023/10/announcing-innovations-cnapp-prisma-cloud/). Cortex transformed AI-driven SecOps. Still, cloud and enterprise security teams remained disconnected, operating in silos with limited visibility, context and response capabilities.

Attackers exploit these gaps – moving between misconfigurations, runtime vulnerabilities and exposed identities faster than teams can respond. The challenges call for change. Palo Alto Networks set out to address them.

### Introducing Cortex Cloud

[Cortex Cloud](/cortex/cloud) is the next version of Prisma Cloud merged with best-in-class Cortex CDR to deliver real-time cloud security. Built on Cortex, organizations can seamlessly adopt natively integrated capabilities as part of the world’s most complete enterprise-to-cloud SecOps platform.

Security teams gain a context-driven defense that delivers real-time cloud security – continuous protection from code to cloud to SOC. Our new Cloud Runtime Security offering includes the world’s leading CNAPP capabilities at no additional cost, maximizing adoption of end-to-end cloud security on a single platform.

![AI automation – unified data from code to cloud to SOC.](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-12-at-8.53.55 AM-1-230x100.png)

Cortex Cloud delivers real-time cloud security powered by unified data, [Precision AI®](/precision-ai-security) and automation.

For Prisma Cloud customers, this translates into more power. Your investments are secure, and existing Prisma Cloud customers will experience a seamless upgrade to Cortex Cloud with all the core capabilities you’ve come to expect, enhanced with significant new innovations – including AI-powered prioritization, automated remediation and a new simplified, powerful user experience.

Additionally, once upgraded, Prisma Cloud customers can add Cortex’s industry-leading CDR capabilities as part of the new Cloud Runtime Security offering. Now available on the single Cortex platform, Cortex XSIAM users can seamlessly adopt industry-leading CNAPP, making it the preferred SOC platform for enterprise and cloud.

## A Formula for Results

Breaches happen when security teams can’t connect the dots fast enough. Imagine a world, though, where runtime context informs cloud posture decisions during peace time, ensuring vulnerabilities and other risks are prioritized before they become active threats. Automation then closes the loop on critical issues, resolving risks before attackers exploit them.

At the same time, envision SOC teams with the full picture – seeing not just an attack in progress but the cloud exposures that made it possible. With runtime insights mapped to cloud risk, investigations become faster, more precise and tied to real-world attack paths.

Cortex Cloud changes the equation, setting new benchmarks for simplicity and effectiveness. From smart prioritization that manages millions of security findings to automation that streamlines remediation, organizations can take back control.

### Unified Data for Complete Security Intelligence

Security teams aren’t short on data – quite the opposite. Threat indicators get lost in the vast array of cloud telemetry. Cortex Cloud unifies first- and third-party findings into a unified dataplane, eliminating the need to manually connect dispersed insights. Every signal and event is stitched together, giving teams full, real-time context for every decision.

End-to-end visibility allows organizations to reduce investigation times, prioritize what matters and automate responses, whether strengthening security during peace time, such as application development, or responding to real-time incidents under active attack.

### AI and Automation — Smarter Detection, Faster Response

With over 7,000 detectors and 2,400+ machine learning models, Cortex Cloud identifies high-risk threats with precision using Cortex XDR’s best-in-class CDR agent, which achieved industry-leading results in the most recent MITRE ATT&CK testing. AI-powered recommendations guide teams toward the fastest resolution, while automation accelerates containment, blocking malicious activity and isolating compromised resources.

Security teams no longer need to navigate disconnected tools and siloed workflows. Out-of-the-box and customizable playbooks orchestrate response workflows, automating fixes where possible and streamlining analyst actions when human oversight is required. As Cortex Cloud continually learns from incidents, automation becomes faster, smarter and more effe...
