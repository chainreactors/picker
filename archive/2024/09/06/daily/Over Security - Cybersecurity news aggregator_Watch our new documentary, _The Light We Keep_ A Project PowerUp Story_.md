[Ukraine](/category/ukraine/)

You may have already read about the incredible story of [Project PowerUp](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/project-powerup-ukraine-grid/) – how we worked with a multi-company, multi-national team to find a way to keep the lights on in Ukraine in the face of electronic warfare.

Today, we are releasing a short documentary on how this story came to be, while exploring the impact on the daily lives of millions of Ukrainians. The documentary delves into the history of targeted attacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, from the Black Energy attack in 2015 and the Industroyer campaign the following year. We then study a unique challenge involving GPS jamming, which came up within a chance conversation over dinner with some of our Ukrainian partners.

We hope this story shines a light on some of the issues faced within an electronic warfare zone, and how sometimes thinking outside of the box isn’t enough. Sometimes, you need to first create the box.

Join our [live Q & A](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cisco-talos-intelligence-group_mark-your-calendar-and-join-us-on-september-activity-7233986016137605120-jpgu) with some of the people featured in the documentary or watch it back on demand.
