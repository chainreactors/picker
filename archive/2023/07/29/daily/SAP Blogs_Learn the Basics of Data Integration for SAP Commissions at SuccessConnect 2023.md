The flagship of SAP Sales Performance Management is SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management, formerly known as SAP Commissions, which enables compensation teams to create scalable, dynamic compensation plans for any size organization. However, a major challenge faced by any organization is the creation of seamless data integration scenarios, which allow the tool to use data from source systems such as sales management and human resource management software.

What better time to expand your knowledge of SAP data integration than our pre-conference training?

This year at SuccessConnect, we will be conducting a 4-hour pre-conference training session on Express Data Loader (XDL), formerly known as Commissions Data Loader (CDL), led by a seasoned SAP Incentive Management instructor. This scalable data integration tool is built into the solution and is the preferred way to import and extract data between Incentive Management and other systems. Through discussion, demonstration, and hands-on practice, you'll learn how to use XDL to perform inbound and outbound data transfers with no coding using a graphical user interface. You'll get an overview of various data integration options, then dive into the details of using XDL, covering system architecture, import templates, file naming requirements, and global and file-specific settings. The target audience is implementors of the Incentive Management solution, data integration analysts, and business users.
