## PROTOCOL Goes Live!

This week was a big one, my first episode of PROTOCOL, “[What Is a Protocol?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrV0SeP66Qc)” went live. I’ve been working on this idea for a video series off and on for over a year, and now I’ve finally decided to try to work on it more “on’ than “off”. I have several episodes finished and it should go live weekly on Wednesdays at 10am Pacific.

I found that the best way to make this project fit into my schedule is to batch videos together in my process. So I write several videos, then record them all in one day, and then edit them and get them ready for publication. Any given week has too much variance in it to be able to definitely do a new episode every week, this way I have some more flexibility. And since the content isn’t time-sensitive, I don’t have to worry about publishing a video about a news event weeks after it’s relevance has passed.

I’m definitely learning that editing can take up a lot of time to do it well, but even just in the editing of my first few episodes, I feel like I got better. Now I just need to figure out how to get certain patterns saved into premiere to make it easier to reuse them across episodes.

Next week’s episode is about the Internet Engineering Task Force, and the following week is about the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

Unfortunately, the amount of time I spent editing this week also means I didn’t get much else done on other projects.

## Interesting Links

* [Watchtowr S3 Bucket Research](https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/) - When registering abandoned s3 bucket names could have huge implications across thousands of organizations. Abandoned corners of the internet remain a risk.
* [Obsidian: The Good Parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0yAy2j-9V0) - A new No Boilerplate video about Obsidian and what is good about it and some traps to avoid. I think it finally helped me cure my habit with needing everything to be in some “correct” folder – it turns out knowledge doesn’t fit cleanly into folders, and tags are a way more flexible system to achieve a pretty similar outcome.
* [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) - Coolify looks like a really useful platform for enabling simple self-hosting of services. I feel like it’s a middle ground between hand managing your containers and running a full blown k8s cluster, but also seems like it might be a nice entry point for people who are just getting into self hosting. I particularly am interested in trying out their GitOps flow, I would *love* to have a simple GitOps workflow for managing all my apps on a server in a more declarative way than, say, ansible, but less painful than kubernetes. But I’m probably just delaying the inevitable when I rewrite my servers in NixOS.

## Upcoming Projects

* [Defcon Call for Music/Tracks](https://defconmusic.org/def-con-33-call-for-music-tracks/) - I intend to submit as a performing artist as well as submit a soundtrack track again this year. I have a really fun idea for a track and am currently waiting on production.
* I want to publish one non-PROTOCOL video this month but am not sure which topic I want to cover. If you have any ideas, I’d love if you reached out on Bsky or Mastodon.
