## Look who's visiting the watering hole these days

Amazon today said it disrupted an intel-gathering attempt by Russia's APT29 to trick Microsoft users into unwittingly granting the Kremlin-backed cyberspies access to their accounts and data.

APT29, also known as Cozy Bear and Midnght Blizzard, is probably best known for the [2020 SolarWinds hack](https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/15/solarwinds_hack_russia_apt29_positive_technologies_sanctions), and has been widely linked to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) by the US, UK, and other governments and security researchers. And this particular bear has developed a [taste for Microsoft data](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/08/microsoft_confirms_russian_spies_stole/) and user credentials over the years.

In its most recent [watering hole campaign](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/amazon-disrupts-watering-hole-campaign-by-russias-apt29/), the attackers compromised legitimate websites and injected malicious JavaScript code that redirected about 10 percent of visitors to actor-controlled domains.
