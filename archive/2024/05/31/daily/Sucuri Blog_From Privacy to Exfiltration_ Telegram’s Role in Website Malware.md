![From Privacy to Exfiltration: Telegram's Role in Website Malware](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Blog-Post-From-Privacy-to-Exfiltration-Telegrams-Role-in-Website-Malware-820x385.png)

Telegram, a name synonymous with secure messaging, has paradoxically become a tool for cybercriminals who abuse the strengths of the platform to target unsuspecting websites. This popular messaging platform, once known for its commitment to user privacy and security, is now being used in ways its creators never intended: a conduit for controlling malware-infected websites.

In this post, we’ll explain how Telegram has become a useful tool for hackers — and what that means for website owners.

## The misuse of Telegram in website malware

Telegram’s versatility as a messaging app is undisputed: the app has numerous features that cater to *both* privacy and flexibility. However, these same qualities have attracted a less savory user base — cybercriminals.

Using [Telegram’s API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), hackers can create bots that act as “overseers” for their malicious activities. Here are a few of the ways attackers are using Telegram to launch complex attacks on a website.

### Real-time alerts and monitoring

One of the primary ways attackers use Telegram is to receive notifications about the status of their malware. Once a website is compromised, a Telegram bot can send alerts to the attacker, providing real-time updates about the infected site. This includes alerts when new data is captured, when additional malware is successfully implanted, or when an administrator interacts with the infected parts of the website.

### Data exfiltration

Telegram bots are often configured to exfiltrate stolen data directly to the attacker’s Telegram account. This can include sensitive user information, login credentials, and financial data. The speed and encryption of Telegram ensure that this stolen data is moved quickly and covertly, often bypassing traditional security measures designed to monitor and block suspicious data flows.

### Command and control communications

Traditionally, malware requires a command and control (C&C) server to receive updated commands and to manage the infected systems. Telegram provides a stealthier alternative. Through simple messages, attackers can command their deployed malware to download additional components, spread to other parts of the network, or even initiate a denial-of-service attack. This use of Telegram simplifies the infrastructure required for such operations and reduces the risk of exposing the C&C servers to law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. In the past, researchers have even seen Telegram acting as a [C&C server in ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telecrypt-ransomware-uses-telegram-as-candc-server/).

### Evasion and anonymity

Telegram’s strong encryption and privacy policies mean that tracing these activities back to their perpetrators is difficult. Attackers hide behind the veil of anonymity, complicating efforts by law enforcement and researchers to track and neutralize threats.

## Prevalence of Telegram-based website attacks

Last year, our research team found numerous malware infections leveraging Telegram in their website attacks. We cleaned over **11,000** malicious files from more than **290** infected websites related to this malware.

The following examples illustrate the impact of these attacks, highlighting both the ingenuity of hackers and the challenges faced by today’s website admins.

### Case Study 1: Monitoring and notification system

We occasionally find attackers using Telegram bots to receive real-time notifications about their malware’s status on compromised websites, including alerts on new data capture, additional malware implants, and administrator interactions.

In this example, the malware uses Telegram to notify an attacker that the website has been compromised so they can upload further malware or use the website for other nefarious purposes.
