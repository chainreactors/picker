In 2022, Black Duck commissioned the SANS Institute to examine how organizations achieved improvements in their security posture and operational effectiveness by aligning development, security, and operations teams around the cultural ideals, practices, and tools that make up the secure DevOps, or DevSecOps, methodology.

Respondents to the survey were drawn from a geographically diverse group from organizations of all sizes, including many in security roles. The subsequent report showcases the progress made by the community, and ongoing challenges on the path to DevSecOps excellence.

In this series of blog posts, we’re going to examine what the “SANS 2022: DevSecOps Survey: Creating a Culture to Significantly Improve Your Organization’s Security Posture” report can tell us about how instituting good [DevSecOps practices](/blog/devsecops-best-practices.html) can help your organization achieve secure coding without sacrificing development velocity, automate security, and help those involved with triage and remediation work more efficiently.

## DevSecOps survey findings

Let’s begin by examining what we can learn from the SANS report. The good news is that the survey found that shifting left is being instituted across the DevSecOps community. Security testing increased at the architecture and design stage, the requirements and use case stage, the code commit and pull request stage, and the QA and acceptance stage. The bad news for secure coding is that the only stage where security testing fell was at the interactive development environment (IDE) security plug-ins stage. While 44% of respondents surveyed in 2021 were using IDE security plug-ins, by 2022 that number had fallen to 30%. Reducing risk awareness and testing in the IDE increases the likelihood that issues will go undetected and persist downstream into the...
