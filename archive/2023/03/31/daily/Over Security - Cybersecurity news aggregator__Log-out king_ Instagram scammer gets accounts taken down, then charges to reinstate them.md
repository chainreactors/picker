# “Log-out king” Instagram scammer gets accounts taken down, then charges to reinstate them

Posted: March 28, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

A fraudster going by “OBN Brandon” has been defrauding Instagram influencers and entertainment figures out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by taking down their accounts and then asking for money to get them back up again, ProPublica [reports](https://www.propublica.org/article/instagram-fraudster-ban-influencer-accounts). OBN has been successful in his [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) taking advantage of Instagram’s less-than-good customer support, and an easily manipulated account reporting system. The nonprofit believes it may have identified the fraudster as someone in Las Vegas.

## Account takedowns for hire

In 2021, Motherboard [reported](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k78kmv/instagram-ban-restore-service-scam) on a booming industry in the digital underground dedicated to banning Instagram accounts at will. Interestingly, some scammers behind ban-as-a-service (BaaS) offerings would also provide account restoration for users who think they have been unfairly suspended.

BaaS offerings are often used by those with “money to throw around,” an ex, a business rival, someone nursing a grudge, or a mix of these. But what opened opportunities for scamming is a system’s tendency for abuse. Meta has developed Instagram’s reporting system to shield users from harmful content on the platform, such as those depicting suicide and self-harm, by taking them down as quickly as possible after receiving a report.

For a fee, scammers use the same system designed to protect as a tool to harass and censor Instagram users purposefully.

“We have been professionally banning since 2020 and have top-tier experience,” reads one advertisement from a scammer group. “We may not have the cheapest prices, but trust me you are getting what you are paying for.”

These groups use several methods to get accounts taken down. One is to fully duplicate a target account and then report the original account for impersonation. Some create scripts or bots to report accounts en masse. Scammers can also use these to file reports against a single Instagram account automatically.

Because reporting is anonymous, fraudsters can earn double by offering their victims a way to restore their accounts. A restoration service would cost $3,500 to $4,000, with a nonrefundable downpayment of $1,500. Victims will never know that the party responsible for their ban is also stepping up to get their accounts back up and running again.

Two years after this story, it appears BaaS has grown more wretched and lucrative.

## “Log-out king”

There is no mention of OBN using scripts or bots, but ProPublica says that he “touts software he uses to file false reports that allege an account violated Meta’s community guidelines, triggering a takedown.” Impersonation is part of his repertoire, too. Sometimes, OBN orchestrates a setup by [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) an account himself to post [content deemed inappropriate](https://help.instagram.com/165828726894770) in Instagram’s terms of service (ToS) and then reports the account.

Like the Instascammers featured in Motherboard’s story, OBN also offers to reactivate accounts in tandem with his takedown service. He charges a fee as high as $5,000 (depending on follower count) to get an account back. But days late...
