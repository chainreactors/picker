## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Double Trouble: Evil Corp & LockBit Fall](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/lockbit-ransomware-and-evil-corp.html):** A consortium of international law enforcement agencies took steps to arrest four people and take down nine servers linked to the LockBit (aka Bitwise Spider) ransomware operation. In tandem, authorities outed a Russian national named Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, who was one of the high-ranking members of the Evil Corp cybercrime group and also a LockBit affiliate. A total of 16 individuals who were part of Evil Corp have been sanctioned by the U.K.

### **üîî Top News**

* **DoJ & Microsoft Seize 100+ Russian Hacker Domains:** The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and Microsoft [announced](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/us-and-microsoft-seize-107-russian.html) the seizure of 107 internet domains used by a Russian state-sponsored threat actor called COLDRIVER to orchestrate credential harvesting campaigns targeting NGOs and think tanks that support government employees and military and intelligence officials.
* **Record-Breaking 3.8 Tbps DDoS Attack:** Cloudflare [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/cloudflare-thwarts-largest-ever-38-tbps.html) that it thwarted a record-breaking distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 3.8 terabits per second (Tbps) and lasted 65 seconds. The attack is part of a broader wave of over a hundred hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks that have been ongoing since early September 2024 targeting financial services, Internet, and telecommunication industries. The activity has not been attributed to any specific threat actor.
* **North Korean Hackers Deploy New VeilShell Trojan:** A North Korea-linked threat actor called APT37 has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/north-korean-hackers-using-new.html) as behind a stealthy campaign targeting Cambodia and likely other Southeast Asian countries that deliver a previously undocumented backdoor and remote access trojan (RAT) called VeilShell. The malware is suspected to be distributed via spear-phishing emails.
* **Fake Trading Apps on Apple and Google Stores:** A large-scale fraud campaign [leveraged](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/fake-trading-apps-target-victims.html) fake trading apps published on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as phishing sites, to defraud victims as part of what's called a pig butchering scam. The apps are no longer available for download. The campaign has been found to target users across Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. In a related development, Gizmodo [reported](https://gizmodo.com/truth-social-users-are-losing-ridiculous-sums-of-money-to-scams-2000506604) that Truth Social users have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to pig butchering scams.
* **700,000+ DrayTek Routers Vulnerable to Remote Attacks:** As many as 14 security flaws, dubbed [DRAY:BREAK](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/alert-over-700000-draytek-routers.html), have been uncovered in residential and enterprise routers manufactured by DrayTek that could be exploited to take over susceptible devices. The vulnerabilities have been patched following responsible disclosure.

### **üì∞ Around the Cyber World**

* **Salt Typhoon Breached AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Networks:** A Chinese nation-state actor known as [Salt Typhoon](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/chinese-hackers-infiltrate-us-internet.html) penetrated the networks of U.S. broadband providers, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, and likely accessed "information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests," The Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b?st=4QbXPX&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). "The hackers appear to have engaged in a vast collection of internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small, and millions of Americans, as their customers."
* **U.K. and U.S. Warn of Iranian Spear-Phishing Activity:** Cyber actors working on behalf of the Iranian Government's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have [targeted](https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/the-iranian-cyber-capability/) individuals with a nexus to Iranian and Middle Eastern affairs to gain unauthorized access to their personal and business accounts using social engineering techniques, either via email or messaging platforms. "The actors often attempt to build rapport before soliciting victims to access a document via a hyperlink, which redirects victims to a false email account login page for the purpose of capturing credentials," the agencies [said](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2024/240927.pdf) in an advisory. "Victims may be prompted to input two-factor authentication codes, provide them via a messaging application, or interact with phone n...
