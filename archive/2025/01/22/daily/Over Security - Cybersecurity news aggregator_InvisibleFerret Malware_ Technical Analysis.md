InvisibleFerret Malware: Technical Analysis

***Editor’s note**: The current article is authored by Mauro Eldritch, offensive security expert and threat intelligence analyst. You can [find Mauro on X](https://x.com/MauroEldritch).*

Recently, during October and November, we observed a rise in North Korean activity employing a well-known and distinctive technique: [staging job interview processes to spread multiple malware families.](https://threatchronicles.com/2024/11/dev-popper-contagious-interview-campaign-follow-up-november-2024/)

This signature technique was previously used to distribute [QRLog](https://github.com/birminghamcyberarms/QRLog) and [Docks /RustDoor](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/65c0ef492547f1c6b60729e6/), and is now delivering [BeaverTail](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.beavertail) and [InvisibleFerret](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/py.invisibleferret). In this first article, we will conduct a technical dissection of the latter.

## **The Beaver**

These malicious components do not simply appear randomly among the files of questionable pirated software, lying in wait for their victim. Instead, they are part of an *organized* effort targeting the technological, financial, and cryptocurrency sectors, with developers as the primary focus. By staging fake job interviews, threat actors aim to [spread malware](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/672b4dd2c7b9f03eb412d8ff) disguised either as coding challenges (or their dependencies) or video call software, in a campaign now known as **Contagious Interview** or **DevPopper**.

One of the implants distributed is **BeaverTail**, a stealer and loader written in obfuscated **JavaScript** and delivered [as an NPM module](https://socket.dev/npm/package/blockscan-api/overview/1.3.1). While not the focus of this article, BeaverTail downloads a customized portable **Python** environment (“[p.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6a104f07ab6c5711b6bc8bf6ff956ab8cd597a388002a966e980c5ec9678b5b0/detection)”) and later deploys **InvisibleFerret** as its next stage, which is the main subject of this research.

## **The Ferrets**

**InvisibleFerret** is a **Python**-based malware that, at first glance, shows a disorganized structure and unnecessary escaping sequences, giving a glimpse of what lies ahead if we dare to explore the code further. A quick look reveals a compact initialization of hardcoded constants used to [install dependencies via pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), which are later reused multiple times throughout its execution.

As expected from malware of its kind, **InvisibleFerret** does not generate an output trail or a logfile of its actions. Its silent nature, combined with a somewhat difficult-to-read codebase, led me to add verbosity to its functions and expand some of its compressed syntax and overly compact one-liners for better readability, creating [PrettyVisibleFerret](https://github.com/MauroEldritch/prettyvisibleferret). This version is more talkative and easier to read for everyone, but still executes malicious instructions and should be handled with care.
