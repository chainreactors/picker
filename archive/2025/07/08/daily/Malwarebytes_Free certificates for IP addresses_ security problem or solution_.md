# Free certificates for IP addresses: security problem or solution?

Posted: July 7, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Let’s Encrypt has [announced](https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate/) its issued its first certificate for an [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address). Why that’s significant deserves a little explanation.

You may have run into Let’s Encrypt certificates many times without realizing it. When you see a padlock icon in your browser’s address bar, it means the site is using a certificate to secure your connection. These certificates are “digital passports” that websites use to prove their identity and to encrypt the data sent between your browser and the website.

Traditionally, these certificates have only been issued for domain names (like malwarebytes.com). Now, Let’s Encrypt has started issuing certificates for IP addresses, which are the numerical labels (like 192.0.66.233) that computers use to find each other on the internet.

Let’s Encrypt is a very popular provider of certificates, and you can find its certificates on hundreds of millions of websites. That’s because:

* Let’s Encrypt certificates are free.
* Hosting companies and content delivery networks often provide Let’s Encrypt by default as a service to their customers.
* Let’s Encrypt is a mission-driven nonprofit aiming to make the web safer and more private for everyone.

The advantages of providing certificates for IP addresses are clear. Since some browsers will refuse to open sites without a certificate, it provides a safer way to access your website if you don’t have a domain name at all. It also allows you to use your browser to remotely access home devices like network-attached storage (NAS) servers and Internet-of-things ([IoT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/iot)) devices.

But most home users are unlikely to access a site by using the IP address. Domain names are much easier to remember (most of them anyway) and Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names to IP addresses for us without a lot of problems.

And while IP addresses can change, DNS will make sure that our browser can still find the domain we want to visit. This is one reason why Let’s Encrypt will only issue short-term certificates for IP addresses: The certificates will be valid for just six days, a move designed to minimize the risk window in the event of a key compromise and to encourage automated certificate renewal practices.

Domain certificates can be compromised and abused. For example, in 2011, [DigiNotar, a Dutch certificate authority, was breached](https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/how-the-2011-hack-of-diginotar-changed-the-internets-infrastructure.html), resulting in the issue of at least 500 fraudulent certificates for high-profile domains such as Gmail, Facebook, and the CIA.

And while you may have never heard of this breach, it spurred some much-needed improvements in the security of our online trust infrastructure.

## Here’s the problem

If I post a URL online or send it by email, there is a visible part and a part that’s actually where you will be taken. For example `<a href="<https://malwarebytes.com/blog>">example.com</a>` will not take you to the displayed example.com, but to our blog’s landing page.

But let’s say that a cybercriminal can get a free certificate for the IP address of a server unde...
