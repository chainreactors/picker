Ever wonder what happens when attackers don't break the rules‚Äîthey just follow them better than we do? When systems work exactly as they're built to, but that "by design" behavior quietly opens the door to risk?

This week brings stories that make you stop and rethink what's truly under control. It's not always about a broken firewall or missed patch‚Äîit's about the small choices, default settings, and shortcuts that feel harmless until they're not.

The real surprise? Sometimes the threat doesn't come from outside‚Äîit's baked right into how things are set up. Dive in to see what's quietly shaping today's security challenges.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[FBI Warns of Scattered Spider's on Airlines](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/fbi-warns-of-scattered-spiders.html)** ‚Äî The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of a new set of attacks mounted by the notorious cybercrime group Scattered Spider targeting the airline sector using sophisticated social engineering techniques to obtain initial access. Cybersecurity vendors Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 and Google Mandiant have also issued similar alerts, urging organizations to be on alert and apply necessary mitigations, including strong authentication, segregation of identities, and enforcing rigorous identity controls for password resets and multi-factor authentication (MFA) registration, to harden their environments to protect against tactics utilized by the threat actor.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[LapDogs ORB Network Compromised Over 1,000 SOHO Devices](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/over-1000-soho-devices-hacked-in-china.html)** ‚Äî A China-linked APT has built an operational relay box (ORB) network called LapDogs comprising over 1,000 backdoored routers for espionage purposes. The digital break-ins began no later than September 2023 and have expanded ever since. The campaign mostly targets end-of-life routers, IoT devices, internet-connected security cameras, virtual servers, and other small office/home office (SOHO) devices, with the goal of building an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network. Five geographic regions ‚Äî the U.S. (352 victims), Japan (256 victims), South Korea (226 victims), Taiwan (80 victims), and Hong Kong (37 victims) ‚Äî make up about 90% of the entire ORB network. The attacks leverage known security flaws in Linux-based devices to drop a backdoor called ShortLeash. The purpose of the malware itself is not known, although it has been found to share similarities with another malware sample used by UAT-5918. It's suspected that the devices are being gradually, but steadily, compromised as part of methodical and small-scale efforts across the world to gain long-term access to networks.
* **[Iranian Hacking Group Targets Israeli Cybersecurity Experts](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/iranian-apt35-hackers-targeting-israeli.html)** ‚Äî APT35, an Iranian state-sponsored hacking group associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ([IRGC](https://www.tenable.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-iranian-cyber-operations)) has been linked to a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists, high-profile cyber security experts, and computer science professors in Israel that seeks to redirect them to bogus phishing pages that are capable of harvesting their Google account credentials. The attacks, which take place via emails and WhatsApp messages, leverage fake Gmail login pages or Google Meet invitations to harvest their credentials. The development comes amid geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, which has also led to a spike in hacktivist activity in the region. "There are about 170 hacker groups attacking Israel, with about 1,345 cyber attacks on Israel, including about 447 cyber attacks launched against Israel after the conflict broke out," NSFOCUS [said](https://nsfocusglobal.com/the-hacktivist-cyber-attacks-in-the-iran-israel-conflict/) in a report published last week. "The number of hacker groups attacking Iran reached about 55, and the number of cyber attacks on Iran reached about 155, of which about 20 were launched against Iran after the conflict broke out."
* **[Citrix Patches Actively Exploited 0-Day](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/citrix-releases-emergency-patches-for.html)** ‚Äî Citrix has released security updates to address a critical flaw affecting NetScaler ADC that it said has been exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-6543 (CVSS score: 9.2), is a memory overflow bug that could result in unintended control flow and denial-of-service. It's currently not known how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild. The exploitation of CVE-2025-6543 coincides with reports that another critical security vulnerability in NetScaler ADC (CVE-2025-5777, CVSS score: 9.3) is also being weaponized in real-world attacks post public-disclosure.
