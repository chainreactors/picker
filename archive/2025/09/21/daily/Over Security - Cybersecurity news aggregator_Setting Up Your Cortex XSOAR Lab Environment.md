## Setting Up Your Cortex XSOAR Lab Environment

In this post, we’ll guide you through setting up a lab environment for experimenting with Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XSOAR. This tutorial aligns with the content from the video
[XSOAR Engineer Training - Part 2: Incident Types & Fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92rG4FPc-k&list=PLD6FJ8WNiIqUVEA2e5LZhmqNnwFcFhDTZ&index=2)
.

## Download and Install Cortex XSOAR\*

Start by
[downloading](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/sign-up-for-community-edition.html)
 the trial version of XSOAR. You’ll receive a file, approximately 1GB in size, named something like **demistoserver-6.12-857430.sh**. This file needs to be copied to a Linux system. I’m using Ubuntu Linux 22.04 for this setup.

Run the installation with the **root** user:

```
bash /tmp/demistoserver-6.12-857430.sh
```
