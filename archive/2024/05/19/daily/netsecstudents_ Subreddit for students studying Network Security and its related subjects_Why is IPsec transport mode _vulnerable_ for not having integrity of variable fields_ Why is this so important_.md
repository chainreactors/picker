# Why is IPsec transport mode "vulnerable" for not having integrity of variable fields? Why is this so important?

With IPsec transport mode we CAN'T have integrity of variable fields (eg TTL and checksum). Why is it a problem? Is it? What could be the attack?

I think TTL expire or checksum modification (so both DoS), but I mean, if an attacker can modify the TTL value or checksum, this means that he can literally also drop the packet. So... What's the point of this "vulnerability" in non-securing variable fields in IPsec transport mode?

Is there a particular scenario/vulnerability/attack that is different than DoS that can occur by modifying this varying field which can justify the need to have integrity also for these varying fields?
