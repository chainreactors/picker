Let’s kick off this infosec year with the first cyber attacks timeline for January 2023. In this fortnight I have collected 132 events, ten events more than the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/01/12/16-31-december-2022-cyber-attack-timeline/), which bring the daily average to 8.8 events per day. If we look back at [January 2021](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/01/25/1-15-january-2021-cyber-attacks-timeline/), back then we collected 93 events, meaning a 42% increase.

Events characterized by ransomware were stable around 30% (40 out of 132, it was 35% in the previous timeline) thanks primarily to the threat actor of Vice Society that leaked the data exfiltrated from eleven schools in the U.K., whilst 15 out of 132 events (corresponding to 11.36%) were characterized by the exploitation of vulnerabilities, an important increase compared to 5.9% of events (8 out of 122) of the previous fortnight.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

The fintech sector continues to be under pressure, with multiple campaigns targeting crypto companies and their users.

In the meantime, Twitter was the victim of yet another mega breach, with approximately 200 million profiles leaked and put on sale by a threat actor, and similarly an attack against an undisclosed marketing provider in Japan, caused the leak of nearly 2 million records belonging to Japanese customers of two large insurance companies.

The hacktivist front was always hot, fueled by the campaigns of pro-Russian threat actors such as NoName057(16), similarly to the cyber espionage, not so many operations, apparently, but hitting very high-profile targets: Cold River (AKA Calisto) hit three nuclear laboratories in the U.S., a new operation from the Turla Russian threat actor was unearthed, targeting organizations in Ukraine, and the list is completed by Strong Pity and Dark Pink, for which a new cluster of malicious activities were similarly discovered.

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
