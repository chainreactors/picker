The world is moving faster than ever. AI, cloud networks and more distributed workforces are driving business growth and innovation. These advancements bring tremendous opportunities, but they also introduce new security challenges, like AI-driven threats, expanding attack surfaces and a more complex landscape reshaping the road ahead. As your organization continues to grow and innovate, staying ahead of these risks is crucial.

But here’s the good news – your security doesn’t have to slow you down or disrupt innovation. With the right solutions and strategies, you can ensure that your security ecosystem works seamlessly alongside your growth, empowering your team to move faster and smarter.

Join us for InterSECt, a 2-hour virtual experience where we’ll unveil the future of network security. Industry leaders and innovators will reveal how the latest advancements by Palo Alto Networks are designed to keep your business more secure and running at full speed. In addition, product demos will provide a firsthand look at the solutions driving the future of security, helping you understand how they can work for your organization.

### Skills You Will Learn

* **Navigating Your Entire Security Landscape with Simplicity:** In today’s complex security environment, managing multiple-point solutions can be overwhelming. By moving to a unified platform, like the [zero trust network security platform](/network-security), you can transform your security approach. You’ll hear from platform customers who’ve made the shift from fragmented tools to a unified strategy and the impact it’s had on their business.
* **Protecting Every User and Every Device with No Compromises:** As the workforce becomes more distributed, and AI adoption accelerates, securing every user, device and connection without compromising performance is more critical than ever. [Prisma Access Browser 2.0](/sase/prisma-access-browser) helps stop advanced web attacks, safely enable GenAI use and ensure fast, secure access to cloud apps. With stronger data protection and expanded global coverage through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you get protection and performance everywhere your users work.
* **Securing Your Cloud with Seamless, End-to-End Protection:** Multicloud network environments are growing more complex, and so are the threats targeting them. Network security must also evolve as mesh networking and AI-driven operations redefine enterprise infrastructure and workloads. This session introduces a visionary cloud network security approach – one purpose-built for the hybrid mesh era. Designed to provide scalable, proactive and automated network security across distributed environments, this innovation delivers the increased visibility and protection that modern enterprises need while also improving deployment speed and ease of management.
* **Safeguarding Your AI Ecosystem as It Evolves:** AI is changing the way we work, but it’s also introducing new security uncertainties. As organizations build and deploy AI applications, it’s critical to secure every step, from choosing an AI model to deploying agents. Learn how [Prisma AIRS](/prisma/prisma-ai-runtime-security) protects the full AI ecosystem with model scanning, posture management, AI Red teaming, runtime security and agent security.

This is your chance to take control of your security strategy and confidently accelerate into the future. We’ll show you the way.
