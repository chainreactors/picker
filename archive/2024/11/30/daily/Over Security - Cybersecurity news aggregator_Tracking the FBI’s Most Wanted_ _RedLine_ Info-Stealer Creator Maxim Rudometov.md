# Tracking the FBI’s Most Wanted: "RedLine" Info-Stealer Creator Maxim Rudometov

A coalition of international law enforcement agencies has been investigating the creator and distributor of the notorious infostealer variant RedLine in an operation codenamed “Operation Magnus.” RedLine, a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service), has stolen sensitive data from millions of users worldwide, including credit card information, browser history, autofill form data, emails, and passwords. Active since 2020, RedLine is one of the most widespread infostealer variants.[Read more](https://www.occrp.org/en/news/servers-seized-suspect-charged-in-global-infostealer-takedown).

In August 2021, law enforcement obtained a portion of data from one of RedLine's licensing servers, which was voluntarily reported by a security company to the U.S. government. U.S. investigators then secured a search warrant to analyze the data, uncovering evidence linking Maxim Rudometov to the development and deployment of RedLine. According to an FBI arrest warrant, Rudometov was found to be interacting with or accessing the licensing server using multiple usernames.

On May 16, 2021, a username “Heijs” using an IP address ending in -.180 requested a build of RedLine from the licensing server. Approximately nine minutes later, the same IP address was logged by Apple as having accessed an iCloud account belonging to Maxim Rudometov. Further IP addresses associated with Rudometov’s online accounts also interacted with the RedLine licensing server, under usernames “Admin12” and “testpanel.”

Additionally, on May 2, 2021, an individual using an IP address ending in -.14 signed a malicious file via the licensing server. About an hour earlier, the same IP address was logged into an Apple iCloud account belonging to Rudometov while playing a mobile game. The IP address was assigned to an Internet Service Provider in Krasnodar, Russia, and was later linked to a Skype account used on hacker forums and to access a GitHub repository containing a known exploit for Windows devices. In July 2021 alone, this IP address reportedly accessed the iCloud account approximately 701 times.[Source](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/media/1375146/dl?inline).

The FBI announced the following pictures of Maxim Rudometov in their announcement.

**As shown in the picture on the left, Maxim Rudometov is said to be living in Luhansk, an oblast in Ukraine. The picture is from his VK profile.**

### **What We Know So Far**

There is strong evidence implicating Maxim Rudometov as a significant individual behind the MaaS RedLine. His IP address is associated with an Internet Service Provider located in Krasnodar, Russia. Additionally, he has been located in Luhansk, Ukraine at some point in his life.

### **Beginning Our OSINT Investigation**

We found supporting evidence indicating that Maxim Rudometov was indeed in Luhansk, Ukraine, in 2021. During that time, he obtained a driver’s license from a driving school in Luhansk called "AutoLux."

**Expanding the Timeline**

Although the picture above is presumably newer than those provided by the FBI, we were able to find recent photos of Maxim Rudometov, further expanding the timeline of his whereabouts. Maxim Rudometov frequently gets tattooed at a specific salon in Krasnodar, as seen on the artist’s Instagram account.

**The Extravagant Lifestyle of Maxim Rudometov**
We have, on multiple occasions, located Rudometov at upscale nightclubs, bars, and restaurants, which provides interesting information about his lifestyle and whereabouts. Additionally, as we will see, we have found the most recent pictures of Maxim Rudometov, taken this summer (July 28, 2024).

But first, we will geolocate Rudometov’s whereabouts.

![ree](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aee2e4_0f16a2455f964c85baac7d61784727aa~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_45,h_43,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_avif,quality_auto/aee2e4_0f16a2455f964c85baac7d61784727aa~mv2.png)

Here, Maxim Rudometov is seen with some close friends. We were able to geolocate the bar by conducting in-depth SOCMINT and analyzing various details visible in the image above.

As can be seen in the blue and yellow circles, the windows and furniture match each other, which supports the hypothesis. We then analyzed the EXIF data of the image of Maxim, which provided us with the name of the photographer.

It was then possible to correlate the photographer’s photo album of Maxim to a bar called **Petrovodkin Bar**, which is located in **Krasnodar, Russia.**

We were also able to locate Maxim Rudometov at a club called ‘**La Villa**’, which is also located in the heart of **Krasnodar**. The pictures were taken on May 19, 2023.
