# How to actually convince someone

Have you ever been told:

If only you did X.
Why don’t you try Y?
You should be doing Z.

You probably didn’t listen. You probably felt nagged and annoyed. Telling someone what they **should** do just doesn’t work.

As the famous saying goes: “You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink.”
But I disagree. I do believe there is a way of making the horse drink. Every single time.

You can *persuade* your son to study for his classes.
You can *convince* your spouse that their new friend is bad for them.
You can *influence* your best friend to break up with her toxic boyfriend.

More importantly, you can find a way to get your girlfriend to finally leave the mall.

Funny enough, everyone does the exact opposite. Everyone uses a “should” statement.

You **should** do X.
You **should** do Y.
You **should** do Z.

**Should** statements just shouldn't work, they never will.

Should statements make the person feel inferior. Worse, they don’t viscerally understand WHY they should be doing that thing.

The horse is going to drink when he is thirsty. Not when he is told to drink.
Your son will study for his classes when he cares for his future. Not when he is told.
Your spouse will leave their friend once she becomes too toxic to handle. Not when you tell her.

But my girlfriend will never leave the mall until 3 hours have gone by and I’m clawing my way out.

Okay, jokes aside. Let’s go over what actually works.

Planting seeds.

To the horse: “It’s such a hot today. A cold drink would feel great right now.”

To your son: “Oh, your uncle (the doctor) just bought a Ferrari.”
To your spouse: “Is it just me, or wasn’t it weird how she spoke earlier today?”
To your best friend: “Is he always treating you like that?”

With time, the seeds you have planted will grow and will aid in the understanding of WHY one should do something.

Patience and strategic comments are all you need to actually convince someone. We are just scratching the surface of how this actually works. If anyone has thoughts on this, would love to hear them.
