"MSSP Security Strategies")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiX-JzOxEtjlUyLJ5JwDHgO4iXpieUP81digrVVZRcEd1QLK7cP4ebH-mxVkLE4VnKNT7e4zTxCM9FWFxIS0MRpSfTKTw2TYkekfxPw0Q1R8Aos_QrSzQlTqygjGuXxPONe-7a_6Sp0iydaxr0QRmrRV-ZcuJmDl9wAU2gbZb0Ro2RMGA6Zi1eBNiBeLlk/s790-rw-e365/cynomi.jpg)

The 2024 State of the vCISO Report continues Cynomi's tradition of examining the growing popularity of virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services. According to the independent survey, the demand for these services is increasing, with both providers and clients reaping the rewards. The upward trend is set to continue, with even faster growth expected in the future. However, service providers looking to enter the vCISO market must address challenges like technological limitations and a lack of security and compliance expertise.

For more details on the state of vCISO, read Cynomi's comprehensive report.

[The State of the Virtual CISO Survey Report](https://cynomi.com/state-of-the-vciso-2024/#utm_source=article&utm_medium=THN&utm_campaign=vciso_state_report-2024) by Global Surveyz, an independent survey company, which was commissioned by Cynomi, provides a deep understanding of the vCISO opportunities and challenges facing MSPs and MSSPs today. The report shares insights from 200 security leaders in MSPs and MSSPs that provide cybersecurity strategic services or cybersecurity consulting and employ 50 or more employees. It shines a light on the growing adoption of vCISO services by service providers, the reasons driving this adoption, the challenges faced by MSPs/MSSPs, and how to overcome them.

### 1. Who Will Offer vCISO Services? Everyone!

Starting with the most striking data: in the upcoming period, 98% of MSPs and MSSPs that don't currently offer these services as part of their portfolio — will. This incredible surge, which can be seen in Figure 1, reflects the growing SMB demand for specialized cybersecurity and compliance expertise and how vCISO services align with service providers' growth and business goals.

### 2. The vCISO Landscape is Changing Fast

Next, it's interesting to examine the changes behind this surge. SMBs are tasked with protecting their assets, ensuring compliance, and meeting cyber insurance requirements. Yet, many do not have the bandwidth and resources to hire a full-time security executive. The vCISO role provides SMBs across industries with top-tier cybersecurity and compliance expertise, in a flexible and cost-effective manner. MSPs and MSSPs understand this need and the opportunity it holds and are consistently adding vCISO services to their portfolio.

Currently, 21% of MSPs and MSSPs are offering vCISO services. This trend is on the rise, increasing from 19% in 2023. It seems like this is just the start, with vCISO services gaining traction, and expected to surge in the next few years.

The vCISO landscape is expected to change dramatically in the upcoming years. According to the report, nearly all MSPs and MSSPs will offer vCISO services as part of their offering. 98% of MSPs that currently don't, will do so. This is not only a phenomenal surge in the ecosystem, it's also a change in the MSP/MSSP mindset that sees vCISO services as a must-have as part of their future offering.

### 3. vCISO Services - A Beneficial and Strategic Opportunity

The appeal of vCISO services lies in the multiple business and customer benefits that derive from adding them to the MSP/MSSP portfolio. 59% of service providers that added vCISO services increased revenue and/or their margins. Guess how many increased revenue by more than 20%? Answers in the [report](https://cynomi.com/state-of-the-vciso-2024/#utm_source=article&utm_medium=THN&utm_campaign=vciso_state_report-2024).

Just as importantly, 43% of MSPs and MSSPs identified improved customer security as a beneficial impact of adding vCISO services, 38% enjoyed increased client engagement, and 38% were able to upsell additional products and services.

These benefits show how MSPs and MSSPs have been able to leverage vCISO services to position themselves as security leaders and trusted leadership advisors. This change has been lucrative, resulting in more sales, customers, and revenue. Both of these advantages overlap with the strategic goals service providers have set for themselves for the upcoming year.

### 4. Obstacles to Offering vCISO Services and How to Address Them

Yet, the path to vCISO success requires addressing certain challenges, as can be seen in Figure 4. 29% of respondents report that they lack the technology that can help them support and offer vCISO services. In addition, more than one-fourth feel they have limited security or compliance knowledge, which hinders them from adding vCISO services to their offering.

The initial investment required to build a vCISO offering and the scarcity of skilled personnel are also perceived as vCISO adoption blockers. This includes hiring and training a security team, requ...
