# Description
As part of my cybersecurity thesis I wanted to create an exploit for a vulnerability.

I HIGHLY recommend reading this guide, as this exploit is based on it:

https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/

Also, check out this repo, as i took inspiration from it:

https://github.com/Almorabea/Polkit-exploit/blob/main/CVE-2021-3560.py

This code is by no means perfect, sometimes it gets a bit buggy if you set a password for the new user.

I recommend NOT setting a password.

If it does not create a new user, simply retry a few times and it will eventually work.

if you have any advices on how to improve this code, please, feel free to share them :) !
