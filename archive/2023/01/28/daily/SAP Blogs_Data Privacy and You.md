Our world runs on data — from interests and purchases to Social Security numbers and bank account information. Every interaction you have with technology leaves a trail of data, and some of that data is highly sensitive. Thanks to the value of private and personal data, cybercriminals are constantly trying to compromise applications, networks, and systems to gain access to this precious information. While keeping your data private may seem like an impossible task, there are ways you can control how you share your data. For this year’s Data Privacy Day, we’d like to share a few things you can do to protect your data from falling into the wrong hands.

## Pay Attention to Permissions

When downloading a new app on our phone, we might get a pop-up asking for access to our location, contacts, or other information on our phone. This is a perfect time to ask, “Is it necessary?” For example, when using an app like Google Maps, it might be crucial to share your location. However, when using a workout app, your location is not necessary for the app to run successfully. If you’re worried about what information you’re currently sharing, check the settings on your phone and other devices.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/283294_GDPR_2_R_blue-1.png)

## Use Strong Passwords

A malicious actor knows that most people use common passwords in their log in information, and it can take them minutes to figure out how to access your account. Using a unique password of at least 12 characters with numbers, letters, and symbols for each device and account you have is a great way to secure your data. If remembering each password proves to be challenging, you can also rely on a password manager to store your unique passwords.

## Install Latest Updates

Updates for devices, software, or browsers often fix bugs or apply patches for vulnerabilities. Cyber criminals often exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to a system, which can be detrimental to its users. By turning on automatic updates, you’ll have the latest and greatest version, which is often the most secure.

## Stay Vigilant

Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated every year. While cyber criminals often target large corporations, there are still some that target individuals through phishing messages. A phishing message is when a malicious actor is pretending to be someone they are not with the goal to get a user to download or click on something that most likely contains a type of malware. Phishing can be done through email, text, or direct message. Before clicking on an email attachment, make sure you are familiar with the sender, that the language is consistent, and that there is not a sense of urgency in the message. If you’re unsure if it’s a phishing message, reach out to the sender with a new message and verify that they sent you that message.

We hope the tips above can be a good starting point into learning how to keep your data private and secure. Happy Data Privacy Day!
