In the second timeline of October, I have collected 130 events (corresponding to 8.13 events/day), a noticeable drop compared to the 144 of the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/11/10/1-15-october-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/). I wonder if this is a temporary decrease or the beginning of a new trend.

Ransomware is a primary attack vector even in this timeline, and its percentage reaches again the higher values of 2022 with 31.5% (41 out of 130 events), a sharp increase compared to 20.8% of the first half of October. Instead the impact of vulnerabilities remains stable at 10%, very close to 9.7% of the first half of this month.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

The toll to Decentralized Finance platforms continue to grow: in this timeline two organizations, Moola Market and Team Finance, fell victim of the attackers, with a total loss of nearly 24 million worth of cryptocurrency (respectively 9 million and 14.5 million.) Ironically, as if the massive crash was not enough, the FTX users were victim of a phishing campaign.

And despite the impact of the cyber campaigns related to Ukraine seems to decrease (at least the ones that are visible), the cyber espionage front continues to be quite hot. The list of the known threat actors active in this period include: APT41 (AKA Winnti, Chinese attribution), Domestic Kitten (Iran), Sidewinder (Pakistan), Kimsuky (North Korea). Instead the new threat actors revealed in this timeline include: DiceyF and Cranefly. Two additional events to notice in this timeline include the alleged hack of the cellphone of the previous UK Prime Minister Liz Truss (by suspected Russian threat actors), and the constant presence of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior operations aiming to undermine the public opinion of western contries. It is also interesting to notice that yet another ransomware gang (Cuba) turned its unwelcome intentions to Ukraine

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
