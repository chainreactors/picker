[Cisco Talos Incident Response](/category/cisco-talos-incident-response/)

In today’s world, cybersecurity incidents are not a matter of if, but **when** and **how**. From ransomware attacks to data breaches exposing sensitive information, organizations face a changing threat landscape. As a result of cybersecurity attacks, organizations can experience downtime, financial losses, reputational damage and regulatory penalties. That’s when it really helps to have a team like Cisco Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) by your side. But what exactly happens when you bring in a team of cybersecurity responders? How do we turn chaos into control, and what is the long-term value that Talos IR provides to the organizations we work with?

This blog post takes you behind the scenes of engaging an incident response (IR) firm like Talos IR. We will walk through what really happens during an IR engagement, from the moment you pick up a phone and call for help in the middle of a crisis to the long-term changes that make your organization stronger and more secure.

## Why engage an IR team?

Before diving into the process, let’s address the fundamental question: Why engage an IR firm? Cybersecurity incidents are complex, often requiring specialized skills, tools and experience that internal teams may lack. The [Talos Year In Review Report](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2024yearinreview/)highlights the rising frequency and sophistication of attacks; as a result, many security teams are struggling to address emergencies due to resource constraints or the complexity of response at scale.

Engaging an IR firm like Talos IR brings several key advantages:

* **Speed and availability**: We provide 24/7 global support, with response times often under a few hours for remote engagements and on-site support wherever needed. Engaging an IR firm is like calling in a S.W.A.T. team for a cybersecurity crisis. We bring the tools, tactics and experience to contain the threat and minimize damage while guiding the organization toward recovery and increasing future resilience.
* **Expertise**: With numerous incident responders and threat intelligence analysts, all of whom have access to industry-leading Talos threat intelligence, the team has deep experience handling diverse threats, from ransomware to business email compromise (BEC). We handle it all, from “small” attacks on a single organization to a [country-level threats](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/ukraine/). We don’t focus just on typical IT environments — we work with ICS/OT, cloud or mobile forensic, as well.
* **Vendor-agnostic approach**: Talos IR works with customers’ existing infrastructure and tooling, whether you use Cisco products or not. We simply don’t like to wait for deployment of tools before getting our hands dirty in all the logs, consoles and forensic artifacts. At a time when you are already resource-constrained, the last thing we want to do is make you replace an existing security solution, such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), on the endpoints.
* **Comprehensive services**: Beyond emergency response, Talos IR provides proactive services like [Threat Hunting](https://talosintelligence.com/incident_response/hunting) and [IR Planning](https://talosintelligence.com/incident_response/plans) to strengthen your security posture before an incident happens or after to build up resilience.

## Overview of the IR lifecycle

The IR process typically follows a structured lifecycle, based on frameworks such as [NIST SP 800-61](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r3/final) or the [SANS Institute’s model](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/incident-response/). Talos IR aligns with these best practices, tailoring its approach to organization’s unique needs at the time of crisis and beyond. Handling incidents day in and day out has given Talos IR a deep well of experience, and we’ve built that knowledge into processes to support every organization we work with. The lifecycle of our IR typically includes:

1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

When you engage Talos IR, we apply this lifecycle with a blend of technical prowess, threat intelligence and collaborative teamwork. Let’s walk through each phase in detail.

### Phase 1: Preparation (before the incident)

Preparation is the foundation of effective IR. While many organizations only engage IR firms during a crisis, proactive engagement with Talos IR can significantly reduce the impact of future incidents. With a Talos IR retainer, you secure an agreement that ensures rapid response during an emergency and access to proactive services tailored to your organization’s risk profile and needs, offering:

* **Emergency response**: Guaranteed access to a global team within a short time of experiencing of an incident. During major global cybersecurity events like Wannacry, Heartbleed or Log4J or others, an existing retainer can be the difference between receiving immediate help and waiting days to weeks.
* **Proactive services**: Access to [proactive services](https://talosintelligence.com/incident_response/services#proactive-services) for Threat Hunting, Tabletop Exercises or Purple Teaming
* **Relationship building**: Familiarity with your environment, reducing response time during a crisis

These services build [trust and familiarity](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/case-study-catching-threats-ahead-of/), ensuring Talos IR can hit the ground running during an emergency.
