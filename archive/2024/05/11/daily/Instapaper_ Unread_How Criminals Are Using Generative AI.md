## How Criminals Are Using Generative AI

There’s a [new report](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/back-to-the-hype-an-update-on-how-cybercriminals-are-using-genai) on how criminals are using generative AI tools:

> Key Takeaways:
>
> * Adoption rates of AI technologies among criminals lag behind the rates of their industry counterparts because of the evolving nature of cybercrime.* Compared to last year, criminals seem to have abandoned any attempt at training real criminal large language models (LLMs). Instead, they are jailbreaking existing ones.* We are finally seeing the emergence of actual criminal deepfake services, with some bypassing user verification used in financial services.

@Bruce Schneier

From the extract

“We are finally seeing the emergence of actual criminal deepfake services, with some bypassing user verification used in financial services.”

Perhaps not surprising when you consider from another recent report that’s been mentioned on MSM it’s been said the number one most profitable crime currently is fraud.

Though other figures say other types of more traditional crime like burglary have not gone down.

At the moment it can be said that online crime is safer for criminals than other forms of crime so it’s not surprising that they would start into AI as a tool for crime.

I suspect what may be holding things back is the fact that AI systems are not that easy to access, nor access safely from the criminal perspective, though this will change.

Also creating your own AI LLM system is not cheap and has high electrical power and cooling demands. So are not yet something for Grandma’s back bedroom or similar. Especially when you consider high electrical power and water has been associated with “illegal herb growing” so authorities are already on the lookout for it.

This in effect turns the LLM into a sitting duck for authorities to find…

But I do expect this to change if the AI hype bubble does not burst.

I guess one question we should think about is,

How long before an AI can sit in on a Zoom meeting?

Because as finance related crime rises, banks will move towards interactive online “proof of life and ID”.

> To improve their social engineering tricks. LLMs prove to be particularly well-suited to the domain of social engineering, where they are able to offer a variety of capabilities. Criminals use such technology for crafting scam scripts and scaling up production on phishing campaigns. Benefits include the ability to convey key elements such as a sense of urgency and the ability to translate text in different languages. While seemingly simple, the latter has proven to be one of the most disruptive features for the criminal world, opening new markets that were previously inaccessible to some criminal groups because of language barriers.

And:

> To circumvent this, criminals are now offering to take a stolen ID and create a deepfake image to convince the system of a customer’s legitimacy.

Annoying but limited. The current level of technology is convincing for low bandwidth automated and low task orientated work. I’m sure much worse is coming one day but we’re not there yet.

And:

> Problems arise for criminals when a deepfake attack targets somebody close to the subject being impersonated, as deepfake videos have not yet reached a level where they can fool people with an intimate knowledge of the impersonated subject. As a consequence, criminals looking for more targeted attacks toward individuals — like in the case of virtual kidnapping scams — prefer audio deepfakes instead. These are more affordable to create, require less data from the subject, and generate more convincing results. Normally, a few seconds of the subject’s voice can suffice, and this type of audio is often publicly available on social media.

I can be chatty or have behaviours which look like nothing on the surface but pull more information out of another person. Discussion tilt, tone, emotional microexpressions can mean something as can none verbal equivalents, timing, and responses. And also what they don’t say and don’t do. I also have a few tricks like being busy or kicking the can down the road, or putting on an act of agreeing with them while I’m buying time and they’re giving me more information for free, or just waiting to see what happens with other people as part of that feedback/evaluation loop. Sometimes I’m just me being me. It’s hard to say, really.

I never like urgent. The more urgent someone is the less I like it. What are they really after, and how are they lying to me, and what else is happening I don’t know about?

I know from experience and feedback from other sources I made the correct decision when it mattered. I didn’t get it right every single time but you pick up a sense about it. It’s none linear. You can only get that from experience. My toleration for something “off” is low.

Let’s see how far an “AI” gets with an in-person meeting.

Welcome to my web said the spider to the fly.

For anything else I would call the cops.

Isabelle Bousquette reports:

> Deepfake incidents in the fintech sector increased 700% in 2023 from the previous year

Yowza. Will they increase more still? I can’t recall if these entities have reporting requirements?

Looks like at least one bank is changing their identity verification protocols for setting up an online account. Users will have to take selfies using the bank’s app. The app instructs users to look in different directions, which is said may be unanticipated by a generic AI deepfake.

The financial institutions will own the costs of fraud, right? Will be an interesting space to watch for new developments.

@noname
I’m also pretty worried about this. However, I do...
