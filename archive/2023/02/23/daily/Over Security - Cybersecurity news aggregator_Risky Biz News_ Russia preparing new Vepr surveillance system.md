The Russian government plans to roll out a new internet surveillance system in the second half of the year.

Named **Vepr** (*Вепрь, the Russian word for "boar"*), the system is allegedly capable of detecting "points of tension" and "threats to the individual, society, and the state" on the public internet.

According to *[TASS](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/17091419)*, the system is being built by Neobit, a Sankt Petersburg software company that was [sanctioned](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0127) by the US Treasury in April 2021 for developing cyber tools for Russia's intelligence and military services.

Work on Vepr began last year in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the system appears to have been designed to allow the Russian government to track potential dissent or mis/disinformation efforts on Russia's internet space.

Officials told *[Vedomosti](https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2023/02/20/963570-roskomnadzor-gotovitsya-zapustit-sistemu-obezvrezhivaniya-infobomb)* the system is not designed to remove information from the internet but to allow to monitor and predict potential "points of tension."

Vepr is currently undergoing tests at the Main Radio Frequency Center (GRFC), a subdivision of the Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications watchdog.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has ramped up its national surveillance capabilities in attempts to prevent dissent from its own population.

For example, last week, the Russian Duma also started working on a project that would [fine telcos](https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2023/02/17/963490-oborotnie-shtrafi-sorm) that fail to properly implement SORM—special equipment installed in a telco's backend network that logs internet and telephony traffic and allows Russian law enforcement and intelligence services to search through the data.

Earlier this month, Russia also launched [Oculus](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/russia-internet-censorship-oculus-ukraine-war-content-b2281297.html), a system that scans the internet and detects banned content, either in text or image format.

Last year, Russia began work on a system that [aggregates CCTV video streams](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-russia-is-building) from all over the country at a new data center near Moscow.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Coinbase phishing incident:** Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase [disclosed](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/social-engineering-a-coinbase-case-study) that earlier this month, on February 5, one of its employees fell victim to a phishing attack and allowed a threat actor to collect their Coinbase login credentials. The company says that MFA protections prevented the attacker from silently logging into the employee's account. Nevertheless, the attacker was able to gain access to some Coinbase systems after calling the phished employee and posing as one of the company's IT support staff. Coinbase avoided a larger breach because its security team spotted the unusual activity on the phished employee's account and contacted them while they were still on the phone with the attacker. While it couldn't be sure, Conibase says it believes the threat actor behind this attack is a group known under the names of [0ktapus](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/0ktapus-campaign/) and [Scatter Swine](https://sec.okta.com/scatterswine).

> "Fortunately no funds were taken and no customer information was accessed or viewed, but some limited contact information for our employees was taken, specifically employee names, email addresses, and some phone numbers. "

**Activision breach:** Activision, the game publisher behind the Call of Duty franchise, has [confirmed](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkg7pn/hacker-breaches-activision-slack-steals-call-of-duty-info) a security breach that took place in early December 2022 after a hacker gained access to one of its internal Slack channels. Activision didn't reveal the incident on its own, but only after it was pressed by reporters after infosec threat intel-sharing group VX-Underground [published](https://mastodon.social/%40vxunderground%40mastodon.socialspill.com/109894432673264729) redacted screenshots they received from the attacker. The intruder told VX-Underground that they gained access to Activision's Slack channel after phishing a "privileged user." The attacker stole internal documents related to the Call of Duty franchise and the content scheduled to be released throughout 2023. Activision says no employee or user data was stolen, nor any of the game's source code. VX-Underground says the attacker also tried to phish other Activision employees, but the attempt failed.

**RailYatri leak:** The personal details of more than 31 million Indians is currently on sale on an underground hacking forum. The seller claims the data belongs to RailYatri, a ticket-booking app used by India's national railway. A government official told the *[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railyatri-user-data-up-for-sale-on-dark-web-101676836961703.html)* they are currently investigating the incident.

**Virgin Media incident:** Virgin Media Television broadcasts were impacted across Ireland after the company [discovered](https://archive.ph/fN18T) an "unauthorised attempt to access [their] systems." According to Ireland's national television *[RTE](https://www.rte.ie/news/2023/0220/1357832-virgin-media-hack/)*, as a result of the attack, Virgin Media aired recorded programming on several channels on Monday, such as Virgin Media 3, 4, More, and VMTV Player.

**DOD leak:** The US Department of Defense has leaked sensitive emails after it left one of its Azure servers exposed on the internet without a password. According to *[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/sensitive-united-states-military-emails-spill-online/)*, the server hosted internal mailboxes for US Special Operations Comman...
