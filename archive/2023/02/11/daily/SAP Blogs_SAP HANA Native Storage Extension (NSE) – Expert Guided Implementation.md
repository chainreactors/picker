SAP HANA Native Storage Extension (NSE) is a general-purpose, built-in warm data store in SAP HANA that lets you manage less-frequently accessed data without fully loading it into memory. It integrates disk-based or flash-drive based database technology with the SAP HANA in-memory database for an improved price performance ratio.

SAP HANA Native Storage Extension (NSE) is supported for the release SAP HANA 2 SPS 04 provides a  disk-based extension to the in-memory COLUMN STORE in SAP HANA. Instead of loading a whole column, only the needed pages are loaded into the buffer cache when accessing the data. A substantial increase in SAP HANA data capacity, with good performance for high-data volumes.
