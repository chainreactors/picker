Hi guys, I‚Äôm **Shubham Bhamare** from Maharashtra, India. As I promised in my [previous write-up](https://medium.com/theshubh77/my-first-bug-bounty-write-up-about-my-first-valid-finding-a-very-simple-ato-bug-in-a-target-who-1b8259f531d6), here‚Äôs my first Facebook bug bounty write-up. Finally! üòÇ

I know it‚Äôs too late to publish this write-up as this bug was found and rewarded in 2018. I‚Äôm extremely sorry for that. Anyways, I‚Äôm going to publish all my other findings too in the coming days.

So without wasting time, let's start! üëâ

===

**Description:**

This issue could have accidentally revealed the identity of the Facebook page admin under certain circumstances.

On Facebook, page admin‚Äôs roles are secret. Disclosing the identity of the page admin may cause a significant privacy issue. In this case, it was possible to disclose the identity of the page admin under certain circumstances.

===

**Setup:**

2 Facebook users i.e. Shubham and John

1 Facebook page i.e. Shubham's Page

1 Facebook group i.e Shubham's Page Group

Platform: [Facebook Web](https://www.facebook.com)

===

**Scenario:**

As mentioned above, there are 2 Facebook users i.e. Shubham and John.

Shubham is the admin of Shubham's Page.

Shubham's Page is linked to Shubham's Page group which is a group for Shopping. Post approval for this group is turned on.

John is a member of said group.

Shubham hasn't made himself an admin of a group because he doesn't want to disclose his identity.

So now that group has only one admin i.e. Shubham's Page.

Shubham is just a member of that group and always acts as a page.

===

**Reproduction steps:**

1) From John's account, create a selling post in the group.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![]()

2) Post will be sent to admin for approval.

3) Now from Shubham‚Äôs account (acting as a page), click on the "Message Seller" button at the bottom of the above unapproved post and send a message.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![]()

4) Message will be sent from Shubham's personal profile instead of the page, which is unintended.

![]()

===

**The logic behind it:**

It‚Äôs easy for John to determine who‚Äôs the admin of the page as there‚Äôs only one group admin (Shubham‚Äôs Page) who can see that unapproved post.

===

**Fix:**

The team fixed this issue by removing the "Message Seller" button when acting as a page.

===

**Bypass:**

I found that fix was incomplete as this issue was still working on old unapproved posts.

===

**Bounty:**

1500 USD

**Timeline:**

> Sep 09, 2018: Report sent
> Sep 11, 2018: Pre-triaged
> Sep 12, 2018: Triaged
> Oct 13, 2018: Fixed
> Oct 13, 2018: Fix bypassed
> Oct 23, 2018: Fixed completely
> Nov 03, 2018: 1500 USD bounty awarded

===

**Takeaway(s):**

1) If you're new to Facebook bug bounty, try to find logical bugs the most.

2) Always try to find a bypass.

===

Thank you for reading! My next write-up will be about my [**second bug in Facebook (Bounty: 5000 USD)**](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/facebook-page-admin-disclosure-by-create-doc-button-bounty-5000-usd-2fd1ff615bf8).
