# Neon App pays users to record their phone calls, sells data for AI training [updated]

Posted: September 26, 2025

TechCrunch [reports](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/24/neon-the-no-2-social-app-on-the-apple-app-store-pays-users-to-record-their-phone-calls-and-sells-data-to-ai-firms/) about a “bizarre app” inviting you to record and share your audio calls so that it can sell the data to AI companies. And if that’s not weird enough on its own, it’s ranking No. 2 in Apple’s US app store at the time of writing.

The name of the app is Neon Mobile and it promises to pay users hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year. Why would you do it? Its reasoning is the old “they already know everything about you anyway” adage and “you might as well get paid for it then.”

Neon will sell the data collected by the app to “AI companies for the purpose of developing, training, testing, and improving machine learning models, artificial intelligence tools and systems, and related technologies.”

The payment is $0.15 per minute if you’re the only Neon Mobile user in the conversation, and this doubles when the person on the other end uses the app as well. With a maximum payout of $30 per day and the understanding that the call has to be made through the app, you’ll have to be on the phone a lot to make thousands of dollars, but we can see why this might be an attractive offer to some people.

Some people are even already planning to do it as a second job. One commenter says:

> “They just want the voice data. So if you and a friend agree to talk about pretend situations for an hour a day to make $900 a month that seems pretty easy. If both parties are doing it that comes out to $18 an hour which is pretty good.”

Neon Mobile promises that:

* It will never sell your personal data to any third party.
* It does not knowingly or intentionally collect personal data about children under 16.
* It will only record your side of the call unless it’s with another Neon user.

We have some doubts about how it will accomplish the one-sided recording technically, as well automatically filtering out names, numbers, and other personal details.

As always, there are some caveats. Looking at the [Privacy Policy](https://neon.com/privacy-policy) we noticed:

* **Neon collects a lot of personal and technical data about you**, like identifiers, contact details, usage data, payment information, event participation, account activity, testimonials, and other data from third-party sources.
* **Any third-party integrations are your responsibility**. These third-party integrations may ask for permissions to access your personal data, or send information to your Neon Account. It is the user’s responsibility to review any third-party integrations.
* **Your personal data is shared with others.** Neon regularly passes personal data to service providers and “trusted partners” for things like hosting, marketing, sales support, and analytics. combined marketing, support, and analytics.
* **You have certain rights, but not absolute ones.** You can request to access, delete, or correct the personal data Neon Mobile collects or maintains about you, but Neon may deny requests when the law allows.
* **You need to watch out for opt-outs.** If Neon wants to use your data in a new way, or if it plans to disclose it to another third party no...
