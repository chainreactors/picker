## Criteria

There are several criteria you will need to think of before choosing the best VPN service provider for Netflix.

### The number of servers

The number of servers is important because the lesser the number, the less popular the VPN service provider is. That being said, it does not mean that if a VPN service have a lot of servers is the best.

It depends on whether your VPN service appetite is that huge.

### The VPN service provider’s privacy and security

Are you someone who is concerned about your own privacy and security? User privacy and security is important in a sense that you do not want your credit card and other personal details leaked, do you?

Though most VPN service providers practice zero logs policy, it does not mean they are not prone to hackers. You will still need to be aware and careful that your private information and internet activities will still be mined by 3rd party members without your knowledge or warrant.

### Connection speediness

If you are planning on using VPN services to access and watch Netflix contents, then VPN connection speediness is definitely one of the most important factors you should consider.

Most mid- to high-range VPN service providers usually have a good to excellent speed. Having run it in the background, your internet speed usually will decrease by a small percentage, but not very drastically.

The decrease in internet speed usually won’t be too noticeable most times anyway. You’ll be left with a speed that runs almost as fast as your original speed.

### Plans and pricing

Plans and pricing would be subjected to consumer’s preferences. Having taken into account your expectations and budget, searching and browsing the right Netflix VPN may be worthwhile for you.

## Our Top 7 VPN Choices for Accessing Netflix

We can now discuss about our best 7 VPN service choices for accessing Netflix without worrying about getting blocked.

### 1. NordVPN

![NordVPN](data:image/svg+xml...)![NordVPN](https://www.suspek.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NordVPN-Screenshot.png)

It is not surprising to see NordVPN here in the list. With over 5600+ servers available, it is no surprise that NordVPN is considered one of the best. The large amount of servers reflects the popularity of the VPN service provider, and have been confirmed as such.

In terms of speed connection, NordVPN is said to be one of the speediest VPN Netflix among its competitors. Even as it is considered as one of the best VPN service, that does not mean it has speed issues.

Most VPN service providers, when activated and run in the background can slow down your overall PC speed. NordVPN is no exception to that. Users have reported back saying that even when it is activated and running in the background, it will hardly cause any performance slowdowns.

People often hate slow connections when they are streaming Netflix movies and tv series. If you are worried if the slower connection will affect your Netflix streaming, it will not. Users said that despite the speed difference, they said the movies and tv series did not slow down that much.

As a matter of fact, the slowdown was almost close to non-noticeable. Hence, the speed decrease is less likely to be felt.

Remember that depending on which servers’ location you are connected to can be a contributing factor to your internet speed. The further away it is from you, the slower your connection speed will be. The same can be said about being connected to a server location that is much closer to you geographically – which usually will be faster.

Concerned about safety? NordVPN practices a n0-logs policy where they keep none of your personal data and information. If anyone demands that they handover your user details, NordVPN will not be able to do it since they don’t keep data anyway.

If you are interested in NordVPN it has several plans for you.

* 1 Month Plan: US$11.95/month
* 1 Year Plan: US$143.40/year
* 2 Years Plan: US$286.80/year
* 3 Years Plan: US$430.20/year

NordVPN has a 30-day money back guarantee feature. If you are not happy with their services, you can unsubscribe from their plan before the 30th day mark.

On a side note, users have mentioned how NordVPN is more expensive than average. Most VPN services charges around US$10 a month on average. NordVPN is slightly above that average so to speak.

### 2. ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN is another popular Netflix VPN service provider that we can say “does wonders” as a VPN. “Doing wonders” may be an over-reaching appraisal, but the fact of being one of the best VPN service...
