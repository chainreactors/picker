## DIRNSA Fired

In “[Secrets and Lies](https://www.schneier.com/books/secrets-and-lies/)” (2000), I wrote:

> It is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state.

It’s something a bunch of us were saying at the time, in reference to the vast NSA’s surveillance capabilities.

I have been thinking of that quote a lot as I read [news](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/nsa-director-haugh-trump-loomer.html) [stories](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/) [of](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-agency-tim-haugh-ec08b455e2c1112f5c6bb1881fad73e2) President Trump firing the Director of the National Security Agency. General Timothy Haugh.

A couple of weeks ago, I [wrote](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/28/signal-chat-leak-trump-technology-security-houthis-group-defense-nsa/):

> We don’t know what pressure the Trump administration is using to make intelligence services fall into line, but it isn’t crazy to [worry](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/16/house-fisa-government-surveillance-senate) that the NSA might again start monitoring domestic communications.

The NSA [already](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying) [spies](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/five-things-to-know-about-nsa-mass-surveillance-and-the-coming-fight-in-congress) [on](https://epic.org/documents/in-re-epic-nsa-telephone-records-surveillance/) [Americans](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/every-move-you-make-obama-nsa-security-surveillance-spying-intelligence-snowden/) in a [variety of ways](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline). But that’s always been a sideline to its main mission: spying on the rest of the world. Once Trump replaces Haugh with a loyalist, the NSA’s vast surveillance apparatus can be refocused domestically.

Giving that agency all those powers in the 1990s, in the 2000s after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and in the 2010s was always a mistake. I fear that we are about to learn how big a mistake it was.

Here’s PGP creator Phil Zimmerman in 1996, [spelling it out](https://philzimmermann.com/EN/testimony/index.html) even more clearly:

> The Clinton Administration seems to be attempting to deploy and entrench a communications infrastructure that would deny the citizenry the ability to protect its privacy. This is unsettling because in a democracy, it is possible for bad people to occasionally get elected—sometimes very bad people. Normally, a well-functioning democracy has ways to remove these people from power. But the wrong technology infrastructure could allow such a future government to watch every move anyone makes to oppose it. It could very well be the last government we ever elect.
>
> When making public policy decisions about new technologies for the government, I think one should ask oneself which technologies would best strengthen the hand of a police state. Then, do not allow the government to deploy those technologies. This is simply a matter of good civic hygiene.

I don’t follow why there’s suddenly a concern about NSA leadership. Of course the new administration replaces people so they have folks in place that support them in driving their political goals. Why use the term loyalist? Obama and Biden did replace various leadership positions in the intelligence community as well. They both also spied on journalists. I think only the Trump campaign was spied on by the NSA, right? Maybe we’ll see some reform.

Is there anything to this article other than the hypothesis “…the NSA’s vast surveillance apparatus **CAN** be refocused domestically” ? (emphasis mine)

I suppose that in a sense that is true, it can be refocused. But it can also NOT be refocused, or it could be if the outcome of the election was Kamala taking the Oval Office, too.

Seriously, I like the technical articles but the double standard in the political debate here is apalling. Can we go back to cryptography and hacking news stories please?

This is a bipartisan issue. There are no good guys…and you know it.

This post is very timely as I was thinking along the same lines as I walked up the hill from the bus to the local 50501 rally this past Saturday. My phone in a faraday pouch and my rayhunter turned on (thanks EFF!) and going through how I could tighten things up more and get more friends onto Signal. Not a cheerful place to be on a sunny and warm Saturday; Thanks Bill and Obama.

Geez! What’s with the comments on this one? The responses have a lot more vitriol than I would expect to a security expert saying “The government is changing a lot and looking at its people more. Be careful out there.”

When administrations become obsessed with insider threats, regardless of who is in power, they are essentially operating blind while presenting a perfect environment to adversaries.

Credibility in important roles is incredibly important, but it also requires people who will listen to the advice or information delivered. Politicians often spruik themselves as tough on defense and national security, but have no practical experience in defense planning, security or intelligence. They also have a record of ignoring experts.

Oral briefings rarely provide the detail and context of what is provided in carefully produced and verified written reports. Nor can presentations convey the understanding gained through the in-person experience of those physically dealing with the matters that are outlined.

The evidence of this is, that when eventually challenged with the pending implications of historic national security warnings, governments consistently cut budgets to departments and attempt to rearrange the very agencies that delivered those very same warnings.
