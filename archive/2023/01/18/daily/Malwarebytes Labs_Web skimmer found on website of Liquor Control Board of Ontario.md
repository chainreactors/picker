# Web skimmer found on website of Liquor Control Board of Ontario

Posted: January 17, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

On January 12, 2023, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) published a [news release](https://www.lcbo.com/content/lcbo/en/corporate-pages/about/media-centre/news/2023-01-12.html) about a cybersecurity incident, affecting online sales through LCBO.com. It is one of the largest retailers and wholesalers of beverage alcohol in the world.

## Web skimmer

The cybersecurity incident was a web skimmer, which is designed to retrieve customer payment information. Or, in the words of the LCBO:

> “an unauthorized party embedded malicious code into our website that was designed to obtain customer information during the checkout process.”

LCBO has reset all LCBO.com account passwords.

## Magecart

The web skimmer was identified by experts as a Magecart web skimmer. The malicious code injected was inside a [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en) (GTM) snippet encoded as Base64. The abuse of this legitimate Google service has been ongoing because it provides attackers free infrastructure upon which they can host their scripts, while also granting enhanced capability to avoid detection.

Malwarebytes’ Director of Threat Intelligence Jérôme Segura commented:

> The attack on LCBO’s online portal follows a trend we’ve seen before of injecting malicious code disguised as legitimate snippets such as Google Tag Manager. In this case, the threat actor added an extra level of stealth by loading the skimmer code via a websocket, instead of a more typical [HTTP](https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day) request. LCBO took quick action to take its site offline and publicly acknowledge and disclose the issue which should be commended.”

The code only loads the skimmer if the current URL contains the string ‘checkou’ (note the missing ‘t’). It then opens a [websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) for communication which is more covert than a typical HTTP request. The Magecart domain is: magento-cdn[.]net, which was registered less than a month ago.

## Stolen information

According to the press release, customers who provided [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) on check-out pages and proceeded to the payment page on LCBO.com between January 5, 2023, and January 10, 2023, may have had their information compromised.

The stolen information could include names, email and mailing addresses, [Aeroplan](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan.html#/) numbers, LCBO.com account password, and credit card information.

LCBO is looking to contact those affected directly, but in the meantime all customers who initiated or completed payment for orders on LCBO.com during that time period should monitor their credit card statements and report any suspicious transactions to their credit card providers.

The vast majority of payment card records that are stolen by Magecart groups using the GTM container method were later offered for sale on [Dark Web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/09/what-is-the-dark-web-the-dark-web-explained) marketplaces.
