## The likes of SHA-256, RSA, ECDSA and ECDH won't be welcome in just five years

Australia's chief cyber security agency has decided local orgs should stop using the tech that forms the current cryptographic foundation of the internet by the year 2030 – years before other nations plan to do so – over fears that advances in quantum computing could render it insecure.

The Land Down Under's plans emerged last week when the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) published [guidance](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism/cyber-security-guidelines/guidelines-cryptography) for High Assurance Cryptographic Equipment (HACE) – devices that send and/or receive sensitive information – that calls for disallowing the cryptographic algorithms SHA-256, RSA, ECDSA and ECDH, among others, by the end of this decade.

Bill Buchanan, professor in the School of Computing at Edinburgh Napier University, wrote a [blog post](https://billatnapier.medium.com/shock-news-sha-256-ecdsa-and-rsa-not-approved-in-australia-by-2030-3d1c286cad58) in which he expressed shock that the ASD aims to move so quickly.
