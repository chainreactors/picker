Business transformation has become 'the new normal'. The reasons and scope of required readjustments are diverse - for example, increasing pressure from customers to offer sustainable products. The search for new suppliers because of disrupted supply chains or rising energy prices causes modification of business models. Or a lack of qualified employees and cost pressure sparks the need to design efficient processes through digital technologies.

Depending on the strategy addressing these challenges, the transformation affects the company's entire value chain, selected business functions (like finance or supply chain), or processes (e.g., digitization of customer orders). The degree of change that is needed finally determines the transformation's duration and complexity. For example, it raises the question of how many processes and IT systems will be involved. Employees need to be involved in the changes and have the opportunity to share their ideas to successfully realize the transformation goals.

As part of our [SAP Signavio Community Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzGnM7_tHk8) campaign, in this blog post, we'll explain the different flavors of a transformation, how to find the right balance when transforming, potential vs. reality, and how SAP Signavio can help you.

**TRANSFORMATION IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS**

Enterprise programs typically start with estimating the full potential value, followed by building a plan of initiatives to close the value gap.

Picture 1 - Transformation Flavours

In view of the number of measures to be taken, management teams are challenged to identify and prioritize upcoming tasks. Often, available resources (internal and external) are limited. Therefore, a decision must be taken on what to implement and what not. After, it must be determined how transformation successes will be realized along a consistent plan of prioritized activities. 'Value contribution' and 'feasibility' are popular criteria for prioritization. Our clients love to work along a phased plan, starting with 'Quick Wins' right away for early outcomes.

**FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE**

We're following a customer-proven approach that is based on three strategic dimensions driving value in a company. The first dimensions are products or services that open up a company's market and thus make revenue generation possible. The product portfolio design is a company's fundamental decision to safeguard its existence. Depending on this, basic conditions are defined as how the customer interaction will be designed (second dimension). Higher-priced products or services require a customer experience that meets the expectation and aspirations of the product. And finally, a cost structure (third dimension) must be developed that doesn't overstretch the market and customers find attractive and realizes the expected margin.

Picture 2 - Dimensions of Value

Within these three dimensions, we first start with a benchmark comparison of the company's current performance (the inner circle in the chart). In turn, the outer circle shows which results the company's peers have achieved. The company's task during the transformation design is now to set up initiatives suitable for reducing the distance to the outer circle. If necessary, go beyond to generate additional competitive advantages.

The options for this can be different. They require a redesign of a customer journey or better availability of desired products. They often include specific changes to a process organization, such as shortening cycle times by automating individual processes to a greater extent.

**SIZING THE REALISTIC POTENTIAL VALUE**

To confirm the selected measures, we use a combination of external benchmarks (business KPIs) and performance indicators (PPIs) that we can extract from existing IT systems. This combination ensures that we gauge the distance to our competitors based on (undebatable) publicly available financial company data (annual reports). In the first step, the focus is thus directed to those areas in the company that show high potential. In the second step, this preselection is confirmed with the help of operational process performance metrics obtained through various process analysis methods. The desired granularity can be adjusted according to the information needs. A first assessment is possible within one day after connecting to the source IT system.

Picture 3 - Integrated Performance Management

This allowed for a fact-based definition of initiatives with their respective value potential and implied cost for improvement, as well as prioritized activities, delivering short-, mid-, and long-term outcomes, depending on the chosen transformation goal.

From here, it's all about execution, monitoring, and countermeasures to safeguard value realization throughout 'Large Transformations' and 'Continuous improvement initiatives.
