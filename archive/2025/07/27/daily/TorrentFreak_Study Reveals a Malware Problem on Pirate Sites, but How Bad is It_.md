# Study Reveals a Malware Problem on Pirate Sites, but How Bad is It?

A new report investigates the cybersecurity risks consumers face when using digital piracy services in Southeast Asia. The findings clearly show that pirate sites are a bigger threat than legal streaming platforms, suggesting that countermeasures are warranted. However, does is also mean that pirates are 65 times more likely to be infected by malware? And is that even important?

Today’s online landscape continues to face similar issues, [if not worse](https://torrentfreak.com/most-popular-movie-piracy-site-ever-strongly-linked-to-global-infostealer-activity-250720/). With more attack vectors and potential victims than ever before, security risks are front and center.

Even if operators of pirate sites and services are not actively looking for trouble, the third-party ads on their sites can easily cause havoc. This makes online pirates a key target for cyber threats.

## Report: Pirate Sites & Cyber Threats

A new report released this week, commissioned by the Motion Picture Association’s anti-piracy arm ACE, quantifies the risk for users of popular pirate sites in Southeast Asia. Written by Dr. Paul Watters of Macquarie University, it examines cyber threat detections on websites in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore.

*Consumer Risk from Piracy in Southeast Asia* *([pdf](https://torrentfreak.com/images/Watters-PiracyInSEA-071025-v2.pdf))* is part of a series, which previously covered other countries such as the Philippines and Poland.

The report looks at the 30 most popular sites in each country, split into various content categories such as P2P, IPTV, streaming and anime sites. It also includes piracy-themed scam sites, which do not provide any content themselves but are designed to attract pirates, often for credit card scams.

The final sample includes 1,200 websites that were tested for problematic content using VirusTotal. The results were then compared to a control sample of legal streaming services in the same regions.

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the ‘pirate’ sites were much riskier than legal streaming platforms. P2P sites performed the worst with an average total of 53.2 threat detections per 30 sites per country, followed by scam sites (44.8) and pirate streaming services (35.6).

Manga sites were the most ‘safe’ according to the report, with an average of 10.6 detections per 30 sites per country.

## Key Findings Deserve Nuance

For its ‘Key Findings’ the report zooms in on the worst result combination of category and country, which explains the higher relative risks shown in the image below. The 65x multiplier for the P2P category, for example, refers to Indonesia.

*Key Findings*

We have no reason to doubt these results; our recent reporting has indicated several high-profile threats associated with pirate sites, some of which may not even be picked up by simple VirusTotal scans.

That said, the ‘relative risk’ terminology can be confusing. After all, most legal streaming sites have no malware threats, so what does it mean when P2P sites have a relative risk of 65 in Indonesia?

It basically means there were a total of 65 threat detections for the 30 sites in the P2P category in Indonesia. Similarly, there were 52 detections for the 30 pirate streaming sites in Malaysia, et cetera. This includes the sites with lower or no threats at all.

In theory, it could be that one site is responsible for all detections in a category, with the other 29 being clean. Those details are not specified, however.

*Detections (worst-case) per category in Indonesia*

The report notes that the “extraordinary” findings “dwarf the baseline,” which consists of legal streaming sites that often have zero threats. Instead of zero as a comparison base, the report uses a [pseudo count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) of one, concluding that the risk is 65 times higher.

“When we normalize these findings against the Top 30 mainstream control sites to compute Relative Risk, the elevation is extraordinary: worst-case RRs for Streaming piracy (e.g. 52.00 in Malaysia), P2P (65.00 in Indonesia), and Scam (49.00 in Thailand) dwarf the control baseline,” the report reads.

For those who are still following along, the “relative risk” is essentially the same as the number of detections in pretty much all examples, as the baseline is 1. So people are 65 times more likely to…?

## 65 Times More Likely to be Infected by Malware?

We agree with the report in the sense that malware and other cyber threats are relatively prevalent on pirate sites. However, results like these should be interpreted by others with caution.

ACE, which commissioned the research, [draws a conclusion](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/news/study-finds-consumers-up-to-65-times-more-likely-to-be-infected-with-malware-when-using-piracy-sites/) that, while approved by the report’s author, may be a bit too broad based on what the study reports.

“[T]he study revealed that in the worst case, local consumers are up to 65 times more likely to be **infected with malware** when using piracy sites as compared to legitimate websites,” the group wrote (emphasis added).

*From ACE’s press release*

![65 times](https://torrentfreak.com/images/65times.jpg)

ACE uses the “key finding” figure from the worst-case scenario in the most problematic category and country, P2P sites in Indonesia. The average number of threats for 30 sites across all countries and categories is closer to 28 detections.

More problematic is the “infected with malware” phrase. This isn’t a correct representation of the findings, as malware is only a subset of the detected cyber threats. These also include phishing, suspicious content, spam, and potentially unwanted software.

*Not All Malware*

Needless to say, an unclassified popup advertisement is not the same as a malware infection. In fact, even when it comes to malware, the report only lists detected problems, not actual malware infections.

Unfortunately, however, the “infected by malware” headline was [picked up broadly in the press](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2265+times+more+likely+to+be+infected%22).

## Automated Blocking Recommended

This problem shouldn’t boil down to how many times more likely pirates are to be infected by malware. The details and severity of the threats are key. There is no doubt that a subset of pirate sites is posing a problem, and that may even be more severe than the report’s abstract figures suggest.

The bigger question is what to do with this information, and the report provides some pointers there as well.
