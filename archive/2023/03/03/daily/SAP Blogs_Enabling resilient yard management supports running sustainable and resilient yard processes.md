# Enabling resilient yard management supports running sustainable and resilient yard processes

As a yard manager, you are faced with numerous challenges daily, from managing the flow of transportation units like trucks or containers in and out of the yard, to ensuring that the drivers and their vehicles are planned properly, are in time and processed efficiently in the yard.

With so many moving parts to keep track of, it can be easy to overlook the importance of having a resilient yard management plan in place.

In this blog post, we will explore the concept of resilient yard management and how it can help you to achieve more sustainable and efficient operations.

## What is Resilient Yard Management?

Resilient yard management refers to the ability of a yard to withstand and recover from adverse conditions and challenges. This involves implementing strategies and systems that help to mitigate the impact of disruptions, such as weather events, traffic congestion, and maintenance issues.

The goal of resilient yard management is to ensure that your yard continues to operate smoothly, even in the face of unexpected obstacles. This not only protects your reputation and bottom line, but it also helps to foster a more sustainable and efficient operation.

## Why is Resilient Yard Management Important?

There are many reasons why resilient yard management is important, including:

1. **Improving Efficiency**: Resilient yard management helps to improve the overall efficiency of your operation. By having strategies in place to mitigate the impact of disruptions, you can minimize downtime and reduce the number of unexpected delays.

2. **Protecting Reputation**: Resilient yard management can also help to protect your reputation as a reliable and efficient truck yard. When your yard is able to continue operating smoothly in the face of adversity, it builds trust with your customers and helps to establish your yard as a leader in the industry.

3. **Promoting Sustainability**: Resilient yard management is also an important aspect of promoting sustainability. By minimizing disruptions and reducing downtime, you are able to reduce your carbon footprint and minimize the negative impact of your operation on the environment.

## Tips for Implementing Resilient Yard Management

1. **Plan for Disruptions**: The first step in implementing resilient yard management is to plan for disruptions. This involves identifying potential sources of disruptions, such as weather events and traffic congestion, and developing strategies to mitigate their impact.

2. **Invest in Technology**: Another important aspect of resilient yard management is investing in technology. This can include real-time tracking systems and predictive analytics to anticipate and prevent disruptions.

3. **Foster a Culture of Collaboration**: Resilient yard management also requires fostering a culture of collaboration. This involves encouraging open communication and collaboration between all members of your team, including drivers, dispatchers, and maintenance personnel.

## Implement a resilient Yard Management with SAP Yard Logistics

[SAP Yard Logistics](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/yard-logistics.html) is the perfect basis for building a resilient and sustainable yard management system that will help you to run your business in the best way.

By using its planning capabilities, the system will provide you upfront with the information about planned incoming and outgoing transports as well internal activities. Scheduling in- and outgoing transports is also important to reduce consumption of parking laces or avoiding traffic jams. The **dock appointment scheduling tool** with SAP Yard Logistics is taking care of those time slots and can be used to coordinate with suppliers and carriers to ensure the supply and demand fits to the needs of the business by not using extensive parking capacities or human capital for gate agents and security.

Based on this information, identification of bottle necks is possible as well as the initiation of manual or system-guided counter measures. An optimizer-based planning scenario like the berth planning considers the different workload inputs, putting them on a Gannt-chart timeline, thereby visualizing the planning result.

The **Yard Cockpit** as graphical representation helps to evaluate the yard occupation and supports dependent activities to keep operations running in the best manner.
