Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution in cs.exe (CVE-2022-45923)
The `Common Gateway Interface (CGI)` program `cs.exe` of the `Content Server`
has a vulnerability, which allows an attacker to increase/decrease an arbitrary
memory address by 1 and to trigger a call to a method of a `vftable` with a
`vftable pointer` value chosen by the attacker.

The `cs.exe` does de-serialize (crack) the user provided data in the `_fInArgs`
parameter, if the parameter `_ApiName` is set. During this de-serialization to
a `class KOSValue` object, the function `obj_ref_cracker` can be called. This
function tries to create a new `class KOSValue` object with an unknown class ID
of `3`.

As the class ID is unknown the function returns an object of type
`KOSValueBaseClass` instead of `KOSObjRefClass`, but the value of the
`class_ptr` attribute of the new `class KOSValue` object is controlled by the
attacker. This new object can then be used to increase/decrease arbitrary
memory addresses and call methods of its `vftable` via the functions
`KOSValueBaseClass::AddReference` and `KOSValueBaseClass::ReleaseReference`.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution in cs.exe (CVE-2022-45923)
The following request crashes the `CGI` binary `cs.exe` with an `access
violation exception - 0xC0000005` trying to read memory from address
`0xAAAA+8`:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ PoC removed, will be published at a later date ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are `.dll` files (`libaprutil-1` & `libapriconv-1.dll`) which are not
compiled with the security flag `Address Space Layout Randomization - ASLR`
enabled, which can be used to achieve remote code execution.
