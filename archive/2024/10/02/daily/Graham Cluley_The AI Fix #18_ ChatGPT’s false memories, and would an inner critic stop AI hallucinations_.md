In episode 18 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù our hosts discover that OpenAI‚Äôs Advanced Voice mode is too emotional for Europeans, a listener writes a Viking saga about LinkedIn, ChatGPT is a terrible doctor, and the voice of Meta AI takes to Meta‚Äôs platforms to complain about Meta AI reading things people post on Meta‚Äôs platforms.

Mark discovers what Darth Vader really said on Cloud City, Graham rummages through ChatGPT‚Äôs false memories, and our hosts find out why AIs need an inner critic.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
