# Pressurecore

Pressurecore is a position-independent code (PIC) framework for Rust shellcoding, inspired by [Rustic64](https://github.com/safedv/Rustic64) and the original C++ implementation [Stardust](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Stardust). This project is designed for advanced shellcode development on Windows x64, focusing on stealth and reliability.

## Features

* **no\_std**: Minimal runtime, suitable for shellcode and payloads.
* **x64 Only**: Supports only 64-bit Windows targets.
* **SSN Syscalls**: Uses direct syscall numbers for Windows API calls.
* **Vectored Exception Handling (VEH)**: Implements VEH for stealthy syscall invocation.
* **Custom Build Pipeline**: See `Makefile....
