# Tax deadline threat: QuickBooks phishing scam exploits Google Ads

Posted: April 8, 2025
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

The pressure of the looming tax filing deadline (April 15th in the US) can make anyone rush online tasks. Cybercriminals are acutely aware of this increased activity and are exploiting trusted platforms like Google to target Intuit QuickBooks users.

By purchasing prominent Google Ads, they are creating highly convincing fake login pages designed to pilfer [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), including usernames, passwords, and even one-time passcodes (OTPs) – the keys to someone’s financial data needed for tax compliance.

Understanding this deceptive tactic is the first step in protecting yourself from falling victim.

## Brand impersonation: from Google ad to phishing page

Accounting and tax preparation software has traditionally been a common lure for scammers, particularly those related to online support operating out of large call centres in India and surrounding areas.

Late last year, we documented a [fraudulent QuickBooks installer](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2024/11/quickbooks-popup-scam-still-being-delivered-via-google-ads) that was laced with [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) and generated a fake pop up to trick users into calling for assistance.

This time, the attack is even more dangerous as it goes after victims’ login credentials for QuickBooks. It starts from a Google search, showing an ad that impersonates Intuit’s branding for “QuickBooks Online”.

This leads to a fraudulent website that is essentially a lookalike.

```
Domain Name: QUICCKBOORKS-ACCCOUNTING .COM
Registrar URL: https://www.hostinger.com
Creation Date: 2025-04-07T01:44:46Z
```

Unbeknownst to victims, the sign-in page is actually a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) portal that will steal account credentials in real-time and leak them to the criminals behind this scheme.

## One-time passcode workaround

Passwords alone offer a limited level of security because they can be easily guessed, stolen through phishing, or compromised in [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach). It is highly recommended to enhance account protection by enabling a second form of [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) like one-time passcodes sent to your device or utilizing a [2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa) app for an extra layer of verification.

Phishing kits have evolved to become increasingly sophisticated, with some now capable of circumventing one-time passc...
