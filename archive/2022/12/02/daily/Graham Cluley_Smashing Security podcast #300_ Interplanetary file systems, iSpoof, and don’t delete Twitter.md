Why deleting your Twitter account may be a very bad idea, how the police unravelled the iSpoof fraud gang, and a trip into outer space (or at least interplanetary file systems).

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning “Smashing Security” podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by original show co-host Vanja Švajcer.

What an amazing 6 years of bickering it has been… thanks to all of you who have tuned in, appeared on the show, or supported us! 🙏
