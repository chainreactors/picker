# Greece Approves Legal Framework to ‘Fine’ Pirate IPTV Users, Ramps Up Blocking

Greece continued to expand anti-piracy efforts in 2024, issuing a record-breaking number of blocking decisions. Most blockades target live sports streams offered by illegal IPTV subscription services. To increase the deterrent effect, a new legislative amendment makes it possible to fine subscribers of these services up to 750 euros. However, this may prove challenging.

This puts a spotlight on the practices of other countries, especially those where innocent websites are blocked, as we’ve recently seen in [Spain](https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-blocks-cloudflare-again-new-pirate-iptv-providers-anything-in-the-way-250218/) and [Italy](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/piracy-shield/).

In Greece, where the [first domains were blocked in 2018](https://torrentfreak.com/greek-isps-ordered-to-block-38-domains-including-the-pirate-bay-181109/), the situation has been relatively calm. Blocking requests are managed by the EDPPI, a special commission at the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports that acts following complaints from rightsholders. While there is no direct court oversight, we have seen little to no backlash.

The lack of news does not mean that nothing is happening. During the first four years, EDPPI issued a total of 38 blocking orders. After that, the process sped up, with 62 decisions in 2022, and 89 a year later. In 2024, another milestone was reached, with EDPPI issuing 124 additional blocking decisions.

## 810 IP addresses & 49 Domains

According to public information, last year’s blockades targeted a total of 810 IP addresses and 49 domain names. The focus on IP addresses indicates that current blocking efforts are more likely to target streaming servers than traditional websites.

Indeed, according to a letter from the Hellenic Copyright Organization, which falls under the Ministry of Culture, the majority of the decisions targeted pirated broadcasts of sports events.

These live-streaming blockades were made possible by an amendment to Greece’s copyright law that came into force three years ago. The amendment granted EDPPI the power to issue preemptive live blocking orders against domain names and IP addresses that provide access to pirated streams.

Internet providers are informed about these upcoming streams in advance and are required to take swift action. Otherwise, they risk a fine for each day of non-compliance.

## Amendment to Fine Pirate Subscribers

The blocking amendment proved successful, with discussions already underway to encompass content besides live sports. At the same time, a new proposal seeks to go beyond blocking by directly penalizing pirate subscribers with fines.

In recent months, there have been mentions in the Greek press that a pirate IPTV user was sent to prison. While that may have been [overblown](https://torrentfreak.com/historic-decision-to-imprison-pirate-iptv-user-smells-of-propaganda-241208/), the proposal to fine users is real.

Earlier this week, the Athens News Agency reported that anti-piracy provisions had been [added to the Greek fundraising bill](https://www.amna.gr/home/article/884858/L-Mendoni-Prostima-ochi-mono-stous-diakinites-alla-kai-stous-christes-peiratikou-tileoptikou-i-optikoakoustikou-ulikou) under discussion in Parliament.

This provision reportedly makes it possible to issue an “administrative fine against those who illegally obtain access to audiovisual media” through paid subscriptions. Fines would be applicable to both subscribers and providers of illegal streaming software and equipment.

In the Parliament’s Cultural Affairs Committee, Minister of Culture Lina Mendoni stressed that these fines complement blocking efforts, by holding subscribers responsible for their alleged wrongdoing.

“The fine is graded according to the gravity and despicability of the violation and ranges from 750 euros in the case of home users, increasing to 1,500 euros in cases of public display and use and reaching 5,000 euros in cases where the violation is committed for the purpose of financial or commercial gain,” Mendoni said.

Lawmakers have reportedly greenlighted the bill, including the ‘fine’ amendment. The full text was published in the [Official Gazette](https://search.et.gr/en/fek/?fekId=777704) earlier today and mentions that the aforementioned fines will be doubled for repeat offenders.

In addition to potential penalties for suppliers and users of pirate IPTV services, the amendments also strengthen blocking powers. Among other things, it will be easier to dynamically block URLs, when appropriate.

## Will it Work?

Based on the information available, the ‘piracy fine’ provision will ensure that subscribers of pirate IPTV services are indeed at risk; at least theoretically.

In practice, however, it might not be easy to find out who the subscribers of these services are. That typically requires assistance from a third party, such as an illegal IPTV provider itself or possibly a payment service, to hand over personal data of subscribers first.

*Subscribe…*

It’s not clear if there are any concrete plans to gather this type of data but, meanwhile, the risk of a fine may be enough of a threat to convert some pirates into paying subscribers.

Interestingly, this is also easier said than done. A recent study, which examined whether threats of a substantial fine would make people more likely to subscribe to legal streaming services, showed that this is not the case. Threats [don’t increase people’s intent to subscribe](https://torrentfreak.com/threatening-anti-piracy-messaging-fails-to-stimulate-intent-to-subscribe-240908/).

The same study found that offering legal streaming services at substantial discounts would be more effective. Luckily, Greek sports streaming services already [came to that realization themselves](https://torrentfreak.com/sports-streaming-services-fight-piracy-with-a-very-affordable-bundle-240719/).
