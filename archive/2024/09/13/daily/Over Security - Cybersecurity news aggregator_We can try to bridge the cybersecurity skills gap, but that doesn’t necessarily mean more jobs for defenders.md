[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

I have written about the dreaded [“cybersecurity skills gap”](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/threat-source-newsletter-april-7-2022/) more times than I can remember in this newsletter, but I feel like it’s time to revisit this topic again.

That’s because the White House announced a new initiative last week for the U.S. government called the [“Service for America” initiative](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/cybersecurity-talent-shortage-prompts-white-house-action) designed to train new workers in the cybersecurity field. This measure directs U.S. federal agencies to help recruit and prepare Americans for jobs in cybersecurity and AI by removing certain degree requirements and emphasizing skills-based hiring. This means, hopefully, more educational resources for people looking to break into cybersecurity.

On its face, I’m all in favor of this. I did eventually go back to school to get my associate's degree in cybersecurity, but much of what I’ve learned about this field has been from working at Talos and spending time around my talented and intelligent colleagues, [many of whom](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/researcher-spotlight/) did [not go to college for cybersecurity](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/researcher-spotlight-david-liebenberg-terminals-to-apts/).

The U.S. government also has separate initiatives to support [neurodivergent candidates](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/how-neurodiversity-can-help-cybersecurity-workforce-shortage) who want to work in security, as well as those who are [blind and visually impaired](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-careers/ambitious-training-initiatve-taps-talents-of-blind-visually-impaired).

My concern is that, even if we do train these employees and give them the proper skills, it’s on companies to eventually hire them.

A June report from CyberSeek found that there are only enough skilled workers to [fill 85 percent of cybersecurity jobs in America](https://www.comptia.org/newsroom/press-releases/cybersecurity-career-opportunities-outpace-supply-new-cyberseek-data-reveals). Yet hiring in the industry has remained flat, according to a soon-to-be-released [report from cybersecurity non-profit ISC2](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/11/mind_the_talent_gap_infosec/). This year, the global security workforce is estimated to be 5.5 million, which is only a 0.1 percent increase year over year, according to the report.

Among the more than 15,000 cybersecurity practitioners from around the globe who responded to the study, 38 percent of respondents said their organizations had experienced a cybersecurity hiring freeze over the past year, up 8 percent from 2023. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported budget cuts to the security program, and another 25 percent said their teams had experienced layoffs.

That same CyberSeek report also found that, in the U.S., the amount of cybersecurity-related job postings decreased by 29 percent year-over-year.

So as these skills gap-closing programs begin, we need to be thinking about what skills, exactly, managers want their workers to be trained in. There is obviously some sort of disconnect here between the people who want to work in security compared to the companies or managers who want to hire them. Or there just simply isn’t enough money to go around right now to handle staffing up cybersecurity teams, and that’s just the reality of the current economy in the U.S. and globally.

I’m not saying this to discourage anyone from entering the security space or spread doom and gloom. But I do think it’s important to acknowledge that there are many already skilled and trained workers who simply cannot find work or are treading water throwing dozens of applications at the wall to see what sticks.

I’ve seen too many people posting on LinkedIn recently looking for a cybersecurity job to think that the solution to bolstering security is getting \*another\* worker in with the same skillset to compete for the same job opening as someone who’s been in the industry for 10 years.

## The one big thing

Talos [recently uncovered a new threat called “DragonRank”](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/dragon-rank-seo-poisoning/) that primarily targets countries in Asia — and a few in Europe — operating PlugX and BadIIS for search engine optimization (SEO) rank manipulation. DragonRank exploits targets’ web application services to deploy a web shell and utilizes it to collect system information and launch malware such as PlugX and BadIIS, running various credential-harvesting utilities. Their PlugX not only used familiar sideloading techniques, but the Windows Structured Exception Handling (SEH) mechanism ensures that the legitimate file can load the PlugX without raising suspicion.

### Why do I care?

This group compromises Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) servers hosting corporate websites, with the intention of implanting the BadIIS malware. BadIIS is malware used to manipulate search engine crawlers and disrupt the SEO of the affected sites. With those compromised IIS servers, DragonRank can distribute the scam website to unsuspecting users. DragonRank engages in SEO manipulation by altering or exploiting search engine algorithms to improve a website's ranking in search results. They conduct these attacks to drive traffic to malicious sites, increase the visibility of fraudulent content, or disrupt competitors by artificially inflating or deflating rankings. These atta...
