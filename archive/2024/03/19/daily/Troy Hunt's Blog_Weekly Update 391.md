# Weekly Update 391

18 March 2024

I'm in Japan! Without tripod, without mic and having almost completely forgotten to do this vid, simply because I'm enjoying being on holidays too much 😊 It was literally just last night at dinner the penny dropped - "don't I normally do something around now...?" The weeks leading up to this trip were especially chaotic and to be honest, I simply forgot all about work once we landed here. And when you see the pics in the thread below, you'll understand why:

Regardless, this week has a bunch of content primarily on the Onerep mess; can you imagine a company selling services to remove your data from the other services they're running?! That's the Krebs position and the story is a great read so go and check that out. We may not have heard the end of it yet either, especially given the Mozilla situation.
