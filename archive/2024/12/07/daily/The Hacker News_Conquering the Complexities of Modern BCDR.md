The modern business landscape is thrilling yet daunting. Rapidly evolving technology, persistent cyberthreats and escalating operational complexities make data protection and seamless business continuity challenging for businesses of all sizes. Your organization needs robust security measures that go beyond traditional backup solutions to address the intricacies of today's complex IT ecosystems.

To ensure comprehensive security and smooth operation of critical business processes, your organization needs more than periodic backups — it requires a comprehensive, proactive approach that integrates advanced backup strategies, disaster recovery (DR) capabilities and state-of-the-art ransomware protection.

In this article, we'll examine the current cyberthreat landscape, how it is evolving and how you can prepare your organization to overcome unprecedented challenges in 2025 and beyond.

[Take a self-guided product tour](https://www.unitrends.com/resources/product-tour?utm_source=701Rp00000FrjeP&utm_medium=Other&utm_campaign=Unitrends) of Unitrends Unified BCDR to experience effortless backup and disaster recovery.

## The 2024 threat landscape: Key takeaways

As 2024 draws to a close, let's take a look at how threat actors have evolved their tactics, lessons learned and how you can better protect your business and data in 2025.

### **Shifts in attack strategies**

The cybersecurity landscape in 2024 has been remarkably dramatic, demonstrating a significant increase in aggressiveness and sophistication among threat actors. Ransomware attacks are the most common type and have the greatest impact, with nearly 50% of businesses experiencing one, according to the Kaseya Cybersecurity Survey Report 2024.1

Cybercriminals are constantly adapting and evolving. This year, attackers have shifted their strategies, focusing on extracting data, such as credentials, session cookies and digital identity. They now employ user-based attacks, such as session hijacking, for initial access, bypassing multifactor authentication (MFA) and leveraging social engineering methods, such as ClickFix, to deliver infostealing malware to infiltrate systems.

### **Complex IT infrastructures**

Hybrid and multicloud environments have become a popular choice among businesses looking to navigate the constantly changing business environment. However, increasing reliance on modern, interconnected IT infrastructures and diverse systems adds to complexity, making data protection across all platforms more difficult.

Ensuring seamless security in such complex environments is challenging due to differences in security protocols, inconsistent policy enforcement and gaps in integration between on-premises systems, public clouds and private clouds. These silos create vulnerabilities that cybercriminals easily exploit, especially in organizations with limited visibility into their entire IT ecosystem.

### **Tight RTOs and RPOs**

| In a recent survey, 41% of respondents revealed it would take days or longer to recover critical applications, if they could recover at all. |

Disruptive incidents, whether natural disasters, human errors or cyberattacks, are bound to happen, and they often occur when you least expect them. When such incidents do occur, slow recovery times or significant data loss can result in costly consequences, including lost productivity and regulatory penalties. Meeting tight recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) is critical for maintaining business continuity. However, achieving these stringent goals can be a daunting task with legacy or outdated backup solutions.

Traditional backup methods often lack the speed, scalability and integration capabilities required to handle the complex demands of modern IT environments. Your organization must transition to advanced backup and disaster recovery solutions that prioritize automation, resilience and security to meet even aggressive RTO and RPO goals. Features like automated backups, advanced recovery options, disaster recovery testing and real-time data replication are critical for minimizing downtime and ensuring seamless recovery.

## Why businesses need a new approach to business continuity and disaster recovery

With the threat landscape changing rapidly and business operations becoming more digitized, traditional business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) methods are no longer enough. Your organization must implement proactive strategies and robust BCDR solutions to effectively tackle the challenges of today's dynamic environment.

### **From reactive to proactive**

Routine backups can help protect your data to a certain extent. However, you must adopt a proactive approach to BCDR to safeguard your data effectively and ensure your business never stops. Besides developing a comprehensive business continuity plan, you must also invest in reliable solutions to build resilience against evolving threats, such as ransomware attacks.

Look for a backup and disaster recovery solution that integrates automation and intelligence. Automated backup and recovery processes enhance efficiency and reduce the chance of errors, while intelligent systems can iden...
