## Friday Squid Blogging: “Mediterranean Beef Squid” Hoax

The [viral video](https://archive.org/details/mediterraneanbeefsquid) of the “Mediterranean beef squid”is a [hoax](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/04/27/fact-check-video-mediterranean-beef-squid-viral-hoax/11737144002/).

It’s not even a deep fake; it’s a plastic toy.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

AI models

AI must be decentralized with specific models that look at specific subject matter. Multiple models on same subject.

No Generalized AI. Competition.

@ SpaceLifeForm, ALL,

Re : LLM’s on marching power.

From the “alledged” document,

> *“Notably, they were able to use data from ChatGPT while circumventing restrictions on its API – They simply sampled examples of “impressive” ChatGPT dialogue posted on sites like ShareGPT.”*

“Twas’ to be expected”…

In effect it’s an serial itterative sift process that has “direction” rather than a parallel uplift process, that just builds a landscape anew each time.

The trick is that the “heavy” tectonic uplift has been done and has endogenously produced the rough surface (first order weights) from the data set. The itterative exogenetic denudation processes then selectively weather the surface and stratifies it such that the weights are aggregated by related type thus can be mined more effectively.

As such endogenous processes are intermittent high resource, whilst exogenetic processes,are continuous low resource.

The real trick will be to optomise the interleaving of the lift and weather processes to facilitate maximum extraction for mininum reseource input.

Re: lift and weather

It’s more like a frozen network of snowflake crystals and subject to sudden melting and re freezing – catastrophic forgetting in the presence of new data. There is nothing that produces long term stability. This is one reason AI does mot not resemble a thinker. It’s convinced by the last thing it’s heard. Get out early before it becomes cool.

Cisco recommends replacing Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters with analogue adapters, as they will not be releasing an update.

“A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapters could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.”

“This vulnerability is due to a missing authentication process within the firmware upgrade function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by upgrading an affected device to a crafted version of firmware. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with full privileges.”

@ResearcherZero

Cisco: “A vulnerability in the web-based management interface …”

Duh! Recommendation to replace with analog is great, but, the recommended devices are out of stock from all local suppliers …
