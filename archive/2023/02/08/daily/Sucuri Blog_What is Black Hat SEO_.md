Your website’s search results and rankings are vital to the success of your online business. Better search visibility equates to more traffic — which results in more opportunities to convert leads into customers.

And while it may be tempting to game search engine algorithms to come out on top, there’s a hard line in the sand when it comes to the right and wrong ways to optimize a site for search. Black hat SEO (shady techniques that go against search guidelines) is definitely not something you want to practice if you care about the long-term growth and success of your website.

In this post, we’ll outline what black hat SEO is, the tactics and techniques used in black hat SEO campaigns, how the dark art of black hat SEO can impact your website and rankings, and how to report it to search authorities.

## What is black hat SEO?

**Black hat SEO** (or black hat search engine optimization) is the practice of unethical techniques that go against search engine guidelines to improve a site’s rankings in search results.

Instead of creating helpful content, improving a site with quality information, or providing experiences that solve for the user, shady tactics are employed to get search algorithms to rank a domain’s web pages. These dishonest practices rarely keep the needs of the searcher or website visitor in mind.

While black hat SEO can create a short term improvement in rankings, they often damage a website’s presence in search engines over the long term. They can even lead to a site being [blocklisted](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-remove-google-blocklist-warning/) or completely omitted from search results. This is why it’s imperative that you protect your site from bad actors and avoid use of these techniques on your own domains.

## What are black hat SEO techniques?

Often used by bad actors and shady marketers, black hat SEO techniques can include link manipulation, keyword stuffing, comment spam, cloaking, and unwanted redirects.

If your [website has recently been hacked](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-a-hacked-website/), you may find one or more of these techniques added to your domain in an attempt to generate more traffic to the attacker’s domains or help rank third-party websites.

Let’s take a closer look at some of the more common techniques used in black hat SEO.

* [Cloaking](#cloaking)
* [Doorway pages](#doorway-pages)
* [Keyword stuffing](#keyword-stuffing)
* [Link schemes and paid links](#paid-links)
* [Comment spam](#comment-spam)

### Redirects

A redirect (also referred to as a URL redirect or URL forwarding) is a technique used to redirect a website visitor to a different URL. Redirects are commonly used in SEO to pass authority from one page to another or consolidate two or more pieces of content.

In black hat SEO, however, redirects are used outside of the usual intended purpose to trick search engines — for example, to redirect a web page with high authority to a completely unrelated page so that its position is boosted in Google’s search results. Or to redirect site visitors to one page and search engine crawlers to a completely different one.

These sneaky redirects should be avoided as they are a clear violation of [Google’s search engine guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/doc...
