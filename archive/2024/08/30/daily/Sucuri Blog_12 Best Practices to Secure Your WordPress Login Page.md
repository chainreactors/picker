![12 Best Practices to Secure Your WordPress Login Page](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Post-12-Best-Practices-to-Secure-Your-WordPress-Login-Page-820x385.png)

WordPress powers a significant portion of websites on the internet. With this popularity comes the need for strict security measures, especially for the login page. These entry points are prime targets for hackers and malicious actors. By implementing proper security practices outlined in this guide, you can maintain a secure WordPress login and protect your site from unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

## How secure is the WordPress login page?

WordPress comes with basic security features out of the box. However, these standard protections may not be enough to ward off determined attackers. The default login page can be vulnerable to various threats, including:

* [Brute force attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-brute-force-attack/)
* [Credential stuffing](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/06/3-password-attacks-101.html#:~:text=spraying%20will%20work.-,Credential%20Stuffing,-To%20summarize%20credential)
* [Phishing attempts](https://sucuri.net/guides/phishing-attacks/)
* [Man-in-the-middle attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-broken-access-control/)

To truly safeguard your WordPress site, you need to go beyond the default security settings and implement additional protective measures.

## Best practices for a secure WordPress login page

Let’s explore the most effective ways to boost your WordPress login security:

### 1. Install a security plugin

Security plugins offer comprehensive protection for your WordPress site. They often include features like:

* Firewall protection
* Malware scanning
* Login attempt monitoring
* IP blocking

One standout option is [Sucuri Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/). Our plugin provides:

* [Security hardening](https://sucuri.net/wordpress-security-plugin/)
* [Post-hack security actions](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-use-the-wordpress-security-plugin/#:~:text=STEP%206-,Post%2DHack,-If%20your%20website)

By using Sucuri or a similar security plugin, you add an extra layer of defense to your login page and entire WordPress site. Harden your security posture further with our [Security Platform](https://sucuri.net/website-security-platform/) plans for a web application firewall and malware removal services.

### 2. Modify the default login URL

The standard WordPress login URL is a well-known target for attackers. By changing this address, you can significantly reduce the amount of attacks your site faces.

**Steps to change your WordPress login URL:**

1. Go to **Plugins** > **Add New**.
2. Download, install and activate the **[WPS Hide Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/)** plugin.
3. You will be redirected to the plugin settings page.
4. Update your login path to a new URL and save.

Remember to inform your legitimate users about the new login address. This simple change can greatly improve your site’s security by making it harder for potential intruders to find the entry point.

### 3. Enforce strong password policies

Weak passwords are a major security risk. Encourage all users to create strong, unique passwords for their accounts. Here are some password creation tips:

* Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
* Include numbers and special characters
* Make passwords at least 12 characters long
* Avoid common words or phrases
* Don’t reuse passwords across multiple sites

Consider implementing a password policy that enforces these rules for all user accounts.

### 4. Secure the wp-admin directory

Another layer of protection you can add to your wp-admin folder is to password protect your wp-admin directory, requiring users to supply an additional set of credentials before they can access the WordPress login page.

For the following steps we’ll go through how this process works in cPanel:

1. Log in to your cPanel.
2. Go to the **Directory Privacy** section.
3. Locate the **public\_html/wp-admin** folder and select **Edit**.
4. Enable **password protection for this directory**.
5. Enter a name for the protected directory and select **Save**.
6. Use the **Create User** field to add a new username and password.
7. Select **Save**.
