## What is ransomware-as-a-service and how is it evolving?

October 27, 2022

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Ransomware attacks are becoming more frequent and costlier—breaches caused by ransomware grew [41 percent in the last year, the average cost of a destructive attack rising to $5.12 milllion](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach). What’s more, [a good chunk](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-as-a-service-is-the-new-big-problem-for-business/#:~:text=Researchers%20at%20cybersecurity%20company%20Group%2DIB%C2%A0have%20detailed%20that%20almost%20two%2Dthirds%20of%20ransomware%20attacks%20analysed%20during%202020%20came%20from%20cyber%20criminals%20operating%20on%20a%20RaaS%20model.) of the cyber criminals doing these attacks operate on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model.

RaaS is not much different, in theory, from the software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, where cloud providers “rent out” their technology to you on a subscription basis—just swap out ‘cloud providers’ with ‘ransomware gangs’ and ‘technology’ with ransomware (and the related crimes involved).

In this post, we’ll talk more about how RaaS works, why it poses a unique threat to businesses, and how small-and-medium-sized (SMBs) businesses can prepare for the next generation of RaaS attacks.

## How does ransomware-as-a-service work?

Don’t get it twisted: RaaS gangs aren’t your run-of-the-mill hackers looking to score a few hundred bucks. We’re talking big, sophisticated businesses with up to a hundred employees—**LockBit, BlackBasta, and AvosLocker** are just a few of the RaaS gangs we cover in our [monthly ransomware review](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2022/10/ransomware-review-september-2022).

“This is run as a business,” says Mark Stockley, Security Evangelist at Malwarebytes. “You’ve got developers, you’ve got managers, you’ve got maybe a couple of levels of people doing the negotiations, things like that. And these gangs have made hundreds of millions of dollars each year in the last few years.”

RaaS gangs like LockBit make money by selling “**RaaS kits**” and other services to groups called affiliates who actually launch the ransomware attacks. In other words, affiliates don’t need crazy technical skills or knowledge to carry out attacks. By working closely with “**Initial Access Brokers**” (IABs), some RaaS gangs can even offer affiliates direct access into a company’s network.

## How ransomware-as-a-service changed the game

Let’s jump back to the year 2015. These were the “good ol’ days” where ransomware attacks were automated and carried out on a much smaller scale.

Here’s how it went: somebody would send you an email with an attachment, you double-clicked on it, and ransomware ran on your machine. You’d be locked out of your machine and would have to pay about $300 in Bitcoin to get it unlocked. Attackers would send out loads of these emails, lots of people would get encrypted, and lots of people would pay them a few hundred bucks. That was the business model in a nutshell.

But then ransomware gangs sniffed out a golden opportunity.
