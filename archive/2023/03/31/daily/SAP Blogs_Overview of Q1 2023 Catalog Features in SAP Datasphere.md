Within this blog post, you will find features that are included in the first SAP Datasphere catalog release. For an overview of SAP Datasphere catalog, check out Mona Walia’s great blog, [Unlock the full potential of your enterprise data with SAP Datasphere Catalog](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/15/unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-enterprise-data-with-sap-datasphere-catalog/), where you can see use cases and a demo of SAP Datasphere catalog.

## **What is SAP Datasphere catalog?**

First let’s define what a catalog is. A catalog is a comprehensive solution that collects and organizes data and metadata to enable business and technical users to make confident data-driven decisions. Catalog improves productivity and efficiency by building trust in enterprise metadata through consistent data quality and governance. For more details on the importance of catalog take a look at my blog, [Why is it Vital to Have a Data Catalog?](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/28/why-is-it-vital-to-have-a-data-catalog/)

SAP's vision is to build a catalog rich with SAP business applications data and provide an open ecosystem to integrate with leading 3rd party catalog vendors to power the business data fabric. I have grouped our SAP Datasphere catalog features into three main buckets:

* Data Discovery & Consumption

* Data Enrichment & Classification

* Administration & Monitoring

### **Data Discovery & Consumption**

Data discovery and consumption helps to locate relevant data, provide insights about the data, enables self-service, supports data democratization, and aids in data governance programs.  With Data Discovery & Consumption you can:

* #### **Search & Filter** – Discover desired data by searching and filtering including the ability to mark favorite assets and terms.  This is important so you can:

  + Easily locate data assets

  + Use the power to narrow down the search results to swiftly locate the necessary and appropriate data for your needs

  + Generate a better and smoother user experience for users in locating the correct data source

  + Quickly use and access your ‘favorites’ without having to retype your search and filter criteria

* #### **View Asset Details, Lineage, & Impact Analysis** – Collection of properties, glossary terms, tags, and lineage information associated to the selected asset to review additional details and gain insights. Gaining additional insights is beneficial for many reasons, a few of those reasons include:

* + Allowing you to determine if the asset is the right one for you and your needs

  + Being able to identify which assets will be impacted by a change, such as, making a schema change

  + Providing users, the ability to trace back the origins of the data – allowing you to answer questions such as, “How did the data get here or in this report?”, “Did the data originate from a trusted source?”

  + Visualizing which assets are consumed in the model

### **Data Enrichment & Classification**

Data enrichment is the process of enhancing existing information by supplementing missing, incomplete data, or incorrect data; while data classification is the process of organizing the data into categories making it easier to locate, sort, and store data for future use. Data Enrichment & Classification also supports KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Data enrichment and classification provides the following capabilities:

* #### **Business Glossary & Terms** – A collection of terms and concepts defined and described in a clear language that all lines of businesses within the organization can understand. This is necessary to:

* + Promote proactive data governance and collaboration

  + Build transparency, consistency, and understanding

  + Comprehend relationships and connections between terms and data assets

  + Increase data literacy

* #### **Tags & Classification** – Organize information more efficiently, improve search results, and provide insights about the data. This is significant in that it will:

* + Enable organizations to organize data assets

  + Clearly label the data to understand exactly what it is and where it is​

  + Improve the data discovery process

  + Helps to identify and manage sensitive data supporting governance and compliance requirements

* #### **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** – KPIs are a quantifiable measure of progress and performance over time for a specific strategic goal. There are many benefits to measuring and tracking the progress of KPIs, such as:

* + Providing targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress, and insights that help people across the organization make better decisions

  + Ensuring teams are supporting the overall goals of the organization

  + Keeping teams aligned: Whether measuring project success or employee performance, KPIs keep teams moving in the same direction

  + Clearly visualizing your successes and failures so you can do more of what’s working and less of what’s not
