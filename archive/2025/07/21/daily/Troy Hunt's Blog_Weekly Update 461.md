# Weekly Update 461

20 July 2025

The Stripe situation is frustrating: by mandating an email address on all invoices, we're providing a channel that sends customer queries directly through to us rather than via [our support portal](https://support.haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com), which already has the answers many people are raising tickets for. It's frustrating because it slows our customers down (they need to wait for us to respond), and it's also frustrating because we have to respond (and we're swamped as it is). I go into more detail in the video but at this stage, it looks like the only way out is to create a do\_not\_email@ alias, which people will inevitably email anyway, and then auto-respond to that with a link to the support portal. C'mon Stripe, fix this thing!
