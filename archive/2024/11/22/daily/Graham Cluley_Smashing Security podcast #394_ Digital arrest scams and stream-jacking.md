In our latest episode we discuss how a woman hid under the bed after scammers told her she was under ‚Äúdigital arrest‚Äù, how hackers are hijacking YouTube channels through malicious sponsorship deals, and how one phone company is turning the tables on fraudsters through deepfake AI.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by computer security veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by special guest Maria Varmazis.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
