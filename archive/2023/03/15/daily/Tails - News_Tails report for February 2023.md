# Highlights

* [@bokonon](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/bokonon) joined our team, as our
  Fundraising Lead. bokonon will help us develop and grow our fundraising
  initiatives, to support the work we do to accomplish our
  [mission](../../contribute/mission/).
* We prepared usability tests planned in Ecuador in March.

# Releases

We [released Tails 5.10 on February 16](../version_5.10/).

As part of our focus on polishing user experience, Tails now asks for
confirmation when starting without unlocking the Persistent Storage. Because we
humans sometimes forget stuff. It's OK :)

Tails 5.10 fixed a few problems introduced in Tails 5.8 in December,
and some more:

* Fixed another case of Persistent Storage not activating.
  ([#19432](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19432))
* Avoid opening the Persistent Storage settings each time after login.
  ([#19410](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19410))
* Solve a possible privilege escalation through a symlink attack.

# Metrics

Tails has been started more than 652 918 times this month. This makes 23 318
boots a day on average.
