Cybersecurity researchers have exposed a previously unknown threat actor known as Water Curse that relies on weaponized GitHub repositories to deliver multi-stage malware.

"The malware enables data exfiltration (including credentials, browser data, and session tokens), remote access, and long-term persistence on infected systems," Trend Micro researchers Jovit Samaniego, Aira Marcelo, Mohamed Fahmy, and Gabriel Nicoleta [said](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/f/water-curse.html) in an analysis published this week.

The "broad and sustained" campaign, first spotted last month, set up repositories offering seemingly innocuous penetration testing utilities, such as SMTP email bomber and Sakura-RAT, but harbored within their Visual Studio project configuration files malicious payloads that are designed to siphon sensitive data.

Water Curse's arsenal incorporates a wide range of tools and programming languages, underscoring their cross-functional development capabilities to target the supply chain with "developer-oriented information stealers that blur the line between red team tooling and active malware distribution."

"Upon execution, the malicious payloads initiated complex multistage infection chains utilizing obfuscated scripts written in Visual Basic Script (VBS) and PowerShell," the researchers said. "These scripts downloaded encrypted archives, extracted Electron-based applications, and performed extensive system reconnaissance."

The attacks are also characterized by the use of anti-debugging techniques, privilege escalation methods, and persistence mechanisms to maintain a long-term foothold on the affected hosts. Also employed are PowerShell scripts to weaken host defenses and inhibit system recovery.

Water Curse has been described as a financially motivated threat actor that's driven by credential theft, session hijacking, and resale of illicit access. As many as 76 GitHub accounts have been linked to the campaign. There is evidence to suggest related activity may have been ongoing all the way back to March 2023.

Leveraging GitHub as a malware distribution point is a tactic that has been adopted by several threat actors in the past. But the use of a network of GitHub accounts to create malicious repositories particularly overlaps with another distribution-as-service (DaaS) offering called the [Stargazers Ghost Network](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/stargazer-goblin-creates-3000-fake.html).

When reached for comment, Check Point Research told The Hacker News that it can "neither deny nor confirm" if these activities are part of the Stargazers Ghost Network given the limited information available. "However, we've noticed that the <PreBuildEvent> attack method has been used in past campaigns distributed by the Stargazers Ghost Network," it said.

The emergence of Water Curse is the latest example of how threat actors are abusing the trust associated with legitimate platforms like GitHub as a delivery channel for malware and stage software supply chain attacks.

"Their repositories include malware, evasion utilities, game cheats, aimbots, cryptocurrency wallet tools, OSINT scrapers, spamming bots, and credential stealers," Trend Micro said. "This reflects a multi-vertical targeting strategy that blends cybercrime with opportunistic monetization."

"Their infrastructure and behavior indicate a focus on stealth, automation, and scalability, with active exfiltration via Telegram and public file-sharing services."

The disclosure comes as multiple campaigns have been observed leveraging the prevalent [ClickFix](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/microsoft-warns-of-clickfix-phishing.html) strategy to deploy various malware families such as [AsyncRAT](https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/fileless-asyncrat-distributed-via-clickfix-technique-targeting-german-speaking-users), [DeerStealer](https://www.esentire.com/blog/dont-get-caught-in-the-headlights-deerstealer-analysis) (via a loader named [Hijack Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/hijack-loader-malware-employs-process.html)), [Filch Stealer](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/filch-stealer-a-new-infostealer-leveraging-old-techniques/), [LightPerlGirl](https://www.todyl.com/blog/threat-advisory-lightperlgirl-malware), and [SectopRAT](https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/a-wretch-client) (also via Hijack Loader).
