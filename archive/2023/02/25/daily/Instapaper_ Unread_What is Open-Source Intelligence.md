# What is Open-Source Intelligence?

Feb 23 2023

OSINT is intelligence produced by collecting and analyzing public information with the purpose of answering a specific intelligence question.

### What is Open-Source Intelligence?

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is defined as intelligence produced by collecting, evaluating and analyzing publicly available information with the purpose of answering a specific intelligence question.

### Information versus Intelligence

It's important to note that information does not equal intelligence. Without giving meaning to the data we collect, open-source findings are considered raw data. It is only once this information is looked at from a critical thinking mindset and analyzed that it becomes intelligence.

For instance, conducting OSINT is not simply saving someone’s Facebook friends list. It’s about finding meaningful information that is applicable to the intelligence question and being able to provide actionable intelligence in support of an investigation. Another way to look at it is to answer, “why does this data matter” and provide meaningful intelligence about the data collected.

#### Open-source information is content that can be found from various sources such as:

• Public Records

• News media

• Libraries

• Social media platforms

• Images, Videos

• Websites

• The Dark web

### Who uses OSINT?

• Government

• Law Enforcement

• Military

• Investigative journalists

• Human rights investigators

• Private Investigators

• Law firms

• Information Security

• Cyber Threat Intelligence

• Pen Testers

• Social Engineers

We all use open-source and probably don't even realize it, but we also use it for different reasons. You might use open-source information to do a credibility check and to find out more about the person selling you something on Facebook marketplace. You may research someone you met on a dating app or before hiring someone for a job.
