## MOVEit discloses THIRD critical vulnerability

June 16, 2023

[Pieter Arntz](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/parntzmalwarebytes-com/)

In chess, the threefold repetition rule states that a player may claim a draw if the same position occurs three times during the game. Whether this means that customers of the popular file transfer utility MOVEit Transfer can ask for their money back remains to be seen, but we do hope it signals the end of the game.

Let’s do a small recap first, because it’s easy to lose track here. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. We will use these CVE numbers where available.

Timeline:

* On May 31, 2023 Progress [released a security bulletin](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-31May2023) about [CVE-2023-34362](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34362), a vulnerability in MOVEIt Transfer that was being actively exploited. At the time [we had a few details](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/update-now-moveit-transfer-vulnerability-actively-exploited/) about how it was being exploited, but not by who.
* Over the next few days it became clear that the Cl0p ransomware group had been testing the vulnerability since July 2021 and decided to deploy it over the Memorial Day weekend. The first victims became known.
* A [second vulnerability was found while new victims were still coming forward](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/06/more-moveit-vulnerabilities-found-while-the-first-one-still-resonates). After the first vulnerability was discovered, MOVEit’s owner Progress Software partnered with third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct further detailed code reviews of the software and found [CVE-2023-35036](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2023-35036). Progress posted a [new bulletin about it](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-CVE-2023-35036-June-9-2023) on June 9, 2023.
* On June 15, 2023, Progress [published](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-15June2023) information about a third critical vulnerability which got listed as [CVE-2023-35708](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-35708) on June 16.

This latest vulnerability could lead to escalated privileges and potential unauthorized access to the environment.

Please note that it is very important to follow the instructions outlined in the [latest advisory](https://community.progress.com/s/article/MOVEit-Transfer-Critical-Vulnerability-15June2023) regarding the order in which the patches need to be applied and based on how many patches have already been applied.

The best advice provided by Progress is probably to disable all HTTP and HTTPs traffic to MOVEit Transfer on ports 80 and 443 to safeguard the environments while a patch is being prepared to address the vulnerabilities and in case even more of them come to the surface.

Meanwhile the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  says it’s providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting their MOVEit applications. Among the probably hundreds of victims are [Payroll provider Zellis who serves British Airways and the BBC](https://therecord.media/bbc-british-airways-hit-by-zellis-zero-day), [oil giant Shell](https://therecord.media/shell-impacted-in-clop-ransomware-attack), several financial services organizations, insurance companies, and many others.
