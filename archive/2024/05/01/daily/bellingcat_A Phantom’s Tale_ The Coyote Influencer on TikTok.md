An alleged coyote holding a walkie talkie crouches by some mangroves. In another video, he speaks to the camera about the fact that [new floating barriers](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/01/texas-border-floating-barrier-fifth-circuit-court-ruling-remove/) deployed in the Rio Bravo/Rio Grande won’t stop him crossing the river.

The only problem – we geolocated this footage to a Marina south of Miami, Florida, almost 2,000 km away from that river on the US-Mexico border.

Bellingcat and our investigative partner the Latin American Center for Investigative Journalism (CLIP) analysed his TikTok account of 150,000 followers which alluded to people smuggling activities via hundreds of videos and posts. Scores of people requested information about being smuggled or working as a smuggler, but we found many of the account’s claims don’t add up. Experts told us the account portrays a cartoonish version of real life smuggling.

Bellingcat contacted the account holder – a man who goes by the name Maldonado- and in an unexpected turn, he claimed to help people cross the US-Mexico border undetected without charging them and without receiving permission from organised crime groups.

But we couldn’t confirm these claims. It was not clear who was really behind the account and whether it acted as a marketplace for smuggling activities or was simply a scam.

Maldonado’s account was banned by TikTok after we contacted them about it.

A TikTok Spokesperson told us:

“We have zero tolerance for content that facilitates human smuggling. We continue to work closely with law enforcement and industry partners to find and remove content of this nature.”

## The Economics of Illegal Migrant Smuggling in Central America

Maldonado’s account stood out from dozens of TikTok accounts that Bellingcat and CLIP reviewed which promoted people smuggling services, depicting a trouble-free journey for people moving through Central America into the US. You can read their investigation [here](https://www.elclip.org/publicidad-redes-sociales-tiktok-facebook-telegram-trafico-migrantes/).

We surveyed approximately 100 advertisements on TikTok offering smuggling services.

The smuggling of Latin American migrants into the United States is a multi million dollar operation. It has been [reported](https://www.unodc.org/documents/toc/factsheets/TOC12_fs_migrantsmuggling_EN_HIRES.pdf) that more than two million migrants were apprehended at the US border in 2022 and 2023.

Depending on the point of origin and package selected, migrants are reportedly charged between USD$[2,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p4TUwPmSAU)–[10,000](https://www.telemundo52.com/noticias/inmigracion/frontera-eeuu-mexico-coyotes-cuanto-cobran/2577947/) to be smuggled into the US.

According to the International Organization for Migration ([OIM](https://rosanjose.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1446/files/documents/2024-02/oim_estudio_perfiles_240221-final-1.pdf)), while a VIP service includes air travel and accommodation in hotels and costs up to USD$60,000, the most basic service includes crossing into the US by inflatable boat, walking, or confined in trucks.

The basic structure of the migrant smuggling networks includes the leader of the smuggling network, followed by the Coyote or Pollero and the Enganchadores.

Coyotes or Polleros guide migrants during the journey – they are in charge of all tasks related to the illegal crossing.

Enganchadores or “recruiters” are responsible for recruiting migrants to make the journey – often people are recruited in person in [transport hubs](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Studies/TOC_Central_America_and_the_Caribbean_english.pdf); but also increasingly online.

Migrants [reportedly](https://apnews.com/article/80291c27b1a9401497128c76f836d971) have to pay a chain of stakeholders which ranges from small local recruiters and smugglers. Drug cartels typically used to charge smugglers a toll fee for each migrant crossing their territories but their active participation in the business is [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/25/us/migrant-smuggling-evolution.html) to be increasing due to the larger number of migrants seeking to cross.

US border states such as Texas have been responsible for [increasing militarisation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/11/17/us-reject-texas-border-militarization) of the US-Mexico border and human rights groups have identified persistent [human rights abuses](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/02/us-mexico-border-human-rights-abuses) by US customs and border police. Bellingcat has previously written about [US nativist militias](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/02/21/borderless-vigilantism-the-nativist-us-militias-entering-mexico/) that have been deploying aggressive anti-immigrant tactics, and have even crossed into Mexican territory during ‘patrols’ .

## The Digital Coyote

Created in February 2023, Maldonado’s account featured hundreds of short clips showing a mixture of people smuggling operations, small aircrafts and semi-trailers.

We reviewed a thousand posts on the account, which started to reveal a pattern.

In some videos Maldonado is featured on camera, he is seen wearing vaguely camouflage clothes often with a walkie talkie and the audio accompanying these clips often involves discussion of smuggling activities. Mixed in with these posts there are personal posts – of horse riding or other activities such as quad biking. Dozens of videos feature people in camouflage walking in the desert, a field or by a river bank. Crucially, none of these videos feature Maldonado on camera.

We identified approximately 50 videos where Maldonado filmed himself sitting near a body of water with a walkie talkie. In some of them he implies the body of water is the Rio Bravo by adding background music or location pins.
