## On Alec Baldwin‚Äôs Shooting

We recently learned that Alec Baldwin is being [charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/19/arts/rust-shooting-charges-alec-baldwin.html) with involuntary manslaughter for his accidental shooting on a movie set. I don‚Äôt know the details of the case, nor the intricacies of the law, but I have a question about movie props.

Why was an actual gun used on the set? And why were actual bullets used on the set? Why wasn‚Äôt it a fake gun: plastic, or metal without a working barrel? Why does it have to fire blanks? Why can‚Äôt everyone just pretend, and let someone add the bang and the muzzle flash in post-production?

Movies are filled with fakery. The [light sabers](https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/97448/how-did-the-original-lightsaber-prop-work%20) in Star Wars weren‚Äôt real; the lighting effects and ‚Äúwooj-wooj‚Äù noises were add afterwards. The [phasers](https://www.thetrekcollective.com/2021/07/original-tos-phaser-and-other-trek.html) in Star Trek weren‚Äôt real either. Jar Jar Binks was 100% computer generated. So were a gazillion ‚Äúprops‚Äù from the Harry Potter movies. Even regular, non-SF non-magical movies have special effects. They‚Äôre easy.

Why are guns different?

EDITED TO ADD (2/14): Hollywood has [procedures](https://www.csatf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/01FIREARMS.pdf) for handling firearms on movie sets. And this [CGI recreation](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11653617/CGI-recreation-shows-exactly-Alex-Baldwin-fatally-shot-cinematographer-set-movie-Rust.html) provides details on how this gun handling failed to meet industry standards.

Because it‚Äôs cheaper.

Live bullets should have never been on set.

As for why they use real guns:

* Blanks produce recoil for the actors to react to. That causes the actors to move differently to when they are trying to simulate the effect of that recoil on an empty gun. The difference is enough for some viewers to notice.
* Real guns with blanks are cheaper than good quality CGI. Rust was never a big budget production like the others you mention and, if you look into details, you‚Äôll find other cost cutting at the expense of safety. Have a read at why a veteran armor, who had long wanted to work on a western, turned down the job: <https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-10-25/prop-master-alec-baldwin-rust-accident-waiting-to-happen>

Hollywood does have procedures for handling firearms on set:
<https://www.csatf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/01FIREARMS.pdf>

They weren‚Äôt followed. The shooting wasn‚Äôt the first time a gun that had been declared cold (empty) had accidentally discharged. The first time was a blank, but that still shouldn‚Äôt have happened. The union camera crew quit over the lack of any investigation into the first accidental discharge, among other complaints, and were replaced by non-union camera crew before the fatal shooting.

Follow the money. Guns are cheap and plentiful in the USA: Why spend more on CGI?

The utter incompetence previously described on that movie set, with (1) people taking the ‚Äúprop‚Äù guns out in the sticks to target shoot, then (2) returning the guns to the armorer and the armorer not clearing the guns properly, is almost unbelievable.

Money: Because the movie company did not have to buy them, but just only had to ask an employee to bring on of their‚Äôs.

Star Wars fan here. Jar Jar Binks was not 100% computer-generated. He was played by a live actor (Ahmed Best) wearing Jar Jar‚Äôs head as a hat (and also some gloves); only the skin was added later with CGI. The lightsabers were quite real ‚Äì they even broke several during the shootings. Only the lightning and sound effects were added with CGI. The phaser shots in Star Trek are purely CGI ‚Äì which is why they look so unrealistic.

What really puzzles me with this case is why the actor is being charged ‚Äì and not, say, the movie director, the person responsible for the props, the safety instructor, etc.?

@Vesselin Bontchev

Alec Baldwin was also the producer of Rust.

The armorer has also been charged.

Don‚Äôt they usually use fake prop guns? Don‚Äôt they usually add flashes in post? Don‚Äôt the avoid actually firing anything at anyone?

Folks on Quora seem to say those things are true.

Money, mostly. But also verisimilitude.

I know how a gun looks when it is held and fired; I‚Äôve held and fired them myself. Faking that with CGI is certainly possible but it requires a much higher degree of accuracy to make it believable for such a familiar object. I don‚Äôt have any real-world experience with lightsabers or phasers (sadly), so it‚Äôs much easier to suspend my disbelief even with bad CGI. See also: uncanny valley

Good CGI costs a lot more, so yeah, it‚Äôs entirely about money.

The Atlantic has an interview with someone who actually handles guns on movie sets:
