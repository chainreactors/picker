Asia In Brief China last week approved rules that will see Beijing issue identity numbers that netizens can use as part of a federated identity scheme that will mean they can use one logon across multiple online services.

China’s government will issue the credential, sometimes referred to as “Cyberspace IDs” or “online numbers”, after citizens provide verifiable identity documents. A “National Network Identity Authentication Public Service Platform” will run the enrolment process and the federated authentication tools that make them usable by third-party services.

Beijing’s aim is to provide a single credential netizens can use to access multiple government and private online services, instead of needing to set up accounts at each. Authorities [assert](https://www.cac.gov.cn/2025-05/23/c_1749711107835487.htm) that doing so will reduce the amount of personal information netizens share online and should therefore improve security across the country.
