The patent examination process is rife with problems. Too often, patent law supports applicants seeking unwarranted monopolies—not the public interest. That’s why we get things like [Amazon’s patent on white-background photography](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/how-amazon-got-a-patent-on-white-background-photography/). This is especially true when it comes to software and so-called “business methods,” a catchall term for patents that are often granted for trivial innovations on well-known concepts, like [financial hedging](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/06/bilski-v-kappos-supreme-court-declines-prohibit).

Fees from patent applicants [pay about 85 percent](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/these-experts-figured-out-why-so-many-bogus-patents-get-approved/) of the budget of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the office very much serves those “customers” who are seeking patents—not the public.

In sum, there’s a very long way to go before the patent examination process becomes fair to the public. However, there are a few ways the process could be changed that we believe would deliver outsized results. That’s why when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) asked for public feedback on how to improve the examination process, we were glad for the opportunity to weigh in with [our comments](https://www.eff.org/files/2023/02/15/pto-p-2022-0025_comments_of_eff_2023-02-01.pdf).
