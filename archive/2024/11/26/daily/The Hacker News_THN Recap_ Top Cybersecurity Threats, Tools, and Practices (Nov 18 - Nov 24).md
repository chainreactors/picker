We hear terms like "state-sponsored attacks" and "critical vulnerabilities" all the time, but what's really going on behind those words? This week's cybersecurity news isn't just about hackers and headlines‚Äîit's about how digital risks shape our lives in ways we might not even realize.

For instance, telecom networks being breached isn't just about stolen data‚Äîit's about power. Hackers are positioning themselves to control the networks we rely on for everything, from making calls to running businesses. And those techy-sounding CVEs? They're not just random numbers; they're like ticking time bombs in the software you use every day, from your phone to your work tools.

These stories aren't just for the experts‚Äîthey're for all of us. They show how easily the digital world we trust can be turned against us. But they also show us the power of staying informed and prepared. Dive into this week's recap, and let's uncover the risks, the solutions, and the small steps we can all take to stay ahead in a world that's moving faster than ever. You don't need to be a cybersecurity pro to care‚Äîjust someone who wants to understand the bigger picture. Let's explore it together!

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**New Liminal Panda Group Goes After the Telecom Sector:** A previously undocumented China-nexus cyber espionage group, Liminal Panda, has orchestrated a series of [targeted cyber attacks on telecom entities](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/china-backed-hackers-leverage-sigtran.html) in South Asia and Africa since 2020. Using sophisticated tools like SIGTRANslator and CordScan, the group exploits weak passwords and telecom protocols to harvest mobile subscriber data, call metadata, and SMS messages. This development coincides with U.S. telecom providers, including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Lumen Technologies, becoming targets of another China-linked hacking group, Salt Typhoon. The U.S. Cyber Command has stated that these efforts aim to establish [footholds in critical U.S. infrastructure](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/chinese-hackers-preparing-conflict-says-us-cyber-official-2024-11-22/) IT networks, potentially preparing for a major clash with the U.S.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Palo Alto Networks Flaws Exploited to Compromise About 2,000 Devices:** The newly disclosed security flaws impacting Palo Alto Networks firewalls ‚Äì CVE-2024-0012 (CVSS score: 9.3) and CVE-2024-9474 (CVSS score: 6.9) ‚Äì have been [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/warning-over-2000-palo-alto-networks.html) to breach roughly 2,000 devices across the world. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and escalate their privileges to perform various malicious actions, including executing arbitrary code. The network security vendor told The Hacker News that the number "represents less than half of one percent of all Palo Alto Networks firewalls deployed globally that remain potentially unpatched." The company also said it had been proactively sharing information since November 8, 2024, urging customers to secure their device management interfaces and mitigate potential threats. The guidance, it added, has been effective in mitigating threat activity to a great extent.
* **5 Alleged Scattered Spider Members Charged:** The U.S. [unsealed charges](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/5-scattered-spider-gang-members.html) against five members of the infamous Scattered Spider cybercrime crew, including a U.K. national, for their role in orchestrating social engineering attacks between September 2021 to April 2023 to steal credentials and siphon funds from cryptocurrency wallets. If convicted, each of the U.S.-based defendants face up to 27 years in prison for all the charges.
* **Ngioweb Botnet Malware Fuels NSOCKS Proxy Service:** The malware known as [Ngioweb](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/ngioweb-botnet-fuels-nsocks-residential.html) has been used to fuel a notorious residential proxy service called NSOCKS, as well as other services such as VN5Socks and Shopsocks5. The attacks primarily target vulnerable IoT devices from various vendors like NETGEAR, Uniview, Reolink, Zyxel, Comtrend, SmartRG, Linear Emerge, Hikvision, and NUUO, using automated scripts in order to deploy the Ngioweb malware.
* **Russian Threat Actors Unleash Attacks Against Central Asia:** A Russian threat activity cluster dubbed [TAG-110](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/russian-hackers-deploy-hatvibe-and.html) has primarily targeted entities in Central Asia, and to a lesser extent East Asia and Europe, as part of a broad campaign that deploys malware known as HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY for information gathering and exfiltration purposes. TAG-110 is assessed to be affiliated with a Russian state-sponsored hacking group called APT28.
* **North Korea's IT Worker Scheme's Chinese Links Uncovered:** A new analysis has revealed that the fake IT consulting firms set up North Korean threat actors to secure jobs at companies in the U.S. and abroad are part of a [broader, active network of front companies](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-front-companies.html) originating from China. In these schemes, the IT workers who land employment under forged identities have been observed funneling their income back to North Korea through the use of online payment services and Chinese bank accounts.
* **Cybercriminals Use Ghost Tap Method for Cash-Out:** A legitimate near-field communication (NFC) research tool called NFCGate is being abused by cybercriminals to [cash out funds](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/ghost-tap-hackers-exploiting-nfcgate-to.html) from victim's bank accounts via point-of-sale (PoS)...
