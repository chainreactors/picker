## Winner, Name that Ware, November 2024

The Ware for November 2024 is the [NLP-16A](https://github.com/cherry-takuan/nlp/tree/master) by [cherry-takuan](https://x.com/cherry_takuan). It’s a bespoke 16-bit CPU made entirely from 74HC00 NAND gates.

Even the D-flip flops are made from NAND gates:

Lots and lots of NAND gates…

I got to meet the maker, who goes by Cherry Takuan, at the [Chiba Institute of Technology](https://www.it-chiba.ac.jp/english/)‘s [75th annual student festival](https://sites.google.com/view/cit-tsudanumasai75th/top). The NLP-16A was on display in a corner of the [Denken](https://x.com/ja1ydu) electronics club (there’s also a rival club at the event, [CITera](https://x.com/citera_info)). I was a little in disbelief at first, but after a bit of hemming and hawing I convinced myself this was in fact a full 16-bit CPU made out of nothing but NAND gates (the I/O card and RAM/ROM are separate). It’s double-cool in that the whole thing is up on [github](https://github.com/cherry-takuan/nlp/tree/master/nlp-16a) (here’s the [schematics](https://github.com/cherry-takuan/nlp/blob/master/nlp-16a/circuit.pdf)) and all the tooling (assembler, demo applications, etc.) are there as well. This was apparently a high school project that grew out of control and he’s now on his 6th year working on it. I wonder if he’d be interested in making a version in SKY130 with [eFabless](https://efabless.com/) or [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/). Could stick with the “entirely NAND gate” theme, even in silicon, because why not?

I love this kind of stuff, and it’s heartening to know there’s still engineering students who have a hankering to build stuff out of nothing but NAND gates and solder — and will take the time to do it, instead of chasing the latest AI-crazed startup idea. In retrospect, I could grow into who I am today only because I cut my teeth on gritty projects like this (although not nearly as ambitious!), back when I was his age.

For example, above is a 48-bit wide VLIW audio DSP I made for a “6.111” lab project when I was an undergraduate at MIT…I “cheated” (compared to cherry-takuan’s all-7400 flex) and used some PLA devices, ROMs, and SRAMs to improve density. Unfortunately it was all breadboards so it was ripped up shortly after the class ended. This potato-quality photo is all I have left of it, but this was all pre-Internet, and about as good as we could do back then to preserve a design for sharing if you were a cash-strapped undergraduate with nothing but disposable film camera (remember those?).

Congrats to Alastair for nailing this one. Email me for your prize!

   The real winner is Cherry Takuan. That is such a neat project.

   This is mind-blowing! A 16-bit CPU entirely made from NAND gates? And the D-flip flops too? So many NAND gates! Cherry Takuan is a genius!

   If anyone is interested in such, well there’s no denying it, crazy projects, then I recommend an advanced calculator built on TTL circuits -> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLzlZc9Xecg&t=959s>
