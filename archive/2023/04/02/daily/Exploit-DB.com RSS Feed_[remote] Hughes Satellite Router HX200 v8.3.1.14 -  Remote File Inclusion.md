Exploit Title: Hughes Satellite Router HX200 v8.3.1.14 -  Remote File Inclusion

Vendor: Hughes Network Systems, LLC
Product web page: https://www.hughes.com
Affected version: HX200 v8.3.1.14
                  HX90 v6.11.0.5
                  HX50L v6.10.0.18
                  HN9460 v8.2.0.48
                  HN7000S v6.9.0.37

Summary: The HX200 is a high-performance satellite router designed to
provide carrier-grade IP services using dynamically assigned high-bandwidth
satellite IP connectivity. The HX200 satellite router provides flexible
Quality of Service (QoS) features that can be tailored to the network
applications at each individual remote router, such as Adaptive Constant
Bit Rate (CBR) bandwidth assignment to deliver high-quality, low jitter
bandwidth for real-time traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or videoconferencing.
With integrated IP features including RIPv1, RIPv2, BGP, DHCP, NAT/PAT,
and DNS Server/Relay functionality, together with a high-performance
satellite modem, the HX200 is a full-featured IP Router with an integrated
high-performance satellite router. The HX200 enables high- performance
IP connectivity for a variety of applications including cellular backhaul,
MPLS extension services, virtual leased line, mobile services and other
high-bandwidth solutions.

Desc: The router contains a cross-frame scripting via remote file inclusion
vulnerability that may potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise
an affected system. This vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated malicious
user to misuse frames, include JS/HTML code and steal sensitive information
from legitimate users of the application.

Tested on: WindWeb/1.0

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://w...
