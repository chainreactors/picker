Today, every unpatched system, leaked password, and overlooked plugin is a doorway for attackers. Supply chains stretch deep into the code we trust, and malware hides not just in shady apps ‚Äî but in job offers, hardware, and cloud services we rely on every day.

Hackers don't need sophisticated exploits anymore. Sometimes, your credentials and a little social engineering are enough.

This week, we trace how simple oversights turn into major breaches ‚Äî and the silent threats most companies still underestimate.

Let's dive in.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**UNC5221 Exploits New Ivanti Flaw to Drop Malware** ‚Äî The China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC5221 [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/critical-ivanti-flaw-actively-exploited.html) a now-patched flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure, CVE-2025-22457 (CVSS score: 9.0), to deliver an in-memory dropper called TRAILBLAZE, a passive backdoor codenamed BRUSHFIRE, and the SPAWN malware suite. The vulnerability was originally patched by Ivanti on February 11, 2025, indicating that the threat actors studied the patch and figured out a way to exploit prior versions to breach unpatched systems. UNC5221 is believed to share overlaps with clusters tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers APT27, Silk Typhoon, and UTA0178.

## Stop AI-Powered Threats and Protect Sensitive Data with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI

Companies need to rethink how they protect their private and public use of AI and how they defend against AI-powered attacks. Traditional firewalls, VPNs, and public-facing IPs expose your attack surface and are no match in the AI era. It's time for a modern approach with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI.](https://thehackernews.uk/replace-legacy-security-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **EncryptHub Unmasked as a Likely Lone Wolf Actor** ‚Äî An up-and-coming threat actor operating under the alias EncryptHub has been [exposed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/microsoft-credits-encrypthub-hacker.html) due to a series of operational security blunders. What distinguishes EncryptHub from other typical cybercriminals is the dichotomy of their online activities ‚Äì while conducting malicious campaigns, the individual simultaneously contributed to legitimate security research, even receiving acknowledgment from the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) last month for discovering and reporting CVE-2025-24061 and CVE-2025-2407. Another interesting aspect of EncryptHub is their use of OpenAI ChatGPT as a "partner in crime," leveraging it for malware development and translation tasks. In some particularly revealing conversations with the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, EncryptHub asked it to evaluate whether he was better suited to be a "black hat or white hat" hacker and if would be better being a "a cool hacker or a malicious researcher," even going to the extent of confessing to his criminal activities and the exploits he had developed. "When people think of cybercriminals, they tend to imagine high-tech, government-backed teams and elite hackers using cutting-edge technology," Outpost24 said. "However, many hackers are normal people who at some point decided to follow a dark path."
* **GitHub Action Supply Chain Traced Back to SpotBugs PAT Theft** ‚Äî The cascading supply chain attack that initially targeted Coinbase before becoming broader in scope to single out users of the "tj-actions/changed-files" GitHub Action has been [traced further back](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/spotbugs-access-token-theft-identified.html) to the theft of a personal access token (PAT) associated with another open-source project called SpotBugs. The origins of the sophisticated breach are slowly coming into focus amid continued investigation, revealing how the initial compromise happened. It has now emerged that the popular static analysis tool, SpotBugs, was compromised in November 2024, using it as a stepping stone to compromise "reviewdog/action-setup," which subsequently led to the infection of "tj-actions/changed-files." This was made possible due to the fact that the maintainer of reviewdog also had access to SpotBugs repositories. The multi-step supply chain attack eventually went on to expose secrets in 218 repositories after the attackers failed in their attempt to breach Coinbase-related projects.
* **Contagious Interviews Adopts ClickFix and Spreads Fake npm Packages** ‚Äî The North Korean threat actors behind the ongoing Contagious Interview campaign have been observed adopting the infamous [ClickFix](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/lazarus-group-targets-job-seekers-with.html) social engineering strategy to deliver a previously undocumented backdoor called GolangGhost. The adversarial collective have also published as many as [11 npm packages](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/north-korean-hackers-deploy-beavertail.html) that deliver the BeaverTail information stealer malware, as well as a new remote access trojan (RAT) loader. The packages were downloaded more than 5,600 times prior to their removal. Meanwhile, North Korean IT workers are [expanding their efforts](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/lazarus-group-targets-job-seekers-with.html) beyond the U.S., and are seeking to fraudulently gain employment with organizations around the world, especially in Europe.
