I wrote [what I thought would be the final blog post of 2024](https://soatok.blog/2024/12/18/the-better-daemons-of-our-profession/) last week, and was looking forward to starting 2025 strong with a blog I’d been drafting since July 2023.

But then, a little after Midnight on Christmas, I received the following unsolicited email from “the muhu team”:

![Gmail screenshot. Arrival time: 12:09 AM on December 25, 2024  Subject line: Greta roasted your repo soatok/minisign-php  The email is signed "Muhu Roast" (return email address: roast@muhu.ai) and the contnets of the email are as follows:  hey Soatok Dreamseeker, we found your work on soatok/minisign-php and ran your commits through our AI to create a holiday audio roast—hilarious and cringe.  check it out: https://muhu.ai/holiday-roast/r/96acaf89-1f09-48cd-84b7-4b4aad3ffb5d.  we got your email from GitHub, but no worries, we're not spamming you. If you like what muhu.ai is about (less explaining, more coding), great. If not, just enjoy the laughs and maybe share it with a friend.  happy holidays, the muhu team](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/muhu-roast-email.png?resize=641%2C447&ssl=1)

Now, a total fucking stranger using “AI” to [“roast” the open source software you thanklessly developed](https://web.archive.org/web/20241226090028/https%3A//www.muhu.ai/holiday-roast/r/96acaf89-1f09-48cd-84b7-4b4aad3ffb5d) might not be the absolute worst of all possible holiday gifts to receive, but it’s *definitely* in the F Tier.

Even worse, it’s a transparent attempt to piggyback off open source developers to viral market their AI product, which purports to [“helps you understand what your developers are doing, **no tech degree required**“](https://web.archive.org/web/20241226094046/https%3A//www.muhu.ai/).

The implied value proposition for this “Muhu.ai” startup is to enable clueless suits to surveil the proles working for them without needing to understand any of the domain expertise their developers have accumulated.

**That sure sounds pretty shit to toss at open source developers, doesn’t it?** Using “AI” to shift even more of the power dynamic away from workers and towards company executives.

This and many other problems with AI are covered quite succinctly in Philosophy Tube’s video on the subject.

One thing you may have noticed missing from that screenshot is an opt-out mechanism. Indeed, there is no such thing on their website, either.

> but no worries, we’re not spamming you.

> Gaslighting from someone that is *definitely* spamming you.

In fact, many webpages that used to be available on their website (such as their security policy page) are no longer available, but still exist in Google’s cache.

That’s at least a little suspicious, right?

Surely I’m not the only one who finds it fascinating that, around the time they pull the trigger on their email marketing campaign to send unsolicited “roasts” to random open source developers, their security information page would stop working.

Yet, it was working recently enough for Google to still have a cached copy of it, as of this writing.

In fact, the muhu.ai website doesn’t have any contact information.

The email, signed simply as “the muhu team”, was [delivered from `104.245.209.201`](https://gist.github.com/soatok/40778b1a6d5518d47a2a872b4d1cee98), an IP address that belongs to `activecampaign.com` (a marketing automation company), which is almost certainly a proverbial haystack.

**Who’s running this ship anyway?**

I’m almost certainly **not** the only open source developer to receive one of these unsolicited “roasts”.

However, as of this writing, there is no discussion about them on Mastodon or Bluesky, which are both popular for open source developers.

At this point, annoyed by this intrusion to my inbox on a family holiday, my curiosity has been thoroughly piqued.

## Who is running muhu.ai?

The only platform where anyone was talking about muhu.ai was Twitter (or, rather, X–the husk of what Twitter once was).

![@jason asks: Tell me about your startup here…   Investors: please feel free to engage with these founders!  @peignoir replies: muhu.ai : understand what your developers are doing (ai translating dev work to biz) with  @teddypejoski](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/muhu-ai-twitter.png?resize=762%2C400&ssl=1)

Indeed, the `@heymuhu` account [only has 1 follower](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/j9sSS) as of the time of this writing: **Franck Nouyrigat**.

![Screenshot showing that @peignoir is the only account following @heymuhu.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/muhu-ai-twitter-3.png?resize=742%2C280&ssl=1)

Although he’s credited by Franck as a co-founder, I’m left to guess Teddy Pejoski didn’t feel like following the account for his own startup?

Despite this, they both have been desperately trying to promote muhu.ai everywhere they can:

![Franck quote-tweets Teddy to promote their "Holliday (sic) ai roaster".](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/muhu-ai-twitter-2.png?resize=742%2C747&ssl=1)
