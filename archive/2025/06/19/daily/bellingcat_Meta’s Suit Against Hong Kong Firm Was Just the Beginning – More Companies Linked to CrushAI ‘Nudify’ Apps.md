# Meta’s Suit Against Hong Kong Firm Was Just the Beginning – More Companies Linked to CrushAI ‘Nudify’ Apps

*Content warning: This story discusses non-consensual deepfake nude imagery.*

On the surface, Crushmate appeared to be one of many [artificial intelligence “girlfriend”](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/13/ai-girlfriend-chatbots) or “companion” apps. Its multiple websites said it specialised in “crafting the AI girl of your dreams”, and on Google and Apple’s app stores, it was described as an “AI chat product designed to provide users with a comprehensive emotional support and communication experience”.

But ads linked to the app on popular social media platforms showed it was offering an entirely different service – making nonconsensual nude images of real women.

Meta announced last week that it was [suing Joy Timeline HK Limited](https://about.fb.com/news/2025/06/taking-action-against-nudify-apps/) (“Joy Timeline”), the Hong Kong-based company it said was behind a group of deepfake “nudifying” apps under “CrushAI”, which include Crushmate. This was following a 404 Media [report in January](https://www.404media.co/instagram-ads-send-this-nudify-site-90-percent-of-its-traffic/) that CrushAI had bought thousands of ads on Instagram and Facebook, using multiple fake Facebook profiles to evade Meta’s moderators.

However, a Bellingcat investigation has uncovered two additional companies in Hong Kong and mainland China – Soul friendship HK Limited (“Soul friendship”) and Wuhan Ruisen Zhuoxin Network Technology Co., Ltd (“Wuhan Ruisen”) – that appear to have links to these apps.

The CrushAI ads showed women, including celebrities and influencers, having their clothes artificially removed using [deepfake technology](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2025/05/07/canadian-pharmacist-linked-to-worlds-most-notorious-deepfake-porn-site/). They led to pages prompting users to upload photos of people and “erase clothes” off them.

404 Media’s report prompted Illinois Senator Dick Durbin to [write to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/RJD%20To%20Meta%20re%20Ads%20for%20Nudify%20Apps.pdf) about CrushAI’s advertising on Meta’s platforms, in a letter pointing out that “the generation and dissemination of nonconsensual, deepfake intimate imagery are acts of abuse and violations of privacy that inflict lasting harm on victims”.

Asked about the two other companies Bellingcat has linked to CrushAI, Meta said it was looking into them and would take action, including legal action, as necessary if it found violations of its policies. The company also said they will continue to take the necessary steps against other advertisers who abuse their platform.

Soul friendship was the listed developer of Crushmate on the Apple App Store, while Wuhan Ruisen filed an application for a US federal trademark related to the Crushmate brand last year. Documents supporting Wuhan Ruisen’s trademark application suggest that the app earned [more than US$45,000](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn98681096&docId=FTK20240803150527&linkId=8#docIndex=7&page=1) in subscriptions between December 2023 and July last year.

The legal filing, which Meta provided to Bellingcat, shows that the social media giant is seeking an injunction to prevent Joy Timeline from placing ads related to nudify apps on its platforms. It is also claiming US$289,200 in damages, including costs it said it incurred for investigating and removing ads for the CrushAI apps, to respond to public and regulators’ queries in relation to the ads and to take enforcement action against Joy Timeline.

The complaint stated that Joy Timeline placed over 87,000 violating ads on Facebook and Instagram as of February this year, mainly targeting users in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and the UK.

In response to Bellingcat’s queries, a Crushmate representative said that the app had permanently shut down but had “very briefly relied on the support of many third-party partners” in the early stages of its business.

On the relationship between CrushAI and Joy Timeline as well as the two other companies the representative said that “since the project has now ended and the team no longer exists, I’m unfortunately unable to verify whether the company you mentioned in your email was one of our former partners”.

Soul friendship, Joy Timeline and Wuhan Ruisen did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their relationships with each other or with CrushAI.

## Joy Timeline

Like other notorious AI nudify apps, CrushAI appears to own multiple websites with the same domain name (“crushmate”) but different extensions such as .site .net .vip and .us. Bellingcat found at least 23 domains that used the Crushmate name, all of which are no longer accessible. These were mostly registered on two days in April and July 2024. We also found other sites with identical homepage layouts and content to Crushmate, with similar domains like “Crushai”, “crushh”, “crrru”, “crushx” and “crush1”.

Using [Domain Tools](http://domaintools.com), we were able to link these sites – and more – through an identical Google Analytics Tag, which is used to track website traffic.

While nearly every one of these websites had their [WHOIS registration info](https://www.domaintools.com/support/what-is-whois-information-and-why-is-it-valuable/) redacted for privacy, one was not, and it was registered to Joy Timeline.

Our search on [Whoxy](https://www.whoxy.com/), a reverse WHOIS search tool, found 158 domains registered publicly to Joy Timeline at the time of publication. Only one carried the Crushmate name, but 28 more had almost identical layouts and also appeared to be deepfake “nudify” apps.
