## Friday Squid Blogging: On Squid Ink

It‚Äôs aimed at children, but it‚Äôs a [good primer](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/oct/10/ask-dr-universe-octopuses-squid-and-cuttlefish-hav/).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven‚Äôt covered.

@ Ted, ALL,

Austrailia might look large and mighty on a map, but for a very long time it‚Äôs population has been tiny in comparison.

However it has sent it‚Äôs boys, men, and more recently women off to fight in others wars, a price that has oft been costly.

So I would look on people not knowing of Australia ‚Äúpunching above it‚Äôs weight‚Äù as being a deliberate removal from others history books, mostly for political reasons.

People should remember an important fact in life,

‚ÄúWe are only taught what others want us to know, it is upto us to go out and learn the truth as best we can.‚Äù

A user interface can enhance national security briefings. Reporting for a new book by a *The New York Times* journalist who covered President Trump was that, while Trump was too impatient to read briefings much, he was engaged by visuals supported by data.

Too-good security as a problem:

‚Äî I wrote someone a confidential report and, at her group‚Äôs office, I left it in her mailbox. In addition to it being in a sealed envelope, I had written it on the back of an obviously outdated event flyer to fool an interloper. I folded the flyer so the flyer side would be the first thing seen coming out of the envelope. But she never saw the report. We thought what happened is that she opened the envelope, saw an obviously outdated event flyer, and threw it away. I think I would have flipped it over, but an interloper might have, too.

‚Äî I wrote my bank account number in code, so no one could read it. Then, I couldn‚Äôt read it.

@Clive, ALL

I didn‚Äôt realize Australia‚Äôs overall population density was on the lower side, but that does make sense considering the size of their land area.

They also have to watch out for those muscle-bound kangaroos and drop bears üôÇ

Israeli‚Äôs former prime minister also made a comment about their country ‚Äúpunching above its weight.‚Äù

> Means we‚Äôre punching a bag two-hundred times above our weight. Not two times, not ten times, and not even a hundred times. Two-hundred times above our weight which means there‚Äôs something here that defies numerical size.

Being Semi-Sarcastic‚Ä¶

If the best you can muster is to challenge a cartoon, speaks far more about you than any challenge you might bring‚Äìduh. In other words, challenging the nature or character of a cartoon can in fact turn the observer into one. Going to write my next thesis on; ‚ÄúThe Didactic Automa of Multi-Dimensional Cartoon Expressions as AI; A Transmogrification of the State via Anthropomorphic Projection onto Cellulose as an Application‚Äù (aka Trumpism). But this work might get in the way of my current study; ‚ÄúProcreation in Patriarchal Systems of Oppression, Giving Meaning to Your Life without the Work‚Äù, Christian Nationalism in Three Easy Pieces. Am I being sarcastic and pedantic? I certainly hope so, but doubt it.

Of course, low-information and slow-brained individuals can often be found circling channels that are not encumbered by principals of science or pesky facts, requiring fewer neuro-synaptic network messages, and they are good with that. Too many calories are required to make the larger active neural networks used in complex analysis, as within the context of wider topical subjects that have some depth to them.

Accusations of being a robot?

Recently, two weeks ago, I received a lengthy query respecting the operation of a utility and perceptions respecting its operation and goals. Having understood that the person writing this letter had made a significant investment in communicating with the utility, I took it upon myself to personally reply the the curious individual. With the care and practice necessary for a equally thoughtful response, I went to work writing a exceptional responsive letter.

Interesting, not long after sending this answer to a series of queries (one where a colleague would/did suggest having a FOIA file prior to any response), the originator of the letter believed that the response received came from an AI-based auto responder. I was elated and shaken, at the same tim...
