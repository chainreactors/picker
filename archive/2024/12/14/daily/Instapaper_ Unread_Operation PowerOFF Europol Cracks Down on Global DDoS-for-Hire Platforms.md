Law enforcement worldwide has delivered a significant blow to cybercriminals with Operation PowerOFF, an international effort led by Europol to dismantle Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)-for-hire platforms. In a coordinated strike involving 15 countries, authorities seized 27 of the most popular ‘booter’ and ‘stresser’ websites, arrested three key administrators, and identified over 300 users for further action.

The crackdown targeted platforms like zdstresser.net, orbitalstress.net, and starkstresser.net, which enabled cybercriminals and hacktivists to overload websites and online services with illegal traffic. Europol [highlighted](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-shuts-down-27-ddos-booters-ahead-of-annual-christmas-attacks), “*The festive season has long been a peak period for hackers to carry out some of their most disruptive DDoS attacks, causing severe financial loss, reputational damage and operational chaos for their victims*.”

This operation aligns with Europol’s strategy to combat both the technical and social dimensions of cybercrime. Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) coordinated the effort by providing analytical support, crypto-tracing expertise, and forensic assistance. The Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), operating from Europol’s headquarters, facilitated real-time information sharing between participating nations.

Authorities arrested three administrators in France and Germany and issued over 250 warning letters to individuals involved in DDoS-for-hire activities. The operation also employed “*knock-and-talks*” and reached out to over 2,000 users via email, emphasizing the legal consequences of engaging in such illicit activities.

DDoS attacks, long a tool of hacktivists like Killnet and Anonymous Sudan, are used for various motives, including economic sabotage and ideological protests. These attacks wreak havoc, causing financial losses and disrupting critical services. Europol explained, “*The motivations for launching such attacks vary, from economic sabotage and financial gain to ideological reasons*.”

Beyond dismantling illegal infrastructure, Operation PowerOFF also focuses on deterrence. Law enforcement launched a targeted online campaign to educate potential offenders about the consequences of DDoS attacks. The campaign employs:

* **Google search ads** targeting individuals searching for DDoS-for-hire tools.
* **YouTube ads** aimed at those watching tutorials on such services.

Europol noted, “*The campaign highlights the consequences of DDoS attacks and will target potential offenders where they are most active: online*.”

This proactive approach, supported by InterCOP and other international networks, aims to discourage would-be offenders from participating in cybercriminal activities.
