updated T-Mobile US said it is "monitoring" an "industry-wide" cyber-espionage campaign against American networks – amid fears Chinese government-backed spies compromised the un-carrier along with various other telecommunications providers.

On Friday, the Wall Street Journal [reported](https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/t-mobile-hacked-in-massive-chinese-breach-of-telecom-networks-4b2d7f92?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1) T-Mo was among those hit in a months-long effort by the Chinese to snoop on high-value intelligence targets via their cellphone communications. China's Salt Typhoon team broke into [Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen Technologies](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/07/verizon_att_lumen_salt_typhoon/), among others, it is reported.

A T-Mobile US spokesperson on Monday did not confirm nor deny it too had fallen victim to Salt Typhoon, telling *The Register* simply: "T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack." Can we take that as a yes?
