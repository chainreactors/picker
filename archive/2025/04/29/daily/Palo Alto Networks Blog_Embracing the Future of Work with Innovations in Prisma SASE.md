We are witnessing a seismic shift in the way we work. The browser has evolved from a simple utility to the central workspace of modern organizations, where employees connect, collaborate and create. From using GenAI tools to accessing business-critical apps, the majority of work now happens in the browser. In fact, employees spend over [85% of their time working in the browser](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/omdia-state-of-workforce-security). This transformation demands a new approach to security, one that is as dynamic and adaptable as today’s workplace.

At the same time, data has exploded in volume, variety, velocity and is hidden everywhere. It’s no longer confined to structured databases. It moves across endpoints, apps, cloud services, GenAI tools and collaboration platforms. Constantly in motion, data is harder than ever to classify, monitor and protect.

Applications have also changed. They are fast-moving, distributed and at the core of business operations. Employees expect seamless access, anytime. Leaders expect resilience. In this environment, disruptions to user experience or business continuity are no longer acceptable. Security must enable, not obstruct.

These trends are deeply interconnected. The browser is the gateway to apps. Apps are conduits to data. And data powers modern business. To secure this ecosystem, organizations need a unified, modern approach – one that protects productivity, ensures resilience and enhances the user experience.

## The Future of Work Can’t Rely on Yesterday’s Security Tools

Given these trends, modern SASE solutions must support the new reality, where the browser is the new perimeter, apps are dynamic, data flows freely and threats evolve.

Yet most organizations still operate with limited visibility and control inside the browser, which is now the primary gateway to GenAI tools like ChatGPT and core SaaS apps like Salesforce. Traditional browsers weren’t designed to defend against the risks introduced by these tools. As a result, the use of GenAI and SaaS apps increases the risk of data exposure.

At the same time, GenAI and cloud collaboration have accelerated data sprawl. Sensitive information is now just a copy-paste, upload or screenshot away from exfiltration. AI adoption is outpacing legacy DLP tools, which struggle to identify sensitive data in unstructured communications, leading to uncertainties, false positives and alert fatigue. Security teams are left navigating fragmented tools with limited context and capacity.

Organizations are also forced to choose between strong security and good user experience. Legacy solutions often route traffic through centralized inspection points, slowing performance and frustrating users. When security disrupts productivity, users find ways around it.

Resilient, user-centric security is no longer optional. Enterprises need solutions that combine airtight protection with seamless access, resilient enough to handle outages, fast enough for modern work and smart enough to secure data wherever it moves.

To protect what matters most, we must rethink how we secure the tools and environments where work happens, starting with a unified approach to securing the browser, the apps and the data.

## Embrace the Future of Work with Groundbreaking Innovations to Prisma SASE

Today, [Palo Alto Networks unveiled new enhancements](/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-bolsters-sase-capabilities-for-modern-workplace) to the industry’s most comprehensive SASE solution, Prisma® SASE, that prepare our customers for the future of work. This includes Prisma Access Browser 2.0, new data security capabilities, improved AI-powered security and much more. These innovations are built to empower users to browse bravely and adopt AI with confidence. Protect sensitive data everywhere and stop the latest, most advanced threats with Precision AI. Furthermore, all of this is built on a cloud-resilient and scalable architecture to ensure operational resiliency and an exceptional user experience.

## Secure the Future of Work with Prisma Access Browser 2.0

[Prisma Access Browser 2.0](/sase/prisma-access-browser), the world’s first SASE-native secure browser, extends the robust security capabilities of Prisma SASE to the browser. This next generation release of Prisma Access Browser ensures your users can safely adopt GenAI and stay protected from the most sophisticated web attacks, all with an amazing user experience.

We’ve also added new security detections powered by Precision AI to prevent browser-based attacks, including last-mile reassembly, browser-in-the-browser phishing attacks and more. To ensure an amazing user experience, we’re delivering improved performance and security to Azure Virtual Desktop applications with VDI reduction. This allows users to launch applications in seconds and benefit from consistent security and unified access to all applications.

In addition to these enhancements, Prisma Access Browser 2.0 introduces secure, frictionless password management with an integrated Password Manager, allowing you to safeguard your credentials. Additionally, new support for mobile devices with Prisma Access Browser Mobile empowers user productivity and secure access to private applications. Finally, the Prisma Access Browser extension offers a seamless on-ramp to Prisma Access Browser, so your users can browse bravely.

John Grady, Principal Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, now part of Omdia said:

> Palo Alto Networks unique approach of integrating its Prisma Access Browser with Prisma SASE, helps organizations extend the same protection from advanced threats, user experience monitoring and GenAI app protection from the network into the browser, ensuring users are protected, efficient and productive.

## Protect All Sensitive Data Everywhere

It is essential to unify data protection across all users, devices and environments to keep pace with the accelerating rise of AI tools, modern threats and the growing complexity of data flows.

New and enhanced data security capabilities allow you to confidently embrace innovation without compromising security. Using models powered by Precision AI, you can classify and perform deep content inspection to accurately identify and secure all sensitive data in your environment. This reduces false positives and uncovers hidden shadow data before it becomes a risk. Additionally, real-time risk mitigation, powered by AI-driven insights, human feedback and dynamic context, enables you to streamline management and automate incident response. It allows security teams to concentrate on high-impact priorities.

## Stop Advanced Threats with Precision AI

Palo Alto Networks has introduced a number of new security capabilities powered by Precision AI to its [Cloud-Delivered Security Services](/network-security/security-subscriptions) (CDSS), stopping new and advanced threats, including those generated by AI. These enhancements help organizations stay ahead of AI-enabled adversaries, as well as the scale, speed and sophistication of their attacks. Furthermore, these capabilities have been extended to the branch through Prisma SD-WAN, securing east-west traffic.
