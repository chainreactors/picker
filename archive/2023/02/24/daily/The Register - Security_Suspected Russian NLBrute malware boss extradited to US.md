A Russian national accused of developing the NLBrute brute-force hacking tool has made his first court appearance this week in Florida over accusations he used the tool to spawn a criminal empire.

Dariy Pankov, also known as "dpxaker," created the NLBrute malware that cracked the Windows credentials of improperly secured Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) systems through the brute-force technique of throwing massive numbers of password guesses at them, according to the US Department of Justice. He was arrested in the country of Georgia four months ago and extradited to the US recently.

Between 2016 and 2019, Pankov allegedly made hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling NLBrute to other miscreants and by allowing some to resell the tool. He also, the documents claim, had a sideline selling stolen login credentials on a dark web marketplace for criminals to use in further attacks.
