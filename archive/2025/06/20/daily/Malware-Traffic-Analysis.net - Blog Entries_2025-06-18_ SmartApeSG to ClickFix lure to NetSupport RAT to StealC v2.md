## NOTES

SMARTAPESG NOTES:

* Originally nicknamed in June 2024, SmartApeSG started as a type of "SocGholish" campaign.
* SmartApeSG and SocGholish both resulted in fake browser update pages that present malware disguised as an update.
* References:

> * <https://www.threatdown.com/blog/smartapesg-06-11-2024/>

* Sometime in late March 2025 or early April 2025, SmartApeSG switched from fake browser updates to ClickFix lures

CLICKFIX NOTES:

* ClickFix is nickname for a social engineering technique that has been increasingly popular since 2024.
* ClickFix is spread through compromised websites or malicious pages linked from emails, social media or other distribution.
* This technique uses clipboard hijacking to deliver malicious commands or script to potential victims.
* ClickFix style pages instruct potential victims to paste malicious content into a Run window or Terminal window.
* The malicious command/script is often (but not always) PowerShell-based and is designed to infect computers with malware.

NETSUPPORT RAT NOTES:

* NetSupport Manager is a legitimate remote control software.
* Criminals use out-of-date or illegal copies of NetSupport Manager software configured as Remote Access Trojans (RAT).
* These malicious packages are commonly referred to as NetSupport RAT.

STEALC V2 NOTES:

* StealC is an info stealer first reported publicly in February 2023 as a variant or copycat of Vidar and Raccoon info stealers
* As early as April 2025, samples of StealC version 2 started appearing in the wild.
