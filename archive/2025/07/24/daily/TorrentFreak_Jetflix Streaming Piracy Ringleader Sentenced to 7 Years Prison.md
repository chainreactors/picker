The founder of illegal streaming service Jetflicks, a platform said to have negatively affected every significant copyright owner of TV shows in the United States, has been sentenced to 84 months in prison. Kristopher Dallmann had pleaded not guilty to several counts including conspiracy, criminal copyright infringement, and money laundering. He received sentences ranging between 12 and 84 months in prison to be served concurrently.

According to his profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristopher-dallmann-769856132), Las Vegas resident Kristopher Dallmann became the CEO of Jetflicks, LLC, in June 2007.

Fueled by pirated content obtained via sites including The Pirate Bay, RARBG, and Nzbplanet, Jetflicks’ operations came to an abrupt halt in 2017 with an FBI raid on Dallmann’s Las Vegas home following a Motion Picture Association investigation.

## Disagreement and the Long Haul to Trial

Dallmann subsequently claimed that FBI agents removed him from the premises at gunpoint, declined his request for a lawyer, and insisted he waived his Miranda rights.

The U.S. Government strongly refuted that version of events. A similar pattern of disagreement, over what at times seemed relatively insignificant details, became a feature of a prolonged and complex legal battle spanning the next seven years.

Indicted by a [grand jury in 2019](https://torrentfreak.com/eight-men-behind-two-us-pirate-streaming-services-charged-by-grand-jury-190828/), a total of eight defendants faced charges of conspiring to violate criminal copyright law.

Disguised as an aviation service, Jetflicks reportedly offered subscribers a library of movies and at one point 183,285 pirated TV episodes; that made it the [largest internet piracy case](https://torrentfreak.com/iptv-lawsuit-with-19tb-of-data-one-ton-of-print-discovery-heads-for-trial-240127/) by volume of infringed works ever to go to trial in the U.S., the Department of Justice said.

## Las Vegas Jury Finds Defendants Guilty

Dallmann and co-defendants Jared Jaurequi, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, and Peter Huber, went on trial at a court in Las Vegas in the summer of 2024.

The court heard that lead defendant Dallmann ran Jetflicks with assistance from Jaurequi and Courson. Garcia was in charge of customer support and also obtained TV show content, while Huber worked at Jetflicks as a programmer.

The jury found all five defendants [guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nv/pr/five-men-convicted-operating-major-illegal-streaming-service) of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement. [Dallmann was also found guilty](https://torrentfreak.com/five-iptv-operators-guilty-of-movie-tv-piracy-leader-faces-48-years-in-prison-240621/) of three additional counts of criminal copyright infringement plus two counts of money laundering by concealment.

A sixth defendant, Jetflicks programmer Yoany Vaillant, went on trial separately after the court severed his case from the others. He worked at Jetflicks for just four-and-a-half months but was [found guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nv/pr/computer-programmer-convicted-helping-run-one-biggest-illegal-television-show-streaming) of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement after a two-week trial last November.

## U.S. Sought 25-30 Year Sentence for Dallmann

Following the convictions in June 2024, the court docket has remained active with over 200 additional entries. As previously reported, this is a very important case for both the U.S. government and the MPA. Not only is Jetflicks the largest case by volume of works infringed, but it’s also the very first illegal streaming case to go to full trial in the United States.

Last year’s convictions would’ve been welcomed, but deterrent sentences were a priority too. Four of the men were told they could receive sentences of up to 60 months in prison.

Group leader Kristopher Dallmann submitted that a sentence of 36 months on each of his felony counts would be reasonable and could run concurrently. However, the government’s Sentencing Guideline proposed a range of 25 to 30 years, prompting Dallmann’s counsel to brand it “[facially absurd](https://torrentfreak.com/iptv-pirate-fights-25-30-years-prison-facially-absurd-u-s-govt-calculations-250530/).”

## Judgment for Dallmann

A judgment signed by U.S. District Judge Richard F. Boulware, II, dated July 18, 2025, confirms that Dallmann was found guilty on six counts in the indictment. They include (Count 1) Conspiracy to Commit Criminal Copyright Infringement and (Counts 2&3) Criminal Copyright Infringement by Reproduction or Distribution.

Dallmann was also found guilty of Criminal Copyright Infringement by Public Performance (Count 4 / 17 U.S. Code § 106(4)), plus Money Laundering and Aiding and Abetting (Counts 13&14), and sentenced as follows;

Total criminal monetary penalties of $375.00 were due immediately. Dallmann is required to surrender for service of sentence on October 17, 2025.

## Previous Convictions

In 2021, Jetflicks programmer Luis Angel Villarino pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison.

Daryl Polo, Jetflicks programmer and later the operator of rival service iStreamitAll, received a [57-month sentence](https://torrentfreak.com/jetflicks-istreamitall-man-sentenced-to-57-months-prison-1m-confiscation-order-210515/) and a $1m forfeiture order after pleading guilty to four counts of criminal copyright infringement and one count of money laundering.

*Update July 24: MPA released the following statement commenting on the sentencing.*

“The MPA is grateful for the work of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and participating law enforcement agencies on this landmark success, which protects the rights of content creators and sends a message to piracy operators around the world about the potential consequences they face.”
