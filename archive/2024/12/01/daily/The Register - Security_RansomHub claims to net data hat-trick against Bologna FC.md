Italian professional football club Bologna FC is allegedly a recent victim of the RansomHub cybercrime gang, according to the group's dark web postings.

The ransomware crims responsible for attacks on organizations including [Planned Parenthood](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/04/planned_parenthood_cybersecurity_incident/) and [Christie's](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/christies_stolen_data_auctioned_off/) – the same crew thought to have picked up LockBit's top talent post-disruption – posted an extensive collection of data it claims came from Bologna's systems.

Among the samples of allegedly stolen data is a document that purports to be manager Vincenzo Italiano's employment contract, which includes details such as his €4.575 million annual remuneration for this season and the next, plus a potential €455,000 bonus for winning the Italian Serie A league.
