# Patch now! New Chrome update for two critical vulnerabilities

Posted: October 30, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Google has [released](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_29.html) an update for its Chrome browser which includes patches for two critical vulnerabilities.

The update brings the Stable channel to versions 130.0.6723.91/.92 for Windows and Mac and 130.0.6723.91 for Linux.

The easiest way to update Chrome is to allow it to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.

To manually get the update, click **Settings > About Chrome**. If there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then all you have to do is restart the browser in order for the update to complete, and for you to be safe from those vulnerabilities.

Chrome is up to date

This update is crucial as it addresses two major security vulnerabilities. Previous Chrome vulnerabilities reported by Apple [turned out](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/09/update-chrome-now-google-patches-critical-vulnerability-which-is-exploited-in-the-wild) to be exploited by a commercial [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) vendor.

## Technical details

One of the vulnerabilities was reported to Google by Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR), which reported the issue on October 23, 2024. This vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2024-10487](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10487), can be used by cybercriminals as a drive-by download. That means that a victim’s device could be compromised just by visiting a malicious website or advertisement.

The vulnerability was found in Dawn, an open source and cross-platform implementation of the [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU)-standard. WebGPU is a JavaScript Application Programming Interface (API) provided by a web browser that enables webpage scripts to use a device’s graphics processing unit (GPU).

In this case, the discovered vulnerability could allow attackers to write data beyond the allocated memory, potentially leading to code execution or system crashes.

The other vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2024-10488](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-10488), was reported by [researcher Cassidy Kim](https://x.com/cassidy6564). That vulnerability in Chrome’s WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) component could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or cause a crash. It could be used for potential data theft or system crashes.
