Today's threat landscape is constantly evolving, and now more than ever, organizations and businesses in every sector have a critical need to consistently produce and maintain secure software. While some verticals - like the finance industry, for example - have been subject to regulatory and compliance requirements for some time, we are seeing a steady increase in attention on cybersecurity best practices at the highest levels of government, with the US, UK, and Australia all shining very recent light on the need for secure development at every stage of the SDLC.

Despite this, attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass even the most advanced protections and defenses. For example, many have shifted their focus from delivering malware to instead compromising APIs, or launching targeted attacks [against a supply chain](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/defending_against_software_supply_chain_attacks_508_1.pdf). And while those high-level incidents are happening with much greater frequency, so too are the more simplistic exploits like cross-site scripting and SQL injection, both of which have been a scourge on cybersecurity defenses for decades. Just [last month](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/woocommerce-vulnerabilities/470996/), a critical SQL injection vulnerability was reported in a WooCommerce WordPress plugin, with a 9.8/10 severity rating.

It's becoming apparent that while cybersecurity platforms and defenses are critical components in defense against modern attacks, what is truly needed is secure code that can be deployed free from vulnerabilities. And that requires a deliberate and committed lift in secure coding standards, actioned by security-aware developers.

Many developers say they are willing to champion security and commit to higher standards of code quality and secure output, but they can't do it alone. We cannot afford to ignore developer needs in the fight against common vulnerabilities, and they need the support of right-fit tools and training, as well as a reworking of the traditional metrics by which they are often judged by their employers and organizations.

## **Why Most Developers Don't Already Prioritize Security**

Coding best practices have continued to evolve over the years, in response to business needs and market trends. In the past, most applications were created using the so-called [waterfall development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) model where software engineers worked to get their code ready to meet an ongoing series of milestones or goals before moving on to the next phase of development. Waterfall tended to support the development of programs that, having met all of the previous milestones along the way, were free from bugs or operational flaws by the time they were ready for the production environment. But by today's standards, it was painfully slow, with sometimes 18 months or more between starting a project and getting to the finish line. And that's not going to fly in most companies these days.

The [agile method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tended to replace Waterfall, putting a much greater emphasis on speed. And this was followed by DevOps, which is built for even more speed by combining development and operations together to ensure that programs are ready for production almost as soon as they clear the final development tweaks.

Putting speed over security, and nearly everything else beyond functionality, was a necessity as the business environment evolved. In a cloud-based world where everyone is online all the time, and mobile transactions by the millions can happen every few seconds, getting software deployed and into the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline as quickly as possible is mission critical for businesses.

It's not that organizations didn't care about security. It's just that in the competitive business environment that exists in most industries, speed was seen as more important. And developers who could match that speed thrived to the point where it became the primary means by which their job performance was judged.

Now that advanced attacks are ramping up so dramatically, deploying vulnerable code is becoming a liability. The preference is once again shifting, with security increasingly becoming the primary focus of software development, with speed a close second. Bolting on security after the fact is not only dangerous, it also slows the process of deploying software. That has led to the rise of the [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/) methodology that attempts to merge speed and security together to help generate secure code, and consider security as a shared responsibility. But developers trained for pure speed can't become functionally security-aware without a lot of support from their organizations.

## **What Developers Need to Truly Make an Impact on Vulnerability Reduction**

The good news is that most developers want to see a shift to secure coding and a reprioritizing of security as part of the development process. In a [comprehensive survey](https://www.securecodewarrior.com/press-releases/secure-code-warrior-survey-finds-86-of-developers-do-not-view-application-security-as-a-top-priority?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=2022-10-q4-developer-security-maturity&utm_content=press-release) conducted by Evans Data of over 1,200 professional developers actively working around ...
