A mobile ad fraud operation dubbed **IconAds** that consisted of 352 Android apps has been disrupted, according to a [new report](https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-alert-iconads/) from HUMAN.

The identified apps were designed to load out-of-context ads on a user's screen and hide their icons from the device home screen launcher, making it harder for victims to remove them, per the company's Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team. The apps have since been removed from the Play Store by Google.

The ad fraud scheme accounted for 1.2 billion bid requests a day, at the height of its activity. The vast majority of IconAds-associated traffic originated from Brazil, Mexico, and the United States.

It's worth noting that IconAds is a variant of a threat that's also [tracked](https://thehackernews.com/2020/10/google-android-malwar.html) by other cybersecurity vendors under the names [HiddenAds](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/these-16-clicker-malware-infected.html) and [Vapor](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/new-ad-fraud-campaign-exploits-331-apps.html), with the malicious apps repeatedly slipping past the Google Play Store [since at least 2019](https://news.drweb.com/show/review/?lng=en&i=13118).

Some of the common characteristics of these apps include the use of obfuscation to conceal device information during network communications, a set naming pattern used for the command-and-control (C2) domains, and its ability to replace the default MAIN/LAUNCHER activity by declaring an alias.

"This means that when the app is installed, the default label name and icon will be displayed, but as soon as the app runs, the activity-alias declared on the manifest will be active and persist even after relaunching the app or rebooting the device," HUMAN said.

This behavior, in turn, causes the apps's name and icon to be hidden from the home screen, preventing easy uninstallation. The end goal of the apps is to load interstitial ads, regardless of which app is active, effectively disrupting user experience.

Some variants of IconAds apps have been found to impersonate the Google Play Store (or using other Google-related application icons and names) instead of concealing them. Clicking on the app redirects the victim to the official app, while the malicious activity is taking place in the background.

Some of the other new additions incorporated into new iterations of the malicious apps are a license check to determine if the application was installed from the Play Store and halt malicious activity if the app was sideloaded to avoid detection during analysis, as well as feature more layers of obfuscation to resist dynamic analysis.

"Many IconAds-associated apps have short shelf lives before being removed from the Play Store," HUMAN researchers said. "With the several evolutions of this threat, researchers expect continued adaptation, with new apps published and new obfuscation techniques added."

The disclosure comes as IAS Threat Lab [exposed](https://go.integralads.com/rs/469-VBI-606/images/AMER_Threat_Lab_Kaleidoscope_Report_IAS.pdf) another "insidiously adaptive" ad fraud operation called Kaleidoscope that resorts to the evil twin technique, wherein "legitimate-looking apps [are] hosted on Google Play as a deceptive façade, while its malicious duplicate counterparts, distributed predominantly through third-party app stores, drive fraudulent ad supply."

Kaleidoscope is an evolution of [Konfety](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/konfety-ad-fraud-uses-250-google-play.html), a similar ad fraud scheme that revolved around apps embedding an advertising framework called CaramelAds SDK. The newly identified apps have since removed references to CaramelAds and included the core functionality into other manipulated SDKs under different names like Leisure, Raccoon, and Adsclub.

The essence of the operation is this: Cybercriminals create two nearly identical versions of the same app, a harmless "decoy twin" available on Google Play and an "evil twin" that's distributed through third-party app stores or fake websites. The "evil twin" app then generates intrusive, unwanted ads to fraudulently earn advertising revenue.

According to [telemetry data](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-threat-report-h1-2025/) from ESET for the period December 2024 to May 2025, Kaleidoscope impacts a large number of Android users across the world, the most affected being Latin America, Türkiye, Egypt, and India due to the popularity of third-party app stores in these regions.

The adware activity kicks in when users unintentionally install the "evil twin" apps, resulting in intrusive ads and degraded device performance. But since the ads are served via the copycat apps, it tricks advertisers into paying the fraudsters for illegitimate ad views.

"The primary monetization strategy in this scheme relies on malicious duplicates distributed through third-party app stores, where a benign app ID is exploited by a malicious counterpart to generate ad impressions and drive revenue," IAS [said](https://integralads.com/insider/ias-threat-lab-fraud-scheme-kaleidoscope/). "The malicious app delivers intrusive out-of-context ads under the guise of the benign app ID in the form of full-screen interstitial images and videos, triggered even without user interaction."
