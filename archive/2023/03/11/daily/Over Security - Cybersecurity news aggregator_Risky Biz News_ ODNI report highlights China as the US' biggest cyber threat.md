The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has [published](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases-2023/item/2364-odni-releases-2023-annual-threat-assessment-of-the-u-s-intelligence-community) this week its yearly threat assessment, a report that aggregates intelligence insights on the US' main adversaries.

The 40-page unclassified report [*[PDF](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/unclassified_2023_ata_report.pdf)*] covers a wide variety of topics ranging from military capabilities to space programs and economic threats. Cyber and influence operations were also included, which we will try to summarize here—in case you don't want to read the whole thing or [watch the hearing](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-worldwide-threats-3).

**China:**

* ODNI views China as "the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to US Government and private-sector networks."
* The US says "China almost certainly is capable of launching cyber attacks that could disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States, including against oil and gas pipelines, and rail systems."
* In the case of a major conflict, the US believes China would "almost certainly consider undertaking aggressive cyber operations" against US critical infrastructure and military assets.
* In terms of current operations, the US says China regularly targets both its own population and foreigners who criticize the regime.
* Other strategic targets include telecommunication firms, providers of managed services, broadly used software, and other targets "rich in follow-on opportunities for intelligence collection, attack, or influence operations."
* In terms of influence operations, "China is attempting to sow doubts about US leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing's influence, particularly in East Asia and the western Pacific, which Beijing views as its sphere of influence."

**Russia:**

* ODNI notes that even if Russia's cyber operations in Ukraine fell short of expectations, Russia still remains a top-tier cyber adversary since it views "cyber disruptions as a foreign policy lever to shape other countries' decisions."
* Currently, the US sees Russia "particularly focused on improving its ability to target critical infrastructure" using cyber, including "underwater cables and industrial control systems."
* In terms of influence operations, ODNI considers Russia to be "one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States."
* To achieve this, ODNI says Russia uses a mix of intelligence services, websites, individuals, and organizations that appear to be independent news sources, and even US media outlets and US politicians.

> "Russia and its influence actors are adept at capitalizing on current events in the United States to push Moscow-friendly positions to Western audiences. Russian officials, including Putin himself, and influence actors routinely inject themselves into contentious US issues, even if that causes the Kremlin to take a public stand on US domestic political matters."

**Iran:**

* As for Iran, ODNI notes the country's "growing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations."
* ODNI notes that most of Iran's attacks appear to be opportunistic but that the Tehran regime has shown a willingness to push back against the US in cyberspace as a way to show strength—as it recently did with a coordinated series of cyberattacks against Albania and Israel.

**North Korea:**

* ODNI sees North Korea's cyber forces as "mature" and fully capable of achieving a wide set of goals. It does not rule out that North Korean hackers can "cause temporary, limited disruptions of some critical infrastructure networks and disrupt business networks in the United States."
* ODNI also confirms previous US IC and UN reports that North Korea is using its military hackers to conduct cryptocurrency heists and use the funds to power its military and WMD programs.

**Other topics:**

* ODNI warns that centralized databases of health and genomic data will become main targets for cyber operations, with China already engaging in such attacks/thefts already.
* The proliferation of spyware and other surveillance tools "will continue to threaten US interests." ODNI says some governments have expanded the use of spyware from law enforcement investigations to going after political rivals, journalists, and dissidents—even if they reside in foreign countries, such as the US.
* ODNI warns that China has shown "willingness to enlist the aid of China-based commercial enterprises to help surveil and censor PRC critics abroad."

### **Breaches and hacks**

**DC Health Link hack:** DC Health Link, the organization that provides health care plans for US House members and staff, has sent out a notification to government officials about a "significant breach." According to *[CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/08/politics/data-breach-us-lawmakers)*, DC Health Link learned of the breach a day after a threat actor started selling the personal data of 170,000 DC Health Link enrollees on an underground hacking forum. *[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/data-breach-hits-lawmakers-staff-capitol-hill-rcna74061)* reported that the FBI confirmed the hack by buying a sample of the hacked data. Hours after the breach got extensive media coverage, the forum topic advertising the stolen data was taken down, although it remains unclear why.

**AT&T breach:** US telecommunications provider AT&T is [notifying customers](https://www.databreaches.net/att-notifying-some-wireless-customers-of-vendor-incident/) of a security breach at one of its vendors that exposed the account information of some users. Only technical CNPI information was exposed. [According to AT&T](https://forums.att.com/conversations/att-mail-features/is-this-cpni-email-a-phishing-scam/64066deaac6ccc24bdf19e05), no personal information was exposed. The breach impacts roughly [9 million customers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/atandt-alerts-9-million-customers-of-data-breach-after-vendor-hack/).

**Tender.fi crypto-heist:** A hacker stole this week more than $1.59 million worth of crypto-assets from DeFi platform Tender.fi after exploiting a vulnerability in the platform's loaning contracts. A day after the hack, Tender.fi said it reached an agreement with the exploiter, who returned the stolen funds and was awarded [62 ETH ($96,500)](https://archive.ph/XZ2rS) as a bug...
