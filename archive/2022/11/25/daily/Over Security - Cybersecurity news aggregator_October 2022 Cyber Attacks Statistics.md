After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/11/10/1-15-october-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/11/22/16-31-october-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of October 2022 where I have collected and analyzed 268 events, a lower value than September, but a value that confirms the growing trend that is characterizing this second half of 2022.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, once again with a percentage stable around 80% (**79.5%**), despite in slight decrease compared to **80.1%** of September. The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** were stable to **9.7%,** in practice the same value of September (**9.6%**). **Hacktivism** showed a light increase to **5-6%** from **5%** from **6.2%**, similarly events motivated by **Cyber Warfare** got a tiny **2.1%** in line with **1.9%** of the previous month.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, with **34.7%** from **31.7%**, ahead (again) of  **Account Takeovers** with **22.8%** (up from **17.4%** of September) and **Targeted Attacks**, up to **8.2%** from **7.8%**. Instead **Vulnerabilities** drop to **6.7%** from **8.5%**.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, down to **16.8%** from **19.6%** of September, ahead of **Healthcare** (that takes the second place with **13.4%** vs. **11.4%** of the previous month) and **Governments** (**12.8%**, slightly up from **11.8%**).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/October-2022-Statistics-IG-R.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
