In the early years of the internet, website administrators had to face off with a burdensome and expensive process to deploy SSL certificates. But today, hundreds of thousands of people have used EFF‚Äôs free [Certbot](https://www.eff.org/pages/certbot) tool to spread¬†that sweet HTTP**S** across the web. Now [almost all internet traffic is encrypted](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/certbot-use-continues-grow), and **everyone** gets a basic level of security. Small actions mean big change when we act together. [Will you support important work like this and give EFF a Year-End Challenge boost?](https://eff.org/r.szpj)

Since 1990, EFF has defended your digital privacy and free speech rights in the courts, through activism, and by making open source privacy tools. This team is committed to watching out for the users no matter what directions technological innovation may take us. And that‚Äôs funded entirely by donations.
