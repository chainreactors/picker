# Spanish spyware startup Mollitiam Industries shuts down

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

12:00 PM PST · February 19, 2025

Mollitiam Industries, a small and little-known Spanish spyware maker, is shutting down.

The startup’s demise [was first reported](https://www.intelligenceonline.com/surveillance--interception/2025/02/07/cumulative-pressures-force-spanish-cyberoffensive-leader-to-close%2C110372862-art) by the intelligence and surveillance trade news website Intelligence Online, which blamed the company’s downfall on financial issues. [Public business records](https://www.northdata.com/Mollitiam%20Industries%20SL%2C%20Toledo/NIF%20B45892627) confirm that the company filed for bankruptcy on January 23.

Unlike [Hacking Team](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking-team/), [NSO Group](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/), and now [Paragon Solutions](https://techcrunch.com/tag/paragon-solutions/), Mollitiam Industries, which is based in Toledo, a town outside of Madrid, Spain, has mostly operated out of public view. In part, secrecy is just a consequence of the nature of the spyware industry: There are a lot of vendors all over the world, and a significant amount of them don’t want any publicity.

Another reason Mollitiam Industries eschews publicity may have less to do with the spyware industry itself, and more to do with the fact that the spyware startup was based in Spain, which doesn’t get a lot of attention from international English-language media outlets, and also because Mollitiam Industries was only ever known to be involved in one scandal in Colombia, another place that can be be underreported in the English-speaking world.

At the time of writing, Mollitiam Industries’ [official website](https://www.mollitiamindustries.com/) is still online. The company did not respond to a request for comment sent to an email address listed on the site. When TechCrunch called a phone number listed on the company’s Google Maps listing, the line was busy. According to [its official LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mollitiamindustries/about/), Mollitiam Industries had between 11 and 50 employees.

In 2021, Mollitiam Industries first caught the attention of English-speaking media. [Wired reported at the time](https://www.wired.com/story/phone-hacking-mollitiam-industries/) that a brochure unintentionally left online by a third party showed the startup developed spyware products called Invisible Man and Night Crawler, which were designed to surreptitiously extract data from target devices, including from messaging apps like Telegram and WhatsApp, activate the device’s cameras and microphone, steal passwords, and log keystrokes.

The year prior, in 2020, [Colombian news magazine Semana reported](https://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/persecucion-espionaje-y-amenazas-a-periodistas-de-la-revista-semana/647890/) that its journalists and its offices had been under physical and digital surveillance by the country’s military intelligence agency, whose agents reportedly intimidated the journalists with threats that included sending them tombstones. The surveillance and intimidation campaign came after the magazine had published investigations into alleged wrongdoing by officers in the military in 2019.

“A cyber-intelligence colonel offered me 50 million pesos [around $15,000 at the time] to introduce a malware (virus) in the computers of Semana journalists and thus be able to access the information,” a source told the magazine.

That malware was apparently developed by Mollitiam Industries, [according to a photo of a contract](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/semana/RGQHCWMDYNF3HGQMGI65VK7MVM.jpg) between the National Army of Colombia (Ejército Nacional de Colombia) and Mollitiam Industries.

The document showed the military agency made an offer of nearly 3 billion pesos (around $900,000 at the time) to acquire a system called “Hombre Invisible” (or Invisible Man). The software was allegedly capable of infecting macOS and Windows devices both remotely, by hiding inside Office documents, and via USB drive. The malware could als...
