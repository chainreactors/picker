# Weekly Update 420

06 October 2024

Ok, the scenery here is *amazing*, but the real story is data breach victim notification. Charlotte and I wanted to do this one together today and chat about some of the things we'd been hearing from government and law enforcement on our travels, and the victim notification angle featured heavily. She reminded me of the trouble even the police have when reaching out to organisations about security issues, often being confronted by lawyers or other company representatives worried about legal reprisals. It's nuts, and if it's hard for the law to get someone's attention, what hope is there for us?!
