## A Flashback to 2019 and 2020: Exploring GAIA IDs

In this blog we explain how you can find a **Google account** using a **phone number**. But first a quick flashback. On [December 3, 2019](https://sector035.nl/articles/getting-a-grasp-on-google-ids) and [May 25, 2020](https://sector035.nl/articles/keeping-a-grip-on-google-ids), [Sector035](https://twitter.com/sector035) published two blogs about conducting research into **GAIA IDs**. A GAIA ID is an abbreviation of”*Google Account and ID Administration*” which is a unique ID of an account on Google. In other words, it is a series of 21 digits that identifies a user when using Google services.

[![Keeping a Grip on GoogleID’s](https://usercontent.one/wp/www.aware-online.com/wp-content/uploads/Keeping-a-Grip-on-GoogleIDs-1024x533.png?media=1755597985 "Keeping a Grip on GoogleID’s")](https://sector035.nl/articles/keeping-a-grip-on-google-ids)

## What can you do with a Google (GAIA) ID?

In the two Sector035 [blogs](https://sector035.nl/articles/keeping-a-grip-on-google-ids) you can read how you can find out the unique ID of the account using a Gmail account. In addition, it is also described how you can find out via the Gmail account **which services** this account is linked to. Consider, for example, services such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps), but also a service such as [MSN](https://www.msn.com). This can provide you with useful information, such as photos and reviews on Google. The [Epieos.com](https://epieos.com/) website has a handy tool that uses the Google IDs (note: this is a third party website!). In this blog we use the ID for another reason: to be able to **link a phone number to an email address** (and vice versa).

## How can I find the Google ID associated with a phone number?

About a month ago, [Bob Engelen](https://twitter.com/bobengelen2) wrote [an very interesting article on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bob-engelen_phone-number-gaia-id-location-activity-7000395165211181056-_X9J?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) about finding a GAIA ID based on a phone number alone. In this article, Bob writes how you can find the **Google ID** of the user in question via the password reset function in the source code. However, the “problem” of this method is that the account under investigation receives a **notification**. This can be a serious OPSEC risk.

## Find the Google ID without leaving traces

Do you want to find out a user’s Google ID via a telephone number **without** the user **being notified**? Then follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Log in to your Gmail account

**First log in** to your fake [Google account](https://accounts.google.com). For example, use a Gmail address or a telephone number. Then **log out**. This seems to lead to better results. Would you rather try it first without being logged in yourself? Then skip this step. Keep in mind that you leave your IP address and other technical data with Google, so use a VPN if necessary and think about your browser and device settings.

### Step 2: Enter the phone number you want to investigate

Go to the login page again and **enter the phone number** whose Google account you want to retrieve. Then click “Next” to continue.

### Step 3: Open the source code

If you see the screen below, open the **source code**. You can do this by, for example, pressing the “Ctrl” key and the “U” key on your keyboard at the same time.

### Step 4: Look for the GAIA ID

Then search the source code for the **GAIA ID**. This is a sequence of 21 digits. You will need this ID in the next step to find out to which **Google user** this ID is linked. Can’t see the ID? This sometimes happens to us too. It seems that the ID is shown when you have logged in yourself (see step 1). Maybe you can also try...
