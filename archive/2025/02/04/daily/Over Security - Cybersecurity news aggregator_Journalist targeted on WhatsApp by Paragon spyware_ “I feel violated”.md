# Journalist targeted on WhatsApp by Paragon spyware: ‘I feel violated’

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

11:22 AM PST · February 3, 2025

On Friday, at 2:48 p.m., Francesco Cancellato received an ominous notification on his cell phone while he was at home near Milan.

“This is a message from WhatsApp,” read the message in Italian, which was obtained by TechCrunch. “In December, WhatsApp interrupted the activities of a spyware company which we believe attacked your device. Our investigations indicate that you may have received a harmful file via WhatsApp and that the spyware may have resulted in accessing your data, including messages saved on the device.”

“We have made changes to prevent this specific attack from happening again. However, your device’s operating system may remain compromised due to the spyware,” continued the message.

Cancellato is the first target to come forward following the disclosure of a hacking campaign carried out using spyware allegedly made by Paragon Solutions, [as WhatsApp claimed on Friday](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/).

At the time, WhatsApp said that the spying campaign targeted around 90 people, including journalists like Cancellato and members of civil society all over the world, including in Europe.

“I feel violated,” Cancellato told TechCrunch. He said that at the beginning he thought the message was a scam or a joke. “You always think somehow that a journalist might be wiretapped or spied on, but you do it more out of your own paranoia and to exorcise the fact that you may be. When someone tells you it’s true, you tend not to believe it, you always tend to think it’s something else.”

Then he said he realized it was real. “You ask yourself, why me? This is the thing, I mean, what did they want from me?”

“That’s the first question, the second question is what did they take from me? Where did they go? What did they do to me? Once they got into my phone, where there is basically my whole life, my vacations, my friendships, my family, my bank passwords, there is everything — my work stuff,” said Cancellato. “And then the third question is who did it?”

Cancellato is the director of [Fanpage.it](http://fanpage.it), an Italian news website that is [known for investigations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops) into corruption, organized crime, the Catholic Church, and [the youth-wing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops) of the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

For that [multi-part investigation](https://www.fanpage.it/backstair/story/gioventu-meloniana-inchiesta-su-giovani-di-fdi/) last year, Fanpage sent reporters undercover to infiltrate the “Gioventù Meloniana,” a group that is part of Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia party, which has ruled Italy since 2022. The investigation showed videos of several party members making racist remarks against Jewish and Black people, chanting N-words and Nazi slogans, and singing about the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini.

Cancellato said he decided to [come out publicly](https://x.com/fcancellato/status/1885424788237082900) because, as a journalist, his job is to report the news. However, he said he didn’t want to speculate who was behind it. At this point, there are a lot of unanswered questions. including whether his phone was indeed hacked or targeted unsuccessfully, what the hackers were after, and who ordered the attack.

WhatsApp said that the hacking campaign was carried out by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli government spyware maker that reportedly sells a product to spy on encrypted apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal, called Graphite, [as Forbes reported in 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/07/29/paragon-is-an-nso-competitor-and-an-american-funded-israeli-surveillance-startup-that-hacks...
