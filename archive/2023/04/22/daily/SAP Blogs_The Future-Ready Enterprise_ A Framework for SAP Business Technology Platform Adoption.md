Recently I joined the [New Zealand SAP User Group Summit in Hamilton New Zealand](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pedro-finger-de-souza_fre-sap-community-activity-7049173054068850688-kPml?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)where I had the opportunity to speak about our ***Future Ready Enterprise*** framework, which is the engagement model that the SAP BTP Customer Success team follows to support our customer`s adoption of SAP Business Technology Platform.

Inspired by the feedbacks and conversations that followed that presentation, I am writing this blog post to create greater awareness of this framework as well as to spark interest in our community to engage on a sustainable adoption path of BTP.

### **The “way of work on BTP”**

Since the launch of BTP in January 2021 most of the discussions about the platform are around its services, capabilities, and use cases, but rarely are the occasions where the actual adoption journey that customers go through is explained. In my role as SAP Customer Success Partner where we engage in the post-sale cycle of BTP, quite often we face questions or comments like “*I know there`s more in the platform than what we are using…”, “Don`t know how to start”,” which skills my team needs to acquire?” etc…*

Partially this overwhelming feeling that “there`s too much out there” comes from the fact that BTP has a broad range of use cases that can be addressed by its 80+ services, it becomes a challenge to stay up-to-date on each of them individually and on the latest innovations.

That can also be understood due to the journey that most of our customers have been through so far, as becoming a “platform customer” demands a change of mindset. Most of our customers have been on a “software customer” journey with SAP for most of the time, where implementation projects are executed to replace an incumbent technology and/or implement new business processes for a specific business area.

As a platform customer, you`ll be supporting this software implementation, dealing with an environment where you need to promote the co-existence of different platforms, and your success won’t be measured by go-lives, but by how scalable and agile you are able to deliver innovation to your business through the successful adoption of the platform services.

### **What is a Future Ready Enterprise?**

The pace of technological change is forcing businesses to rethink how they approach software development and delivery, being able to respond to external factors is a key factor for a business to thrive, and Advances in technology are creating innovation opportunities and reshaping how we interact with our customers, systems, and data.

A resilient business needs a technology foundation that enables them to: *Embrace Change, Operate at Pace and Protect the Core*.

* **Embrace Change** – The old school approach to protecting the core was to resist change, however, business disruptors and the pace of change in technology demand that businesses embrace change or risk of being left behind.

* **Operate at Pace** – In a modern business environment, the need to deliver innovations and improvements at a pace that matches advances in technologies, changes in market conditions and increasing consumer expectations.

* **Protect the Core** – Customers need an architecture that allows them to embrace change and operate at pace while protecting the stability of their core systems. This is achieved by adopting a modern architectural style with microservices and a decoupled architecture

### **FRE Framework**

The **Future Ready Enterprise (FRE)** is our framework for establishing BTP as the foundation of customers’ journey to become an Intelligent Enterprise and encapsulates the capabilities, opportunities, domains, and outcomes that can be achieved through leveraging SAP BTP in your landscape.

The FRE Framework also forms the bedrock of the FRE Engagement Approach which is aimed at helping our customers become future-ready and realize value through increasing the maturity of relevant BTP domains.

Future Ready Enterprise Framework

We aim to support customers to get the most from the SAP Business Technology Platform, by embedding BTP on customers’ governing architecture and strategy artifacts by using a simple and interactive engagement model driven by key stakeholders for each **Technology Domain.**

As part of the framework, a**Maturity Assessment**process supports the identification of current and target maturity levels along different criteria*: Strategy, Architecture Practices, BTP Knowledge, BTP Delivery Capability, Portfolio Success, and IT Operations.*

### **BTP Maturity Model and Assessment**

The FRE engagement approach has been carefully designed to be applied through the mechanism of the BTP maturity model to support the customer’s maturity journey. This is done by assessing the current and future state maturity of the relevant BTP Technology Domains and aligning supporting activities to address the opportunities presented by this gap analysis, thereby increasing BTP maturity and value derived from BTP.

The BTP key stakeholders are usually largely situated within the IT function of an organization and are often Architects responsible for setting the strategy and the selection of supporting technologies and platforms.

Whilst those technical personas often drive key technology decisions, there are also other business stakeholders and senior IT decision makers that can both influence a...
