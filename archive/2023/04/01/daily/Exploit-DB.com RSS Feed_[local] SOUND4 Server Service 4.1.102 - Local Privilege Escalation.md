# Exploit Title: SOUND4 Server Service 4.1.102 - Local Privilege Escalation
# Exploit Author: LiquidWorm

Vendor: SOUND4 Ltd.
Product web page: https://www.sound4.com | https://www.sound4.biz
Affected version: 4.1.102

Summary: SOUND4 Windows Server Service.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'SOUND4 Server' for Windows. This could potentially allow an
authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the
local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected
by the OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed
during application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user's code
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Windows 10 Home 64 bit (build 9200)
           SOUND4 Server v4.1.102
           SOUND4 Remote Control v4.3.17

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined th...
