# AI is getting “creepy good” at geo-guessing

Posted: April 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

If you are worried about revealing your exact location—or if you maybe even fib about it at times—there are some good reasons to worry about what is visible in background photos, because [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) is getting very good at guessing where you are based on the smallest of clues. And that might even include audio clues, if given the right data.

## Geo guessing

Our curiosity was triggered by [this article in TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/you-cant-hide-from-chatgpt-new-viral-ai-challenge-can-geo-locate-you-from-almost-any-photo-we-tried-it-and-its-wild-and-worrisome) claiming that [ChatGPT o3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/) can geo-guess your location from almost any photo. So, we decided to do some tests and removed the [metadata](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2013/06/revisiting-geolocation-metadata-in-our-toys) from a few selected photographs that I took myself and never published anywhere (for quality reasons, obviously).

Metadata can include technical details like camera settings, date and time, location, and descriptive information like captions or keywords. And we wanted to test the AI’s capability on the picture itself—not on additional data included in the file. I also used a [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn) so I didn’t give away my current location.

We started with an easy one. A landmark in a relatively large city, but from a strange perspective. The picture was part of a selfie taken through a window of an office building in Cork.

![view over Cork, Ireland from an office building](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/20160713_092531.jpg?w=1024)

view over Cork, Ireland

It was no real surprise that [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security) got this right.

> “Alright, let’s break this one down — this does have some standout features that make it easier to geo-locate. Here’s the reasoning step by step:”

---

> **🧱 Architectural Clues:**
>
> * The old stone building in the foreground has **Georgian-style windows and masonry**, which are common in parts of the British Isles, especially in **Ireland** and **the UK**.
> * The clock tower in the back-left with the **green copper dome** is particularly distinctive and often used in civic buildings in Ireland.
> * The **mix of historical and modern buildings**, with the newer glass-fronted offices across a small river or canal, suggests urban regeneration in a historically rich city.

---

> **🌉 Infrastructure and Environment:**
>
> * The modern bridge with a **blue banner advertisement** and the **tree-lined waterfront** hints at a city that integrates riverways into its urban design.
> * The road signs and general driving direction suggest **left-hand traffic**, supporting a guess of **Ireland or the UK**.

---

> **🏛** **Key Landmark:**
>
> The building with the green dome in the background looks **very much like the clock tower of Cork City Hall in Ireland**. The angle of the shot shows the old Custom House building in front, and the modern offices across the **River Lee**, which runs through Cork.

This was spot on. But sure...
