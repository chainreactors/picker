The latest Gcore Radar report analyzing attack data from Q1–Q2 2025, reveals a 41% year-on-year increase in total attack volume. The largest attack peaked at 2.2 Tbps, surpassing the 2 Tbps record in late 2024. Attacks are growing not only in scale but in sophistication, with longer durations, multi-layered strategies, and a shift in target industries. Technology now overtakes gaming as the most attacked sector, while the financial services industry continues to face heightened risks.

### **Key takeaways: the evolving DDoS landscape**

Here are five key insights from the Q1–Q2 2025 Gcore Radar report:

1. **Attack volumes are rising.** Total attacks climbed from **969,000 in H2 2024 to 1.17 million** in H1 2025, a 21% increase over the previous two quarters and 41% YoY growth.
2. **Attack size continues to grow.** The peak attack of 2.2 Tbps demonstrates the increasing scale and destructive potential of modern DDoS campaigns.
3. **Attacks are becoming longer and more sophisticated.** Extended durations and multi-layered tactics allow threat actors to bypass defenses and maximize disruption.
4. **The industries targeted are shifting.** Technology overtakes gaming as the top target, while financial services is being increasingly targeted.
5. **Application-layer attacks are on the rise.** Multi-vector assaults targeting web applications and APIs now account for 38% of total attacks, up from 28% in Q3–Q4 2024.

### **DDoS attack frequency has surged**

Gcore Radar highlights a continued upward trajectory in DDoS activity. Compared to H2 2024, attack volumes rose **21%**, while YoY growth reached **41%**, underscoring a long-term escalation trend. Several factors contribute to this rise:

* **Accessible attack tools:** Cheap DDoS-for-hire services empower more threat actors.
* **Vulnerable IoT devices:** Unsecured devices are hijacked into large-scale botnets, amplifying attack volumes.
* **Geopolitical and economic tensions:** Global instability drives more frequent and targeted attacks.
* **Advanced attack techniques:** Multi-vector and application-layer attacks increase both complexity and impact.

### **The largest attack reached 2.2 Tbps**

The peak assault in Q1–Q2 2025 hit **2.2 Tbps**, surpassing late 2024's 2 Tbps attack. While attacks exceeding 1 Tbps remain rare, their frequency is rising, highlighting attackers' growing ambition to overwhelm networks, applications, and services. Even smaller attacks can incapacitate unprotected systems.

### **Industries targeted are shifting**

**Technology** now represents **30% of all DDoS attacks**, overtaking gaming (19%). Hosting providers supporting SaaS, e-commerce, gaming, and financial clients are particularly vulnerable, as a single attack can trigger ripple effects across multiple dependent businesses.

**Financial services** account for 21% of attacks. Banks and payment systems are prime targets due to high disruption potential, regulatory sensitivity, and ransomware risk.

**Gaming** continues to face significant threats, but improved defenses and strategic attacker shifts reduced its share from 34% in H2 2024 to 19% in H1 2025. Key drivers of ongoing attacks include competitive advantage and revenue impact.

**Telecommunications** now make up 13% of attacks, reflecting their role as critical internet infrastructure.

**Media, entertainment, and retail** see more moderate attack levels, with media at 10% and retail at 5–6%.

### **Attack duration and tactics**

Recent data shows a **shift toward longer, more sustained assaults**. Attacks under 10 minutes decreased by roughly 33%, while 10–30 minute attacks nearly quadrupled. Maximum attack duration slightly decreased, from five hours to three, indicating a focus on **concentrated, high-impact campaigns**.

**Short bursts remain preferred.** Despite longer attacks gaining prevalence, brief attacks remain highly disruptive, evading automated defenses and often serving as smokescreens for multi-stage cyberattacks.
