### Ever wondered how attackers can compromise modern websites by exploiting invisible cracks in HTTP infrastructure to win big bounties?

In [his latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjPFjd8GJWY&t=56s), NahamSec walks through the basics of request smuggling with James Kettle, Director of Research at PortSwigger. Take a look as the pair dive deep into the world of [HTTP Request Smuggling](/web-security/request-smuggling), a class of vulnerabilities that still haunts web stacks nearly two decades after it first surfaced.

## What can I learn?

James breaks down how differences in the way front-end and back-end servers interpret HTTP headers can allow malicious requests to sneak past security defenses, hijack sessions, poison caches, and even compromise entire systems.

[The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjPFjd8GJWY&t=56s) also covers cutting-edge techniques involving HTTP/2 downgrades, browser-powered desync, and real-world case studies impacting major platforms like Netflix and Atlassian.

Whether you're a pentester, developer, or AppSec pro, this is a [must-watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjPFjd8GJWY&t=56s) to understand one of the web’s most underestimated risks.

[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjPFjd8GJWY&t=56s).

## Ready to learn even more about HTTP request smuggling?

On 6 August, James Kettle will be releasing groundbreaking new research uncovering new desync attacks at Black Hat USA, unveiling how HTTP/1.1 Must Die.

Keep up to date with this new release, learn how lucrative this can be for a bug hunter, and join the movement over at [http1mustdie.com](http://http1mustdie.com).

## Can I chat with other bug hunters getting started with request smuggling?

Absolutely! There’s a thriving community of testers, bug hunters, students, and AppSec professionals on the [PortSwigger Discord](https://discord.com/invite/portswigger).
