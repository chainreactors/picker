Entering in duplicate data, correcting information before it flows to another part of the process, chasing information from users. Sound familiar? If so, business rules may be the remedy for you!

Many customers are using business rules to improve data integrity and create more efficient processes. Over the years, we have witnessed many clever, creative, and impactful ways to automate, propagate, validate, calculate, and default data in the system.

Are there times when it would be nice to warn a user to enter data, or provide a pop-up message as someone is completing a form, such as the requisition template?  Good news, business rules can help you accomplish this!

Deana Janowsksy, SAP’s IT Application Senior Consultant for Recruiting, shared “if something is repeatable and reliable - then it is a use case for a business rule.” An example of how SAP uses business rules in SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting was by adding a pop-up message to the requisition template. With the recent salary transparency on job descriptions needed in some US states, a prompt was needed to remind recruiters that an extra step was needed before posting requisitions. Adding a business rule with a pop-up message informing the recruiter about the action that they need to take has reduced mistakes and rework by 50%.

Deana’s advice is to keep things simple. Is there a repetitive task that your users may be entering, or a field that needs duplicate data?  Explore creating a business rule. Are there times when you need users to take an extra action or remind them of something in the process? Explore creating a business rule.
