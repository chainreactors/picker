# Beware of Zelle transfer scams

Posted: September 22, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

As we have said many times before, falling for a scam can happen to the best of us. And it can [ruin lives](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2025/09/from-fitbit-to-financial-despair-how-one-woman-lost-her-life-savings-and-more-to-a-scammer). In our podcast [How a scam hunter got scammed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2025/08/how-a-scam-hunter-got-scammed-lock-and-code-s06e17), scam hunter Julie-Anne Kearns talked about how she had been duped by people pretending to be from HMRC, which is the UK’s version of the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

This week in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/zelle-chase-banking-scam.html) crime reporter Michael Wilson, who has covered many scams during his career, almost fell for a scam that used a spoofed telephone number from Chase Bank. Michael’s story sounded vaguely familiar to us because we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/bank-fraud-scammers-trick-victims-with-claims-of-bogus-zelle-transfers) about something similar back in 2022.

The scam is a prime example of how social engineering is used to talk victims out of their money.

Michael received a call, seemingly from a Chase bank branch. The caller even invited him to Google the number and pointed out which branch he was “calling from.” The scammer claimed that fraudulent Zelle transfers had been made to and from a bank account in his name, even though Michael had never opened an account with Chase.

The initial scammer gave Michael a case number and put him through to “his supervisor.” This man asked Michael to open Zelle.

Zelle is a popular US peer-to-peer payment service that allows users to send and receive money quickly and securely directly from their bank accounts using just an email address or mobile phone number.

Where it says, “Enter an amount,” the “supervisor” instructed him to type $2,100, the amount of the withdrawals he said he was going to help reverse. In another field the scammer wanted Michael to enter the 10 digits of the case number. This triggered Michael’s spidey senses—it looked suspiciously like a phone number:

> “This case number sure looks like a phone number, and I’m about to send that number $2,100.”

![Zelle form. Receiver can be email address or telephone number](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/form.jpg)

At that point the scammer gave him a 19 character code to put in the “What’s this for?” field, telling Michael it was needed for his team to be able to reverse the transaction.

But that didn’t calm down the spidey senses and Michael asked the question that will scare most scammers away. He proposed to meet in person and settle this. The scammer tried to persuade him by saying it might be too late by then, but Michael persisted and said he’d call back.

Only then did he realize the scammers had him on the hook for 16 minutes before he managed to break free.

> “I should be able to spot a scam in under 16 seconds, I thought — but 16 minutes?”

Michael found that several others had been approached in the very same way. The “supervisor” is an element that provides legitimacy to the call and makes people feel like they’re talking to actual bank employees.

And once they have you filling out forms and writing down long codes, they have turned you from a critical t...
