Why do SOC teams still drown in alerts even after spending big on security tools? False positives pile up, stealthy threats slip through, and critical incidents get buried in the noise. Top CISOs have realized the solution isn't adding more and more tools to SOC workflows but giving analysts the speed and visibility they need to catch real attacks before they cause damage.

Here's how they're breaking the cycle and turning their SOCs into true threat-stopping machines.

## Starting with Live, Interactive Threat Analysis

The first step to staying ahead of attackers is seeing threats as they happen. Static scans and delayed reports just can't keep up with modern, evasive malware. Interactive sandboxes like ANY.RUN let analysts detonate suspicious files, URLs, and QR codes in a **fully isolated, safe environment** and actually **interact with the sample in real time**.

Why CISOs give access to interactive sandboxes:

* Analysts can click links, open files, and mimic real user actions to trigger hidden payloads that traditional scanners miss.
* They get full visibility into execution flow, dropped files, network connections, and related TTPs in seconds.
* Immediate IOC extraction means teams can respond faster and block similar threats before they spread.

Check this real case of phishing attack analyzed inside ANY.RUN's interactive sandbox.

| Full phishing attack chain analyzed inside interactive sandbox in real time |

A phishing attack with a malicious QR code was fully analyzed in under one minute inside ANY.RUN. Analysts were able to watch the entire attack chain unfold, collect IOCs, and map behaviors to MITRE TTPs, all without leaving the sandbox. What once took hours of manual work now takes minutes, saving the team time and helping prevent repeat attacks.

Give your analysts the speed, automation, and clarity they need with the ANY.RUN sandbox, trusted by CISOs to drive faster, smarter threat response.

## Automating Triage to Speed Up Response and Reduce Workload

Modern SOCs are turning to **automation** for one simple reason: it removes the slow, repetitive tasks that hold teams back. By automating triage, SOCs gain several key benefits:

* **Faster investigations → faster incident response:** Automated workflows shorten the time between alert and action.
* **Reduced human error:** Machines handle routine steps consistently, so nothing gets overlooked.
* **Confidence for junior analysts:** Automation handles the tricky parts, so new team members can contribute without constantly relying on seniors.
* **Focus for senior specialists:** Freed from repetitive work, they can spend time on advanced threats, hunting, or improving detection rules.
* **Higher SOC efficiency overall:** Less fatigue, more accurate findings, and faster MTTR (Mean Time to Respond).

The QR code phishing attack mentioned earlier is a perfect example of how **Automated Interactivity** in ANY.RUN changes the game. In this real case, the malicious URL was buried behind a QR code and protected by a CAPTCHA.

| Phishing attack with QR code exposed with the help of automation, saving time and resources |

Normally, an analyst would have to manually scan the code, open the link in a safe browser, pass the CAPTCHA, and then try to trigger the hidden payload; a tedious and error‑prone process.

With **automation enabled**, the sandbox handled everything on its own: it opened the hidden URL, passed the CAPTCHA, and exposed the malicious process in seconds.

| Malicious URL revealed inside ANY.RUN sandbox |

Analysts didn't have to wait for the analysis to finish; they could **interact with the sample live at any stage**, clicking through processes, opening files, or triggering additional behaviors in a fully safe environment.

This dual approach, **automation plus interactivity,** means your SOC saves time on tedious tasks while still giving analysts complete control. Routine steps no longer drain resources, junior staff can contribute confidently, and investigations move faster, leading to quicker containment and a stronger overall security posture.
