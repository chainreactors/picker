### A guide to finding the right endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution for your business' unique needs.

Cybersecurity has become an ongoing battle between hackers and small- and mid-sized businesses. Though perimeter security measures like antivirus and firewalls have traditionally served as the frontlines of defense, the battleground has shifted to endpoints. This is why endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions now serve as critical weapons in the fight, empowering you and your organization to detect known and unknown threats, respond to them quickly, and extend the cybersecurity fight across all phases of an attack.

With the growing need to defend your devices from today's cyber threats, however, choosing the right EDR solution can be a daunting task. There are so many options and features to choose from, and not all EDR solutions are made with everyday businesses and IT teams in mind. So how do you pick the best solution for your needs?

## **Why EDR Is a Must**

Because of its ability to monitor for and alert you to malicious activity, EDR solutions can be one of the most powerful tools in your cybersecurity arsenal.

[EDR is an endpoint security solution](https://hubs.ly/Q02wytZy0) designed to detect even the most subtle cyber threats and allow teams to respond to them more quickly. It provides unparalleled visibility and detection capabilities across endpoints, which means it can often catch threats that perimeter security measures—like antivirus and firewalls—might miss.

Typically, EDR solutions should have the ability to track and analyze endpoint activity and enable analysts to respond when suspicious activity is detected. Along with this functionality, a modern and effective EDR solution can bring many advantages, including:

* Increased visibility into endpoint activity, all the way down to a granular level that makes it extremely hard for hackers to hide.
* Protection against known and unknown threats, like zero-day vulnerabilities or threats that can bypass signature-based detection.
* Deeper threat intelligence and analysis, providing in-depth context for all threat activity, attack chains, and attack timelines—leading to clear, targeted response actions.
* Faster incident response that can help minimize the potential impact of threats.
* Adherence to many of today's insurance and regulatory compliance requirements.

## **How EDR Works**

Simply put, EDR solutions capture the relevant events occurring on every endpoint it's installed on. Every login. Every running process. Every bootup and shutdown. It's all monitored and logged to provide a full picture of what's happening at the endpoint level.

That granularity also helps create a baseline of expected endpoint activity. And from that baseline, security analysts or machine learning algorithms can help determine what's "normal" behavior for your organization and what appears to be "abnormal."

For example, if one of your employees opens [a phishing email](https://www.huntress.com/blog/5-phishing-email-scams-and-how-not-to-fall-for-them?utm_campaign=CY24-Q1-CAMP-ExpertiseIncluded-EDR&utm_source=hackers-news&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=10-may-2024-article-edr-buyers-guide) and downloads an attached document, and that document runs a malicious program, EDR will step in to flag that behavior and automatically generate an alert to let your team know that something's wrong.

EDR solutions heavily rely on data collection, which gives analysts a lot of helpful context like who, what, where, when, and how an attack may have occurred. Depending on configuration, some EDR solutions have the ability to isolate host machines when malicious activity is detected to prevent lateral movement throughout the network.

That's really what sets EDR apart from antivirus solutions and why it's a complementary layer in any security stack. EDR technology can analyze billions of events in real time—including comparing indicators of compromise (IOCs), scanning for known threats using traditional malware signatures, and using behavioral detections for threats that might be unknown. And, of course, EDR solutions offer the critical ability of enabling threat response.

Keep in mind, however, while EDRs excel at flagging potential threat actor activity and quickly alerting it, they're not a "set it and forget it" kind of tool. EDR solutions require consistent tuning and close management by security analysts to investigate alerts and verify real threats from false positives.

## **How to Evaluate Your EDR Needs**

Whether it's your first time venturing into EDRs or you're looking for a better-fitting solution, asking the right questions can point you in the right direction. Here's what you should consider as you go through your evaluation process.

#### **Determine Your Organization's Needs:**

* What kind of threats am I most concerned about?
* Do I have a large number of endpoint devices to manage?
* Will EDR replace or complement my existing endpoint security investments?
* How much expertise or time can I commit to operationalizing an EDR?
* What level of support do I need from my EDR solution or vendor?

#### **Determine Your Technical Needs:**

* How effective is the solution at detecting the threats I'm most concerned about?
* Do I have a process or workflow to continuously review, tune, and maintain detection rules?
* What operating systems does the solution support?
* What does the agent update process look like?
* Will the solution have any noticeable impact on my endpoint devices?
* What's the dep...
