I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

This is a cryptography blog and I always feel the need to apologize for any post that isn’t “straight cryptography.” I’m actually getting a little tired of apologizing for it (though if you want some hard-core cryptography content, there’s plenty [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/04/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-1/) and [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/10/06/to-schnorr-and-beyond-part-1/).)

Sometimes I have to remind my colleagues that out in the real world, our job is not to solve exciting mathematical problems: *it’s to help people communicate securely*. And people, at this very moment, need a lot of help. Many of my friends are Federal employees or work for contractors, and they’re terrified that they’re going to lose their job based on speech they post online. Unfortunately, “online” to many people includes thoughts sent over private text messages — so even private conversations are becoming chilled. And while this is hardly the worst thing happening to people in this world, it’s something that’s happening to my friends and neighbors.

(And just in case you think this is partisan: many of the folks I’m talking about are Republicans, and some are military veterans who work for the agencies that keep Americans safe. They’re afraid for their jobs and their kids, and that stuff transcends politics.)

So let me get to the point of this relatively short post.

### Apple iMessage is encrypted, but is it “secure”?

A huge majority of my “normie” friends are iPhone users, and while some have started downloading Signal app (and you should too!) — many of them favor one communications protocol: [Apple iMessage](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=apple+imessage). This is mostly because iMessage is just the built-in messaging app used on Apple phones. If you don’t know the branding, all you need to know is that iMessage is “blue bubbles” you get when talking to other Apple users.

Apple [boasts](https://www.cyberdaily.au/tech/10217-apple-s-imessage-gets-post-quantum-end-to-end-encryption) that the iMessage app [encrypts your messages end-to-end, and that it has done so since 2011](https://staringatphones.com/2015/07/26/a-brief-history-of-imessage/). This means that all your messages and attachments are encrypted under keys that Apple does not know*.* The company has been extremely consistent about this, discusses it in their [platform security guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web), and in recent years they’ve even extended their protocol to provide [post-quantum security.](https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/) (A few years ago my students and I [found a bug in the protocol](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/), but Apple fixed it quickly — so I am very personally confident in their encryption.)

This is nice. And it’s all true.

But encryption *in tra...
