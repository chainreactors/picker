# Free Threat Modeling Training for Displaced Federal Workers

Free training for displaced government employees
![An AI image for the post](/images/blog/img/2025/threat-modeling-training-1000w.png)

US Government employees (and former employees) are going through a lot of chaos. Many of our colleagues, collaborators, and friends are out of work — suddenly and unexpectedly.

At Shostack + Associates, we can’t fix that. But we can offer something concrete.

In times of uncertainty, we focus on what we know, and what we know is threat modeling and how to teach it. It’s what we do best, and it’s how we can help.

We’re opening a free instance of our Threat Modeling Intensive
course — a $3,900 value — no strings attached. This will be a
distributed, live instruction instance of the course **for people
whose government jobs have gone**. The course is designed for
technologists who have at least a couple years of experience as a
software developer, systems operator or technical project manager,
and have shipped one or more systems.

This is the full version of our most popular training. It’s practical, focused, and designed to
help you move into a new role with in-demand skills. It’s
interactive and hands on. You’ll be threat modeling and
collaborating to get peer feedback and review. Complete the work and you'll finish the week with new capabilities and a course completion certificate.

The course runs the week of July 7. We
don’t want to cap attendance, but our training is interactive, so
we need to use the Zoom meeting and that leads to
participation limits. So if you sign up, please do so with a plan to attend and
participate. If you’ve lost your job — sign
up. We’ll cover the full cost. You bring your attention and drive,
and you can sign up at our [Google form](https://forms.gle/sX5auhseej594mmX8). Also, you can learn
more about the course on our general [Threat Modeling Intensive Course](https://courses.shostack.org/pages/intensive-222) page.

In the spirit of transparency, there’s something in this for us
too: one of our major customers is planning a large-scale course,
and we want to experiment and see if there’s limits to how many
folks we can teach effectively. We're confident in our
approach. We believe that our mix of hands-on, small peer group
discussions and larger full class discussions can scale. And we
love experimentation and learning.

Please share this with anyone you know who’s been impacted. We’ll
do our best to make this useful, relevant, and hopefully a step
towards something new.

PS: If this sounds good but you’re not an impacted government
employee, we have upcoming open trainings Blackhat ([Aug 2-3](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/training/schedule/#adam-shostacks-threat-modeling-intensive-44283) or [4-5](https://www.blackhat.com/us-25/training/schedule/#adam-shostacks-threat-modeling-intensive-442831736891193)), as well as
self-pace trainings and private offerings.

Update: Bolded the descriptions of who the course is for and
alternatives after weeding through responses.
