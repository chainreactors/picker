In the **October 2024** survey we received responses from **1,131,068,688** sites across **271,754,817** domains and **13,003,235** web-facing computers. This reflects an increase of 12.0 million sites, 971,957 domains, and 62,565 web-facing computers.

OpenResty experienced the largest gain of 2.2 million sites (+1.98%) this month, increasing its market share to 10.1% (+0.09pp). Cloudflare made the next largest gain of 1.5 million sites (+1.18%).

Apache suffered the largest loss of 2.2 million sites (-1.11%) this month. It now accounts for 17.6% (-0.39pp) of sites seen by Netcraft. Microsoft experienced the next largest loss of 699,464 sites (-3.45%).

### Future of the .io TLD

Earlier this month, the UK announced that sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, also known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, [will be transferred to Mauritius](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98ynejg4l5o). This has caused [speculation over the future of the .io TLD](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/io_domain_uk_mauritius/), which has gained popularity amongst tech companies in recent years due to I/O also being an acronym for "input/output". In January 2013, we saw just 4,224 web-facing .io domains, compared to 733,662 domains this month.

Around 17,000 of the [top million busiest sites](https://www.netcraft.com/solutions/other-solutions/internet-data-research/) use the .io TLD, such as NFT platform [OpenSea](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopensea.io), AI audio company [ElevenLabs](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https://elevenlabs.io), and open-source home automation project [Home Assistant](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https://home-assistant.io). As country code TLDs correspond to [ISO 3166 country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table), there is a possibility that .io [will be retired](https://www.iana.org/help/cctld-retirement) if the IO country code is removed from the standard. While ccTLDs for some former countries still exist, such as .su for the Soviet Union, [others have been deleted, including .yu, .tp, .zr, .an, and .um](https://domainincite.com/30406-five-times-icann-deleted-a-cctld-and-what-it-means-for-io).
