Our popular Threat Modeling Intensive course is where you learn to threat model with the Four Question Framework:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What are we working on?

2Ô∏è‚É£ What can go wrong?

3Ô∏è‚É£ What are we going to do about it?

4Ô∏è‚É£ Did we do a good job?

But we‚Äôve revamped our Threat Modeling Intensive **just** for OWASP! After honing your threat modeling skills, you'll go further and learn to use LLMs to go faster, scale better and have more hallucinations (legally!) than ever before!

Let‚Äôs face it. Every organization wants to use AI to help scale. But you need to know how to threat model to evaluate what the AIs hallucinate. By the end of this course, you will learn the fundamentals for threat modeling and leave with a new understanding of AI-driven development and designing.

This brand new course adds LLMs as chatbots, and as products. You‚Äôll learn with Chatbots and with threat modeling specific tooling, and you‚Äôll learn about the tradeoffs like cost, customizability and convenience

There‚Äôs so much to learn that this is our first-ever three-day course!
