# Poland arrests former spy chief in Pegasus spyware probe

For the last few years, the Polish government under Donald Tusk has been investigating the use — [and alleged abuse](https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/poland-nso-pegasus-election/) — of Pegasus phone spyware by the previous government.

On Monday, Piotr Pogonowski, the former head of Poland’s internal security agency, was arrested and forcibly taken to testify before parliament, as part of the current government’s probe into the alleged spyware abuse carried out in recent years under the previous administration of the Law and Justice (PiS) party, per the[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/88525828-50fc-4b32-b929-58f742c99d72).

From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email.

Pogonowski reportedly ignored three summons to testify to the Polish parliamentary committee.

In 2021, Citizen Lab and Amnesty International concluded that NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was used against three critics of the previous Polish government, including a senator who was allegedly hacked dozens of times ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections. In 2023, [the Polish senate concluded](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/08/polish-senate-says-use-of-government-spyware-is-illegal-in-the-country/) that the use of Pegasus in the country was unlawful.
