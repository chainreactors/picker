## [CVEs of SSH talk this Thursday](?id=796)

hexarcana

It took us a while, but we're finally doing the first open webinar in English ("we" being my company – HexArcana). It's going to be ["CVEs of SSH" presented by Dan Murray](https://hexarcana.ch/workshops/cves-of-ssh)!

Dan basically spent the last few months digging into the SSH ecosystem, and has quite a lot of interesting stories to tell. During this talk he'll focus on a couple of high profile CVEs assigned to various SSH client/servers. You can expect technical insight, historical context and humorous anecdotes along the way as we demystify headline-grabbing issues.

The talk is free to attend, but you have to register at <https://hexarcana.ch/workshops/cves-of-ssh>. Once registered, you'll receive the link to the talk on Wednesday or Tuesday.

Details:

* **Speaker**: Dan Murray
* **Date**: 2024-11-21 8:00 PM GMT+1
* **Duration**: ~1.5h
* **Price**: Free (registration required)
* **Other**: Recording will be available for a limited time (30 days).

In a few days we'll also announce a 1-day course on SSH led by Dan – that's for you folks who like to dig a bit deeper into the tools you use. Stay tuned!

And see you on Thursday hopefully ;>
