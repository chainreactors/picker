## SARS-CoV-2 Lab Leak Intelligence Assessments

*This article is part of an ongoing experiment with the use of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) for developing primers on cyber security topics.*

As this is in the news this week, and Director Wray came out and spoke about it last night, I thought a little intelligence report generated by ChatGPT and a threat assessment might be fun. Personally, I have always held that the potential of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in this scenario than the wet market scenario due to several things.

Firstly, the virus seems to have been, for a zoonitc event, all too readily infectious for humans right from the start. While SARS virus’ are already seen in humans and of course SARS had an outbreak in [China back in 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%932004_SARS_outbreak), the impacts of that particular strain were not as massive as SARS-CoV-2. One of the primary reasons for that from my reading, has been the difference in the virus in Cov-2-19 is it’s ability to bond to the [ACE2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167588/?utm_source=modulosPL&utm_medium=linkinterno&utm_campaign=ux) within our systems and run rampant. It is also to be noted that the genetic structure of the virus [does not rule out genetic manipulation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7744920/), specifically, that of [gain of fucntion research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK285579/), which is what WIV had been working on.

Secondly, there were at least three emplyees of the [WIV who got sick in November](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wuhan-lab-staff-sought-hospital-care-before-covid-19-outbreak-disclosed-wsj-2021-05-23/), just before the pandemic started in Wuhan, who may have in fact had Covid-19. Not much is known about these three people as the Chinese governmnet is not being transparent about them, but, it is quite the coincidence that these three lab workers got sick with an unknown disease, in November, and then the full outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 began in December, in Wuhan of all places.

Thirdly, the Chinese government has been very obtuse in cooperating with anyone about getting to patient zero in this pandemic and has actively blocked investigations. Of course, this is a tricky situation for any country, the epicenter of a pandemic, but China has really blocked so much of the potential truth that it cannot be dismissed. I am not saying in any way, that this was a deliberate release, or that this virus was being “weaponized” in a military program though. It is my contention, that they were doing gain of function work in efforts to understand how to counter such shifts in the SARS genome should it happen and create vaccines against it. It is just a matter of it walked out on someone’s shoe before they even had a chance to come up with a counter to the bug they had just souped up.

Added to this last set of facts, I also can easily see how the virus could have escaped from WIV due to reporting before the pandemic where the lab had been [cited for poor security practices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/). This is also a known quantity that is not a slam dunk, but, if you take all of the known known’s and assess the situation before and after the initial beginnings of the pandemic, well, I can easily see my way to a low to a medium confidence theory on a lab leak being the possible caue of the pandemic writ large.

Anyway, here’s an assessment written by ChatGPT on this…

***ChatGPT: Create an intelligence estimate of the lab leak theory for sars-cov-2 and cite data that backs up this theory***

Executive Summary:

The theory that SAR-CoV-2 originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) through a laboratory accident remains inconclusive. While there is some circumstantial evidence to support this hypothesis, there is also evidence against it, and alternative explanations remain plausible. Further investigation is necessary to determine the virus’s origins and the role of the WIV, including tracing the early spread of the virus and studying its genetic makeup. The possibility of a laboratory accident cannot be completely ruled out, and the scientific community and policymakers must continue to take steps to ensure the safety of biosecurity labs and prevent future accidents.

Background:

The emergence of the novel coronavirus SAR-CoV-2 in late 2019 has led to intense speculation about its origins. One hypothesis is that it may have accidentally leaked from the WIV, a high-level biosecurity laboratory located in Wuhan, China. The lab is known for its research on bat coronaviruses and is part of China’s effort to become a world leader in virology research.

Intelligence Assessment:

1. Evidence supporting the lab leak theory:

There is some circumstantial evidence to support the theory that SAR-CoV-2 originated from the WIV through a laboratory accident. For example, the lab was conducting research on bat coronaviruses at the time of the outbreak, and there have been reports of lax safety protocols at the facility. In addition, some scientists have suggested that the virus’s genetic makeup is more consistent with laboratory manipulation than natural evolution. However, none of this evidence is conclusive, and alternative explanations remain plausible.

2. Evidence against the lab leak theory:

There is also evidence that contradicts the lab leak theory. For example, the virus’s genetic makeup closely resembles that of other bat coronaviruses found in the wild, suggesting a natural origin. In addition, many experts believe that the virus likely originated in a wet market in Wuhan, where the sale of live animals provided an opportunity for the virus to jump from animals to humans. Furthermore, some early cases of COVID-19 were traced back to individuals who had no connection to the WIV, further casting doubt on the lab leak theory.

3. Unanswered questions:

There are still many unanswered questions about the origins of SAR-CoV-2, and the possibility of a laboratory accident cannot be completely ruled out. Further investigation is necessary to determine the virus’s exact origins, including tracing its early spread in Wuhan and studying the genetic makeup of the virus. In addition, more information is needed about the safety protocols at the WIV and other biosecurity labs around the world.

4. Confidence in the intelligence assessment:

The level of confidence in the intelligence assessment varies depending on the specific evidence and alternative explanations. Overall, there is a medium level of confidence in the assessment due to the inconclusive nature of the evidence and the need for further investigation.

Conclusion:

The theory that SAR-CoV-2 originated from the WIV through a laboratory accident remains inconclusive. While there is some circumstantial evidence to support this hypothesis, there is also evidence against it, and alternative explanations remain plausible. Further investigation is necessary to determine the virus’s origins and the role of the WIV. The possibility of a laboratory accident cannot be completely ruled out, and the scientific community and policymakers must continue to take steps to ensure the safety of biosecurity labs and prevent future accidents. This includes increasing funding for biosafety research, strengthening regulations and oversight, and improving international cooperation to address global public health threats.
