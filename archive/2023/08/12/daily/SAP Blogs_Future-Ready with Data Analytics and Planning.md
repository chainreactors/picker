 **Dear** **All,**    The **Future-Ready with Data Analytics and Planning** was successfully held in **Shanghai** on July 27th and 28th 2023. The workshop was initiated from BTP CSP and contributed by SAC Product management, Development, BTP CoE, ICC, SAP Labs China Management Team, Labs China Innovation Experience Center.    The workshop was well attended where the participants were mainly the customers which are already live with SAP Analytics Cloud, early phase of SAC implementation, and also prospect customers. **61 participants from 30+ customers and partners joined this workshop on-site and more than 50 participants joined remotely.** Their active engagement and valuable insights made this workshop truly special.    ![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/blog1.jpg)Gartner’s research states that business content plays a critical role in enabling self-service analytics, as it provides users with pre-built templates, reports, and dashboards that can be easily customized to meet their needs. This allows users to gain insights into their data more quickly and easily, ultimately resulting in improved business outcomes.    At the event, for SAC end users and SAC partners in Greater China, ICC team detailed ICC's recently launched certification: SAP BTP - Partner Business Content certification. This certification program is designed to validate the technical proficiency of partner organizations in creating business content for analytics and data warehousing cloud solutions. The program covers a broad range of topics, including data modeling, data integration, data analytics and data visualization. The certification program also emphasizes the importance of best practices, security, and compliance in the development of business content for cloud solutions.  ![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/blog2-scaled.jpg)   Today SAP provides business content out of the box, and given the diverse line of business that we support and intend to grow, partner innovations will play pivotal role by bringing expertise and convenience of using partner developed contents to the diverse customer LoBs.  ![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/blog3.jpg) |
