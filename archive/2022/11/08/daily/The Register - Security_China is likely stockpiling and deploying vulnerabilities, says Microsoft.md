Microsoft has asserted that China's offensive cyber capabilities have improved, thanks to a law that has allowed Beijing to create an arsenal of unreported software vulnerabilities.

China's [2021 law](https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/15/china_vulnerability_law/) required organizations to report security vulnerabilities to local authorities before disclosing them to any other entity. The rules mean Beijing can use local research to hoard vulnerability information.

A year later, researchers from the Atlantic Council [found](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/27/atlantic_council_china_vuln_research/) there was a decrease in reported vulnerabilities coming from China – and an increase in anonymous reports.
