Threat actors with ties to North Korea have been observed targeting Web3 and cryptocurrency-related businesses with malware written in the Nim programming language, underscoring a constant evolution of their tactics.

"Unusually for macOS malware, the threat actors employ a process injection technique and remote communications via wss, the TLS-encrypted version of the WebSocket protocol," SentinelOne researchers Phil Stokes and Raffaele Sabato [said](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/macos-nimdoor-dprk-threat-actors-target-web3-and-crypto-platforms-with-nim-based-malware/) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

"A novel persistence mechanism takes advantage of SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handlers to install persistence when the malware is terminated or the system rebooted."

The cybersecurity company is tracking the malware components collectively under the name NimDoor. It's worth noting that some aspects of the campaign were previously documented by [Huntabil.IT](https://huntability.tech/threat-note-2025-04-23-nk-zoom/) and later by [Huntress](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/bluenoroff-deepfake-zoom-scam-hits.html) and [Validin](https://www.validin.com/blog/zooming_through_bluenoroff_pivots/), but with differences in the payloads deployed.

The attack chains involve social engineering tactics, approaching targets on messaging platforms like Telegram to schedule a Zoom meeting via Calendly, an appointment scheduling software. The target is then sent an email containing a supposed Zoom meeting link along with instructions to run a Zoom SDK update script to ensure that they are running the latest version of the videoconferencing software.

This step results in the execution of an AppleScript that acts as a delivery vehicle for a second-stage script from a remote server, while ostensibly redirecting the user to a legitimate Zoom redirect link. The newly downloaded script subsequently unpacks ZIP archives containing binaries that are responsible for setting up persistence and launching information stealing bash scripts.

At the heart of the infection sequence is a C++ loader called InjectWithDyldArm64 (aka InjectWithDyld), which decrypts two embedded binaries named Target and trojan1\_arm64. InjectWithDyldArm64 launches Target in a suspended state and injects into it the trojan1\_arm64's binary's code, after which the execution of the suspended process is resumed.

The malware proceeds to establish communication with a remote server and fetch commands that allow it to gather system information, run arbitrary commands, and change or set the current working directory. The results of the execution are sent back to the server.

Trojan1\_arm64, for its part, is capable of downloading two more payloads, which come fitted with capabilities to harvest credentials from web browsers like Arc, Brave, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox, as well as extract data from the Telegram application.

Also dropped as part of the attacks is a collection of Nim-based executable that are used as a launchpad for CoreKitAgent, which monitors for user attempts to kill the malware process and ensures persistence by installing custom handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM.

"This behavior ensures that any user-initiated termination of the malware results in the deployment of the core components, making the code resilient to basic defensive actions," the researchers said.

The malware also launches an AppleScript that beacons out every 30 seconds to one of two hard-coded command-and-control (C2) servers, while also exfiltrating a snapshot of the list of running processes and executing additional scripts sent by the server.

The findings demonstrate how North Korean threat actors are increasingly training their sights on macOS systems, weaponizing AppleScript to act as a post-exploitation backdoor to meet their data gathering goals.

"North Korean-aligned threat actors have previously experimented with Go and Rust, similarly combining scripts and compiled binaries into multi-stage attack chains," the researchers said.

"However, Nim's rather unique ability to execute functions during compile time allows attackers to blend complex behaviour into a binary with less obvious control flow, resulting in compiled binaries in which developer code and Nim runtime code are intermingled even at the function level."

### Kimsuky's Use of ClickFix Continues

The disclosure comes as South Korean cybersecurity company Genians [exposed](https://www.genians.co.kr/en/blog/threat_intelligence/suky-castle) Kimusky's continued use of the [ClickFix social engineering tactic](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/north-korean-hackers-exploit-powershell.html) to deliver a variety of remote access tools as part of a campaign dubbed [BabyShark](https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/n-korean-kimsuky-hackers-using-new.html), a known cluster of activity attributed to the North Korean hacking group.

The attacks, first observed in January 2025 and targeting national security experts in South Korea, involve the use of spear-phishing emails masquerading as interview requests for a legitimate German-language business newspaper and trick them into opening a malicious link containing a bogus RAR archive.

Present within the archive is a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that's engineered to open a decoy Google Docs file in the user's web browser, while, in the background, m...
