How to Analyze Node.js, Python, Android, and Linux Malware with ANY.RUN

Malware doesn’t stick to one platform or play fair. One day it’s a Python stealer. The next, it’s an Android RAT or a Node.js backdoor quietly pinging its C2. Then it hits Linux, flooding your network with suspicious connections.

Modern threats are unpredictable. They move across systems and languages, often slipping past tools that weren’t built for this level of complexity.

[ANY.RUN’s cloud-based sandbox](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=how_to_analyze_nodejs_python&utm_term=270525&utm_content=linktolanding) gives [companies and SOC teams](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/expertware-success-story/) the flexibility to investigate these threats.

One sandbox where you can analyze, detect, and understand malware and phishing, no matter the OS, architecture, or language. With support for [Windows](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows-10-sandbox/), [Linux](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/linux-malware-analysis-cases/), and [Android](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/android-malware-analysis/), you can choose the environment that fits your sample and see how the same threat behaves across platforms. Just upload, launch, and start investigating.

Let’s see how cybersecurity teams use ANY.RUN to detect and analyze malware written in languages like Python and Node.js, and built to target different systems.

## Malware Written in Node.js: Unpacking GootLoader’s Multi-Stage Execution

JavaScript isn’t just for websites anymore, and that’s part of the problem. Threat actors increasingly use JavaScript and Node.js to build droppers, stealers, and loaders that can bypass traditional defenses.

For businesses, these threats often arrive disguised as legitimate files, especially in environments where document sharing and template downloads are common. Once executed, they can trigger multi-stage infections, establish persistence, and pull down additional payloads without leaving obvious traces.

To see how a Node.js-based attack unfolds in the real world, let’s analyze a live [GootLoader](https://any.run/malware-trends/gootloader/) infection inside the ANY.RUN sandbox.

[View analysis of Node.js threat](https://app.any.run/tasks/ff1f17dc-3519-4c32-8e7b-893e5e4d5451/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=how_to_analyze_nodejs_python&utm_term=270525&utm_content=linktoservice)

The attack begins when a user lands on a compromised website while searching for something business-related, like a contract template.

The site delivers a ZIP file containing a trojanized JavaScript file posing as a common library (e.g., jQuery). Once opened, the script runs via wscript.exe, launching a heavily obfuscated payload.

ANY.RUN’s [Script Tracer](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malicious-scripts/) logs and deobfuscates this activity in real time, giving analysts full visibility into each execution step.

We can see all the completed processes of the attack from the right side of the screen, where the process tree is. Here is what we discover here:

Once executed, the first-stage payload drops a second-stage JavaScript file onto the victim’s system and creates a scheduled task to run it immediately and ensure persistence.

The task launches the second-stage script, initially again through wscript.exe (PID 7828), which then transfers execution to cscript.exe (PID 7896). This script spawns a PowerShell process (PID 8092), which further deobfuscates and runs another PowerShell sc...
