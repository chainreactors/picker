In a world where threats are persistent, the modern CISO's real job isn't just to secure technology‚Äîit's to preserve institutional trust and ensure business continuity.

This week, we saw a clear pattern: adversaries are targeting the complex relationships that hold businesses together, from supply chains to strategic partnerships. With new regulations and the rise of AI-driven attacks, the decisions you make now will shape your organization's resilience for years to come.

This isn't just a threat roundup; it's the strategic context you need to lead effectively. Here's your full weekly recap, packed with the intelligence to keep you ahead.

## ‚ö° Threat of the Week

**[New HybridPetya Ransomware Bypasses UEFI Secure Boot](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/new-hybridpetya-ransomware-bypasses.html)** ‚Äî A copycat version of the infamous Petya/NotPetya malware dubbed HybridPetya has been spotted. But no telemetry exists to suggest HybridPetya has been deployed in the wild yet. It also differs in one key respect: It can compromise the secure boot feature of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) by installing a malicious application. Attackers prize bootkits since malware installed at that level can evade detection by antivirus applications and survive operating system reinstalls. With access to the UEFI, hackers can deploy their own kernel-mode payloads. ESET said it found HybridPetya samples uploaded to Google's VirusTotal platform in February 2025.

## Getting Started Guide: Transforming Detection & Response for the Cloud Era

Cloud attacks need cloud-native response. The Cloud gives teams incredible speed and flexibility. Security should match that pace, helping you detect and respond to issues in real time without slowing innovation. That's where Cloud Detection & Response (CDR) comes in. Built for the cloud, CDR gives you comprehensive visibility, enabling you to both understand the threats facing your environment and provide better remediation recommendations. Discover how CDR enables security teams to act faster, smarter, and bring clarity to SecOps](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-detect-guide-ar)

## üîî Top News

* **[Samsung Patches Actively Exploited Flaw](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/samsung-fixes-critical-zero-day-cve.html)** ‚Äî Samsung has released a fix for a security vulnerability that it said has been exploited in zero-day attacks. The vulnerability, CVE-2025-21043 (CVSS score: 8.8), concerns an out-of-bounds write that could result in arbitrary code execution. The critical-rated issue, per the South Korean electronics giant, affects Android versions 13, 14, 15, and 16. The vulnerability was privately disclosed to the company on August 13, 2025. Samsung did not share any specifics on how the vulnerability is being exploited in attacks and who may be behind these efforts. However, it acknowledged that "an exploit for this issue has existed in the wild."
* **[Google Pixel 10 Adds Support for C2PA Standard](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/google-pixel-10-adds-c2pa-support-to.html)** ‚Äî Google announced that its new Google Pixel 10 phones support the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) standard out of the box to verify the origin and history of digital content. Support for C2PA's Content Credentials has been added to Pixel Camera and Google Photos apps for Android. The move, Google said, is designed to further digital media transparency. "Pixel 10 phones support on-device trusted time-stamps, which ensures images captured with your native camera app can be trusted after the certificate expires, even if they were captured when your device was offline," Google [said](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/google-pixel-10-adds-c2pa-support-to.html).
* **[Chinese APT Deploys EggStreme Malware in Attack Targeting Philippines](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/chinese-apt-deploys-eggstreme-fileless.html)** ‚Äî A novel malware framework called EggStreme has been put to use in a cyber attack on a Philippine military company attributed to a government-backed hacking group from China. EggStreme framework is a tightly integrated set of malicious components that, unlike traditional malware, operates "with a clear, multi-stage flow designed to establish a resilient foothold on compromised systems." The backdoor offers a wide range of capabilities, allowing hackers to inject other payloads, move around a victim's network and more. The activity was observed between April 9, 2024, and June 13, 2025, indicating a year-long effort. The attackers leveraged legitimate Windows services to blend into the system's normal operations and maintain access.
* **[New RatOn Malware Targets Android](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/raton-android-malware-detected-with-nfc.html)** ‚Äî A new Android malware called RatOn has evolved from a basic tool capable of conducting Near Field Communication (NFC) relay attacks to a sophisticated remote access trojan with Automated Transfer System (ATS) capabilities to conduct device fraud. The trojan fuses NFC relay techniques, ransomware overlays, and ATS capabilities, making it a potent tool with dual-pronged objectives: initiate unauthorized fund transfers and compromise cryptocurrency wallet accounts associated with MetaMask, Trust, Blockchain.com, and Phantom.
