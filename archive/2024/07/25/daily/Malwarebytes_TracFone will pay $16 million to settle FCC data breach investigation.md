# TracFone will pay $16 million to settle FCC data breach investigation

Posted: July 24, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Following three separate [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) between 2021 and 2023 which exposed the proprietary information (PI) of TracFone Wireless customers, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [announced](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-404156A1.pdf) that the Verizon-owned company has agreed to pay a $16 million civil penalty to settle the government investigation, and it has made an agreement to improve its application programming interface  (API) security.

TracFone Wireless Inc. is an American prepay wireless service provider wholly owned by Verizon. TracFone services are used by the brands Straight Talk, Total by Verizon Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile.

The settlement ends an investigation into TracFone’s security practices to uncover whether the breaches were the result of ineffective cybersecurity protocols. The Enforcement Bureau (EB) of the FCC found that cybercriminals gained access to certain TracFone customer information, including PI and customer proprietary network information (CPNI), by exploiting vulnerabilities related to customer-facing APIs.

APIs allow different computer programs or components to communicate with one another. When the security behind the APIs is not secure enough, cybercriminals can abuse them to gather information without authorization.

The FCC media release explains in detail that it is possible to leverage numerous APIs to access customer information from websites. And according to the FCC’s own Enforcement Bureau, that is exactly what happened at TracFone.

In addition to the civil penalty, the FCC secured extra assignments for TracFone in the [Consent Decree](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-24-481A1.pdf):

* TracFone has to deploy a mandated information security program, with novel provisions to reduce API vulnerabilities in ways consistent with widely accepted standards, like those identified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP).
* TracFone must improve protection measures against [SIM-swapping](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/howto/protect-yourself-from-sim-swap-scams). [SIM swapping](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/howto/protect-yourself-from-sim-swap-scams) (and the very similar port-out fraud) is the unlawful use of someone’s [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) to steal their phone number and swap or transfer it to another device. With this, criminals can intercept calls, messages, and certain [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for) codes.
* TracFone has to undergo annual assessments—including by independent third parties—of its information security program.
* Employees and certain third parties are to receive privacy and security awareness training.

The Enforcement Bureau reported to the FCC that:

> “After gaining access to customer information during one of the three breaches, the threat actors completed an undisclosed number of unauthorized port-outs.”

 All this occurs as the FCC has continued a [mission against SIM-swapping](https://www.malwarebytes...
