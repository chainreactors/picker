Could a senior Latvian politician really be responsible for scamming hundreds of ‚Äúmothers-of-two‚Äù in the UK? (Probably not, despite Graham‚Äôs theories‚Ä¶) And should we be getting worried about the AI wonder that is ChatGPT?

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Plus don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with DigiCert‚Äôs Brian ‚ÄúPKI‚Äù Trzupek.
