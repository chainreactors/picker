# Should I go for bachelors in SANS?

I am very interested in SANS Technology institute but they require you to have done some college to fulfill 70 credits. I am a high school student so this is not something which I have. They have a patnership with Montgemory College which might allow me to transfer to SANS. However, they haven't specified what requirements I should meet to transfer to SANS.

I am a high school student with decent GPA and good SAT score and am probably capable of entering some decent universities.

I want to know if there is some guarantee that I will be accepted to SANS technology institute if I were to go do my Associates in Montgomery College.

I am not willing to risk abandoning going to a 4-year well-known university for just a chance to get to SANS tech institute. I want to know if there is some guarantee which I can do which will allow me to just go do Montgemory College and then transfer to SANS tech institute. Like some sort of reserved seat...

^=likely to get accepted ^^=maybe ^^^=dream

My Uni List:
1- CMU^^^

2-UIUC^^

3-University of Michigan ^^^

4- Purdue University^^

5-UC^^/^^^

6- University of Wisconsin-Madison^^

7- UMD^^

8-Michigan State University ^

9-Ohio State University Columbus ^

10-University of Illinois , Springfield ^

EDIT: Thank you all for taking your time to discuss with me
