# Weekly Update 414

25 August 2024

This is such a significant week for us, to finally have Stefan join us as a *proper* employee at HIBP. When you start out as a pet project, you never really consider yourself a "proper" employee because, well, it's just you mucking around. And then when Charlotte started "officially" working for HIBP a few years ago, well, that's my wife helping me out. To have someone whose sole purpose it is to write code that makes this thing tick *and* build all sorts of amazing new features expands our capacity to actually produce stuff many times over. I use that term "actually produce stuff" because it was precious little time I had to do this, given all the things involved in running HIBP. It's an exciting time for all three of us now ðŸ˜Š
