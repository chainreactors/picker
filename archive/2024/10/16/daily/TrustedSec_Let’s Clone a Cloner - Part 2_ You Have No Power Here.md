Previously on [Let's Clone a Cloner](https://trustedsec.com/blog/lets-clone-a-cloner-to-meet-my-needs), I needed a long-range RFID badge cloner. There are many walkthroughs out there on how to build a cloner that are fantastic, innovative builds, but I wanted one that meets all of my needs. Although I have tinkered with fixing electronics in the past, I have never actually “hardware hacked,” so I decided to build my own and share with those who are thinking about hacking hardware, just like me. I came across a fantastic build that I wanted to work from: <https://www.phrack.me/hardware/2022/11/11/Tastic-RFID-thief.html>.

My plan was set, I temporarily wired it up, and I found that the range was less than an inch. In this part, we will dive into what could be causing the poor range. Is it the used, sun-faded HID MaxiProx 5375 card reader? Does it have a bad chip or capacitor in it? Maybe the firmware? Is something interfering with the wireless signal such as the USB battery pack or the placement of the ESP RFID Tool (the man-in-the-middle card number collector)? Possibly (and most likely) an incorrect amount of power being supplied? Let’s figure this out together.

## Could it be Power?

The first thing that I am going to look at is if the range issue could be power related. If your car battery has ever died on you, then you are well aware that the battery could seem to work fine since your remote unlock works, interior lights are on, and your radio is blaring. But as soon as you turn the key, you hear the engine try to turn over but not start the car. In my MaxiProx build, everything looked like it was working, and just like a car with a weak battery, the MaxiProx looks like it is getting enough power, but it seems like there is not enough power. And this is what we are going to troubleshoot first.

I Got My MaxiProx Working

Before we start looking at what power is being supplied, we need to understand the basics of electricity.

## Sidestep - Understanding Electricity

Let’s review some basics of electricity to ensure that if you are new to hardware hacking, or working with electricity in general, you do so safely. Before we dig in, it is important to know that electricity can sometimes...
