# Weekly Update 466

25 August 2025

I'm fascinated by the unwillingness of organisations to name the "third party" to which they've attributed a breach. [The initial reporting on the Allianz Life incident from last month](https://securityaffairs.com/180445/data-breach/allianz-life-data-breach-exposed-the-data-of-most-of-its-1-4m-customers.html?ref=troyhunt.com) makes no mention whatsoever of Salesforce, nor does any other statement I can find from them. And that's very often the way with many other incidents too, which, IMHO, sucks. My view is that when our data is provided to a third party and that party exposes it, we have a very reasonable expectation to know who lost it. My own personal info was exposed in [the Ticketek breach last year](https://www.teg.com.au/statement-regarding-ticketek-cyber-incident/?ref=troyhunt.com); can you find any mention whatsoever in that disclosure notice of Snowflake DB? Nope, but that's the "reputable, global third party supplier" they refer to. Another fun fact: the other third party they don't name is HIBP: "We are aware some customers¬†have recently been contacted by a third party regarding the impact to their information". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
