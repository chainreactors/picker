# Beyond the Phish: 5 Deceptive Commands to Emulate Physical Attacks

As Red Teamers, we often live in the realm of sophisticated exploits, complex phishing campaigns, and intricate post-exploitation frameworks. But what happens when an attacker gets **physical access**? A malicious device plugged into an unguarded port can bypass layers of security in seconds.

The good news is you don't always need a bag full of custom hardware to test your defenses against these threats. For your next purple team engagement, you can simulate the initial impact of a physical breach using commands you already have.

This post breaks down five simple but powerful one-liners for both Linux and Windows that emulate physical hardware attacks. Let's get our hands dirty and give the Blue Team something to really look for.

## Simulating Hardware Threats on Linux

These Linux commands are designed to mimic the behavior of malicious hardware at the OS level, testing your network and endpoint visibility.

### 1. The Rogue Device: Test Your DHCP & Network Access Control (NAC)

This command simulates a network implant (like a hidden Raspberry Pi or a malicious USB-to-Ethernet adapter) being plugged into a corporate network port. Its goal is simple: can it get an IP address?

#### The Scenario

> An attacker walks into an office, finds an open network jack under a desk, and plugs in a device. This command simulates that device's first action.

#### The Command

```
IFACE="rogue0"; ip link add $IFACE type dummy && ip link set $IFACE up && echo "[+] Emulating rogue device. Attempting DHCP lease on interface $IFACE..." && dhclient -v $IFACE && ip link delete $IFACE
```

#### How It Works

* `ip link add $IFACE type dummy`: Creates a new, virtual network interface named `rogue0`. To the OS, this looks like a new piece of hardware has been activated.
* `ip link set $IFACE up`: Enables the interface.
* `dhclient -v $IFACE`: This is the crucial step. It broadcasts a DHCP discovery request on the network, asking the server for an IP address lease.
* `ip link delete $IFACE`: Cleans up by deleting the virtual interface.

#### ðŸŸ£ Purple Team Focus: What to Look For

* **DHCP Server Logs:** Did your DHCP server issue an IP address to the `rogue0` interface's MAC address? Policies should prevent leases for unknown or unauthorized MACs.
* **NAC Alerts:** If you have 802.1X or other NAC solutions, the port should have been blocked entirely. Did an alert fire?
* **SIEM Events:** A new, unclassified device appearing and requesting network access is a high-fidelity indicator of potential compromise.

### 2. The Low-Level Keylogger: Test EDR & Input Monitoring

This command simulates a physical, inline keylogger by reading raw data directly from the keyboard's input device file, bypassing many user-space monitoring tools.

#### The Scenario

> An attacker replaces a standard keyboard with a modified one containing a keylogging chip or plugs a small device between the keyboard and the computer.

#### The Command

```
# Improved command with a check
KBD_PATH=$(find /dev/input/by-path/ -name "*-kbd" | head -n 1)

if [ -n "$KBD_PATH" ]; then
    echo "[+] Keyboard device found at $KBD_PATH. Capturing for 30s..."
    nohup cat "$KBD_PATH" > /tmp/keylog.raw 2>/dev/null &
    PID=$!
    sleep 30
    kill $PID
    echo "[+] Capture finished. Raw data in /tmp/keylog.raw"
else
    echo "[!] No physical keyboard device found."
fi
```

#### How It Works

* `find ... -name "*-kbd"`: Locates the system device file that represents the physical keyboard.
* `cat "$KBD_PATH"`: This is the core of the simulation. It reads the raw event stream directly from the device file.
* `> /tmp/keylog.raw`: The raw, binary output is saved to a file.
* `nohup ... &`: Runs the capture process in the background.

#### ðŸŸ£ Purple Team Focus: What to Look For

* **EDR/XDR Alerts:** A good EDR should be highly suspicious of any process other than the X server reading directly from `/dev/input/`.
* **File System Monitoring:** Does your monitoring detect the creation of a raw log file in an unusual location like `/tmp`?

### 3. The Faulty Network Tap: Test Performance Anomaly Detection

This command simulates the physical layer disruption caused by a faulty or malicious passive network tap, which can force a network interface to negotiate a much lower speed.

#### The Scenario

> An attacker physically installs a network tap to sniff traffic. A poorly made tap can degrade the network connection for the target device.

#### The Command

```
# Replace eth0 with your primary interface name
IFACE="eth0"
echo "[!] Throttling $IFACE to 10Mbps/Half-Duplex..."
ethtool -s $IFACE speed 10 duplex half && \
echo "[+] NIC throttled. Testing connectivity..." && \
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 && \
echo "[!] Restoring $IFACE to 1Gbps/Full-Duplex..." && \
ethtool -s $IFACE speed 1000 duplex full
```

#### How It Works

* `ethtool -s eth0 speed 10 duplex half`: Uses the `ethtool` utility to force the network card to operate at a legacy speed of 10 Mbps with half-duplex.
* `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8`: Runs a simple connectivity test.
* `ethtool -s eth0 speed 1000 duplex full`: Restores the interface to its proper speed.

#### ðŸŸ£ Purple Team Focus: What to Look For

* **Network Performance Monitoring (NPM):** Your NPM tools should immediately flag a critical link speed change on a production device.
* **Log Analysis:** The link speed change should generate a log message in `/var/log/syslog` or `dmesg`. Are you alerting on these events?
