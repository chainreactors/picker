Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends Kyocera customers to install the latest updates.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals
is highly advised, as the software may be affected from other security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Path Traversal - Bypass (CVE-2023-34259)
A path traversal vulnerability was found by Hakan Eren ŞAN in 2020-06-06.
The previous exploit can be found at: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48561
Kyocera has fixed the vulnerability. It was not possible to access arbitrary
files using the public exploit. However, SEC Consult have found a bypass to
exploit this vulnerability again and access arbitrary files. Due to the fact
that the web service is running as the user root, it was possible to access all
files (e.g. /etc/shadow) on the device.

2) Denial-of-Service - Web Interface (CVE-2023-34260)
The denial-of-service vulnerability is related to the path traversal
vulnerability. Instead of requesting a file, a directory will be requested.
Once the request is sent to the web service running on TCP port 443, the web
service will become unresponsive and must be restarted.

3) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-34261)
The login function on the web service running on TCP port 443 is prone to a
user enumeration vulnerability. The login function will return different
responses, whether the username is valid or not.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Path Traversal - Bypass (CVE-2023-34259)
Previously, a security researcher has discovered an unauthenticated directory
traversal vulnerability in the web service running on port 443. The following
payload was used to access arbitrary files:

https://IP/wlmeng/../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00index.htm

This vulnerability is fixed in the current version. It was not possible to
access arbitrary files using the above payload. However, the vulnerability was
not fixed correctly. SEC Consult identified a bypass to exploit this
vulnerability again.

Once the ../ sequences will be URL encoded, it is possible to bypass the fix
and access arbitrary files. The following payload can be used to access the
file /etc/passwd:

https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/passwd%00index.htm

The response containing the contents of the file /etc/passwd can be seen
in the following paragraph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also, it was possible to access the file /etc/shadow. The following payload can
be used:

https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc/shadow%00index.htm

The output containing the content of the file /etc/shadow as it can be seen in
the following paragraph.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the web service is running as the user root it was possible to access the
/etc/shadow file or the file has set the wrong permissions.

Based on previous security assessments of Kyocera printers, it is likely that
the service is running as the user root.

2) Denial-of-Service - Web Interface (CVE-2023-34260)
To trigger the DoS attack it is sufficient to navigate to the URL:

https://IP/wlmdeu%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%00index.htm

Once the request is sent to the web service, the web service will become
unresponsive.

This attack is related to the path traversal vulnerability. The difference is
that in this case a folder is requested instead of a file. Apparently, this
leads to an error condition in the web server causing it to be unresponsive for
all users. Other applications offering a web interface (e.g., on port 8083)
seem to not be affected by the attack.

3) User Enumeration (CVE-2023-34261)
The user enumeration is located in the login functionality of the web
interface. Submitting an existing username will result in a different server
response than submitting an incorrect username. This enables attackers to
enumerate existing users by submitting potential usernames till a different
response is gathered. In this case, it does not matter whether the transmitted
password is correct or not. The gathered information could be used to better
search for default passwords or custom passwords inside of public password
leaks.
In case, the username does not exist, the response will return
"Login-Benutzername oder Passwort falsch.", on the other hand, if the
username exists the response contains "Sie können sich nicht einloggen."
