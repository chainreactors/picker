## OT Cybersecurity Platforms, 2025

As operational technology (OT) environments rapidly evolve, security strategies must keep pace with emerging risks and operational challenges. The modernization of OT calls for a fresh approach that goes beyond asset visibility to ensure resilience, safety and uptime. Protecting industrial infrastructure, especially environments with legacy systems, distributed operations and remote workforces, requires security strategies that address real-world threats, adapt to operational constraints, and support long-term reliability.

We’re proud to share that [Omdia’s Market Radar: OT Cybersecurity Platforms, 2025](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/ot-security-market-radar-2025) has named Palo Alto Networks as a Leader in its latest evaluation. We received the highest possible rating, "advanced," in seven out of 10 capability categories and achieved broad coverage in the remaining three. No other vendor received more advanced ratings.

## A Recognized Leader in OT Cybersecurity

Omdia’s report highlights that decision makers are increasingly prioritizing comprehensive security coverage, centralized management and advanced cybersecurity capabilities when selecting OT security solutions.

Among the key areas where Palo Alto Networks stands out comparatively are **vulnerability and risk management** and **secure remote access** – two capabilities that are critical for protecting industrial environments.

Why Palo Alto Networks was ranked as a leader in OT cybersecurity platforms.

## Vulnerability and Risk Management — Prioritizing What Matters Most

Managing vulnerabilities in OT environments remains a major challenge as organizations navigate the delicate balance between security and uptime. Legacy systems, often running outdated or unsupported software add another layer of complexity to an already difficult risk landscape. Security teams are inundated with alerts and complex patching cycles, making it difficult to prioritize the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to critical operations.

Omdia highlights Palo Alto Networks Guided Virtual Patching – the industry’s only fully integrated, risk-based guided virtual patching solution for OT environments. Powered by Precision AI®, it provides real-time risk assessment, vulnerability prioritization and proactive threat prevention without disrupting industrial processes.

Omdia recognizes that our approach to risk management goes beyond basic visibility, stating:

> This capability complements other risk management features, such as analysis, prioritization, least privileged policy recommendations and the ability to customize based on compensating controls, risk factors and asset criticality.

By automating the correlation between vulnerabilities, asset criticality and potential threats, security teams can focus on mitigating the most impactful risks while reducing the time and effort traditionally required for manual patching. This streamlines security workflows, enhances resilience and protects OT environments without disrupting operations.

## Secure Remote Access — Enabling Seamless, Secure Connectivity for OT

With remote operations now a critical component of modern industrial environments, organizations need secure and frictionless access to OT assets without compromising security. Omdia recognizes the Privileged Remote Access capabilities by Palo Alto Networks, which provide granular access control across users, applications and devices, ensuring secure remote connectivity while maintaining operational efficiency​.

By leveraging Prisma® Access Browser and agent-based or agentless secure remote access, security teams can extend Zero Trust network access (ZTNA) principles into OT environments while reducing deployment complexity. Unlike traditional VPN-based solutions, which can be difficult to manage and lack OT-specific controls, our browser-based architecture features an integrated jump server that streamlines access to critical OT systems while maintaining strict security controls.

Designed specifically for OT environments, our solution supports just-in-time access for OT administrators, session recording for audit and compliance needs, and purpose-built workflows that meet the unique security and operational requirements of industrial environments. Omdia states:

> Palo Alto Networks OT Security allows focused and granular policy control across assets, users, applications and content, as well as flexible agent-based or agentless secure remote access.

This approach enables organizations to protect industrial operations from unauthorized access while supporting secure remote work, third-party access and distributed OT environments, all without sacrificing productivity or uptime.

## A Platform Approach to OT Security

Omdia emphasizes that while visibility and detection are essential, they are no longer enough on their own. The real differentiator is how organizations act on security insights to mitigate risk, enforce policies and maintain uptime.

Omdia highlights the value of the Palo Alto Networks platform-based strategy in addressing these challenges:

> The platform approach aids efficiency and reduces complexity and technology sprawl, alleviating strain due to skills gaps. This approach also allows customers to scale, expanding their OT cybersecurity capabilities with additional products and services and moving toward more integrated security across IT and OT environments.

Our platform approach reflects our commitment to delivering a unified security strategy that adapts to customer needs, streamlines security operations and strengthens the cybersecurity posture across both OT and IT.

## Enhance OT Security with AI-Driven Visibility and Protection Powered by Precision AI

Building on this foundation, Palo Alto Networks extends its advanced security capabilities to OT environments, delivering the protection that Omdia identifies as critical for modern industrial operations.

Omdia highlights the deep integration of OT Security by Palo Alto Networks with its broader cybersecurity portfolio, enabling customers to manage security holistically across OT and IT domains from a unified platform​.

Our security framework enablements:

* Comprehensive asset and threat visibility, identifying and mitigating threats before they disrupt operations.
* Risk-based asset management, allowing organizations to classify and prioritize OT assets with security policies based on risk level and operational impact.
* Consistent security policy enforcement across users, applications, content and devices, ensuring a cohesive security strategy across deployments.

By aligning with proactive threat management and AI-driven security controls, our solution enables organizations to secure their industrial environments while maintaining the agility and uptime required for critical operations.
