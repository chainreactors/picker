# Announcing the Trail of Bits and Semgrep partnership

At Trail of Bits, we aim to share and develop tools and resources used in our security assessments with the broader security community. Many clients, we observed, don’t use Semgrep to its fullest potential or even at all. To bridge this gap and encourage broader adoption, our CEO, Dan Guido, initiated discussions with the Semgrep team. Through these discussions, we identified areas where our expertise could enhance Semgrep’s capabilities and vice versa. We are excited to announce a new [partnership with Semgrep](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/semgrep-launches-partner-programs-to-strengthen-joint-customer-security-302249505.html?tc=eml_cleartime), born from these conversations. This collaboration allows us to deliver Semgrep’s advanced features to our clients faster.

> At Semgrep, we are thrilled to partner with Trail of Bits, whose rigorous approach to security engineering and research directly complements our focus on embedding secure coding practices within the development pipeline. Their expertise in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities aligns with our efforts to provide precise and actionable guardrails, enabling teams to produce secure software by design. -Daghan Altas, CRO, Semgrep

### But why Semgrep?

Much like mechanics have a toolbox for their work, so do engineers. We use a suite of tools on every engagement that aid our manual testing. But [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) is one of the first tools our application security team implements when auditing a codebase. It helps us find low-complexity bugs and specific code patterns without building the target code. Its more advanced capabilities allow us to strategically ignore parts of code and to write custom rules. We also train our clients on using Semgrep and other testing tools/methodologies during our assessments.

We encourage not just our clients to use Semgrep in their testing strategies—we believe it’s an incredibly valuable tool for any dev team.

### Semgrep resources

Since our team uses Semgrep frequently during client engagements and in our research, we’ve learned a lot about its capabilities. We share our insights through blog posts, covering topics like custom rules we’ve developed, securing ML projects, and discovering bugs. We also have a comprehensive Testing Handbook with an entire chapter dedicated to Semgrep. Below is just a handful of our Semgrep resources and research:
