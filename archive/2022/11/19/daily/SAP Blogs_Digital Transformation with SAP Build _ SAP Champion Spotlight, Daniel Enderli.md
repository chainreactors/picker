 The [**SAP Champion Spotlight Interview Series**](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/spotlight-interview/) highlights key strategic topics, such as emerging technologies, learning, and other topics, and provides insights from SAP Champions and SAP leaders on turning ideas into innovative approaches that impact people, process, and technology. |

The act of *getting started* on a mission, vision, strategy, or project is important from both a professional and personal standpoint. It fosters growth and self-improvement.

The underlying consideration for a *“just do it and do it now*” attitude is centered around taking self-responsibility and recognizing the importance of making a series of choices and taking action.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/CircleProfile.png)For some, the struggle of getting started can be challenging due to the fear of failure.

Once one abandons the idea that everything has to be “perfect,” the easier it becomes to take those first steps.

For daniel.enderli, SAP Champion, author, Zen project master, geocacher, SAP ALM meetup leader, and Head of SAP *Application Lifecycle Management (ALM*) and SAP S/4HANA Project Manager at Swisscom, he has taken a very inspiring approach to his journey in his education, leadership, community, and professional pursuits. His methods for getting started and simplicity help the groups and teams he’s connected to achieve successful outcomes.

It was insightful to catch-up with Daniel from his home office in Zurich, Switzerland.

**Stacey Fish (SF):** **Hi Daniel! You further invested in your education at the HWZ University of Applied Sciences in Zurich with a master’s in Digital Business addressing leadership, digital risk management, and disruptive technologies. What inspired you to dive deeper into the digital world to compliment your current role as Head of SAP ALM and SAP S/4HANA Project Manager at Swisscom?**

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Daniel1.png)Daniel Enderli (DE):** Digital transformation also means that you have to change yourself. I was pursuing several goals with my master’s degree in digital business. On the one hand, I wanted to get myself fit for the digital future, on the other hand, such an education always offers a network where you can meet people from different industries and exchange ideas.

During my daily work, it is important that I can get employees and customers excited about digitization and show them a vision. I use the knowledge which I’ve learned during my master’s degree and bring it to life in our projects.

**SF: Very curious about your interests as a “geocacher” and “prospector.” For those of us who are new to these activities, geocaching is a type of global treasure hunt for people looking for hidden objects using a GPS. Prospectors search for valuable substances (e.g., gold, coins, or art) on or under the surface of the earth. Tell us more about your navigation activities.**

**DE:** I have always been a treasure hunter. I'm interested in the history of our ancestors. Both hobbies, geocaching and prospecting, offer me the opportunity to live out this passion. A big advantage is that both take place in the nature.

These interests are the ideal balance to my professional work-life balance. You learn to orient yourself in nature and, for example, to read a river in order to find the gold-bearing spots in the riverbed, or I can search for geocaches almost everywhere in the world. Through these hobbies, I have discovered many exciting places that I would never have gone to otherwise.

I am also involved in the public administration as a volunteer prospector. There I can help with historical excavations and prospecting in historical areas. In that way, I learn something exciting about the past.

**SF: How did you become an SAP Champion? In this role, how do you engage with Community members?**

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Daniel2.png)DE:** It was actually very simple. I had found out which community programs were taking place. That's when I came across the SAP Champions program and immediately applied for it.

Also, I set up a [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/sap-alm-solman-cloud-alm-community/) that a circle of us use to hold face-to-face community events. These are very informal events in a relaxed atmosphere with like-minded people. We are now more than 130 members. I'm also a daniel.enderli#content:blogposts and use blogs.sap.com. I exchange ideas with other SAP Community participants at 2-3 fixed events per year, for ex...
