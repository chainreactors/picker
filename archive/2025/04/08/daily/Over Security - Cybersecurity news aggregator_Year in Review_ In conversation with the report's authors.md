**ðŸŽ¥ Talos Year in Review 2024: Part 1 & 2 â€“ Watch Now!**

Another year, another mountain of malicious telemetry to sift through. I spoke with a few of Talos' Year in Review authors, freshly out of the sandbox, to discuss the how's and why's of our biggest findings.

ðŸ‘‰Â **Part 1:**Â [The major theme of 2024, top vulnerabilities, email threats and adversary tooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTDnHbYJrH0)

ðŸ‘‰Â **Part 2:**Â [Ransomware groups, and why we're seeing more identity attacks](https://youtu.be/YFwMSxYd-Kk)

Whether youâ€™re here for the hard data or the dry humor, weâ€™ve got you covered. We break down what mattered most in 2024 â€” and whatâ€™s on the radar for 2025.
