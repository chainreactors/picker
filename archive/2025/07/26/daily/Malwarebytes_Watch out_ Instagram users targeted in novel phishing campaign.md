# Watch out: Instagram users targeted in novel phishing campaign

Posted: July 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A phishing campaign targeting Instagram users is doing the rounds. There are plenty of those around, but when we took a look at this particular email, it seemed a bit different to the normal [phishing emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) that point to scammy websites.

The email looked like this, which is very similar to the one Instagram sends if it wants you to confirm your identity:

![phishing mail](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Email_screenshot_red.png)
> “Hi {name}
> Someone tried to log in to your Instagram account.
> If this was you, please use the following code to confirm your identity:
> 231342
> If this wasn’t you, please [Report this user] to secure your account.”

Instead of linking to a phishing website, which is most common with emails like this, both the “Report this user” and “Remove your email address” links are mailto: links. Clicking on a mailto: link opens your default email program with a pre-addressed message with the subject line “Report this user to secure your account” or “Remove your email address from this account” for the second link.

The email addresses in these links all had unsuspicious looking domains, made to look similar to legitimate ones. We call this technique of registering domain names “[typosquatting](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/06/explained-typosquatting).”

In the case we researched the email addresses were:

* `prestige@vacasa[.]uk.com` (typosquat of vacasa.com vacation rentals)
* `ministry@syntec[.]uk.com` (typosquat of syntechnologies.co.uk hardware provider)
* `technique@pdftools[.]com.de` (typosquat of pdf-tools.com software provider)
* `service@boss[.]eu.com` (several possibilities)
* `threaten@famy[.]in.net` (science news site, possibly compromised)
* `difficulty@blackdiamond[.]com.se` (known malicious domain)
* `anticipation@salomonshoes[.]us.com` (typosquat of salomon.com running shoes)

We sent an email to these addresses from a dummy account to see what happened. Unfortunately, most of them were dead in the water when our email reached them. However, we did find that a lot of the servers were hosted at the same [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address).

Research of the IP address showed that there were many more domains set up, likely with the same objective in mind.

## Why mailto: links?

Many email filters look for links to malicious domains and new ones get added fairly quickly, so the domains and emails are only useful for one day (on average). Using mailto: links can therefore help attackers avoid automated flagging or URL reputation checks.

It also saves the cybercriminals work. They don’t need to set up a fake website, which in this case would be an Instagram clone, or all the back end infrastructure needed to harvest the credentials. All they need to do now is watch the email inbox and wait for victims.

Receiving an email validates that the email address the phishing mail was sent to is active and someone is using it. That opens the victim up for further attempts. By engaging in a conversation, attackers can directly request [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) in a less obvious way than with a phishing form, often through continued corresponde...
