We have several important book updates for March. First, we are releasing our next digital guide, [OSINT Techniques: The Ultimate Virtual Machine](https://inteltechniques.com/book1b.html). The details are below.

It provides our entire playbook which we use to build, configure, clone, export, backup, and wipe out our investigative environments. **All expired and outdated methods and applications were replaced with new functioning techniques, and brand-new programs were introduced throughout.** For this release, **we transition from Ubuntu to Debian** for a more private and stable environment, and also explain all tasks required to maintain your investigative machines. New downloadable scripts automate the entire installation process and all data search programs. **All updates are free and delivered digitally**. The outline is below.

If you created your own configuration following the tutorials in the guide, we recommend starting fresh with a new build for longevity. If you used (or prefer) the pre-configured scripts, we recommend importing the new option for your device and configuring your desired server. Always make a export/backup first!
