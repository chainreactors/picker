# jsmug - JSON Smuggler

`jsmug` is a simple PoC code for JSON smuggling technique. JSON smuggling technique takes advantage of insignificant bytes in a JSON document to smuggle arbitrary files.

## Usage

### Compilation:

```
$ gcc jsmug.c -o ./jsmug
```

### Encoding file:

```
$ ./jsmug encode <input_file_name> <output_file_name> <bytes_per_pair>
```

**Example:**

```
$ ./jsmug encode ./malicious-binary encoded-binary.json 20
```

In the below example, We encoded `naabu` binary in a JSON file named `sweet-document.json`.

### Decoding file:

```
$ ./jsmug decode <encoded_file_name> <output_file_name>
```

**Example:**

```
$ ./jsmug decode ./encoded-binary.json decoded-binary
```

In the below example, We decoded the `sweet-document.json` JSON file generated earlier to retrieve original `naabu` binary named `decoded-binary`.

## Background

As per the [JSON RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2), Certain bytes known as insignificant bytes are allowed at certain positions in a JSON file. These insignificant bytes carry no meaning in a JSON document and hence are ignored by JSON pa...
