The current SOC model relies on a scarce resource: human analysts. These professionals are expensive, in high demand, and increasingly difficult to retain. Their work is not only highly technical and high-risk, but also soul-crushingly repetitive, dealing with a constant flood of alerts and incidents. As a result, SOC analysts often leave in search of better pay, the opportunity to move beyond the SOC into more rewarding roles, or simply to take much-needed breaks. This high churn rate puts the SOC in a vulnerable position, jeopardizing the overall effectiveness of cybersecurity operations.

To keep your team resilient and maintain operational efficiency, it's essential to take proactive steps to reduce burnout and improve retention. Here are five strategies that can make a difference.

## Why Analyst Burnout Matters More Than Ever

SOC analyst burnout is becoming a critical issue as the cybersecurity landscape evolves. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face a growing number of daily alerts to investigate, with 97% of organizations seeing year-over-year increases in the number of alerts generated, according to the [Osterman Research report, "Making the SOC More Efficient," (October 2024)](https://content.radiantsecurity.ai/2024-osterman-research-making-the-soc-more-efficient). This surge is overwhelming for analysts, who are responsible for triaging and investigating a flood of data daily.

Compounding this issue is the escalating backlog of unaddressed alerts and incidents. The same report reveals that 89.6% of organizations are experiencing a continuous rise in their security backlogs. As the number of alerts grows, so does the pressure on SOC teams to manage them. Yet, with only 19% of alerts typically addressed, the workload becomes a vicious cycle, leading to unrelenting pressure on the analysts.

This unmanageable workload contributes directly to work-related stress and burnout. Alarmingly, 80.8% of respondents expect this stress to worsen over the next two years if current SOC approaches are not improved. SOCs cannot afford to lose more analysts, yet the cybersecurity talent pool is shrinking. According to the ISC² Workforce Study 2023, there are currently 4 million open cybersecurity roles in the U.S., an 8% year-over-year increase. With 67% of organizations already reporting staff shortages, each analyst's departure compounds the problem, leading to further strain on those who remain.

Given these challenges, it's critical to ease the burden on SOC analysts. Automating routine tasks, enabling employee growth, and fostering a healthier work-life balance are essential to prevent burnout. Organizations must invest in their SOC teams now to ensure they can keep up with evolving threats while maintaining a healthy, sustainable workforce.

## 6 Simple Steps to Eliminate SOC Analyst Burnout:

For a smooth operating SOC, it's essential that leaders take proactive steps to reduce burnout and improve retention. Fortunately, it's now easier than ever to implement meaningful changes that positively impact the daily lives of SOC analysts. Here are 6 key steps for reducing analyst burnout:

### **1. Automate Alert Triage & Investigation**

The harsh reality is that there simply aren't enough human analysts to handle the overwhelming volume of alerts flooding today's SOCs. This means crucial work often gets filtered out, or worse, left unfinished altogether, increasing the risk of missing critical threats. Every alert needs to be reviewed in order to reduce risk, however SOC automation efforts haven't been able to fully replicate the nuanced decision-making of human analysts when it comes to triaging and investigating alerts. This has left humans in the driver seat for investigation.

With the recent advancements in [agentic AI](https://radiantsecurity.ai/analytics-vs-co-pilots-vs-agents/), we're seeing a breakthrough in SOC automation. AI is now capable of automating up to 90% of the tier 1 tasks that once bogged down human analysts. This not only ensures that critical alerts are addressed faster but also frees up analysts to focus on more complex, rewarding work. By shifting the tedious, repetitive tasks to AI, organizations can mitigate the risk of missed attacks while offering their human analysts more fulfilling roles that reduce burnout and increase retention.

### **2. Change the Nature of Analyst Work**

A fundamental shift in the SOC model is needed to move analysts from "doing the work" to "reviewing the output of AI." This transition comes with several significant benefits. First, it eliminates the tedious, repetitive tasks that often lead to burnout, allowing analysts to focus on more strategic decision-making, skill building, and higher value work. Second, it exponentially boosts productivity, as what once took an analyst 40 minutes to complete can now be done in seconds by AI.

The key to making this model successful is leveraging Agentic AI that functions as a true [AI SOC analyst](https://radiantsecurity.ai/analytics-vs-co-pilots-vs-agents/). These tools deliver decision-ready results, including a triage verdict, incident scope, root cause analysis, and a detailed action plan. With this comprehensive information at hand, human SOC analysts can quickly grasp the situation, understand how the AI reached its conclusions, and confidently validate the results. From there, they can select the appropriate response actions, drastically reducing manual effort while ensuring swift and accurate...
