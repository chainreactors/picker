Arti is our ongoing project to create a next-generation Tor client in Rust.
We're happy to announce the latest release, Arti 1.4.4.

This release of Arti continues our development efforts towards supporting
multi-legged tunnels in Arti via our [Conflux](https://spec.torproject.org/proposals/329-traffic-splitting.html) feature. We have also continued
preparing Arti for support of our [Counter Galois Onion proposal](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/583) feature.

In addition to the ongoing client feature efforts, the Network Team continues
to work towards making Arti ready for use by our Relay Operators, who run the
Tor network. However, no user-visible changes have occurred in this direction
for this release, but the team continue working on the internals of Arti to
make it ready for Relay and Bridge support.

For full details on what we've done, including API changes, and for information
about many more minor and less visible changes as well, please see the
[CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#arti-144--5-june-2025).

For more information on using Arti, see our top-level [README](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/README.md), and the
documentation for the [`arti` binary](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/crates/arti).

Thanks to everybody who's contributed to this release, including hjrgrn, Lionel
Goffaux, Neel Chauhan, Niel Duysters, playbahn, retort-dev, shivam37483,
syphyr, Tobias Stoeckmann, and Vijaya Bhaskar.

Also, our deep thanks to the [Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/), and
our [other sponsors](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors/) for funding the development of Arti!
