Webinar Managing endpoints efficiently has perhaps never been more important or more complex.

The sheer volume of software updates and security threats can overwhelm organizations relying on manual processes for patching and vulnerability remediation. This not only consumes resources but also leaves systems vulnerable to attack.

On [December 9th at 9AM PT/12PM ET/5pm GMT](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32986/automating-endpoint-management), Harman Kaur from Tanium will be joining The Register's Tim Phillips to discuss how automation is transforming endpoint management.

**Key points of discussion include:**

-  The challenges of endpoint management: Harman will highlight how the proliferation of devices and software updates complicates endpoint security. Legacy tools often struggle to keep up with the scale and speed required in modern environments.

- The role of automation: By automating key processes such as patching and vulnerability scans, IT teams can shift their focus from repetitive tasks to strategic initiatives. Hear how automation reduces human error and accelerates response times, ensuring endpoints remain secure.

- Implementing autonomous endpoint solutions: Harman will demonstrate how organizations can integrate automation into their workflows using Tanium's solutions. These tools offer real-time visibility and control, making endpoint management more effective and less resource-intensive.

[Join this webinar](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/32986/automating-endpoint-management) to learn how autonomous solutions can transform endpoint management in your organization. Don't miss this opportunity to modernize your IT approach and protect against evolving threats.
