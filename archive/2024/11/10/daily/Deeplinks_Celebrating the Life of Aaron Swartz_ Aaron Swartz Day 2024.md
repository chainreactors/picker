Aaron Swartz was a [digital rights champion](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/farewell-aaron-swartz) who believed deeply in keeping the internet open. His life was cut short in 2013, after federal prosecutors charged him under the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa) (CFAA) for systematically downloading academic journal articles from the online database JSTOR.

Today, November 8, would have been his 38th birthday.  On November 9, the organizers of [Aaron Swartz Day](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/episode-7-aaron-swartz-podcast/) are celebrating his life with a [guest-packed podcast](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/episode-7-aaron-swartz-podcast/) featuring those carrying on the work around issues close to his heart. Hosts Lisa Rein and Andre Vinicus Leal Sobral will speak to:

* Ryan Shapiro, co-founder of the national security  transparency non-profit Property of the People
* Nathan Dyer of SecureDrop, Newsroom Support Engineer for the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
* Tracey Jaquith, Founding Coder and TV Architect at the Internet Archive
* Tracy Rosenberg, co-founder of the Aaron Swartz Day Police Surveillance Project and Oakland Privacy
* Brewster Kahle founder of the Internet Archive
* Ryan Sternlicht, VR developer, educator, researcher...
