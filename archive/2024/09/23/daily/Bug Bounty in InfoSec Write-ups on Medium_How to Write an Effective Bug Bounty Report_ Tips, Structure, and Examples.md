In the bug bounty world, the quality of your report can make or break your submission. The finding a bug is the first step but writing a report is the most important part of a bug bounty hunting. A well-written report not only helps the security team understand the issue but also increases your chances of getting a higher bounty. Over time, I’ve developed a structure and approach that has worked well for me. Here’s how you can write an effective bug bounty report.

The security team reviewing your report might not be familiar with the specific techniques or tools you used. Your report should be clear enough for someone with a general security background to understand the issue without needing extensive additional research.

### Follow a Clear Structure

* **Title:** Be precise and descriptive. The title should immediately give a clear idea of the vulnerability you’re reporting.
* **Summary:** Start with a brief overview of the vulnerability. This should include what the bug is, how severe it is, and what part of the application it affects.
* **Steps to Reproduce:** This is the heart of your report. Provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability. Include screenshots, code snippets, or any other evidence that helps illustrate the issue.
* **Attachments:** If you have any additional evidence, such as logs or video recordings, include them here.
* **Mitigation:** Offer suggestions on how the issue can be fixed. This shows that you not only understand the problem but also have thought about potential solutions.
* **Impact:** Explain the potential consequences of the vulnerability. How could an attacker exploit this bug? What kind of damage could it cause? Also explain the severity and cvss score according to your under standing.

### Be Clear and Concise

* Avoid unnecessary jargon. Use simple language and explain any technical terms that might not be immediately clear. Your goal is to make sure the person reading your report understands the issue without getting bogged down in complexity.
* Keep your sentences and paragraphs short and to the point. Long-winded explanations can confuse the reader.

### Use Visuals for Clarity

* Screenshots, diagrams, and even short videos can be incredibly helpful. They allow the reader to follow along with your steps more easily and can clarify complex points.
* For example, when I report a bug, I always include screenshots and video that highlight where the vulnerability occurs and the results of exploiting it.

### Be Objective and Professional

* Stick to the facts. Describe what you found, how you found it, and the evidence that supports your findings. Avoid making assumptions or exaggerating the impact of the bug.
* Professionalism is key. A well-organized and respectful report reflects well on you and can lead to more successful submissions in the future.

### Assign the Correct Severity

* Accurately determining the severity of the vulnerability is crucial. It helps the security team prioritize the fix and ensures that your report is taken seriously. Consider the potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation when assigning severity.
* The correct or nearly correct CVSS gives an idea of you to the team that how good u know about the reported bug so if they try to downgrade your provided score they have to give you the explanation to prove their assigning or you can argue on cvss.

> If you wanna read about how to assign correct cvss let me know in comment i will write an article for that.

### Revisit and Refine

* Before submitting, take the time to review your report. Check for any spelling or grammar errors,or if u are missing to add something and ensure that the steps to reproduce are clear and accurate. A polished report is more likely to be taken seriously.

### Example Report: Unauthorized Modification of Web Hosting Configuration

### Takeaways for Writing a Great Report

Write simple and short not make report lengthily with unnecessary writing always add Screenshots, diagrams, snippets , request and even short videos can be incredibly helpful. Stick to the facts and describe what you found without making assumptions. Clearly articulate the potential damage or misuse the vulnerability could lead to. Before submitting, review your report to ensure clarity and accuracy.

By following this approach, you’ll be able to write bug bounty reports that effectively communicate the issue, demonstrate your professionalism, and increase your chances of a successful submission.
