# Weekly Update 329

06 January 2023

Strap yourself in, this is a big one! Big video, big breach (scrape?), and a big audience today. The Twitter incident consumed a heap of my time before, during and after this live stream, but then I go and get a sudden itch to do stuff like the number plate capturing and, well, there goes even more hours I don't have. But hey, I love what I do and I have no regrets, I hope you enjoy watching this week's vid ðŸ˜Š

Oh - one more thing: today I set up [an *official* Mastodon account for HIBP](https://infosec.exchange/%40haveibeenpwned?ref=troyhunt.com). If you've got a footprint in the fediverse, please go and give the account a follow. There are a bunch of others out there that definitely aren't run by me, it's only this one, it only follows me personally and it has a verified website of [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) so should be easy to find even if you don't follow the link above.

1. [The old legacy rate limit for the HIBP API is now gone](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-have-i-been-pwned-api-now-has-different-rate-limits-and-annual-billing/) (loads of warning on this, but the stats show a lot of extra requests being rate limited since the change hit)
2. [The Deezer breach has been really poorly communicated on their behalf](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1610010254649221120?ref=troyhunt.com) (seems like they forgot to notify, well, *everyone!*)
3. [Looks like the scraped Twitter data all came by throwing previously breached email addresses at a vulnerable API](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1611111127605465091?ref=troyhunt.com) (you can't even blame Elon for that one... but you *can* probably blame him for the zero comms on the incident)
4. [I had way too much fun letting ChatGPT mess with a spammer](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1609828351107301376?ref=troyhunt.com) (he wasn't quite as amused as me ðŸ¤£)
5. [I've been playing around with capturing number plates via my Ubiquiti gear](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1610886320993505280?ref=troyhunt.com) (after more trialling today, my conclusion is that I need to get my hands on some of their new AI gear and stop trying to build this myself)
