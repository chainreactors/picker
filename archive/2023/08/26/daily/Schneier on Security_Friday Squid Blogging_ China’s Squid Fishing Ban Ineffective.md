## Friday Squid Blogging: China’s Squid Fishing Ban Ineffective

China [imposed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/10/china-moratoriums-on-fishing-do-nothing-to-protect-squid) a “pilot program banning fishing in parts of the south-west Atlantic Ocean from July to October, and parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean from September to December.” However, the conservation group Oceana analyzed the data and figured out that the Chinese weren’t fishing in those areas in those months, anyway.

<

Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China’s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban’s introduction.

“Ending squid fishing in areas where there is no fishing does nothing to protect squid,” said Oceana’s campaign director, Max Valentine.

John Warnock, a co-founder of Adobe who invented the PDF, has died. He was 82.

Widely known for creating the pioneering technology – in full, the portable document format – that changed the way documents are shared and printed, Warnock died on 19 August, Adobe said.

“John’s brilliance and technology innovations changed the world,” Adobe said. “It is a sad day for the Adobe community and the industry for which he has been an inspiration for decades.”

@ Mr Peed Off – Wow – I came here for a question about pdf’s and I see your post. Sorry to hear this but it indicates it’s time to move on. Deprecated tech is dangerous.

My question is in relation to this discussion a few years ago about the insecurities involving pdf’s. Some of which is highlighted here:

My question is do pdfs retain the MAC address and if so does anyone know if there are commercial tools that break open pdf’s? I’m not looking to break open a pdf for nefarious reasons, I solely want to prove to a major civil Court that this is being done.

My view is documents and their PDF’s are the cause of much attacks, not only carrying nefarious code but also for identifying the creator of the document and identifying enough information from the document to leverage an attack on the creator. I suspect the COTS vendors involved in this profit from this data collection and sale.

In 2023 it’s time to move away from all documents to purpose built applications that contain the data, but it doesn’t move. Data in transit is most vulnerable. Providing temporary view of data is much safer and auditable.

Something about Supply Chain, Microsoft, and Signing Keys.

Maybe you should not use Windows.

Just saying.

‘[Yevgeny] Prigozhin was convinced Haftar’s regime was infiltrated by French intelligence and the CIA. Even the Libyan uniform he would wear on trips to Libya was made in Syria and brought from there—ensuring no bugs or tracking devices could be inserted.’

@SpaceLifeForm

High rotate ad on the Ars page:
“Adversaries love to come in through Windows”

But nobody ever got fired for buying [ IBM | MS ]. Isn’t it about time somebody did get fired for that? After all it’s been going on for #more than 30 years, what rock have these people been hiding their heads under? Especially people who do business with govt, and especially the govt itself …

@ SpaceLifeForm, Bruce, ALL,

Re : Code Signing fail was long expected.

> “Something about Supply Chain, Microsoft, and Signing Keys.

Two issues there, one general, one specific,

1, Use of Code Signing.
2, Use of Microsoft Windows.

The logical fix for both currently can only be,

**Don’t have ANY external connections**

But,

**It’s not just Microsoft**

It’s all the consumer and general commercial OS and similar software suppliers have the same “Code Signing” and “Root of Trust” issues.

Whilst the real solu...
