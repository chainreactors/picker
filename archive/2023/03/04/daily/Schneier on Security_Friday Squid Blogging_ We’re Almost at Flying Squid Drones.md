## Friday Squid Blogging: We’re Almost at Flying Squid Drones

Researchers are [prototyping](https://newatlas.com/robotics/flying-robot-dragon-spidar/) multi-segment shapeshifter drones, which are “the precursors to flying squid-bots.”

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Dr. Timnit Gebru (ex-Google) spoke to MSM on the ethics of AI:

In similar vein our local print paper put behind a paywall their massaging of a puff piece from Microsoft’s Bill Borden suggesting the future of banking is in cloud based AI financial services. Why would he say that? Motley Fool has a graphic of MS’ revenue streams that might explain.

“Tony Robbins: Ok Hal, hypothetical situation; Which do you prefer, a girlfriend missing one breast or half a brain?

Hal: Hmmm, toughie. What about the remaining breast? Is it big?”

@Bruce, All:

I most highly commend this [long New York Magazine article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html) on LLMs like ChatGPT.

It’s organized around computational linguist Emily M. Bender, who has done her best to sound the alarm concerning harmful implications of this technology, co-writing in 2021

> We call on the field to recognize that applications that aim to believably mimic humans bring risk of extreme harms

In an interview, Bender said that we’ve learned to make “machines that can mindlessly generate text. But we haven’t learned how to stop imagining the mind behind it.”

The scope of the article includes ethics, underlying philosophical questions, and potential extreme dangers.

PS – In 2021, Bender and several co-authors wrote the paper “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?”

Two of those co-authors worked in Google’s “Ethical AI Team.” Per policy, Google reviewed and approved the paper. Then, Google changed its tune, and demanded that its staff remove their names from the paper. (One of them, Margaret Mitchell, changed her name on the paper to Shmargaret Shmitchell.)

Both Mitchell and another co-author — who left *her* name on the paper intact — were soon fired from Google.

Thou shalt not publicize the evil of the “don’t be evil” vortex.

@ MarkH

Re: Bender (not the robot)

I am now kind of worried about what role statistics recognizing octopuses, and probably squid too, are playing in world affairs.

The funny thing is after seeing the Squid post go up I was already pondering whether octopuses with their incredible muscular dexterity and ingenuity might be good candidates for somehow training as a ChatGPT.

@ MarH

From the article

“ LLMs, like the octopus, have no access to real-world, embodied referents.“

Iisn’t this just temporary ? ChatGPT can be extended to start consuming data on real world things and actions together with a language commentary on those things. Perhaps this extension will employ mobile robots. Once this training has built up, language inputs can cause it to “take action” in the open world arena. It still won’t be anything other than a computational process, but the simulation of human knowing will be even more convincing.

TPM 2.0 to receive update

Two major vulnerabilities found in the TPM2.0 Revisions 1.59, 1.38 and 1.16 which could potentially result in information disclosure or escalation of privilege.

impact assessment depends on what is at that memory location, which may vary across various TPM implementations & vendors

Additional instances may be identified because of the TPM Work Group ongoing analysis and may result in a larger scope of potential vulnerabilities included in TCGVRT0007.

The tiny chip will supply a unique code called a cryptographic key. If everything is normal, the drive encryption is unlocked and your device starts up.

TPM holds security keys including for any BitLocker encrypted drives.
‘https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-your-security-processor-tpm-firmware-94205cbc-a492-8d79-cc55-1ecd6b0a8022

If you plan on playing with any TPM settings (including BIOS settings) you may want to backup your data, disable Bitlocker and decrypt the drives first.
