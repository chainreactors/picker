SAP Fiori is the new user experience (UX) for SAP software and applications. It provides traditional business practices such as business approval, budgeting, accounting practices, and a variety of personal services.

SAP Fiori, Human Resources, Production, Finance, etc. It provides more than 300 role-based applications. When you open the SAP Fiori Home application, you will see a picture of a flower. Because Fiori means "flower" in Italian.

SAP Fiori provides all business functions in real time through an efficient workflow. It provides an easy-to-use, simple, and seamless workflow for businesses on desktops, smartphones, and tablets.

SAP Fiori supports multiple device applications, allowing users to start a transaction on a desktop/laptop and continue the transaction on a smartphone or tablet. SAP has developed Fiori Applications based on the user interface UI5.

**SAP Fiori Classic:**

Launched in 2013, the Fiori Classic marked the first major step towards improving the user experience of SAP's applications.

Focusing on simple, consistent, and responsible design, Fiori Classic aims to simplify tasks and provide users with a pleasant and responsive interface.

Fiori Classic design language is based on five principles: personality, adaptability, integration, simplicity, and happiness. These principles guide the development of end-to-end shared applications that meet the specific role of the user and adapt to a variety of devices and screen sizes while maintaining user relationships.

The launch of Fiori Classic has breathed new life into the SAP ecosystem and users are not limited to interactions and complexity. Instead, they get clean, intuitive, and focused work that leads to great results and shortens the learning curve for new users.

However, as technology and user expectations evolve, it is clear that further development is necessary to keep Fiori at the forefront of the UX Revolution.

**SAP Fiori 2.0:**

To solve the problems that arose and developed on the basis of the Fiori Classic, SAP introduced Fiori 2.0. As a step between Classic and Fiori 3.0, this release brings some important improvements to the Fiori environment.

One of the main points of Fiori 2.0 is the introduction of "Fiori Launchpad", an access tool that allows users to access all SAP applications in one place. Launchpad has a customizable and easy-to-use interface that allows people to organize tiles and apps according to their preferences and functions.

Fiori 2.0 illustrates the importance of integration with the SAP business operations suite, making it easy for users to navigate through related activities and change ports without leaving Launchpad.

**SAP Fiori 3.0:**

Fiori 3.0 is more than an update; It is a revolutionary process that rethinks the way users interact with SAP applications. This release sets new standards for flexibility, functionality, and intelligence by providing users with a personalized and exciting interface.

Fiori 3.0 promises to unleash their full potential and transform the way they use software by putting users at the Centre of design.

From the Fiori Launchpad, which combines all SAP applications into a single access point, to integration with smart technologies, Fiori 3.0 is ready to revolutionize the way they do business and those who use SAP's powerful solutions. Experience the future of business software as you unleash the magic of SAP Fiori 3.0, every interaction is a step towards perfection in the digital age.

**Exploring the transition from Fiori Classic to Fiori 3.0:**

SAP Fiori evolved from Fiori Classic to Fiori 3.0 for many important reasons, including technological advances, changing user expectations, and the need to provide more familiar and modern use.
