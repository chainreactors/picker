Hello all, After long time writing another writeup. In this writeup I will share my another 6 months of work done I have done in bug hunting. During this 6 months mostly I have not reported many bugs as I am busy in other stuffs. So I have left doing bug hunting around 2–3 months ago. But still this are all the stats in big platforms. So let’s get started..!

If you read my writeup:

[## My First year in Bug Bounty 👨‍💻

### Hello all, In this write-up I summarizes my year in bugbounty on all big platform, self hosted and all the numbers…

infosecwriteups.com](/my-first-year-in-bug-bounty-10994de47849?source=post_page-----8469f3ca230f---------------------------------------)

In the writeup, I have shared my full story of hunting for 1 year. I have stated all the big platforms stats and all you can read that one too. As from that writeup I mentioned at last that **9** bugs are still in **Triaged** stats. So I will also explain that story too.

Now let’s come to the main point:

1. **All Triaged Bug Stats of 2024:**

As I told in my last writeup that I have 9 bugs which are in triaged state now let’s talk all that one what happened with it?🤔

1. I have reported a bug through bugbountys.com platform in **Dec 2024** but still I didn’t get any response from their side. The bug was already fixed and the vulnerable domain is already removed but I never got any single response yet 😢.

**2**. I have reported a bug to **Paytm** through their bug bounty portal and waited for many times. Even I have chatted with them through X(twitter). Firstly I don’t get any response but then after consistently saying they listened me 🤗 And within 2–3 days they resolved the bug. But then I never got any response back from them and I have never been recognized from their side 😭. I even do tweet about it but still no response from their side..!

**3 & 4**. I have reported 2 bugs to a self hosted program. But I have not got any single response from their side also.

**5 & 6**. I have reported 2 bugs to BBC. At first they told me that 1 bug was not a valid and they simply not consider it. But the another one they replied me that the bug was **valid** and they are working on fix. But then after again no response from long time and then after consistently asking for update they finally told me this:

But again not a proper response from them and this two reports are also closed as Not valid 😭💔🤡.

**7.** I have reported bug through Comolho platform on Dec 2024, And till now still the bug was in triaged state and recently the team started working on fixing the bug.

Recent mail come from the team

**8.** I have reported bug to **WHO( World Health Organization).** Which was triaged and consider as a valid🤗 and Finally after lots of rejections I was rewarded a HOF in WHO.

Awarded HOF ❤

**9.** I reported bug to Samsung on 13th Nov, 2024. Which was considered as a valid and I was awarded with the sweet bounty 🤑. Which was actually my very first bounty (in dollars) after 1 year of hardwork. As I already attached the screen short of proof in the bugcrowd section.

Author got his first bounty 🤗

So, the final states are:

**9 bugs are in triaged state in 2024**

**6 bugs are fixed but then No response 😢**

**2 bugs are rewarded ( 1 bounty + 1 HOF) 🤑**

**1 bug is still in triaged** 😶

Now, let’s come to the 2025, 6 months stats:

**2. All big platform stats:**

Because during this 6 months I have not do more hunting so I have stats only on **Bugcrowd**, **Comolho** platform.

1. [**Bugcrowd**](https://bugcrowd.com/)**:** In this platform during this 6 months I have only reported 1 bug and which was accepted as a **P3 Informational.** But after reporting bugs to samsung. They are using bugcrowd payment process to do payments. So In total 3 bugs are confirmed and got paid to me through this platform and for every valid bug I got the points. So in total I have scored **14 points.** Firstly which was at **-1.** And Now It was 14. It feels great 😊.
