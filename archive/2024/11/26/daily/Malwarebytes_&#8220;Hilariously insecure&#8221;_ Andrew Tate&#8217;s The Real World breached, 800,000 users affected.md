# “Hilariously insecure”: Andrew Tate’s The Real World breached, 800,000 users affected

Posted: November 25, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Andrew Tate’s online education platform The Real World—formerly known as Hustlers University—has been hacked and user data has been stolen.

Hacktivists flooded the primary chatroom with emojis as proof that they had breached the site. After this they shared approximately 794,000 usernames of, allegedly, the site’s current and former members with the [Daily Dot](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/andrew-tate-the-real-world-hack/) and journalism collective [DDoSecrets](https://ddosecrets.com/article/andrew-tate-s-the-real-world).

The stolen chat logs originated from the platform’s 221 public and 395 private chat servers. Included in the data are 794,000 usernames for current and former members, and 324,382 unique email addresses that appear to belong to users who were removed from the main database after they stopped paying their subscriptions.

It’s not clear if this set of email addresses came from a less secure environment or whether the hacktivists just stumbled over those first. A source close to the hacktivists say the platform’s security is “hilariously insecure.”

An unpatched vulnerability meant they could “upload emojis, delete attachments, crash everyone’s clients, and temporarily ban people.” All of this must be painful for a platform that claims to teach “all digital skills.”

Highly controversial figure Andrew Tate has not responded to the breach yet.

This could be because he is facing other problems. He’s currently under house arrest in Romania, facing trial after being [charged with rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64125045) to sexually [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) women. He is also wanted in the UK to face allegations of sexual assault. He denies all the allegations.

Anyway, there are reasons why clients, especially those that stopped payments, would not like to be associated with The Real World.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)).** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can’t be phished.
* **Watch out for fake vendors.** The thieves may contact y...
