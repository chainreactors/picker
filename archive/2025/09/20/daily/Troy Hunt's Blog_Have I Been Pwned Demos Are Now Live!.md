# Have I Been Pwned Demos Are Now Live!

19 September 2025

Well, one of them is, but what's important is that we now have a platform on which we can start pushing out a lot more. It's not that HIBP is a particularly complex system that needs explaining in any depth, but we still get a lot of "how do I..." style questions for the fundamentals. Stuff like "how do I search our domain", which is why that's now the very first video we have in the series:

You'll also find this on the brand new demos page at [haveibeenpwned.com/Demos](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Demos?ref=troyhunt.com) where you'll soon be seeing many more examples that'll start with the basics, then become increasingly complex. The APIs in particular are the source of many support tickets, and we hope that these demos simplify them for the masses and save us some ticketing overhead in the process.

The demo is only five and a bit minutes, and I want to keep each one pretty succinct. If there's something you'd like to see explained, please drop me a comment below, and I'll do my best to create some material on it. In the meantime, check out [the brand new HIBP YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/%40HaveIBeenPwnedDotCom?ref=troyhunt.com) and give it some love, there's a lot more coming.

Incidentally, in checking the stats whilst preparing this, it seems that we now have 357k instances of someone monitoring a domain ðŸ˜² That includes almost a quarter of [the world's top 1k largest domains](https://tranco-list.eu/list/7NNYX/1000000?ref=troyhunt.com) too, so this is a very heavily used feature and was a logical place to get started.
