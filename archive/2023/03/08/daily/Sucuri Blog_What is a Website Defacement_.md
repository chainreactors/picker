![What is a website defacement? Signs and symptoms.](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/23-BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_What-is-a-defacement--820x386.jpg)

Defacement is easily one the most obvious signs of a hacked website. In these attacks, bad actors gain unauthorized access to an environment and leave their mark through digital vandalism, altering its visual appearance or content in the process.

In many cases, website defacements display social or political messages that are completely unrelated to the site’s original content — with the ultimate goal of blackmailing or embarrassing the website owner, enacting revenge, or promoting alternative viewpoints.

Unlike many other attacks, defacers seek attention and publicity; they often disclose contact information or a name so they can be associated with the defacement.

So, if you’re a website owner and you access your homepage one day only to find that all of hard work and content replaced with something like this, you may have fallen victim to website defacement:

## How do hackers deface websites?

Hackers deface websites by gaining unauthorized access to an environment. The methods can vary, but popular methods of entry include exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party plugins, brute forcing admin pages, or leveraging stolen login credentials.

Once a foothold has been established, the hacker can gain edit access to the website and make whatever changes they see fit.

Just as the methods of defacement will vary, the depth of the attack can also differ. It may be as simple as the website’s **index.php** file being modified. This kind of hack can be fixed by simply replacing the hacked **index.php** file with a clean copy.

But hackers may also go a bit deeper in their defacement and alter important core files as well. In this case, you may be looking at a more difficult [malware cleanup](https://sucuri.net/website-malware-removal/) scenario.

## Why do hackers deface websites?

While many hacks are designed to generate some form of value for the attacker, website defacements are typically a different kind of attack. Mostly, the defacer is just trying to share a message. In some cases, they’re just looking to flaunt their skills and leave a “calling card” to gain a bit of street cred, while others might deface a website for the sheer fun or challenge. But defacements can also be motivated by political, religious or ideological goals; for example, protesting a specific movement in an act of civil disobedience.

Regardless of the intent, finding your site with a “hacked by” message is something you’ll want to get resolved as soon as possible.

## Examples of website defacements

Website defacements tend to look like… well, what you might expect when you think of a stereotypical hack. Scary imagery like a skull and crossbones, biohazard symbols, or other imagery designed to draw attention to the hack.

Hackers will also take credit for the attack by leaving their mark or “signatures.” Most common hacker signatures are usually pretty generic with wording such as “hacked by”, “pwnd by,” “defaced by,” “Been Hacked By,” “YOU GOT HACKED,” and other such jargon.

Some hackers will even just go with plain text defacements:

Because the nature of these attacks is publicity, we’ve decided not to provide any of the most recent groups’ names.

## What are the consequences of a website defacement?

The consequences of a defaced website are much the same as any other hack — it’s just more obvious that your website’s security has been breached and the environment has been tampered right off the bat.

Trust will be immediately diminished when users visit a page that is clearly displaying signs of being hacked, which can have an immediate impact on your reputation, website sales, churn, and bounce rates.

And the longer you allow your website to display the defacement, the worse things will get. An outward-facing webs...
