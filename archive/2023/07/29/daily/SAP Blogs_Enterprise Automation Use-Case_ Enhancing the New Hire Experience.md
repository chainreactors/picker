### **Introduction:**

**Enterprise automation** is a key driver for organizations aiming to stay ahead in a competitive landscape. It involves identifying and automating business and IT tasks to streamline operations, increase efficiency, and improve business outcomes. SAP provides a comprehensive solution to enable enterprise automation, encompassing various components.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/07/Blog7.jpg)

One essential element is **SAP Integration Suite**, which serves as an integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS). It offers pre-built integrations, APIs, and connectors to seamlessly connect SAP and non-SAP applications, reducing complexity across on-premises and multi-cloud environments.

Another integral part is **SAP Signavio**, which empowers organizations with visibility into their business processes. It helps identify potential bottlenecks, perform root-cause analysis, and offers suggestions for improvement based on industry benchmarks and best practices.

Furthermore**, SAP Build** provides a low-code solution for creating automations and applications. With a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface, business experts can rapidly address process inefficiencies and build customized automations. SAP Build also includes pre-built automations and connectors for both SAP and non-SAP systems.

By leveraging these components, organizations can gain valuable insights into their processes, automate tasks, and achieve optimized efficiency without introducing complexity to their existing IT landscape. Enterprise automation with SAP enables businesses to drive digital transformation, increase productivity, and deliver superior outcomes.

### **Business Problem:**

The onboarding process is a crucial activity in any organization, influencing the experience and success of new hires. I personally am a working student at sap, who rotates every 6 months to a new department. As a result of this, I regularly face the onboarding process with new trainings and system accesses required in order to support the team. From this experience I can say, if not done right, the onboarding process can involve manual and repetitive tasks, leading to inefficiencies and delays. This is why organizations need a solution that enables seamless integration, process automation and customization to provide a personalized onboarding experience for new hires.

### **Solution:**

The SAP Integration Suite, in combination with SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Signavio, offers a comprehensive solution to address the challenges in the onboarding process. By leveraging event-based integration patterns, low-code/no-code workflows, and the power of the Business Technology Platform, organizations can extend and customize the onboarding experience, integrate with third-party tools, automate activities and streamline shared-service processes.

### **Step-by-Step Workflow:**

**Step 1. Identify Process Gaps:** Utilize SAP Signavio Process Intelligence to analyze the onboarding process, identify inefficiencies, and gain insights into manual and repetitive tasks. The following manual steps can be identified:

* Requesting equipment for New-Hires

* Raising service tickets for system access

* Setting up employees with external benefits providers

* Assigning the correct enablement training for the new hires

**Step 2. Subscribe to business events in SAP SuccessFactors:**

The process starts with adding a new hire in SAP SuccessFactors. The information will be put in directly in the system. To automate this process, we will leverage the Advanced Event Mesh and subscribe to SAP SuccessFactors, which enables communication and triggering of workflows across systems. Whenever a new hire is added an event is created which will be needed for triggering a workflow.
