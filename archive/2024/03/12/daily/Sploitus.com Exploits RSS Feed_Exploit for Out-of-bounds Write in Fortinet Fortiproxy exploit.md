## Usage
The script supports two modes of operation:
Single check: You can provide a hostname and port as command-line arguments to check a single host.
```
python3 check-cve-2024-21762.py
```
Mass scanning: You can provide a file containing a list of host URLs in the format hostname:port, and the script will scan each host listed in the file.
```
python3 check-cve-2024-21762.py host_URL.txt # :
```
For each host, the script sends two POST requests: a control request and a check request. Based on the responses received, it determines whether the server is vulnerable or patched. The output includes color-coded status messages for easy identification: Vulnerable status is displayed in red, while Patched status is displayed in green. Additionally, it provides warning messages if the server does not appear to be a Fortinet SSL VPN interface or if the connection fails.
