Advanced, a managed software provider to the UK National Health Service, has confirmed that customer data was indeed lifted as part of the attack by cyber baddies that has disrupted operations for months.

The attack was first noted August 4 when Advanced promptly [pulled a portion of its infrastructure offline](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/05/major_outage_at_it_service/) to contain the spread of infection to other systems. As such, a range of sites hosted for clients were unavailable.

The incident disrupted healthcare customers, forcing NHS 111 medical services operators, for example, to revert back to pen and paper as digital services went AWOL, sources told us at the time.
