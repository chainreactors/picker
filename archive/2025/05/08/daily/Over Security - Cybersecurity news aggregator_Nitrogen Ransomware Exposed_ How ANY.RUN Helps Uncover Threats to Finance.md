Nitrogen Ransomware Exposed: How ANY.RUN Helps Uncover Threats to Finance

The financial sector is heavily targeted by cybercriminals. Banks, investment firms, and credit unions are prime victims of attacks aimed at stealing sensitive data or holding it hostage for massive ransoms. One emerging threat in this landscape is Nitrogen Ransomware, a malicious group discovered in September 2024.

It has since then been notoriously renowned for several successful attacks like that on SRP Federal Credit Union in South Carolina in December 2024. However, there is still a scarcity of information on the group’s TTPs, and this deficit highlights the value of solutions like [ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence and malware analysis suite](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=nitrogen_ransomware&utm_term=070525&utm_content=linktolanding).

## Why Financial Sector Is Vulnerable

The numbers don’t lie: in 2024, 10% of all cyberattacks targeted the financial industry, [according to reports](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/threat-intelligence-reports/q4-2024-threat-landscape-report-phishing).

From ransomware to financial fraud and cloud infrastructure exploits, banks and credit unions face all the kinds of threats that there are. The stakes are high — cyberattacks now cost organizations up to $2.5 billion per incident, with ransomware attacks alone spiking to 20–25 major incidents daily, a fourfold increase in financial losses since 2017.

Why is the [financial sector](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-investment-bank-improved-security/) so attractive? It’s simple: money and data. Financial institutions hold sensitive customer information and control vast sums of capital, which makes them tempting targets for ransomware groups like Nitrogen. Early detection and adversary tactics analysis are critical to minimizing damage, and that’s where services like ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=nitrogen_ransomware&utm_term=070525&utm_content=linktolanding) and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](http://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=nitrogen_ransomware&utm_term=070525&utm_content=linktotilookup) come in handy.

## Meet Nitrogen Ransomware

There are traces of Nitrogen from July 2023, but it’s consensual to track it from September 2024. It was initially observed targeting not only finance but also construction, manufacturing, and tech, primarily in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The routine was to encrypt critical data and demand a ransom to unlock it. One of their confirmed victims, SRP Federal Credit Union, a South Carolina-based institution serving over 195,000 customers, fell prey on December 5, 2024.

Little is known about Nitrogen’s tactics due to limited public data, but [a report by StreamScan](https://streamscan.ai/en/blog/analyse-du-rancongiciel-nitrogen/) provides a starting point.

It offers key indicators of compromise and some insights into the methods. Interestingly, Nitrogen shares similarities with another ransomware strain, LukaLocker, including identical file extensions for encrypted files and similar ransom notes. This overlap raises questions about their origins, but deeper analysis is needed to confirm connections.

The StreamScan report is the primary source of information on Nitrogen, detailing a few [critical IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/):

* **Ransomware File**: A malicious executable with the SHA-256 hash *55f3725ebe01ea19ca14ab14d747a6975f9a6064ca71345219a14c47c18c88be*

* **Mutex**: A unique identifier, *nvxkjcv7yxctvgsdfjhv6esdvsx*, created by the ransomware before encryption.

* **Vulnerable Driver**: truesight.sys, a legitimate but exploitable driver used to disable antivirus and endpoint detection tools.
