# Houthi-Controlled Port Receives Vessel from Occupied Crimea After UN Inspection Body Grants Clearance

*This article is the result of a joint investigation by Bellingcat and Lloyd’s List. The Lloyd’s List version of this piece can be found [here](https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1149882/UN-approved-shipment-of-grain-from-Crimea-to-Yemen-raises-oversight-concerns).*

A Russian flagged vessel was granted clearance by a UN inspection body to call at a Houthi-controlled port after surreptitiously exporting grain from a western sanctioned terminal in occupied Crimea, an investigation by Bellingcat and Lloyd’s List has found.

The bulk carrier, Zafar (IMO: 9720263), switched off its Automated Identification System (AIS) – that allows it to be tracked by shipping services and which commercial vessels are mandated to keep on unless in danger – when it visited the Port of Sevastopol in May this year.

Satellite imagery revealed the vessel’s presence at the port.

Zafar then switched AIS on after leaving Sevastopol and kept it on for its journey to Yemen, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence data. It docked in Djibouti in late June where it was given clearance by the United Nations Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM).

It is not clear if UNVIM knew that the shipment had come from occupied Crimea given Zafar sought to mask the fact it went there.

While there is no suggested illegality with this shipment, experts say it creates an awkward situation where a UN mechanism has waved through a grain shipment from occupied Ukrainian territory despite Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the fact that member nations have repeatedly voted against Russia’s actions towards its neighbour.

The UN General Assembly has passed a number of [resolutions](https://press.un.org/en/2014/ga11493.doc.htm) against Russia’s invasion of Crimea and eastern Ukraine dating as far back as 2014. It also [demanded](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/un-general-assembly-demands-russian-federation-withdraw-all-military-forces-territory-ukraine_und) Russia withdraw all military forces from Ukrainian territory following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But unlike some resolutions from the Security Council, on which Russia sits and has a veto, General Assembly votes are [not legally binding](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/the-un-general-assembly-condemns-russia-but-what-can-it-actually-do/).

The Port of Sevastopol is currently under [United States](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=18322) and [United Kingdom](https://search-uk-sanctions-list.service.gov.uk/designations/RUS0199/Entity) sanctions, while the terminal that Zafar docked in at Sevastopol is under [European Union](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main/details/member?search=%7B%22value%22:%22%22,%22searchType%22:%7B%7D%7D&member=%7B%22order_by%22:0,%22type%22:%22E%22,%22FSD_ID%22:142695,%22name%22:%22AVLITA%20Stevedoring%20Company,%20dok%C3%A1rska%20spolo%C4%8Dnos%C5%A5%20AVLITA,%20%D0%A2%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%90%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%22,%22id_code%22:null,%22reason%22:null,%22creation_date%22:1658354400,%22programme%22:%22UKR%22%7D) sanctions.

Importantly, however, there are no UN sanctions on the Port of Sevastopol or Russia.

Daniel Martin, a partner at the Holman Fenwick Willan law firm who specialises in international trade sanctions told Lloyd’s List: “[if] you look at this from the perspective of the global policy objectives of getting food into Yemen and preventing the entry of arms then UNVIM is fulfilling its mandate.”

“But if you look at the bigger picture, then it is likely that western countries would prefer that this happens without enriching sanctioned countries,” he added.

Material on the UNVIM website outlines that it has received “voluntary contributions and active support” from the likes of the EU, US Department of State, USAID and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Netherlands since it was set up in 2015.

It was not clear exactly where the grain carried by Zafar to Yemen was harvested, but some farmers in occupied eastern Ukraine have [previously](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/61790625) accused Russian forces of stealing grain that was subsequently exported.

Yemen is one of the world’s poorest countries. The decade-long civil war between the Saudi-backed internationally recognised government and Iranian-backed Houthi forces has led to thousands of deaths and a humanitarian crisis. The UNHCR [states](https://www.unrefugees.org/news/yemen-crisis-explained/) millions have been displaced and there is a risk of widespread famine.

UNVIM facilitates the movement of commercial items to Yemeni ports not under the government’s control, while also ensuring compliance with a UN arms embargo. As of 2018, UNVIM grants clearance for the Houthi-controlled ports of Hodeidah and Saleef (also known as As-Salif).

Merchant ships are required to submit a clearance request with supporting documentation, such as bills of lading and clearance from load port, to UNVIM prior to their arrival. Provided there are no issues UNVIM will grant clearance. If there are any suspicions regarding the ship’s movements, crew, documents, or prohibited cargo on board then UNVIM will inspect the ship.
