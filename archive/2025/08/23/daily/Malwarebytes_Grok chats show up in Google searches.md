# Grok chats show up in Google searches

Posted: August 22, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

I’m starting to feel like a broken record, but I feel you should know that yet another [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) has been found sharing private conversations so that Google was able to index them, and now they can be found in search results.

It’s déjà vu in the world of AI: another day, another exposé about chatbot conversations being leaked, indexed, or made public. We have written about the share option in [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/openai-kills-short-lived-experiment-where-chatgpt-chats-could-be-found-on-google) that was swiftly removed because users seemed oblivious to the consequences, and about Meta AI first making conversations [discoverable via search engines](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/your-meta-ai-chats-might-be-public-and-its-not-a-bug) and later [exposing them due to a bug](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/meta-ai-chatbot-bug-could-have-allowed-anyone-to-see-private-conversations). In another leak we looked at an [AI bot used by McDonalds](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/mcdonalds-ai-bot-spills-data-on-job-applicants) to process job applications. And, not to forget, the [AI girlfriend](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/ai-girlfriend-site-breached-user-fantasies-stolen) fiasco where a [hacker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) was able to steal a massive database of users’ interactions with their sexual partner chatbots.

In some of these cases the developers thought it was clear to the users that by using a “Share” option, their conversations were publicly accessible, but in reality, the users were just as surprised as the people that found their conversations.

This same thing must have happened at Grok, the AI chatbot developed by xAI and launched in November 2023 by Elon Musk. When Grok users press a button to share a transcript of their conversation, this also made those conversations searchable, and, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/08/20/elon-musks-xai-published-hundreds-of-thousands-of-grok-chatbot-conversations), this was sometimes done without users’ knowledge or permission.

For example, when a Grok user wants to share their conversation with another person, they can use the “Share” button to create a unique URL which they can then send to that person. But without many users being aware, pressing that “Share” button also made the conversation available to search engines, like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. And that made them available for anyone to find.

Even though the account details may be hidden in the shared chatbot transcripts, the prompts—the instructions written by the user–may still contain personal or [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) about someone.

Forbes reported that it was able to view “conversations where users asked intimate questions about medicine and psychology.” And in one example seen by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrkmk00jy0o), the chatbot provided detailed instructions on how to make a Class A drug in a lab.

I have said this before, and I’ll probably have to say it again until privacy is baked deeply into the DNA of AI tools, rather than patched on as an afterthought: We have to be careful about what we ...
