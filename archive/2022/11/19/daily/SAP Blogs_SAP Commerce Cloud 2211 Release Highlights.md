### **Drive Frictionless Experiences with an Extensible, API-enabled Headless Cloud Platform**

Customers today have many more digital channels to interact and make transactions with than in the early days of digital commerce. The expectations have risen during the pandemic as customers have increased the frequency and spend on digital channels. Organizations have had to adapt to this ever-changing landscape to quickly meet the customer demands.

Headless provides a way for organizations to quickly adapt and offer experiences across digital and emerging channels. Headless also helps organizations to differentiate and provide unique experiences tailored to their target audience.

This release of SAP Commerce Cloud includes new and enhanced sets of Omni Commerce Connect (OCC) APIs that support our customers to quickly meet their changing demands, including Assisted Service Module, customer 360 view, account summary, reCAPTCHA, customer ticketing, and Configure Price Quote (CPQ) and Variant Configurator (VC).

### **Gain Agility and Flexibility with a Composable, Decoupled Storefront**

Customers are continuously expecting more frictionless, seamless experiences. Delivering an immersive and interactive storefront across physical and digital is critical to fulfilling those expectations and driving engagement and loyalty among your customer base. In this release, we’re including our battle-tested modern storefront, previously made available as open-source project Spartacus. We’ve rebranded it and it is now available as SAP Commerce Cloud, Composable Storefront, a fully supported enterprise product from SAP.

SAP Commerce Cloud, Composable Storefront provides templates and enhancements for B2B and B2C use cases and it now includes:

* Screen reader and accessibility improvements that empower the visually impaired user to discover and shop for products more easily

* Integration of login and registration pages with SAP Customer Data Cloud to reduce implementation efforts and enables customization of forms to reflect the customer brand and business needs

* Additional convenience to delight users with small but powerful enhancements including add to cart from carousel, clear cart, show password, and more

* Improvements to the architecture that enables developers to release higher quality code quickly and with fewer bugs
