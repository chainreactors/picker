Fake installers for popular artificial intelligence (AI) tools like OpenAI ChatGPT and InVideo AI are being used as lures to propagate various threats, such as the CyberLock and Lucky\_Gh0$t ransomware families, and a new malware dubbed Numero.

"CyberLock ransomware, developed using PowerShell, primarily focuses on encrypting specific files on the victim's system," Cisco Talos researcher Chetan Raghuprasad [said](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/fake-ai-tool-installers/) in a report published today. "Lucky\_Gh0$t ransomware is yet another variant of the [Yashma](https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/new-yashma-ransomware-variant-targets.html) ransomware, which is the sixth iteration of the Chaos ransomware series, featuring only minor modifications to the ransomware binary."

Numero, on the other hand, is a destructive malware that impacts victims by manipulating the graphical user interface (GUI) components of their Windows operating system, thereby rendering the machines unusable.

The cybersecurity company said the legitimate versions of the AI tools are popular in the business-to-business (B2B) sales domain and the marketing sector, suggesting that individuals and organizations in these industries are the primary focus of the threat actors behind the campaign.

One such fake AI solution website is "novaleadsai[.]com," which likely impersonates a lead monetization platform called NovaLeads. It's suspected that the website is promoted via search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to artificially boost its rankings in online search engines.

Users who end up on the website are urged to download the product by claiming to offer free access to the tool for the first year, with a monthly subscription of $95 thereafter. What gets actually downloaded is a ZIP archive containing a .NET executable ("NovaLeadsAI.exe") that was compiled on February 2, 2025, the same day the bogus domain was created. The binary, for its part, acts as a loader to deploy the PowerShell-based CyberLock ransomware.

The ransomware is equipped to escalate privileges and re-execute itself with administrative permissions, if not already, and encrypts files located in the partitions "C:\," "D:\," and "E:\" that match a certain set of extensions. It then drops a ransom note demanding that a $50,000 payment be made in Monero into two wallets within three days.

In an interesting twist, the threat actor goes on to claim in the ransom note that the payments will be allocated to support women and children in Palestine, Ukraine, Africa, Asia, and other regions where "injustices are a daily reality."

"We ask you to consider that this amount is small in comparison to the innocent lives that are being lost, especially children who pay the ultimate price," the note states. "Unfortunately, we have concluded that many are not willing to act voluntarily to help, which makes this the only possible solution."

The last step involves the threat actor employing the living-off-the-land binary (LoLBin) "[cipher.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/cipher-exe-security-tool-for-the-encrypting-file-system-56c85edd-85cf-ac07-f2f7-ca2d35dab7e4)" with the ["/w" option](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cipher) to remove available unused disk space on the entire volume in order to hinder the forensic recovery of deleted files.

Talos said it also observed a threat actor distributing the Lucky\_Gh0$t ransomware under the guise of a fake installer for a premium version of ChatGPT.

"The malicious SFX installer included a folder that contained the Lucky\_Gh0$t ransomware executable with the filename 'dwn.exe,' which imitates the legitimate Microsoft executable 'dwm.exe,'" Raghuprasad said. "The folder also contained legitimate Microsoft open-source AI tools that are available on their GitHub repository for developers and data scientists working with AI, particularly within the Azure ecosystem."

Should the victim run the malicious SFX installer file, the SFX script executes the ransomware payload. A Yashma ransomware variant, Lucky\_Gh0$t targets files that are roughly less than 1.2GB in size for encryption, but not before deleting volume shadow copies and backups.

The ransom note dropped at the end of the attack includes a unique personal decryption ID and instructs victims to reach out to them via the Session messaging app for a ransom payment and to obtain a decryptor.

Last but not least, threat actors are also cashing in on the growing use of AI tools to seed the online landscape with a counterfeit installer for InVideo AI, an AI-powered video creation platform, to deploy a destructive malware c...
