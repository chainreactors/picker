Exodus Intelligence, the leader in Vulnerability Research, today announced it has been authorized by the CVE Program as a [CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)](https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/02/14/Exodus-Intelligence-Added-as-CVE).  As a CNA, Exodus is authorized to assign CVE IDs to newly discovered vulnerabilities and publicly disclose information about these vulnerabilities through CVE Records.

“Exodus is proud to be authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority which will allow us to work even more closely with the security community in identifying critically exploitable vulnerabilities,” said Logan Brown, Founder and CEO of Exodus.

The CVE Program is sponsored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in close collaboration with international industry, academic, and government stakeholders. It is an international, community-based effort with a mission to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The mission of CVE is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The discovered vulnerabilities are then assigned and published to the CVE List, which feeds the U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Exodus joins a global list of 269 trusted partners across 35 countries committed to strengthening the global cyber security community through discovering and sharing valuable cyber intelligence.
