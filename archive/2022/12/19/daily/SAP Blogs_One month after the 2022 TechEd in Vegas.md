Hello, SAP community,

In this blog, I want to share my exciting first live experience at TechEd Las Vegas 2022. The blog will be structured with *my personal feelings and experiences about this journey (you can skip my opinions written in italics)* and the SAP technical information I bring home. Just to provide context, I am a FIORI/BTP developer consultant enthusiastic about new technologies.

The chapters are structured in chronological order of my experience on November 15th and 16th.

### 15th

## Entrance and Keynote

Attending the Keynote

*After walking for 5 minutes down the long corridors of the hotel to get to the event reception, I quickly received my badge. A long corridor with breakfast offers everything. The quality was ok with a lot of choices for an event like that. I tried to talk with some attendees, but the moment of the keynote was near and I wanted to find the best place to sit. No problem for next time. In the front, you can usually find a good spot.*

SAP Build

The main SAP news is definitely SAP Build, which has the purpose of allowing users to build apps, automate processes, and create unified experiences with drag-and-drop simplicity.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/SAP_Build1.png)

<https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/16/sap-build-is-out/>

The framework combine three new masterpieces and renaiming from SAP box.

* SAP AppGyver => SAP Build Apps

* SAP Launchpad => SAP Build Workzone Standard Edition

* SAP Workzone => SAP Build Workzone Advance Edtiion

* SAP Process Automation => SAP Build Process Automation

I will explain more about SAP Build later, *but what I appreciate about this new offering from SAP is the easy integration between the tools, which is particularly evident in SAP Build Apps.*

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/Coursera.png)

Another important news is the partnership with Coursera. Technology is constantly evolving, and customers demand valid knowledge of the SAP world from us. This new partnership helps outsiders to get deep into the process and Coursera is a trusted program.
*From my perspective, the new SAP Learning still has my attention. I was a fan of Open SAP and the developer site. I hope SAP Learning grows and becomes an access point for our technical developers and that the SAP Certification becomes a validation for our customers. Coursera offers something in the middle, more about processes and management. The question is, how will customers consider a Coursera Certification compared to an SAP Certification?*

<https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/19/multitenant-saas-applications-on-sap-btp-using-cap-tried-and-true/>

*Another topic that deserves attention is SAP's Cloud Application Programming (CAP) and multitenant applications. I am aware that CAP (like SAP's original Application Programming Model, or RAP) is the framework of the future for SAP. I can see the potential and the possibility to combine multiple resources is definitely a new fundamental feature of this framework. Unfortunately, I have not yet applied this technology in my projects, but I will keep an eye on it.*For more information I invite you to follow the blog series of martinf and alperdedeoglu.

## *Hands-On (1) - Build and Extend Apps with the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)*

Hands-On RAP

*-------
I was lucky that a colleague explained to me that I could attend more than two hands-on sessions (the maximum number). If you stay in the queue outside the workshop at TechEd, you can participate in any presentation you want if there is enough space. It was not clear to me, as a new participant at TechEd. Also, the big screen near the hall with all the activities was not very useful: the titles were cut off and I couldn't easily find the rooms. Additionally, the assistance team was not informed about where the hands-on sessions were or the location of the rooms.*

Probably the best hands-on session. We went directly to a development exercise and the RAP in 2022 is the gateway to oData v4.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/RAP.png)
The possibility of creating the entire RAP model directly from a single table helped our developer a lot. It is possible with S4HANA 2022, but we have a few tricks for the old system:

1. Create all the RAP models in the new system and after transport in the older one (this necessity a review of the annotation)

2. Use the [Rap Generator](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/17/the-rap-generator/) by andre.fischer (also the host of the hands-on)

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/image-17-1.png)

Upload file

Also, the new RAP (and oData v4) impress me with the possibility of uploading a file from our FIORI Application generated simply with an annotation of the field.
And also the new "annotation" is **localized,**to expose a text field with the proper language without creating an association like before.

### Lunch and SAP Community Corner

*The possibility of meeting my old friends from Europe is the magic of SAP TechEd. Joining the SAP community from all around the world makes this place so special. I met mynyna.chau a long time ago at an SAP Inside Track i...
