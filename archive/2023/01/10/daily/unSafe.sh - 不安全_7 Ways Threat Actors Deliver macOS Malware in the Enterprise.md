Our [2022 review of macOS malware](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/top-10-macos-malware-discoveries-in-2022/) revealed that the threats faced by businesses and users running macOS endpoints included an increase in backdoors and cross-platform attack frameworks. Threats like [CrateDepression](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cratedepression-rust-supply-chain-attack-infects-cloud-ci-pipelines-with-go-malware/) and [PyMafka](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/use-of-obfuscated-beacons-in-pymafka-supply-chain-attack-signals-a-new-trend-in-macos-attack-ttps/) used typosquatting attacks against package repositories to infect users, while ChromeLoader and others like [oRAT](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-unsigned-macos-orat-malware-gambles-for-the-win/) leveraged malvertising as an infection vector.

However, the infection vector used by many other macOS threats remains unknown. [SysJoker](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/sneaky-spies-and-backdoor-rats-sysjoker-and-dazzlespy-malware-target-macos/), OSX.Gimmick, CloudMensis, Alchemist and the Lazarus-attributed [Operation In(ter)ception](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lazarus-operation-interception-targets-macos-users-dreaming-of-jobs-in-crypto/) are just some of those for which researchers still do not know how victims were initially compromised. In these and other cases, researchers happened across the malware either in post-infection analyses or by discovering the samples on malware repositories like VirusTotal, where the sample’s trajectory from threat actor through victim to discovery remains largely untraceable.

Although this gap prevents us from building a full picture of any particular attack campaign, fortunately we can as defenders enumerate the possible ways that malware can compromise a macOS system and analyze how malware has used these vectors in the past. Armed with this knowledge, we can look to build more resilient defenses and security policies to prevent threats gaining entry.

## 1. The Lure of Free Content

There is an abundance of macOS malware that is distributed through free content downloads sites such as torrent sites, shareware sites, cracked app sites or free 3rd party app distribution sites.

Content lures include:

* Cracked Software
* Live sports streaming sites – sports, geofencing evasion, digital rights management
* Movie, TV, Game and Music download sites
* Porn and sexual services sites

Free content lures are primarily used to drive adware and bundleware infections, but cryptominers such as LoudMiner have also been distributed this way.

The most common scenario is a user being offered free or cracked versions of an application; the user initiates a download of a disk image file purporting to contain that application but on mounting it finds that it is called something like “Flash Player”, “AdobeFlashPlayer.app” or similar. These files are usually unsigned and the user is given instructions on how to override macOS Gatekeeper in order to launch them.

As shown in the above image, this is a simple trick in the Finder that even non-admin users can use to defeat the Mac’s built-in security mechanism.

Some threat actors have recently been seen directing users to the Terminal to override Gatekeeper there, presumably to workaround any additional security controls that organization admins might have deployed via MDM (mobile device management).

![deployed via MDM (mobile device management)](https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/deployed-via-MDM-mobile-device-management.jpg)

Some users set out to seek legitimate content but are pulled into malicious sites through advertising and ‘too good to be true’ deals and offers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a widespread perception among Mac users that exploring such links is not inherently dangerous because Macs are “Safe” and “Don’t get viruses”. The nature of these sites, however, and the insistent use of popups, misleading icons and redirecting links can quickly lead a user from a safe search to a dangerous download.

Although the “Flash Player” lure is largely used by adware and bundleware campaigns, it was also seen in a long-running campaign by Chinese threat actors distributing [macOS.Macma](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/backdoor-macos-macma-spies-on-activists-but-cant-hide-from-behavioral-detection/). Other campaigns that have made significant use of this vector include [OSX.Shlayer](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/coming-out-of-your-shell-from-shlayer-to-zshlayer/), [Pirrit](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/a-threat-hunters-guide-to-the-macs-most-prevalent-adware-infections-2022/) and [Bundlore](https://assets.sentinelone.com/evilquest/how-shlayer-and-othe-1). These threats are well-detected by security vendors but [often missed](https://assets.sentinelone.com/c/enterprise-mac-security?x=fvgtlj#page=1) by Apple’s built in signature-based detection technology XProtect.

### How To Prevent Attacks via Free Content

Mitigating infections through this vector include:

* Controlling permissions relating to software downloads or launches via MDM and/or application allow/deny lists by a security product
* Restricting access to the Terminal via an MDM solution or a security product
* Restricting or preventing the execution of unsigned code with a security product
* Using endpoint protection software to prevent and detect known malware

## 2. Malvertising to Mac Users

Maliciously-crafted ads on webpages can run hidden code inside the user’s browser, redirecting the victim to sites showing popups with fake software updates or virus scan warnings. In [the past 12 months](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/top-10-macos-malware-discoveries-in-2022/), known malvertising campaigns aimed at macOS users include [ChromeLoader](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/top-10-macos-malware-discoveries-in-2022/) and [oRAT](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-unsigned-macos-orat-malware-gambles-for-the-win/).

ChromeLoader, also known as Choziosi Loader or ChromeBack, takes the form of a malicious Chrome extension that hijacks the user’s search engine queries, installs a listener to intercept outgoing browser traffic, and serves up adware to victims.

oRAT is a backdoor implant written in Go and is downloaded to the victim’s machine as an unsigned disk image (.dmg) masquerading as a collection of Bitget Apps. The disk image contains a package with the name Bitget Apps.pkg and the distribution identifier `com.adobe.pkg.Bitget.`
