## Shifting the Paradigm: Why Preemptive Cybersecurity is the Future

![preemptive cybersecurity](https://bfore.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/The-B-Line-Blog-Hero-Banner.png)

As a founder and business owner myself, as well as an IT industry professional, I’m advocating for a shift to a preemptive approach as a more effective way to handle cybersecurity. In this article, I’ll explain my reasoning, drawing from my own experiences, and how the innovative approach we’ve developed at BforeAI helps to meet this growing need.
