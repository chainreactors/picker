Universal “digital ID” proposal for Great Britain.

http s://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/world/europe/uk-digital-id-britcard-starmer.html

goal is to prevent working by “illegal aliens”.

The usual mission creep

“… respondents favoring the concept of a single card that could function as an ID, passport and driving license.”

with attendant unmitigated risks.

article notes that NHS uses a phone resident ID already, so roll that in the mix.

Where is Ross Anderson, need him right now.

I would lihe to hear from UK folhs, what really is the national mood about this?

Think twice before abandoning X11. Wayland breaks everything!

This GARBAGE software (Wayland) is being PUSHED on Linux users by MANY distributions and it is TRASH!

I have computers that work great with Xorg which are RUINED by Wayland. I get screen resolution incompatibility issues, frequent HARD freezes which require a hard reset, can’t use Window Manager(s) of my choice and so much more.

I long for wild west type of Linux Distributions which won’t bow to Wayland and corporations and instead keep Xorg.

Please think twice before supporting/using Wayland GARBAGE.

Read the article **“Think twice before abandoning X11. Wayland breaks everything!”** (on github) for a features comparison between Xorg and Wayland. I can’t link it here, I’ve tried, but it keeps going to moderation status…

@cls

I can’t speak for the national mood on this but here’s a couple of observations. For the most part the discussion is missing the point of a *digital* ID. Plenty of comments about how convenient an ID ‘card’ is, easy to carry around etc. And as usual it’s dog-whistle talk about the relatively trivial numbers of illegal migrants arriving, taking jobs or scrounging benefits. It’s hard to see what the digital ID can do to stop small boats crossing the channel. The consequences of having a centralised database linked to pretty much every aspect of life (residence, housing, jobs, healthcare, education, travel, officialdom) seem to go over the heads of most people.

That’s if it works. Which brings me to the second observation.

There’s no talk (that I’ve seen) about how this is actually going to be achieved and the UK has a shockingly bad track record for public mega-IT projects. It seems almost inevitable that the whole thing will be handed over to the private sector and the likes of Palantir must be licking their lips at the prospect. It wouldn’t surprise me if this aspect is kept under wraps for as long as possible. Data security and sovereignty? Privacy? Cost?

At the moment this is security theatre at the service of political grandstanding. It’s the Labour Party annual conference this weekend. Hard to know whether the Government actually believe in it.

@ cls, Robin, ALL,

With regards,

> “Universal “digital ID” proposal for Great Britain.”

It’s something that comes up again and again with the Tony Blair PM legacy (remember him, the one that was “Bush’s Poodle” that ran around Europe and other places making the fake WMD argument etc and then making the Gulf War happen because he wanted to be better than Thatcher…)

Well he was the man behind why,

> “There’s no talk (that I’ve seen) about how this is actually going to be achieved and the UK has a shockingly bad track record for public mega-IT projects”

He wasted around the equivallent of $40billion (in todays USD) on improving the NHS in two ways,

1, 20Billion on “clipboard consultants”

The aim was to move the UK NHS into a privatised “US Healthcare” system.

And Tony brought in the mad “Public Private Finance Initiative” which is sending billions abroad to Germany amoungst other places.

The reason Tony and friends could not manage a pocket book let alone a household budget… So imagine the disaster their political party funds were in… Lets just say it was criminal.

This is where the National ID comes in, Tony did lots of behind the back backhander deals with companies that have failed to produce National ID cards for other countries that lets just say have failed to be safe, secure or of any use even in some cases for the real purpose of surveillance.

There was befor Tony a cast iron rule in the UK Civil Service from knowing what the Nazis had done during the run up to and including WWII. The rule was all Government Dept records that we would now call “databases” would be kept separate and indexed independently and use different data formats so they could not be linked together.

Yes it made some things “inefficient” but it made,

“The safety of society”

Much much greater and secure from tyrannical, authoritarian, and worse politicians and Guard Labour in all it’s forms (think how military coups get rapid control and establish “police States” almost over night).

Well Tony sold not just the Farm for next to nothing to these companies he put the political party in perpetual hock to them, which is why they keep bringing up National ID cards…

National ID cards by the way do not work for Citizens… The trick to make it look like it does is to make the purchase of things Age bared like Alcohol and Tobacco. Then force regulation onto retailers by large fines etc which are in reality “revenue raising” for the Treasury. Thus they set it up so that retailers have no defence against this back door taxing that is so lucrative for the Treasury.

This makes the retailers make life difficult for selling to those with a disposable income and a strong desire to buy.

Then they say “A national ID Card” would make life easier for the retailers (when in reality it does not). With the retailers pushing it at customers… The customers get the fake idea it would make it more convenient for them…

To see just how dangerous this is it is known that Tony Blair started putting in place changes to “local land...
