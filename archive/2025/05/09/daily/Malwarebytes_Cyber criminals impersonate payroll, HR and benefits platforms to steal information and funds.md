# Cyber criminals impersonate payroll, HR and benefits platforms to steal information and funds

Posted: May 8, 2025

The relentless battle against online fraud is a constant evolution, a digital chase where security teams and malicious actors continually adapt. The increasing sophistication of attacks is blurring the lines between legitimate user behavior and impersonation attempts.

The campaign we are exposing today is a reminder that even the most advanced security technologies do not dissuade threat actors. We discovered a new [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) kit targeting payroll and payment platforms that aims to not only steal victims’ credentials but also to commit wire fraud.

Our investigation began with a fraudulent search ad for [Deel](https://www.deel.com), a payroll and human resources company. Clicking on the ad sent employees and employers to a phishing website impersonating Deel.

Beside stealing usernames, passwords and circumventing two factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication), we identified malicious code capable of performing additional nefarious actions unbeknownst to the victim. Using a fully authenticated web worker, this phishing kit is using a legitimate hosted web service called [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) with the intent of manipulating sensitive profile data fields related to banking and payment information.

While we were working this case, the FBI issued a public service announcement ([PSA250424](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250424)) warning people that cyber criminals are *using search engine advertisements to impersonate legitimate websites* and *expanded to target payroll, unemployment programs, and health savings accounts with the goal of stealing money through fraudulent wire transactions or redirecting payments*.

The Google ad was taken down quickly, and we have informed Deel and MessageBird (Pusher’s parent company) about the misuse of their respective platforms.

## Search results ad targets Deel

Deel is a US-based payroll and human resources company founded in 2019 Deel whose platform is designed to streamline the complexities of managing a global workforce, offering solutions for payroll, HR, compliance, and more.

We first identified a malicious Google Search ad for Deel in mid April for the keywords ‘*deel login*‘. The top link is a sponsored search result, appearing just above the organic search result for Deel’s official website.

The URL in the ad (*deel[.]za[.]com*) uses the .ZA.COM subdomain of .COM targeting South Africa, essentially an alternative to the .CO.ZA extension. That URL is used as a redirect only, allowing the threat actors to use cloaking in order to redirect clicks to decoy websites (white page) or phishing domains they can rotate.

## Phishing portal and 2FA

The first phishing domain we saw was *login-deel[.]app* but at the time we checked it did not resolve. Shortly thereafter, the same Google ad URL pointed to a new domain, *accuont-app-deel[.]cc*.

The phishing page is a replica of Deel’s login page with one minor difference: *the Log in using Google* and *Continue with [QR code](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-a-qr-code)* options are disabled, only leaving the user na...
