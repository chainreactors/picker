In episode 426 of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast, Graham reveals how you can hijack a train‚Äôs brakes from 150 miles away using kit cheaper than a second-hand PlayStation.

Meanwhile, Carole investigates how Grok went berserk, which didn‚Äôt stop the Department of Defense signing a contract with Elon‚Äôs AI chatbot. So who is responsible when your chatbot becomes a bigot?

Plus: Email headaches, SPF rage, and a glowing review for‚Ä¶ Taskmaster SuperMax Plus?

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
