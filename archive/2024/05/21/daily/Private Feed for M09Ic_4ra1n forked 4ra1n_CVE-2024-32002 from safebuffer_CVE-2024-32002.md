# CVE-2024-32002 RCE PoC

## Overview

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) for CVE-2024-32002, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Git submodules. The exploit demonstrates how a malicious payload can be triggered via a recursive clone of a Git repository.

## Repository Setup

Before running the PoC, create the following repositories on your remote Git server or feel free to change the names as needed:

* `hulk.git`
* `submod.git`
* `smash.git`

Update the repository paths in the PoC script accordingly if you change the names.

## Exploit Details

The exploit leverages Git submodules to execute a payload on the target system when the repository is cloned recursively. This PoC is tested on macOS.

### Define Repository Paths

```
HULK_REPO="git@github.com:safebuffer/hulk.git"
pullme_REPO="git@github.com:safebuffer/submod.git"

# Final Exploit Repo
SMASH_REPO="git@github.com:safebuffer/smash.git"
```

### Triggering the Exploit

To trigger the exploit, run the poc.sh script and then execute the following command:

```
git clone --recursive $SMASH_REPO
```

### Payload

The default payload in this PoC opens the Calculator application on macOS. You can change this to any payload of your choice.
