During investigations and trials, video is one of the most common and most effective forms of evidence, but unfortunately, it is often taken for granted. There are many challenges to consider in relation to video evidence, and we believe it is of crucial importance to understand how users around the world are handling these and how the trends are shaping the state of video forensics in 2022 and beyond. For this reason, we launched in July a survey to hear the thoughts and opinions of video evidence practitioners from around the world.

Many questions were raised, such as:

* *‚Äú**What are the most useful and common types of evidence during an investigation?‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúWhat are the main issues while working on video?‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúWhich kind of training did you receive on image and video forensics?*
* *‚ÄúHow long does it take to work on an image/video case on average?‚Äù*

We received some very interesting answers and discovered some useful key findings that will help us predict what are the upcoming trends that your agency, organization, and lab are facing or will soon need to face.

Here are **five** video forensics trends that you need to be aware of for 2023. Read on to find out the results!

## **Who participated in the survey**

The survey had a total of **140 respondents from 22 different countries**, with **United States** alone having almost half of the replies. About 95% of the respondents are users of our software.

The majority of the participants, by the way, belonged to a **Law Enforcement Agency**, mostly from an **Image/Video Analysis Unit** or a **Digital Forensics/Cybercrime Unit**.

## Trend 1: **Low image quality and video conversion continue to be the most common challenges with video evidence**

Similarly to the [previous survey](https://blog.ampedsoftware.com/2022/02/15/a-survey-on-video-evidence-the-highlights-from-the-amped-user-days-2021/) we launched in 2021 for the Amped User days, **low image quality** is by far the biggest issue (hence the popularity of our flagship product [Amped FIVE](https://ampedsoftware.com/five), which stands for ‚ÄúForensic Image and Video Enhancement), followed by the fact that most videos from CCTV are in a **proprietary format** (a problem solved by the Amped Conversion Engine also used by [Amped DVRConv](https://ampedsoftware.com/dvrconv) and [Amped Replay](https://ampedsoftware.com/replay)). Interestingly several respondents added as an important factor **the lack of knowledge about the challenges of images and videos** by stakeholders, like chiefs, customers, or colleagues working in less technical roles. This aligns very well with all the awareness initiatives we are doing at Amped and at the [European Parliament.](https://blog.ampedsoftware.com/2022/05/24/raising-awareness-on-video-evidence-at-the-european-parliament/)

You may also find interesting our introductory training course ‚Äú[Investigating Video Evidence](https://ampedsoftware.com/training#training-4)‚Äù to recognize what are the challenges and pitfalls faced when using digital multimedia evidence for investigations.

## Trend 2: **The amount of image/video casework is likely to increase over the next years**

We tried to understand the amount of work respondents have to do and if this has increased from 2020 to 2022.

The first question was, ‚Äú**How much time do you dedicate to an image/video case on average?**‚Äù Many didn‚Äôt give a specific answer, saying that it varies too much. For the others, these are the results, while just indicative, they are very interesting:

* Average: 2 days
* **Median: 5 hours**
* Minimum: 15 minutes
* Maximum: 1 month

The second was ‚Äú**Can you tell us, on average, how many image/video cases you work on per week?**‚Äù These are the results:

* Average: 7 cases per week
* **Median: 4 cases per week**
* Minimum: a few cases per year
* Maximum: 100 cases per week üò±

We then asked if the **amount of image/video casework increased with respect to three years ago,** and almost **75%** said that their workload increased in some way (more than 50% declares it increased a lot), which we believe it‚Äôs pretty interesting.

![image video casework](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ay8EXS-ZxjnuGG5DJTir5dbLbLS_ECfv1oL7KeuXkqzMr--pEe81tpl0ZIL7iXwJx0cmtXh_vpTdnOQXZ3YoWfcXP1wr04dqVVHZxZ-YMiVNyN4n_pT0bfEVbSpYkaKCbhSG3TG5EqdPfBj6RWpt26Ayrku8nXg5prYGI_Qvs2MlyVfxm02Eqg8YorBUpA)

But what are the reasons for this increase? You can see a summary of the responses below:

![casework](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vxI22nEm7Gadg4hpa9oyRhuKKMxmJ3pPwW539qufiD5GCyXalgxLWc1hZOyCYezw50INBpHrEXPpFgU2TYyPPdumEcVTnxtRbGpaM-8lJSXQxC8tq_KWwaMEN67ipMcO-H_js27NHXTRfGWDoZjxrRtdRkHC_8B25hGcAugLRvpMmyHDxtahRv8ijWAd1w)

Overall the two biggest factors for growth in the number of cases were the **increase in crime rate** and the change (supposedly an improvement) in **image and video quality**. Many mentioned the ever-increasing **amount of devices**, with strong growth, especially by **smart doorbells** and similar **cloud cameras** like Ring, Nest, and so on.

Also, the increase in cases handled locally or by investigators resulted in an important factor that could be further investigated.

Considering the increasing trend of image video casework, we expect the number of cases to grow further in 2023.

## Trend 3: **CCTV/DVR videos are the most common kind of evidence used to solve a crime**

How often different kinds of evidence are useful to solve a crime? The results here show the power and ubiquity of **CCTV videos** as a source evidence...
