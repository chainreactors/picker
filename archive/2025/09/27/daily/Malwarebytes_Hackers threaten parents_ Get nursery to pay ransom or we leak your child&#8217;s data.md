# Hackers threaten parents: Get nursery to pay ransom or we leak your child’s data

Posted: September 26, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Just when you think extortionists can’t sink any lower, along comes a lowlife that manages to surprise you.

The BBC [reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62ldyvpwv9o) that a group calling itself “Radiant” claims to have stolen sensitive data related to around 8,000 children from nursery chain Kido, which operates in the UK, US, China, and India.

The data the group says it stole includes names, photos, addresses, dates of birth, and details about their parents or carers. The hack also reportedly exposed safeguarding notes and medical information.

To prove their possession of the data, the criminals posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children on their darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand to Kido, threatening to release more sensitive data unless they were paid.

When contacted by the BBC about their extortion attempt, the group defended their actions, claiming to:

> “… deserve some compensation for our pentest.”

They should educate themselves before continuing. In most jurisdictions, to carry out this type of “penetration testing” legally, they need to get explicit permission from the company first (or choose a company that runs a bug bounty program).

As if stealing children’s data and publishing them on the dark web isn’t bad enough, Joe Tidy at the [BBC reported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q9SHh4-4r8) that the group also called some of the children’s parents—telling them to put pressure on the nursery chain to pay the ransom demand, or they’ll leak their child’s data.

If history has taught us anything, the next step is that they will try to extort the parents individually, as happened in the case of the [Finnish psychotherapy practice Vastaamo](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/psychotherapy-practice-hacker-gets-jail-time-after-extorting-patients-publishing-personal-therapy-notes-online). Trust me, these things never end well. In Vastaamo’s case, the clinic went bankrupt, at least one suicide has been linked to the case, and the attackers have been sentenced to jail time.

Kido has not issued a public statement. Although the investigation is ongoing, it has contacted parents to confirm the incident and offer reassurance.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened and follow any specific advice it offers.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. Better yet, let a [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) choose one for you.
* **Enable [two-factor authentication**(**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for)**[2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa))**.** If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone a...
