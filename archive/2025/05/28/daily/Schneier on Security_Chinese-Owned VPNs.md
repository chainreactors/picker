## Chinese-Owned VPNs

One one my biggest worries about VPNs is the amount of trust users need to place in them, and how opaque most of them are about who owns them and what sorts of data they retain.

A [new study](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apple-offers-apps-with-ties-to-chinese-military) found that many commercials VPNS are (often surreptitiously) owned by Chinese companies.

> It would be hard for U.S. users to avoid the Chinese VPNs. The ownership of many appeared deliberately opaque, with several concealing their structure behind layers of offshore shell companies. TTP was able to determine the Chinese ownership of the 20 VPN apps being offered to Apple’s U.S. users by piecing together corporate documents from around the world. None of those apps clearly disclosed their Chinese ownership.

Would it kill the authors to put everything in a list? You know, a numbered list with no extra text?

@ Bruce, ALL,

> “One one my biggest worries about VPNs is the amount of trust users need to place in them, and how opaque most of them are about who owns them and what sorts of data they retain.”

The simple answer to that is,

**“If you don’t own it from end to end then don’t trust it, mitigate it.”**

Which I admit can be more difficult than it sounds… Because many VPNs see you not as “customers but product” to be packaged up an sold on. Worse now is that legislation / regulation makes record keeping as “Third Party Business Records” for amongst other reasons “to protect the children” or more importantly to enforce entertainment industry and similar rent seeking extortion via IP rights extorted from content creators.

But that is from my perspective the tip of the iceberg.

Consider the first router upstream from either end of the VPN two things are known,

1, Where your packets are comming from.

This automatically makes you “A person of increased interest”.

Further is “traffic analysis” it can be done by simple correlation in time or the VPN operator could “tag your packets” in various ways.

The thing about “traffic analysis” is it may not be allowed to be entered into court, but there is this little thing called “parallel construction” which is an “after the fact” way of concealing “methods and sources” and getting things into court through what is a back door that nobody in officialdom will do anything but look the other way.

As has been seen before with operation Ore[1] you don’t need to be guilty just appear to be guilty in an observers eyes thus a prime candidate for a stitch-up show trial or bonus / promotion for the investigator or even a Medal (see UK and EncroChat phones). Nothing makes for success like corrupt officialdom.

Thus even using a commercial VPN for entirely innocent reasons is raising you up that list of people who are “singled out for closer inspection” as potential candidates for persecution and prosecution.

[1] Many of the accused under Operation Ore had not even been involved. What happened was a Chinese crime organisation had gained access to a UK supermarkets sales system and stolen their credit card and other information. This they then used to rack up fake charges on a non porn hosting site that acted as a gateway to porn sites. The thing is the Chinese just billed the host to get payment and the host operator build the users credit card and took it’s “finders fee”. It was this list of credit card accounts and an FBI forged web page that was used to claim everyone was downloading kiddy-prn when in fact few ever did (though a few that actually were, like the boyfriend of a prominent male UK politician got no action taken against them). A friend however went through hell and it destroyed his life, even though he could prove he was innocent… And people wonder why I don’t do online transactions and only pay cash.

The good ole’ commie scare will never get boring! I mostly use VPNs to bypass geo-blocked free legal TV. Yes TV stations run by the state itself which are not accessible outside the same state running it.

My DNS queries and the TLS packets, the spies can have. I’m boring and harmless.

I sometimes use tunneling through a strategically placed rented VPS to access geo-blocked sites of public institutions or media in a foreign country, for my own research/information. I guess I am a terrorist.

Moral of the story:

> Know whom you are doing business with. Most certainly when it involves your security or safety.

Now the $64k question:
Which VPNs are *not* owned by evil or untrustworthy entities?

ProtonVPN (Switzerland)?
NordVPN (Panama)?
…?

But more importantly, how can we make users actually care about security?

When Chinese companies started buying out all the VPNs around 10 yrs ago, I stopped paying annual subscriptions, since there are only about 5 that can be trusted and those usually cost 2-4x more than the other options.

When I need a VPN, like I did last weekend, spinning up a VPS, loading wireguard and connecting my clients to that $5/month VPS is quick enough and probably private enough. I haven’t tried using a smaller, cheaper, VPS – they do offer $2.50/month options which would probably work fine for my minimal needs, but in my use all weekend, I think the total price charged was under $0.10, so I don’t see the reason to bother going cheaper.

The setup is scripted to the point that I only need to manually enter the new public IP of the new VPS into my client wg-confg file. Less than 5 minutes from “deploy” to sending all traffic though the VPN. Sometimes it is less than 3 minutes.

Of course, this is...
