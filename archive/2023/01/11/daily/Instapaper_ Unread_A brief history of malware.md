# A brief history of malware

Jan 6, 2023

These days I am finishing the first draft of a new book of the “[Little Handbooks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQNBBTD3)” series, dedicated to Malware Analysis.
One of the first chapters is a brief history of computer viruses.

***Comments and feedback are welcome!***

Malware is a term used to describe malicious software that is designed to harm or exploit computer systems. It can take various forms, such as viruses, worms, trojans, rootkits, ransomware, and adware, and can be used for various purposes, such as stealing data, disrupting services, or extortion.

The history of malware can be traced back to the early days of computing, when the first known computer viruses were created. However, it was not until the rise of the personal computer (PC) and the internet that malware became a significant threat. The proliferation of PCs and the internet created new opportunities for malware to spread and to target a larger and more diverse audience.

In this chapter, we will examine the early history of malware, the birth of the PC, the rise of the internet, the emergence of mobile malware, and the rise of ransomware. We will also discuss the trends and challenges of malware and its impact on society. By understanding the history of malware, we can gain insight into its evolution and future direction and be better prepared to defend against it.

## **Early history of malware**

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. While the term “malware” was not coined until the 1990s, the concept of malicious code has a long history that dates back to pre-digital times.

### Pre-digital era: Malicious code in literature and folklore

One of the earliest references to malicious code can be found in the Greek myth of the Trojan Horse. According to the story, the Greeks built a giant wooden horse and presented it as a gift to the Trojans, who were at war with them.

Unknowingly, the Trojans brought the horse into their city, where it contained a group of Greek soldiers who emerged during the night and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army, leading to the fall of Troy. The Trojan Horse has since become a metaphor for a malicious program that disguises itself as something benign in order to gain access to a system.

In the 16th century, the play “Doctor Faustus” by **Christopher Marlowe** includes a reference to a *“machine or engine, which will make a man invisible”*. This is often cited as an early example of a *“logic bomb”*, a type of malware that is triggered by a specific condition or event, such as a certain date or the deletion of a file.

### Early computers: First instances of malware

As computers became more prevalent in the 20th century, the first instances of malware began to appear.

One of the earliest known examples is the [”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper)*[Creeper](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=2860)*[”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper) program, which was created in 1971 by **Bob Thomas**. Creeper was a simple self-replicating program that infected **DEC PDP-10** computers and displayed the message *“I’M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN”.*

It was followed by the “Reaper” program, which was designed to remove Creeper from infected systems.

Other early examples of malware include the *“Elk Cloner”* virus, which infected **Apple II** computers in 1982, and the *“Brain”* virus, which targeted \*\*IBM PC \*\*systems in 1986. These viruses were primarily spread through floppy disks and were relatively simple in nature, but they marked the beginning of the modern era of malware.

## **The emergence of personal computers**

### The birth of the PC: Early malware targeting PC systems

With the emergence of personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s, malware began to evolve and target these systems.

The first PC-based viruses, such as the [“Brain” virus](https://web.archive.org/web/20050204133534/http%3A//www.brain.net.pk/aboutus.htm), appeared in 1986 and were primarily spread through floppy disks. These viruses were relatively simple in nature, but they marked the beginning of a new era of malware that would continue to evolve and grow more sophisticated over time.

One of the most notable early **PC \*\*viruses was the *“Michelangelo”* virus, which was discovered in 1992. Michelangelo was a boot sector virus that was triggered on \*\*March 6th** (Michelangelo’s birthday) and caused infected computers to display a message stating that the system had been infected. It was estimated that Michelangelo could potentially infect up to 5% of the world’s PCs, causing widespread panic and leading to media coverage of the incident.

Other notable early PC viruses include the *“Jerusalem”* virus, which was discovered in 1987 and targeted executable files, and the *“Melissa”* virus, which was discovered in 1999 and spread through email attachments. These and other early PC viruses were primarily spread through physical media such as floppy disks and CDs, but the rise of the internet in the late 1990s would pave the way for a new generation of malware that could spread much faster and more effectively.

### The rise of the internet: Malware spreads online

With the rise of the internet in the late 1990s, malware began to spread in new and more effective ways. The internet provided a global network for the transmission of malware, allowing it to reach a wider audience and cause greater damage.

One of the first notable internet-based malware outbreaks was the *[“Love Bug”](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0504i-love-you-virus/)* [or](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0504i-love-you-virus/) *[“ILOVEYOU”](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0504i-love-you-virus/)* [virus](https://www.wired.com/2010/05/0504i-love-you-virus/), which was discovered in 2000.

The Love Bug was a worm that spread through email attachments and infected millions of computers around the world, causing an estimated $10 billion in damages.

Other notable internet-based malware include the *“Code Red”* worm, which was discovered in 2001 and targeted **Microsoft IIS servers**, and the *“Sasser”* worm, which was [discovered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasser_%28computer_worm%29) in 2004 and exploited a vulnerability in **Windows XP** systems. These and other internet-based malware demonstrated the potential for significant global impact and highlighted the need for effective cyber security measures.

The rise of the internet also led to the emergence of new types of malware, such as phishing attacks and malicious websites. Phishing attacks involve the use of fake emails or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details. Malicious websites, also known as “drive-by downloads”, are sites that automatically download malware onto a user’s computer when visited. These and other internet-based threats continue to pose a significant risk to individuals and organizations today.
