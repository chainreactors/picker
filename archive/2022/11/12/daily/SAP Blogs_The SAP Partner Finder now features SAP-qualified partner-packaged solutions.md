### **SAP Partners,** **make it easier for prospects to find** **you****.**

The [SAP Partner Finder](https://pf-prod-sapit-partner-prod.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/) matches prospects with partners in their region that have the knowledge and experience they’re looking for. It’s a powerful demand-generation tool that drives opportunities for the partner’s business. Besides listing the services offered and the competencies of the partner, the SAP Partner Finder now adds SAP-qualified partner-packaged solutions, for a more holistic view of partners capabilities.

Having the SAP-qualified partner-packaged solutions listed on the SAP Partner Finder is a great way to drive incremental exposure for a partner’s package(s) and their unique partner IP. Each package is listed under the country where it is available (qualified), and if the package has a particular industry focus or features special attributes such as being an Intelligent Enterprise package, having SAP Business Technology Platform embedded, or having Industry Cloud components, these are also highlighted.

It is important to mention that the listing of packages on the SAP Partner Finder is not replacing but rather complementing the listing on the [SAP-qualified partner-packaged solution finder](https://www.sap.com/partners/find/qualified-packaged-solutions/finder.html?sort=title_asc), where prospects can go to explore and search for more details about a partner package. We expect that the listing on the SAP Partner Finder will drive additional traffic to the SAP-qualified partner-packed solution finder, thereby helping to generate additional awareness, interest, and leads for the partner packages overall.

With these recent enhancements, we hope to drive increased transparency for partners, and at the same time reinforce our commitment to helping partners promote and monetize their packaged solutions.
