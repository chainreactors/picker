Business recommendation:
------------------------
Upgrade to version v15U1 or install hotfix #309 for v14.14.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)
An authenticated user can inject JavaScript in the "Request Reason". The
injected JavaScript code will be executed if another user looks at the "History"
of this access request. An attacker can then execute arbitrary JavaScript
in the browser of other users which could for example be used for phishing attacks.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)
An authenticated user can submit an access request and has to specify a reason why
the access should be provided.

<1-1_request_access.png>

This request has to be intercepted and modified, e.g.:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /workitemdlg.aspx?ACTTEMP=XXX&RURLID=YYY HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: oissessionid=$MYSESSION
[...]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

[...]
1000104=Need+hello+access+and+bigfun<iframe+src=javascript:alert(document.domain)></iframe>&1000102=I+would+like+to+request+access+to+%5Bspecify+system%5D+so+I+can+perform+my+%5Bspecify+duties%5D+duties+related+to+my+work+as+a+%5Bspecify+position%5D.
[...]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards, anyone who reviews the "History" of this access request will be
affected by the stored JavaScript code. Users who review the history requests are
usually managers who have to approve this request, so this vulnerability allows
reliably affecting higher-privileged users.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version of the on-prem solution has been tested which was the latest
version available at the time of the test:
* 14.0.14.36
