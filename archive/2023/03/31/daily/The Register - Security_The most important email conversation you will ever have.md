# The most important email conversation you will ever have

## Securing your business against BEC

Webinar Business email compromise (BEC) is possibly the worst of cybercrimes because it abuses trust. It feeds on relationships carefully nurtured over decades and erodes a confidence which is foundational to cooperation, and progress.

And it's no good relying on data from yesterday's attacks to try and stop it because bad actors are continuously upping their methodology to breach your security. Email is the vector for 94 percent of cyberattacks and we're also in an era of generative AI attacks that leverage tools such as ChatGPT. So being able to distinguish between a legitimate communication and an impersonation is vital.

But what about never-before-seen attacks? Your email security needs to learn all about you, your business and your users to be able to autonomously deliver precise, effective cyber protection.

Join the Register's Tim Phillips on [4 April at 11am BST/6am EDT/3am PDT](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/18750/email-security-for-every-threat) in conversation with Pieter Jansen, SVP Cyber Innovation and Carlos Gray, Email SME from Darktrace to learn more. The trio will discuss the future of email security, ponder evolving risks and threats that CISOs need to worry about, and look at why AI-powered email security which understands you, is essential to be safe.

Darktrace is using AI to uniquely learn about you in order to spot the very first signs of subtle attack that might otherwise evade detection, for example.

Sign up to attend our ["Email security for every threat"](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/18750/email-security-for-every-threat) webinar here and we'll send you a reminder.
