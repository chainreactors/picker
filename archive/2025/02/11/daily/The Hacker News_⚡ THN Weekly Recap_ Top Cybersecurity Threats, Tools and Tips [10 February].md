In cybersecurity, the smallest crack can lead to the biggest breaches. A leaked encryption key, an unpatched software bug, or an abandoned cloud storage bucket‚Äîeach one seems minor until it becomes the entry point for an attack.

This week, we've seen cybercriminals turn overlooked weaknesses into major security threats, proving once again that no system is too small to be targeted. The question isn't whether attackers will find a way in‚Äîit's whether you'll be prepared when they do.

Let's break down what you need to know.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Microsoft Warns of Attacks Exploiting ASP.NET Machine Keys** ‚Äî Threat actors are [exploiting](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/microsoft-identifies-3000-publicly.html) publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys to inject and execute malicious code responsible for launching the Godzilla post-exploitation framework. Microsoft said it has identified over 3,000 publicly disclosed keys that could be used for these types of attacks dubbed ViewState code injection. The company also said it removed key-related artifacts from "limited instances" where they were included in its documentation.

## New AI Report: DeepSeek Surges, Security Risks Persist

Wiz Research just found a major AI security exposure‚ÄîDeepSeek had a publicly accessible database leaking sensitive information. The issue has been fixed, but it highlights the growing security risks in AI adoption. The State of AI in the Cloud 2025 report ‚Äì just updated with the latest data, breaks it all down.](https://thehackernews.uk/2025-ai-cloud-report-a)[Get the Report](https://thehackernews.uk/2025-ai-cloud-report-a)

## **üîî Top News**

* **Multiple Security Flaws Come Under Exploitation** ‚Äî Malicious actors are exploiting recently disclosed security flaws in [SimpleHelp](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/hackers-exploit-simplehelp-rmm-flaws.html) remote desktop software (CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728) as part of a suspected ransomware attack. Separately, Russian cybercrime groups have been found to exploit a flaw affecting the [7-Zip](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/russian-cybercrime-groups-exploiting-7.html) archiver tool (CVE-2025-0411) to evade mark-of-the-web (MotW) protections on Windows systems and deliver the SmokeLoader malware as part of attacks aimed at Ukrainian entities. Lastly, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that a security flaw impacting [Trimble Cityworks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cisa-warns-of-active-exploitation-in.html) GIS-centric asset management software (CVE-2025-0994) has come under active exploitation in the wild.
* **Ransomware Payments Drop to $813.5M in 2024** ‚Äî Ransomware attacks earned cybercrime groups [$813.5 million in 2024](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/ransomware-extortion-drops-to-8135m-in.html), marking a significant drop from $1.25 billion in 2023. That said, 2024 also witnessed the highest volume of annual ransomware cases since 2021, reaching a staggering 5,263 attacks, an increase of 15% year-over-year. The decline is attributed to the growing law enforcement success in dismantling ransomware gangs, heightened global awareness about the threat, and a fragmented ecosystem where lone wolf actors are known to seek smaller ransom payments.
* **Lazarus's Job-Themed Campaign Delivers JavaScript Malware** ‚Äî The Lazarus Group of North Korea has been [linked](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cross-platform-javascript-stealer.html) to an active campaign that leverages fake LinkedIn job offers in the cryptocurrency and travel sectors to deliver malware capable of infecting Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Bitdefender, which identified the activity, said it likely falls under the Contagious Interview cluster, although the JavaScript malware used in the attacks is different from BeaverTail samples used in the latter.
* **SparkCat Uses Android and iOS Apps to Steal Data** ‚Äî A new malware campaign dubbed [SparkCat](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/sparkcat-malware-uses-ocr-to-extract.html) has leveraged a suite of bogus apps on both Apple's and Google's respective app stores to steal victims' mnemonic phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets. The development marks one of the first instances where a stealer with optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities has been discovered in the Apple App Store. The offending apps have since been removed from both the app storefronts.
* **Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan Orgs Targeted by Silent Lynx** ‚Äî A never-before-seen hacking group tracked as [Silent Lynx](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/silent-lynx-using-powershell-golang-and.html) has targeted embassies, lawyers, government-backed banks, and think tanks located in Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan to deploy a PowerShell script that uses Telegram for command-and-control. The activity, attributed to a Kazakhstan-origin threat actor with a medium level of confidence, shares tactical overlaps with another hacking group name YoroTrooper (aka SturgeonPhisher), which has been linked to attacks targeting the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries using PowerShell and Golang tools.
