As Texas reels from [devastating floods](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3358pz41d6o "Link to BBC News article"), conspiracy theorists are hard at work.

Not by helping victims, or donating aid, but by posting videos claiming the rain is fake, or blaming space lasers or ‚Äúgeoengineering‚Äù plots.

I wish I was joking. But once again the likes of Twitter, TikTok, and Telegram are spreading dangerous nonsense claiming extreme weather was being controlled by the ‚Äúdeep state.‚Äù

And some of these posts are getting millions of views.

In times of real human suffering, spreading misinformation isn‚Äôt just unhelpful. It‚Äôs harmful. Let‚Äôs not lose sight of the facts, or the people who need support the most.
