# Hells Hollow: A new SSDT Hooking technique

Everything is a weapon in the belly of the beast.

## Intro

The proof of concept code for this can be found on GitHub at [0xflux/Hells-Hollow](https://github.com/0xflux/Hells-Hollow). If
you like my project and post, please feel free to give the repo a star! :)

To see **limitations** of this technique, I have included that as a separate section below.

**Hells Hollow** is my name for a technique which has come about from my research into [Alt Syscalls](https://fluxsec.red/alt-syscalls-for-windows-11). In that post,
I explained how when using the Alt Syscalls technique (for defensive EDR purposes) you must always return 1. This time, we are going to return somethi...
