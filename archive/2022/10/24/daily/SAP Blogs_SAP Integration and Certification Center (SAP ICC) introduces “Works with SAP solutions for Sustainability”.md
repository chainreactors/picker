Sustainability is Core to SAPs strategy. SAP has recently introduced “SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises,” a bundle of existing SAP sustainability solutions. SAP Cloud for Sustainable Enterprises is a comprehensive single cloud offering that is tailored to customer needs and can be extended anytime with industry cloud solutions from SAP and partners.

Its reported according to a recent [McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/the-esg-premium-new-perspectives-on-value-and-performance), 83% of c-suite leaders and investment professionals expect that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) programs will contribute more to shareholder value in 5 years than they do today. Moreover, companies brand value and reputations depend on their commitment to social responsibility. For example, a [Deloitte study](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/social-value-creation.html) found that 90% of consumers would switch brands to support a good cause or boycott a brand value due to irresponsible business practices. Checkout this [article](https://news.sap.com/2022/09/sustainable-success-technology-platform/) for more facts.

Our partners are actively endorsing our sustainability vision and supporting our strategy to support our customers run more sustainably.
