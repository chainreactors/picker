With 2022 nearing its end, we take a look at the most-read news articles posted on TorrentFreak this year. The Z-Library crackdown dominated the headlines with several articles. At the same time, prominent Spider-Man and House of the Dragon leaks drew a lot of eyeballs, while the 'You Wouldn't Steal' PSA was put in a new perspective.

On the brink of the new year, we look back at 2022 by reviewing the thirteen most-read news items of the last 12 months.

All in all, it was quite a controversial year once again. The Z-Library crackdown and aftermath was a massive story. And with a criminal investigation into two of the site’s alleged operators, that will likely continue in the coming year.

Various leaks, domain troubles, and court orders made top headlines as well. The most popular articles are listed below, grouped into the twelve biggest stories of the year.

## 1. [Z-library Shutdown and Aftermath](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/)

Z-Library shows up in several of the most-read articles this year. The site first appeared in the news during October when we revealed that TikTok had banned the Zlibrary hashtag following complaints from authors. That was just the start, however.

In November, the U.S. Government [seized](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/) Z-Library’s main [domain names](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-aftermath-reveals-that-the-feds-seized-dozens-of-domain-names-221107/). Soon after, the authorities revealed that two alleged Russian operators had been [arrested](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/) in Argentina as part of a criminal investigation.

While the indicted duo await potential extradition to the United States, Z-Library remains operational on the [dark web](https://torrentfreak.com/z-librarys-tor-network-site-has-also-gone-offline-221123/). In addition, Telegram bots and [archive](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-opens-the-door-to-z-library-and-other-pirate-libraries-221118/) sites try to satisfy the demand for pirated books.

## 2. [Pirate Sites Disappear from DuckDuckGo](https://torrentfreak.com/duckduckgo-removes-pirate-sites-and-youtube-dl-from-its-search-results-220415/)

In April, we noticed that several high-profile “pirate” sites were [unfindable](https://torrentfreak.com/duckduckgo-removes-pirate-sites-and-youtube-dl-from-its-search-results-220415/) in DuckDuckGo’s search results. It wasn’t clear why these domains disappeared but The Pirate Bay, Fmovies, YTMP3.cc, and many others were no longer showing up.

After some back and forth, Bing was identified as the culprit. DuckDuckGo said it would work hard to [mitigate the problem](https://torrentfreak.com/duckduckgo-restores-pirate-sites-and-points-to-bing-220419/). The missing sites eventually returned to DuckDuckGo and Bing search results.

## 3. [US Court Orders Every ISP in the United States to Block Illegal Streaming Sites](https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-orders-every-isp-in-the-united-states-to-block-illegal-streaming-sites-220502/)

In May, a coalition of Israel-based media companies obtained [a broad injunction](https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-orders-every-isp-in-the-united-states-to-block-illegal-streaming-sites-220502/) at a New York court that required every ISP in the United States to block three pirate streaming sites.

This requirement was met with massive opposition from prominent companies such as Google and Cloudflare, after which the parties eventually agreed to seek a less explosive [compromise](https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-media-companies-agree-to-modify-power-grab-injunction-220630/).

## 4. [Adblocking Does Not Constitute Copyright Infringement](https://torrentfreak.com/adblocking-does-not-constitute-copyright-infringement-court-rules-220118/)

In January, Axel Springer [lost its copyright infringement lawsuit](https://torrentfreak.com/adblocking-does-not-constitute-copyright-infringement-court-rules-220118/) against Eyeo GmbH, the company behind Adblock Plus. The German publishing house, which owns the Bild and Die Welt brands, among others, claimed that adblockers interfere with the presentation of websites in browsers, thus breaching copyright.

The Hamburg District Court disagreed and decided to dismiss the case. According to the court, ad blocking doesn’t involve any unauthorized duplication and/or reworking of copyrighted computer programs, as defined in Germany’s copyright law.

## 5. [“House of the Dragon” Fills GOT’s Shoes](https://torrentfreak.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-finale-leaks-early-on-pirate-sites-221021/)

The long-awaited premiere of “House of the Dragon” finally arrived in August. The Game of Thrones prequel immediately proved a [hit on pirate sites](https://torrentfreak.com/house-of-the-dragon-crushes-the-rings-of-power-on-pirate-sites-220924/), where the first episode was widely available nearly a day before the official release. As a result, hundreds of thousands of pirates watched the show before paying customers.

House of the Dragon made piracy headlines once more when the season finale [leaked early](https://torrentfreak.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-finale-leaks-early-on-pirate-sites-221021/). The circle was completed this week when – in true Game of Thrones spirit – House of the Dragon became the most pirated TV show of 2022.

## 6. [Genshin Impact Leaker Ubatcha](https://torrentfreak.com/court-discord-must-expose-genshin-impact-leaker-ubatcha-221202/)

A few weeks ago, prolific Genshin Impact leaker ‘Ubatcha’ was [targeted](https://torrentfreak.com/court-discord-must-expose-genshin-impact-leaker-ubatcha-221202/) in a DMCA subpoena application filed by publisher Cognosphere. The legal uncertainty left its mark, much to the disappointment of Ubatcha’s close followers.

The [question](https://torrentfreak.com/ubatcha-no-more-genshin-impact-leaks-vs-cognospheres-dilemma-221218/) now is whether Cognosphere will leave things as they stand or push forward with a full-blown lawsuit to send a deterrent but potentially fan-alienating message.

## 7. [Netflix Password Sharing is a Crime?](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-govt-netflix-password-sharing-is-illegal-potentially-criminal-fraud-221219/)

Earlier this month, the UK Government’s Intellectual Property Office [published](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-govt-netflix-password-sharing-is-illegal-potentially-criminal-fraud-221219/) new piracy guidance. To the surprise of many, it warned that sharing passwords for streaming services such as Netflix is illegal, and may even incur criminal liability for fraud.

Soon after we uncovered this unusual advice, the Office quietly updated its tough warnings, removing all references to password ...
