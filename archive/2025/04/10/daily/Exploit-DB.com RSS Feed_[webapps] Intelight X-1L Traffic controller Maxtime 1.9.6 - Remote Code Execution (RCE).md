# Exploit Title: Intelight X-1L Traffic controller Maxtime 1.9.6 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 07/09/2024
# Exploit Author: Andrew Lemon/Red Threat https://redthreatsec.com
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.q-free.com
# Software Link: N/A
# Version: 1.9
# Tested on:  (Intelight x-1) Linux 3.14.57
# CVE : CVE-2024-38944

## Vulnerability Description
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of MaxTime Database Editor.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the web-based UI on Traffic Controllers running version 1.9.x firmware.
The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality.
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain full control of Intelight Traffic Controllers and modify the configuration of a traffic intersection,
modify traffic light sequences, or trigger the intersection to go into 4 way flash causing a denial of service and causing traffic congestion.

## Steps to Reproduce

Navigate to the IP address of an identified controller
When prompted for authentication append /cgi-bin/generateForm.cgi?formID=142 to the end of the IP address
Under the web security tab change the drop down from enabled to disabled and select apply or take note of the username and password and login with those.
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [...
