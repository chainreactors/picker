This article focuses on the current issue related to the ongoing unprecedented **energy crisis in Europe** and explains how SAP supports customers’ business strategy and decision making in global cost efficiency and predictability. In addition, a demo will be mentioned that shows how SAP Analytics Cloud can help companies manage challenges associated with an energy crisis.

You can read the content or watch it as a video depending on your preferred way of taking in information.

## Embrace new challenges

Energy landscape in Europe is facing frequent changes due to various economic and political reasons. Enterprises have to deal with daily **higher energy prices** but also with very little visibility of what tomorrow will look like. Rising energy prices may lead to **higher operational costs**, which can **jeopardise** **profits**. Significant impact on production costs is observed in the **energy-intensive manufacturing industries** such as **aluminium, fertilisers, chemicals, steel, machinery, paper, automobile**, services, and many others. Rising energy prices can **reduce competitiveness** in the global market or can even lead to bankruptcy for some companies. If energy prices stay high in Europe some companies may consider relocating production to countries where cheap energy abounds.

As it becomes more expensive for manufacturers to produce their products, companies may have to pass along the costs to consumers, making their finished products less attractive. This can lead to decreased demand and lower profits. Reduced profits and more expensive loans make it **harder for companies to invest in modern technologies and processes or renewable energy sources** to become more sustainable or expand operations. Companies may be also forced to rethink their investment priorities and **cut back on their spending on innovation** and new products.

## Enhance analysis and accelerate decision making

SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) is a comprehensive all in one suite of **analytics, reporting, budgeting and forecasting, scenario simulations and predictive capabilities** to support any **extended planning** processes.

A detailed **cost analysis** is the first step on the way to identify opportunities for cost savings and improving profitability, in which SAP Analytics Cloud can support its users.

SAP Analytics Cloud can provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and patterns to allow companies to make more informed decisions about their **energy consumption**. By providing visibility into energy consumption across multiple sites, SAP Analytics Cloud also enables companies to compare and analyse energy usage and costs across their operations and multiple locations. The application as well provides the ability to benchmark energy usage against industry averages.

Apart from tracking and monitoring energy consumption, SAP Analytics Cloud assists companies to make informed decisions about their **energy purchases**, for example by helping to identify the most cost-effective energy providers or allowing companies to make data-driven decisions about when and where to purchase electricity but also optimise **hedging strategies** by providing insights into historical and current energy prices, as well as energy trends.

## Create more accurate forecasting

**Extended planning and analysis (xP&A)** helps companies to bring people and plans together seamlessly by connecting strategic with tactical financial and operational plans. This approach enables organisations to better **plan, budget and forecast** for their energy needs and costs. Better planning means more predictability, reduced uncertainty, better stability for the company.

SAP Analytics Cloud provides predictive planning capabilities that enable users to anticipate future energy costs based on historical data and other external factors. SAP Analytics Cloud **integr...
