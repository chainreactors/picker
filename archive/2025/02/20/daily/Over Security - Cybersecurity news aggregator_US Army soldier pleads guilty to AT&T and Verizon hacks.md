# US Army soldier pleads guilty to AT&T and Verizon hacks

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

Cameron John Wagenius pleaded guilty to hacking AT&T and Verizon and stealing a massive trove of phone records from the companies, according to court [records](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25539173-wag-motion-to-reopen-detention-hearing-feb-19-2025/) [filed](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25539172-wagenius-notice-of-intent-to-plead-guilty-feb-19-2025/) on Wednesday.

Wagenius, who was a U.S. Army soldier, pleaded guilty to two counts of “unlawful transfer of confidential phone records information” on an online forum and via an online communications platform. According to [a document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25539172-wagenius-notice-of-intent-to-plead-guilty-feb-19-2025/) filed by Wagenius’ lawyer, he faces a maximum fine of $250,000 and prison time of up to 10 years for each of the two counts.

Wagenius [was arrested and indicted](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/18/doj-confirms-arrested-us-army-soldier-is-linked-to-att-and-verizon-hacks/) last year. In January, U.S. prosecutors confirmed that the charges brought against Wagenius were linked to the indictment of Connor Moucka and John Binns, two alleged hackers whom the U.S. government accused of [several data breaches against cloud computing services company Snowflake](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/snowflake-hackers-identified-and-charged-with-stealing-50-billion-att-records/), which were among the worst hacks of 2024.

Last month, U.S. attorney Tessa Gorman told the court that both the AT&T and Verizon breaches “arise from the same computer intrusion and extortion and include some of the same stolen victim information.”  She added that “these cases rely on overlapping evidentiary material and legal process and arguably present common questions of law and fact,” which effectively confirmed that Wagenius was involved in the Snowflake breaches.

By hacking into Snowflake instances, hackers stole troves of data from [AT&T](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/), [LendingTree](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/mandiant-hackers-snowflake-stole-significant-volume-data-customers/), [Santander Bank](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/snowflake-customer-passwords-found-online-infostealing-malware/), [Ticketmaster](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/31/live-nation-confirms-ticketmaster-was-hacked-says-personal-information-stolen-in-data-breach/), and at least 160 other companies.
