## Apple Only Commits to Patching Latest OS Version

People have suspected this for a while, but Apple has made it official. It [only](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a/web) commits to fully patching the latest version of its OS, even though it claims to support older versions.

From [ArsTechnica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/apple-clarifies-security-update-policy-only-the-latest-oses-are-fully-patched/):

> In other words, while Apple will provide security-related updates for older versions of its operating systems, only the most recent upgrades will receive updates for every security problem Apple knows about. Apple currently provides security updates to macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Monterey alongside the newly released [macOS Ventura](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/macos-13-ventura-the-ars-technica-review/), and in the past, it has released security updates for older iOS versions for devices that can’t install the latest upgrades.
>
> This confirms something that [independent security researchers have been aware of for a while](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/psa-apple-isnt-actually-patching-all-the-security-holes-in-older-versions-of-macos/) but that Apple hasn’t publicly articulated before. Intego Chief Security Analyst Joshua Long has tracked the CVEs patched by different macOS and iOS updates for years and generally found that bugs patched in the newest OS versions can go months before being patched in older (but still ostensibly “supported”) versions, when they’re patched at all.

This means, of course, that you need to upgrade macOS yearly. For me, that doubles that part of the cost of owning a mac (which, since I am unwilling to just trust the upgrade process, is already far from zero), and means that when HW goes out of support I have to buy a new machine a year sooner.

So that’s good news.

It also makes me wonder who will be providing software & security updates for the current crop of EVs in 15-20 years time?

They are basically 2-ton computers on wheels, capable of inflicting huge damage if/when they are hacked.

Who will be responsible?

“…who will be providing software & security updates for the current crop of EVs in 15-20 years time?”…

Not only EVs, pure internal combustion vehicles too. An early “theoretical” example was a Jeep steeting and motor remotely hacked (search ‘jeep steering hack’).

It will be curious if once a vehicle becomes that old and unsupported and at risk if it can be air-gaped via 3rd parties, clever DYI’ers, or maybe the manufacture themselves. Maybe, maybe not, depends on how tethered to the mother ship manufactures insist these stay. e.

My 2016 iPhone SE cannot upgrade to IOS 16; however it just received an update to IOS 15.7.1 so they’re still paying some attention to older phones.

That’s a bad idea. Mac users who aren’t willing to upgrade more often because their hardware is “still OK” and/or they can’t afford it, will wind up being vulnerable to attack.

That is poor customer service.

My two main computers are a 2015 iMac (27″ 5K display) running Monterey and a ’15 MacBook Pro running 10.12 Sierra. The laptop will never be upgraded as I would lose apps that are needed. The iMac can no longer be upgraded because of changes to the OS.

This kind of nonsense is so annoying. I can appreciate that they can’t support an OS forever, but their hardware is high-end as is their manufacturing that helps to keep them going for so long. I don’t have the income to replace my kit every five years like Apple would like, especially with retirement staring me in the face, I’ll run these until they fall over dead and then figure out my next step. (pun intended)

It seems like Apple used to be “Yes, we’re expensive, but you’re getting a superior product” to just “Yes, we’re expensive”. To me, the company’s attitude and direction is still wavering post-Steve.

Considering the high prices Apple products this is annoying.

I got Adobe software products that I thought I would be able to use for a lifetime. When I tried to reinstall then I found out Adobe no longer provide the software activation service needed to install the software.

The software companies can pull the plug on software breaking promises made at sale of software and leave users with no alternative but to pay up for expensive subscription plans to use the current software.

It just shows Apple’s continued incompetence in the software domain.

Once upon a time the Apple Security Update server, on request, conversed with the client updater app to download only those updates needed for that machine. Then they changed it so everybody got one large omnibus update, which was not welcomed by users on bandwidth or volume limited connections.

Their current info seems to indicate corporate sized users can manage their own up...
