Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2023-4202, CVE-2023-4203)
Two stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities has been identified in the
firmware of the device. The first XSS was identified in the "Device Name" field
and the second XSS was found in the "Ping" tool. This can be exploited in the
context of a victim's session.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Both cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are permanently affecting the device.

1.1) Stored XSS in Device Name CVE-2023-4202
The first vulnerability can be triggerd by setting the device name
("System->Device Name") to the following value:
"><script>alert("document.cookie")</script>

This code prints out the cached cookies to the screen.

1.2) Stored XSS in Ping Function CVE-2023-4203
The second XSS vulnerability can be found in "Tools->Ping". The following GET
request prints the current cached cookies of a user's session to the screen.

http://$IP/cgi-bin/ping.sh?random_num=2013&ip=172.16.0.141%3b%20<script>alert(1)</script>&size=56&count=1&interface=eth0&_=1682793104513

An alternative to the used payload is using "onmouseover" event tags. In this
case it prints out the number "1337":
" onmousemove="alert(1337)"

The vulnerability was manually verified on an emulated device by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).
