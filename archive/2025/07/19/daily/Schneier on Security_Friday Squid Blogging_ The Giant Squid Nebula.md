## Friday Squid Blogging: The Giant Squid Nebula

Beautiful [photo](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap250705.html).

> [Difficult to capture](https://app.astrobin.com/i/hmtykv), this mysterious, squid-shaped interstellar cloud spans nearly three full moons in planet Earth’s sky. [Discovered in 2011 by](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012RMxAA..48..223A/abstract) French astro-imager [Nicolas Outters](http://outters.fr/wp/?page_id=50), the Squid Nebula’s [bipolar shape](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230416.html) is distinguished here by the telltale blue [emission from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebulium) doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently [surrounded by](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230817.html) the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, one [investigation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...570A.105C/abstract) suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a [triple system](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/orbits.html) of hot, massive stars, cataloged as [HR8119](https://in-the-sky.org/data/object.php?id=TYC3965-880-1#google_vignette), seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 [light-years](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/what-is-a-light-year/) across.

@ Bruce, ALL,

**How to prove lies and open a world of hurt.**

Whilst proving something true can be hard… It’s seen as easy when compared to trying to prove something is not true.”

In fact there are a whole group of things that absolutely rely on this assumption that gives rise to the notion amongst other things of “One Way Functions” which find considerable use in the likes of cryptography.

Which is perhaps why,

<https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-figure-out-how-to-prove-lies-20250709/>

Is subtitled,

> *“An attack on a fundamental proof technique reveals a glaring security issue for blockchains and other digital encryption schemes.”*

But… Is it just journalistic hyperbole or something more fundamental?

Well it starts with perhaps one of the more fundamental proofs used in cryptography,

“The random oracle model.”

Which in layman’s terms is an assumption that

“What looks sufficiently Random, is the same as truly random.”

For some time now I’ve been indicating my lack of trust in the very large gap between provably deterministic and truly random, because of the “observer issue”.

However a newish paper,

<https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/118>

Goes somewhat further…

US passes first major national crypto legislation

=The bill sets up a regulatory regime for so-called stablecoins, a kind of crypto currency
backed by assets seen as reliable, such as the dollar.

Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday, after the House passed the bill on Thursday, joining the Senate, which had approved the measure last month.

Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at providing clear rules for a growing industry, ensuring the US keeps pace with advances in payment systems. The crypto
industry had been pushing for such measures in hopes it could spur more people to use
digital currency and bring it more into the mainstream.

The provisions include requiring stablecoins, an alternate cryptocurrency to the likes of
Bitcoin, to be backed one-for-one with US dollars, or other low-risk assets. Stablecoins are used by traders to move funds between different crypto tokens.

> For example, they said it would deepen tech firms’ participation in bank-like activities

@ not important, ALL,

With regards the US bill on crypto that is limping through the system (as are two others).

Put simply the only actual “business case for Crypto(coins)” that to be blunt makes any kind of sense is,

“To assist and facilitate crime and fraud”

Just about every legitimate aspect of it is more efficiently and more effectively done by existing financial processes and instruments.

I’ve pointed out in the past Cryptocoins, and blockchains have been pushed by those trying to gull those who have more money than sense.

Basically it’s been the equivalent of a “Pump-n-Dump” for the likes of Venture Capitalists and less honest financial advisors.

I thought it had sort of died back, hence the move by the less scrupulously into NFT’s and Smart Contracts, and later other asspects of the badly failing Web3 nonsense that Molly White documents with,

<https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/>

Where she notes sarcastically,

> *“…and is definitely not an enormous grift that’s pouring lighter fluid on our already smoldering planet.”*

And yes all those GPU’s etc burning megawatts of power on the cheap thus creating at the very minimum significant “lost opportunity costs” greater than many countries GDP…

It’s easy to find people happy to explain other disasterous down sides of crypto coins such as,

<https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/against_crypto/>

But… The VC’s have found that Crypto is not bringing home the “Pork Fat Fees” that it used to…

Likewise others, so blockchain is on it’s way out, NFT’s are disappearing and Smart Contracts appear to be veing used to defraud those who have put money in…

So where have not just the VC’s but hardware pushers like Nvidia gone?

Well it looks like their latest money pit for idiots is AGI and similar nonsense.

Likewise it’s ...
