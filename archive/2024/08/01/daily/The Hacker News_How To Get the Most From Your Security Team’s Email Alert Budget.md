We'll TL;DR the FUDdy introduction: we all know that phishing attacks are on the rise in scale and complexity, that AI is enabling more sophisticated attacks that evade traditional defenses, and the never-ending cybersecurity talent gap means we're all struggling to keep security teams fully staffed.

Given that reality, security teams need to be able to monitor and respond to threats effectively and efficiently. You obviously can't let real threats slip past unnoticed, but you also can't afford to waste time chasing false positives.

In this post, we're going to look at some of the ways [Material Security](https://material.security/?utm_source=third-party&utm_medium=blog%20&utm_campaign=20240731-the-hacker-news)'s unique approach to email security and data protection can dramatically–and quantifiably–save your security teams hours each week while improving the effectiveness of your security program.

## What's Your Alert Budget?

Before we dive into the "how," let's take a moment to look at *why* efficiency is critical in security operations. To do that, let's think about how many alerts can your security and incident response teams realistically triage, investigate, and respond to in a given day. Just like your department has a budget that limits how much money you can spend on people and tools, your security teams have a limit to the amount of time they can devote to responding to threats on any given day. **That's your alert budget**.

That number will change day-to-day, of course, depending on the severity and complexity of the incidents that pop, the number of critical strategic projects your team is working on, and myriad other factors. But there is a limit. And just as you can't afford to waste your limited financial resources on redundant tools or software that provides no value to your team, you can't afford for your teams to waste their alert budget investigating duplicate alerts, remediating the same issue over and over, or chasing false positives.

The efficiency with which your security team spends their alert budget is just as important as how you spend your money, if not more so. Now let's dive into how we help improve that efficiency.

## Balancing Accuracy and Sensitivity

No matter how many alerts your team receives, there are a limited number of hours in any given day that your team can devote to responding to them. [Material's approach to phishing](https://material.security/phishing-protection?utm_source=third-party&utm_medium=blog%20&utm_campaign=20240731-the-hacker-news) has been built on the philosophy that we need to help our customers make the most of their time. The alerts we generate must both catch as many threats as possible–while also generating as few false positives as possible.

"Precision" and "recall" are terms that will be familiar to a data scientist, but may not immediately ring a bell for security folks. In the context of email detections, precision is a measure of how many emails flagged as malicious are actually malicious, while recall is a measure of how many of the actual malicious emails received are flagged by the system.

A security system that generates very few false positives has high precision, and a system that catches nearly all the threats it sees has high recall. At a certain granular level, there is some tradeoff between the two: as you can imagine, you can lower the number of false positives you generate by decreasing the sensitivity of the detections: but decreasing the sensitivity will often lead to true positives being missed as well. Conversely, you can minimize those missed true positives by turning the sensitivity way up, but doing so will generate more false positives.

The focus at Material has been to build a detection engine that balances the two effectively, and surfaces the malicious messages that you truly need to focus on. In today's increasingly-complex threat environment, no single layer of protection is sufficient–and no single method of detection can possibly strike the right balance on its own. To that end, the Material Detection Engine is made up of four key components:

* **Material Detections:** A combination of machine learning techniques with rules built by our dedicated threat research team. AI and ML are great for connecting dots and finding relationships that humans may miss, but for all the advancements in AI lately, there's still no replacement for the insight and capability of human expertise. Material Detections are the best of both worlds.
* **Custom Detections:** Every organization and every environment are unique, so we give customers the ability to create custom detections based on what you're seeing across your user base or out in the wild.
* **Email Provider Alerts:** Google and Microsoft periodically issue alerts for phishing emails that they've detected post-delivery; we ingest and process those alerts and add them to our detections.
* **User Reports:** Material [automates your abuse mailbox](https://material.security/automate-user-report-response?utm_source=third-party&utm_medium=blog%20&utm_campaign=20240731-the-hacker-news), from ingesting user reports, consolidating similar messages within a single case, and applying automated...
