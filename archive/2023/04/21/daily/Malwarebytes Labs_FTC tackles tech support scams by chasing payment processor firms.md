# FTC tackles tech support scams by chasing payment processor firms

Posted: April 20, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A multinational payment processing company and two of its executives are [facing a potential $650k fine](https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/18/us_company_accused_of_helping/) as a result of allegedly processing credit card payments for tech support scammers. While this fine isn’t exactly massive in comparison to some of the privacy breaches and other incidents seen down the years, the original fine the company was handed was an eye-watering $49.5m. The fine was [reduced alongside an agreement to court orders](https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2023/ftc-says-proposed-consent-decree-prohibits-nexway-from-helping-scammers/) which involve close monitoring of “high-risk clients”.

From the [FTC release](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/04/ftc-acts-block-payment-processors-credit-card-laundering-tech-support-scammers):

> The Federal Trade Commission has acted to stop Nexway, a multinational payment processing company, along with its CEO and chief strategy officer, from serving as a facilitator for the tech support scammers through credit card laundering.
>
> The FTC’s complaint against Nexway (and several of its subsidiaries and an associated company known as Asknet), its CEO Victor Iezuitov, and its chief strategy officer Casey Potenzone charges that the defendants were at the center of several offshore tech support scams, processing tens of millions of dollars in charges and giving the scammers access to the US credit card network.

A big part of the complaint is in relation to the so-called “premium tech support” customers using the Nexway system for credit card payment processing. The FTC alleges that a Nexway leadership meeting indicated that it was “strongly dependent” on its premium tech support clients, which represented 25% of Nexway’s revenue.

Additionally, the complaints related to the individual tech support scammers were in great supply. So much so that chargebacks (a way for people to dispute charges they feel to be wrong, like realising they’ve been hit by a tech support scam) and cancellations were in no short supply. From the complaint, in relation to one support scam outfit using Nexway for payment processing:

> …on February 10, 2017, the Senior Key Account Manager at Nexway sent Potenzone an email titled “Nexway/TechLiveConnect: Chargeback & Cancellation rates”. The February 10, 2017 email included a table showing Tech Live Connect had (1) chargeback rates of 2.2% in November 2016, 2.6% in December 2016, and 1.5% in January 2017; and (2) cancelation rates of 23.2% in November 2016, 27% in December 2016, and 21.8% in January 2017.

Credit card companies keep a sharp lookout for signs of repeated dubious transactions happening via fraud monitoring programs. From the complaint:

> Nexway had such high chargebacks that Visa placed the company in its Chargeback Monitoring Program in December 2017.

Something was clearly amiss here, and complaints from consumers related to pop-ups, locking up the screen while a siren plays, and bogus [virus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer-virus) warnings made to the Better Business Bureau and elsewhere leads us to where we are today.

Tech support scams have been around forever, and often ride on the coattails of established brands to sell their wares. This kind of scammer has imitated everything from Microso...
