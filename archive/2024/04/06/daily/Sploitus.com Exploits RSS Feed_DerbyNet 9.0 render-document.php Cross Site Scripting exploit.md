CVE ID: CVE-2024-30920

Description:
A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in DerbyNet v9.0, specifically within the `render-document.php` component. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted URLs. The root cause of the vulnerability is the application's failure to properly sanitize user input in document rendering paths, which permits the injection of malicious scripts.

Vulnerability Type: XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

Vendor of Product:
DerbyNet - https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base:
DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component:
render-document.php

Attack Type:
Remote

Impact:
Code execution

Root Cause:
The vulnerability arises from the application's display of debug information, including `ORIG_SCRIPT_FILENAME`, `DOCUMENT_URI`, `SCRIPT_NAME`, and `PHP_SELF`. These debug outputs improperly handle user-supplied input by not sanitizing it before inclusion in the output, leading directly to XSS vulnerabilities when malicious inputs are rendered by the browser.

Attack Vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited with URLs such as:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/render-document.php/racer/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/render-document.php/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

Discoverer:
Valentin Lobstein
