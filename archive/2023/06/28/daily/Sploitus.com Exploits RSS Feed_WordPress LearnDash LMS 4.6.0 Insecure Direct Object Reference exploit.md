Fully Patched Version: 4.6.0.1

The LearnDash LMS plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.6.0. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for attackers with existing account access at any level, to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.

Technical Analysis

The LearnDash LMS plugin provides the shortcode ‘[ld_reset_password]‘ to embed a password reset form into a page on a WordPress site. The form allows users to submit their username or email address to receive an email with a password reset link containing a user activation key.

Examining the code reveals that the plugin checks that the user activation key belongs to the given user with the learndash_reset_password_verification() function only when displaying the new password form, where the new password can be entered.

However, there is no user activation key check when processing this form. This makes it possible for any authenticated user who has accessed the password reset form via the link sent in the email to modify the password of another user by changing the value of the username hidden input field.

As with any Arbitrary User Password Change that leads to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability, this can be used for complete site compromise. Once an attacker has gained administrative user access to a WordPress site they can then manipulate anything on the targeted site as a normal administrator would. This includes the ability to upload plugin and theme files, which can be malicious zip files containing backdoors, and modifying posts and pages which can be leveraged to redirect site users to other malicious sites.
