## Digital License Plates

California just [legalized](https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/11/california_digital_license_plates/) digital license plates, which seems like a solution without a problem.

> The Rplate can reportedly function in extreme temperatures, has some customization features, and is managed via Bluetooth using a smartphone app. Rplates are also equipped with an LTE antenna, which can be used to push updates, change the plate if the vehicle is reported stolen or lost, and notify vehicle owners if their car may have been stolen.
>
> Perhaps most importantly to the average car owner, Reviver said Rplate owners can renew their registration online through the Reviver mobile app.

That‚Äôs it?

> Right now, an Rplate for a personal vehicle (the battery version) runs to $19.95 a month for 48 months, which will total $975.60 if kept for the full term. If opting to pay a year at a time, the price is $215.40 a year for the same four-year period, totaling $861.60. Wired plates for commercial vehicles run $24.95 for 48 months, and $275.40 if paid yearly.

That‚Äôs a lot to pay for the luxury of not having to find an envelope and stamp.

Plus, the privacy risks:

> Privacy risks are an obvious concern when thinking about strapping an always-connected digital device to a car, but the California law has taken steps that may address some of those concerns.
>
> ‚ÄúThe bill would generally prohibit an alternative device [i.e. digital plate] from being equipped with GPS or other vehicle location tracking capability,‚Äù California‚Äôs legislative digest said of the new law. Commercial fleets are exempt from the rule, unsurprisingly.

More important are the security risks. Do we think for a minute that your digital license plate is secure from denial-of-service attacks, or number swapping attacks, or whatever new attacks will be dreamt up? Seems like a piece of stamped metal is the most secure option.

Setting aside the security issues, and considering vehicles in CA need two plates (rear and front) in the very improbably scenario üôÇ of a fender-bender, or backing up into a lampost or wall, or those highly improbably events that we all have heard of and never experienced‚Ä¶ What happens if that digital plate gets punctured, crushed, bent, or whatever? Who pays for the replacement? Is the insurance forced to cover it? Would that increase the premiums? What happens if the plate is vandalized, stolen, or just damaged? With a regular metal plate, you just straighten it up with a hammer and you‚Äôre done‚Ä¶ in this case, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna be an option.

As with the law stating that attaching location devices to these things is not allowed, isn‚Äôt robbing, carjacking, murdering, et. al. also forbidden?

This is definitely a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù for a problem that does not exist.

The obvious advantage is that it requires an energy source to work. So simply remove power to make your number plate become un-trackable.

You can‚Äôt do this with sheet metal plates. Those remain trackable 24/7 by all the license plate readers dotted around everywhere.

@Q

If I was designing a plate like this, I‚Äôd go for something similar to an E-ink display for the plate. Something that only requires power to change what‚Äôs displayed. Then I can use the car to supply the power, because the plate will only need power while the car is running. If thieves disable the power connection, the plate will display whatever it was last showing, which is probably the number plate.

Also, my experience with a kindle tells me that e-ink is much easier to read in direct sunlight than displays on tables/phones.

> Perhaps most importantly to the average car owner, Reviver said Rplate owners can renew their registration online through the Reviver mobile app.

I live in New Zealand. I‚Äôve owned a car for over 6 years now and have renewed my registration through a government website every year.

The biggest risk I see with these digital plates is what happens when someone starts messing with them to get them to display whatever the attacker wants. An attacker who starts with full access to the hardware.

Huh? How does it take something this intrusive to have online registrations? I live in the backwards state of TX, and we‚Äôve had online registration for a long time with the plain old steel plates.

I‚Äôve been avoiding needing to mail a renewal form for I think over 15 years now in MA.

Not sure how long CA has had theirs up but it‚Äôs here:
<https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/vehicle-registration-renewal/>

So the high price isn‚Äôt even needed to get ‚Äúthe luxury of not having to find an envelope and stamp‚Äù.
It does however allow renewing via an app instead of through a web browser for those people who find web browsers confusing and hard to use üôÇ

Could someone please remind someone about how cellular networks (such as LTE) are able to push data packets to a specific terminal?
