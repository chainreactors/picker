Private AI Assistant for Malware Analysis
in ANY.RUN Sandbox

We are excited to announce the release of an updated AI assistant, which brings powerful analysis capabilities right to your private sessions in the [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=private_ai&utm_term=091024&utm_content=linktolanding). With our new assistant, we’ve taken things to the next level by combining deep, insightful analysis with the privacy and security you need.

## AI Reports Are Now Available for Private Sessions

Previously, our AI assistant ([powered by ChatGPT](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/chatgpt-powered-analysis-method/)) was only accessible in public sandbox sessions. Now, it has been replaced with a new AI model fully hosted on our own infrastructure, allowing [Hunter](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/subscriptions-hunter-plan/) and [Enterprise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-for-enterprises/) users to enjoy AI insights securely in private mode as well.

With the updated version, you get detailed insights without any risk of your information being shared with third parties. Everything stays within your private session, so you can confidently analyze sensitive files and links with [full privacy](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/privacy-features/).

## How AI Assistant Helps with Malware Analysis

Inside ANY.RUN’s sandbox, you’ll now find the *AI* button next to [processes](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/advanced-process-details/), [Suricata](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/new-threat-details-window/) rules, as well as other key elements in your analysis session.

By clicking the *AI* button, you can get detailed insights about what each element does in that specific context. This feature is designed to give you a clearer understanding of malicious behavior, speeding up your investigations and providing helpful summaries in real time.

**Here’s what AI assistant can do for you:**

1. **Process trees:** The AI assistant digs into the process tree, identifies suspicious behavior and offers summaries of each process, helping users focus on critical areas of interest.

2. **Command line:** It scans command line inputs, pinpointing potential indicators of malicious activity, and generates a detailed report to guide your investigation.

**3. Suricata rule triggers:** When Suricata rules are triggered, the AI assistant provides a clear explanation of what these triggers mean in the context of your security, helping you understand the potential threat level.
