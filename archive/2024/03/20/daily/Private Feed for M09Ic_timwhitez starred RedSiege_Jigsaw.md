# Jigsaw

Jigsaw takes a raw shellcode input and outputs randomized shellcode, a lookup table, and a C/C++ stub to translate the randomized shellcode back to a usable format.

Read the Red Siege blog post explaining Jigsaw: <https://redsiege.com/blog/2024/03/jigsaw/>

## Usage

`python3 jigsaw.py inputfile.bin`

## Note

Jigsaw takes raw shellcode bytes (output format Raw in Cobalt Strike) as input.

## Example

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe -f raw -o calc.bin
$ python3 jigsaw.py calc.bin
$ cat jigsaw.txt
unsigned char jigsaw[276] = {0x5d, 0x8b, 0x8d, 0xc0, 0x01, 0x48, 0x80, 0x00, 0x87, 0x7c, 0xc0, 0x74, 0x48, 0x58, 0xd1, 0x95, 0x00, 0xe9, 0xbd, 0x63, 0xe0, 0x01, 0x65, 0x01, 0x4a, 0x48, 0x6f, 0x44, 0x6a, 0xa2, 0x0a, 0x4c, 0xb7, 0x88, 0x5a, 0x01, 0xbb, 0xac, 0x0d, 0xba, 0x4d, 0x41, 0x59, 0x42, 0x49, 0x50, 0x5e, 0xbb, 0x5a, 0x41, 0x83, 0xc9, 0x28, 0x20, 0x00, 0x52, 0x00, 0xd2, 0x24, 0x41, 0x4a, 0x01, 0xff, 0xd0, 0xff, 0x56, 0x20, 0x31, 0x56, 0x8b, 0x6c, 0x31, 0x12, 0xf0, 0x34, 0x48, 0xac, 0x41, 0x8b, 0x01, 0x58, 0x48, 0x48, 0x04, 0x88, 0x48, 0xff, 0x52, 0x05, 0x65, 0xc9, 0xc1, 0x48, 0x8b, 0x75, 0x40, 0xd0, 0x59, 0x4d, 0xff, 0x61, 0x1c, 0x75, 0x4c, 0x01, 0x52, 0x8b, 0xc9, 0x56, 0x8b, 0x0c, 0x48, 0x58, 0xf1, 0x41, 0x31, 0x00, 0xd0, 0xd0, 0xec, 0x00, 0x59, 0x13, 0xe0, 0x72, 0x8b, 0x48, 0xff, 0x40, 0xd0, 0x...
