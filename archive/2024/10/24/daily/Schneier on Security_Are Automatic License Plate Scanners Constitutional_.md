## Are Automatic License Plate Scanners Constitutional?

An advocacy groups is [filing](https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/) a Fourth Amendment challenge against automatic license plate readers.

> “The City of Norfolk, Virginia, has installed a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible for people to drive anywhere without having their movements tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet surveillance program,” the [lawsuit notes](https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-1-Complaint.pdf). “In Norfolk, no one can escape the government’s 172 unblinking eyes,” it continues, referring to the 172 Flock cameras currently operational in Norfolk. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and has been ruled in many cases to protect against warrantless government surveillance, and the lawsuit specifically says Norfolk’s installation violates that.”

Of course they are, the founders didn’t specifically mention them, therefore they must be Constitutional.

This falls into the bin of things that are past their expiration date.

Try Neighbors by Ring, ARGUS, Public CCTV, PayByFace, grandma’s photo album, whatever.

It’s the 3rd Party Doctrine that is the issue, not the tool that is used.

That might only stop the government. We really need to get rid of identifiers on license plates. That will make it a lot harder to track cars. Police can ask for registration after they pull someone over, if they care about the car in addition to the driver. For parking violations they can read the VIN.
In the short term people can consider parking their car some distance from their destination when visiting sensitive places to make linking them to those places harder.

That implementation certainly looks problematic.

License plate scanners could be OK if each camera only stored data locally for a fixed period, and could only be retrieved with a warrant in the form “report any sightings of this specific license plate in this limited geographic area”

Historically, things done in public have been fair game for collection. I realize that when pervasive enough, such collection can be used to fill in the dots and prevent people from hiding things they might not want known, like “Where were you on the evening of October 20, 2024.” Similarly, what’s printed on the outside of an envelope has been considered public information, and, by analogy, sender and recipient information in email communication has at times been deemed fair game for warrantless collection.

Still, I don’t see how this the data collection described can be considered unconstitutional, since the terms search and seizure have (as far as I know — I am not a lawyer!) been generally applied to protect done in private, not things done in public.

Speed cameras, especially now in the age of AI, need to be banned nationwide. This isn’t about the constitutionality (thought I’m glad the 4th Amendment exists); this is about preventing a authoritarian dystopian civilization from being able to exist in our future.

How many books, comics, plays, scripts, movies, short stories, etc. have we written, as a warning to ourselves, to not allow these kinds of things to exist… and yet here we are trying to build the invisible, digital turn-key prison.

Cars: Inherent safety problem •

“In Norfolk, no one can escape the government’s 172 unblinking eyes” – Well, no one except those who walk, bike, or take the bus. Car drivers, esp. USians, tend to not realize that there are other ways to get around. Now if there are also facial recognition cameras active everywhere like in China, constantly tracking, that would be worse. Granted, I agree that the continuous tracking and storage is wrong for driving also, but traffic cameras generally are a good thing, to help the police stop the most deadly drivers and keep the average driver honest and law abiding. Without policing, driving descends into chaos and mayhem. More than we already have, I mean.

I do not think Automatic License Plate Scanners are constitutional, especially on such a large scale.

This has all sorts of interesting implications.

Fundamentally, “At what point does accumulating all the public information available become an unlawful search?”

This has been litigated already, about cell-phone location information. Can the cops simply get all the phones, all the time, every time – or do more specific warrants need to apply?

As I recall, the courts said No, but given our current batch of “justices” I’d give no credence to the precedent anyhow.

Furthermore, as is typical of pretty much all mass surveillance, the rich have a trivial loophole out – Register (and insure) the car as a ‘company car’, part of a fleet. Who knows who was driving which car when?
