Security leaders are in a tricky position trying to discern how much new AI-driven cybersecurity tools could actually benefit a security operations center (SOC). The hype about generative AI is still everywhere, but security teams have to live in reality. They face constantly incoming alerts from endpoint security platforms, SIEM tools, and phishing emails reported by internal users. Security teams also face an acute talent shortage.

In this guide, we'll lay out practical steps organizations can take to automate more of their processes and build [an autonomous SOC strategy](https://intezer.com/blog/incident-response/soc-automation-in-2024-tips-trends-tools/?utm_campaign=Hacker%20News&utm_source=article&utm_medium=SOC%20strategy). This should address the acute talent shortage in security teams, by employing artificial intelligence and machine learning with a variety of techniques, these systems simulate the decision-making and investigative processes of human analysts.

First, we'll define objectives for an autonomous SOC strategy and then consider key processes that could be automated. Next, we'll consider different AI and automation products, then finally look at a few examples of how those tools could be used as part of an autonomous SOC strategy.

## The Goal of an Autonomous SOC Strategy

The goal of the autonomous SOC strategy is to automate every step of alert triage from start to finish, reducing risk by independently investigating, triaging, and resolving *as many alerts as possible without any human intervention*.

It's important to set expectations here – the objective of an autonomous SOC strategy should not be to replace every human on a security team with AI tech. Like any well-rounded cybersecurity strategy, the bottom line is about protecting the organization by incorporating "people, processes, and technology." No reasonable security professional thinks we can remove people from that equation.

You can think of an autonomous SOC functioning like an extra team of Tier 1 or 2 analysts, expanding your team's capacity and skills. The system should be designed to escalate critical threats to human analysts. An autonomous SOC should *work for* *people*, using technology that fits into your processes, makes your job easier, and extends your capabilities.

## 6 Key SOC Processes to Automate

First, we have to recognize that every SOC is different (we'll talk about tools for automation in the next section.) You'll need to consider the specific needs of your SOC, so you can prioritize automating the workflows that create bottlenecks or overwhelm your team. Manual tasks that are repetitive and time-intensive are key opportunities to consider for automation.

Here we'll look at 6 key SOC processes – these will outline what we'll call our Autonomous SOC:

1. **Monitor** – The Autonomous SOC continuously monitors and collects alerts 24/7 from your integrated security tools, ensuring that no potential threat goes unnoticed.
2. **Collect Evidence** – Upon receiving an incoming alert, the Autonomous SOC collects all relevant data associated with the alert. That includes files, processes, command lines, evidence from process arguments, URLs, IPs, parent and child processes, memory images, and more.
3. **Investigate** – The Autonomous SOC analyzes each piece of collected evidence using AI and a variety of sophisticated techniques. That includes sandboxing, genetic code analysis, static analysis, open-source intelligence (OSINT), memory analysis, and reverse engineering. The results of these individual analyses are then summarized into a cohesive incident-wide assessment using generative AI models.
4. **Triage** – The Autonomous SOC categorizes the risk associated with each alert and decides whether to escalate it based on the investigation results. In addition, the Autonomous SOC reduces noise by auto remediating false positives within the detection systems, since these require no other action.
5. **Respond** – Serious threats get immediately escalated to the analysts. For all confirmed threats, the Autonomous SOC provides assessments, recommendations, creating tickets in the case management system. These include detection content and ready-to-use hunting rules to guide the response process.
6. **Report** – The Autonomous SOC generates reports to keep your team informed and provide tuning suggestions, allowing for continuous improvement in your security operations.

These steps use technology to "autonomously" sift through alerts, escalating only those that truly require human analysis. This helps effectively manage a high volume of alerts and drastically reduces time spent on false positives.

## SOC Automation Tools for Building Your Autonomous SOC

On a practical level, you need the right tools to execute your strategy. Let's look at some of the key tools that you can integrate into your systems to design a step-by-step implementation plan.

1. **SOAR products**: This is an established product category, with many SOC teams automating tasks using Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools. It has challenges since SOAR usually involves heavy engineering or building complex playbooks. Some SOARs have recently integrated AI, or offer pre-built playbooks and no-code tools that simplify automating some processes.
2. **Autonomous SOC products**: This is a newer product category, that uses native automated workflows and AI to ingest, investigate, and triage alerts. The newest startup...
