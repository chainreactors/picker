## New Open SSH Vulnerability

It’s a [serious one](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/07/01/regresshion-remote-unauthenticated-code-execution-vulnerability-in-openssh-server):

> The vulnerability, which is a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH’s server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root on glibc-based Linux systems; that presents a significant security risk. This race condition affects sshd in its default configuration.
>
> […]
>
> This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.
>
> Moreover, gaining root access would enable attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms, further obscuring their activities. This could also result in significant data breaches and leakage, giving attackers access to all data stored on the system, including sensitive or proprietary information that could be stolen or publicly disclosed.
>
> This vulnerability is challenging to exploit due to its remote race condition nature, requiring multiple attempts for a successful attack. This can cause memory corruption and necessitate overcoming Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Advancements in deep learning may significantly increase the exploitation rate, potentially providing attackers with a substantial advantage in leveraging such security flaws.

I hope for AI hardened systems. I wonder if anyone is working on that yet.

Not only a serious one but shows vividly how utmost pointless the ASLR is.

Sadly the industry is full of those pointless and half bakes solutions that are supposed to solve important problems but actually make things more difficult and solve nothing.

MSM report indicates

* The vulnerability is the result of a code regression introduced in 2020 that reintroduced CVE-2006-5051, a vulnerability that was fixed in 2006.

The problem was fixed in 2006

The problem was unfixed in 2020

@ ALL,

Hmm and the first mitigation is the one in many cases that should have been done long before.

Which is,

“Pull the plug from the external wall.”

To cut off the systems communications to the outside world.

We really should be asking about the supposed benefits of external communications and how we limit the ever present harm such communications paths cause.

I hear a lot about “the benefits” but it’s arm wavery at best and when examined is usually found to be wishful thinking.

The simple fact is all our commercially available “Applications” and the “OS’s” they run on are defective and riddled with vulnerabilities just waiting to become obviously exploited. By the time sufficient people are aware and the alarm gets out very many will probably have been harmed.

As for Open Source, yes it has vulnerabilities as well, which makes the point that maybe we should not be running with scissors.

@Leon

This actually shows exactly the opposite: ASLR slows the attack process. Attacking i386, with its weak ASLR, takes twice as many tries as attacking a non-ASLR system. Attacking amd64’s stronger ASLR takes so much longer that the researchers only theorize that such an attack is possible — it’s expected to take a quarter-million times as many tries as a non-ASLR system would.

@ Morley,

> “I hope for AI hardened systems. I wonder if anyone is working on that yet.”

Short and quick answers are,

“Yes” and by “starving the AI of input”.

Slightly longer answer,

When you think about it current AI systems work as “collect it all” back ends.

That is they slurp in any “plaintext” and build it’s “Digital Neural Network”(DNN) weights / multipliers with it.

Logically if there is no plaintext or information with usable statistics to build the DNN with then the AI is defunct.

So anything that has two basic properties is in effect AI hardened

1, All information outside the processing of the system is suitably randomised / coded / encrypted.
2, Only properly authenticated and authorized processes have access to the internal processing.

The first is actually the hardest because there are three levels of information you have to deal with currently,

1, Actual data.
2, Meta-Data.
3, Meta-Meta-Data.

I’m not going to go into how you deal with each layer as that’s been covered fairly frequently on this blog in the past and it’s fairly lengthy.

Not so serious for well maintained Linux systems because Qualys forgot to mention, that an exploit is currently only available for 32 bit systems (i368).

But if you have some kind of router or other device with ssh exposed, chances are good that you might have “visitors”.

And fixing is difficult. OpenWRT has a fixed version but how to get that onto your device? Other vendors tend to neglect the care of their p...
