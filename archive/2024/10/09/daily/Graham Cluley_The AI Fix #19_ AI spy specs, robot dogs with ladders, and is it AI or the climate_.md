In episode 19 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast, Graham and Mark discover some AI podcast hosts having an existential crisis, a robot dog climbs another step towards world domination, Mark makes a gift for anyone working in tech support, and William Shatner chews through Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

Things can take a terrible turn when a pair of bored students think they‚Äôre Ethan Hunt, and Mark thinks that an underwater IKEA might be the silver lining to the climate crisis.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
