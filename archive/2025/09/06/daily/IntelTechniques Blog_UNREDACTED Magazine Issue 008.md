UNREDACTED Magazine Issue 008 is now available!

After publication of the previous issue, I had thought that this magazine might be finished. While downloads and overall interest were at an all-time high, article submissions were low. Not just low, practically non-existent. My goal for the magazine was always to combine three of my favorite things from the past: Bulletin Board System (BBS) text files, photo-copied hacker 'zines', and old-school 2600 quarterly issues. Each of those merged various views from the communities which they served into a long-form outlet, encouraging the reader to devour the content unavailable anywhere else. Times have changed.

The internet has spoiled us. We have overwhelming unlimited access to immediate information. Click bait titles draw us in while our attention spans, or lack of, become victim to the next juicy thing. When we do find something online of interest, the information is limited to a bite-sized chunk which we can handle while we check our messages and scroll our feeds. We get sucked into a video when the thumbnail shows the "influencer's" shocked face or they promise to tell us the one thing we need to know to solve all of our problems (but never seem to disclose the secret). OK, OK, I sound like Andy Rooney now... and I just lost half of the remaining readers as they go search to see who that is. I think we all need Andy today more than ever. We also need more long-form written content.

With this issue, I am trying something new. In April, we announced that our digital book provider was terminating our legacy account and eliminating the ability to send free updates to those who had purchased books. This was devastating, because they were the only provider who offered the specific services we needed. In order to keep our promises of free book updates, we decided to post any new content to our Blog, free for the world to see.

This was met with both praise and criticism. The majority preferred these online updates which were released as they were written, instead of waiting for a combined update within a PDF. They also preferred the ability to immediately see the new details instead of skimming through the entire book to find the modified content. However, many readers wanted a PDF which they could download and add to their files for future offline reference. Some felt it was unfair that the updates were free for everyone and not just those who bought the books. We respect both camps, but ultimately found it more important to do SOMETHING instead of NOTHING.

Recently, we decided to do both. We will continue to post updates to our Blog as needed over at https://inteltechniques.com/blog/. With this magazine issue, we are combining all of those recent update posts, plus many new articles with expanded content, within a single PDF which can be preserved and digested as desired. No cost and no registration. Simply grab a copy from our site the same way as all previous issues.

While this issue is not much of a community effort, it allows us to use the existing avenue to deliver raw content which we feel is important. Most articles are simply attributed to "The IntelTechniques Team" since an internal group of us worked on them collectively. Any reference to "I" in those is a group effort "we". Two articles near the end were contributed by readers.

With this issue, we also eliminated any advertisements or paid endorsements. I am extremely thankful for our previous sponsors, as they made the past issues possible. This time around, we wanted to just focus on the content and not sales or ads. If you find value within these pages and have a strong desire to donate to the cause, please consider purchasing one of our digital books on our site. Give one as a gift to someone who needs it more than you. We also offer ways to donate virtual currency or smaller amounts on the [magazine page](https://inteltechniques.com/magazine.html). However, there is no pressure to donate, we want to do this work.

We now respectfully present issue 008 of UNREDACTED Magazine. No fluff. No filler. No agenda. Just free information.
