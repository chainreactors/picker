**Hack2Build**, ‘Beyond a Hackathon’ is an initiative which brings together the creativity and speed of prototyping by the partners in just 5-10 days. Partners validate their ideas with SAP during the ‘Hackathon phase’ and are encouraged to move from prototyping to the ‘build phase’, to develop their market-ready solution.

The SAP Co-Innovation Lab, North America hosted a Hack2Build focusing on SAP Build in collaboration with the Product Management from SAP Build Apps, SAP Build Workzone, SAP Build Process Automation, and the BTP Solution Architects teams during Feb. 20 - 24, 2023.

This event received more than 20 use cases submitted from SAP partner teams. After carefully reviewing the use case, 15 use cases were verified and accepted, and finally 13 use cases representing 13 SAP Partner teams were presented in the Demo Jam.
