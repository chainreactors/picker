 The [**SAP Community Expert Interview Series**](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/expert-interview/) highlights key strategic topics, such as emerging technologies, learning, and other topics, and provides insights from industry experts and leaders on turning ideas into innovative approaches that impact people, process, and technology. |

A popular Haitian proverb has a universal theme, “*Dèyè mòn, gen mòn*,” which translates to “*Beyond every mountain, there's another mountain.*” ![:mountain:](/html/@0BA01687EC4A528AA91E024C1E105F11/emoticons/26f0.png ":mountain:")️

As the business world and technology evolves, there is always something new to consider, or *another mountain to conquer*. It’s vital to keep up with emerging technologies and compelling trends.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/PawanKumarCircleProfile.png)Given the realities of continuous change, individuals and organizations should consider what’s next when assessing learning and development opportunities to stay ahead of the curve.

Today, there is a huge opportunity for non-programmers and advanced coders to leverage [Low-Code/No-Code](https://community.sap.com/topics/low-code-no-code) (LCNC) apps for a range of outcomes including mobile, desktop, browser, and TV using intuitive, visual drag-and-drop experience with zero (or near zero) lines of code.

For pawan.kumar08, SAP Community top contributor, SAP Development Consultant, and recent graduate of the [Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) Applications and Automations certification](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/100499/influencers/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2F100499%2Finfluencers%2FShared%20Documents%2FBriefings%2FBusiness%20Technology%20Platform%2FIntegration%2FJuly%202022%2FMentor%20Meeting%2FMentorMeeting%5FSAPIntegrationSuite%5F20220714%2Emp4&referrer=Teams%2ETEAMS%2DELECTRON&referrerScenario=teamsSdk%2DopenFilePreview), he knows first-hand about the importance of continuous learning, assessing what’s next, and climbing one mountain of opportunity at a time.

Enjoyed catching up with Pawan from his home office in Delhi, India.

**Stephanie De Camara Marley (SM):** **Hi Pawan! As member of the SAP Success Delivery Centre, you and your team provide expertise supporting customer innovation, emerging technologies, and leveraging R&D environments. How does this Center of Excellence (CoE) inspire you in your role as an SAP Development Consultant?![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/Pawan1.png)**

**Pawan Kumar (PK):** I must say that’s a great question. I have always had a fascination towards technology starting with my university days, as my major was Computer Science, where I got to learn a lot.

However, from my career journey addressing technology solutions with leaders like Infosys, Sopra Steria, EY and now SAP, I can see the real value emerging apps and tools brings to organizations, customers, and beyond.

This realization pushed me more to learn new technologies and leverage them by implementing innovative solutions for customer’s success.

As a team member in a CoE environment here at SAP, I get various opportunities to learn emerging technologies and work on them with industry experts which keeps me motivated and inspired.

**SM****:** **Congratulations on your recent certification: “**[**SAP Certified Citizen Developer Associate – Low-code/No-code (LCNC) Applications and Automations**](https://learning.sap.com/certification/sap-certified-citizen-developer-associate-sap-build-low-code-no-code-applications-and-automations)**.” You have great technical expertise, for example with** [**SAP Transportation Management**](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/06/15/accessing-updating-dependent-object-hosted-inside-another-dependent-object-in-sap-tm/) **(great blog!). What topics interested you the most in the certification (e.g., Building a LCNC Mobile App, Extension with SAP AppGyver, SAP Process Automation, SAP Work Zone, all of them, etc.)? Why?**

**PK:** Thank you! After completing the certification, I can say that all the topics are equally interesting in the learning journey of the certification, but if I have to pick the most exciting one out of them, it would definitely be building a LCNC Mobile App. ![:mobile_phone:](/html/@71C046F08079422E2FF02C74CE1867C6/emoticons/1f4f1.png ":mobile_phone:")

At the onset of my career, I’ve developed apps with coding language like SAP ABAP and it would take days to finish one app, but with the capabilities of LCNC, it hardly takes few hours to develop a mobile app with no prior experience in coding. Isn’t that exciting and cool!![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/Pawan2.png)

You could have an idea, and it can be built into an app within a day…!

**SM****:** **How did hear about this** **low-code/no-code certification****?**

**PK:** New technologies always excite me, so when I learned that SAP had acquired a LCNC platform [SAP AppGyver](https://community.sap.com/topics/appgyver), I tried exploring it within the community edition. I found it really interesting and dug deeper into it; that is when I came across this certification on the learning portal ([Free SAP Online Courses | SAP Learning](https://learning.sap.com/)) of SAP.

**SM****:** **Very cool that you applied your low-code/no-code knowledge into a** [**Retail ...
