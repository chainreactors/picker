# Corpse-eating selfies, and other ways to trick scammers (Lock and Code S06E14)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

There’s a unique counter response to romance scammers.

Her name is Becky Holmes.

Holmes, an expert and author on romance scams, has spent years responding to nearly every romance scammer who lands a message in her inbox. She told one scammer pretending to be Brad Pitt that she needed immediate help [hiding the body of one of her murder victims](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/brad-pitt-a-still-body-ketchup-and-a-knife-or/id1500049667?i=1000603859247). She made one romance scammer laugh at her immediate willingness to take an international flight to see him. She has told scammers she lives at addresses with [lewd street names](https://x.com/deathtospinach/status/1937105123110482098), she has sent [pictures of apples](https://x.com/deathtospinach/status/1911330346081058818)—the produce—to scammers requesting Apple gift cards, and she’s even tricked a scammer impersonating Mark Wahlberg that she might be [experimenting with cannibalism](https://x.com/deathtospinach/status/1904546064448827532).

Though Holmes routinely gets a laugh online, she’s also coordinated with law enforcement to get several romance scammers shut down. And every effort counts, as romance scams are still a dangerous threat to everyday people.

Rather than tricking a person into donating to a bogus charity, or fooling someone into entering their username and password on a fake website, romance scammers ensnare their targets through prolonged campaigns of affection.

They reach out on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, X, or Instagram and they bear a simple message: They love you. They know you’re a stranger, but they sense a connection, and after all, they just want to talk.

A romance scammer’s advances can be appealing for two reasons. One, some romance scammers target divorcees and widows, making their romantic gestures welcome and comforting. Two, some romance scammers dress up their messages with the allure of celebrity by impersonating famous actors and musicians like Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Keanu Reeves.

These scams are effective, too, to sometimes devastating consequences. According to recent research from Malwarebytes, [10% of the public have been the victims of romance scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2025/06/44-of-people-encounter-a-mobile-scam-every-single-day-malwarebytes-finds), and a small portion of romance scam victims have [lost $10,000 or more](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/romance-scams-costlier-than-ever-10-percent-of-victims-lose-10000-or-more).

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Holmes about her experiences online with romance scammers, whether [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) is changing online fraud, and why the rules for protection and scam identification have changed in an increasingly advanced, technological world.

>  ”I’ve seen videos of scammers actually making these real life video manipulation calls where you’ve got some guy sitting one side of the world pretending to be somewhere else completely, and he’s talking into his phone and it’s coming out on the other person’s phone as a different image with a different voice.”
