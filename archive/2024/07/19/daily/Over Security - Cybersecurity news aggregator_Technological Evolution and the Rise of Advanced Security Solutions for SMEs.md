### The Modern Cybersecurity Landscape for SMEs

In today’s digital age, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are facing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. The threat landscape has evolved dramatically, with malicious actors constantly seeking out the weakest links, including those within supply chains.

As outlined by Sekoia TDR, some attackers group today specifically target small or middle-sized companies, such as the [Vice Society group](https://blog.sekoia.io/vice-society-a-discreet-but-steady-double-extortion-ransomware-group/) or [8base and Akira ransomware groups](https://blog.sekoia.io/sekoia-io-mid-2023-ransomware-threat-landscape/) which specialize in human-operated double-extortion campaigns. Cybercriminals also adapt their methods: in the financial sector for instance, Business Email Compromise (BEC) campaigns [pose an increasing threat](https://blog.sekoia.io/unmasking-the-latest-trends-of-the-financial-cyber-threat-landscape/) to SMEs.

Overall, as reported in the [2019 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2019/2019-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf), small businesses are target #1 for criminals and represent 43% of all data breaches.

Coupled with a scarcity of skilled security professionals, this creates a heightened exposure for SMEs globally. These businesses, which form a significant portion of our global economy, must navigate the complexities of an increasingly digital world while struggling to attract and retain the necessary personnel to tackle cybersecurity issues effectively.

### The Cloud Revolution

The migration to cloud-based solutions has revolutionized how SMEs approach cybersecurity. The shift from legacy on-premise deployments of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and other log management products to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models has brought numerous benefits. Cloud technology simplifies the management of complex tech stacks, reduces costs, and offers more “plug and play” options, making advanced security solutions more accessible and manageable for SMEs.

### Emergence of Security Service Delivery Platforms

The emergence of Security Service Delivery Platforms (SSDPs) marks another significant advancement in the industry. These platforms enable Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to upgrade or redefine their service models, transitioning towards Managed Extended Detection and Response (MXDR) offerings. By abstracting the technical layer, SSDPs allow service providers to focus resources on delivering high-quality, specialized services instead of balancing between service and product expertise. This leads to more hybrid engagement models where service providers can collaborate closely with customer teams to drive custom, high-quality operations.

### Generative AI: A Game Changer

One of the most talked-about technological disruptors today is generative AI (genAI). While the cybersecurity industry has long leveraged machine learning and other AI models, genAI offers a new level of sophistication. Expertly trained models can augment SOC analysts, combat analyst fatigue, and support ongoing product training throughout the platform’s usage lifetime. The potential of combining human and AI skills is immense, and we are only beginning to scratch the surface. This innovation is poised to significantly impact the availability and cost of cybersecurity services for SMEs.

### Democratizing Advanced Cybersecurity Services

The democratization of advanced cybersecurity services means that SMEs can now access the types of services that were once reserved for large corporations. This development is crucial for enabling growth and ensuring higher quality deliverables from SMEs, ultimately contributing to a more secure and resilient economy.

### Conclusion: The Future of Cybersecurity for SMEs

At [Sekoia.io](https://www.sekoia.io/en/homepage/), we are at the forefront of this dynamic shift. Our threat intelligence-powered SOC platform serves as the SSDP upon which our partners consolidate their offerings and build the future of cybersecurity. We believe that the commodification of cybersecurity will lead to positive and secure outcomes for all. SMEs now have the opportunity to claim their right to robust security at an affordable price, leveling the playing field and enhancing their ability to combat adversaries.

The future of cybersecurity is bright, and as we continue to innovate and evolve, we remain committed to providing SMEs with the tools and solutions they need to protect their businesses and thrive in an increasingly digital world.
