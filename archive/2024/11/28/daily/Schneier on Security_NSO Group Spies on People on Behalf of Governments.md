## NSO Group Spies on People on Behalf of Governments

The Israeli company NSO Group sells Pegasus spyware to countries around the world (including countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, India, Mexico, Morocco and Rwanda). We assumed that those countries use the spyware themselves. Now we’ve [learned](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/14/nso-pegasus-spyware-whatsapp) that that’s not true: that NSO Group employees operate the spyware on behalf of their customers.

> Legal documents released in [ongoing US litigation between NSO Group and WhatsApp](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/29/pegasus-surveillance-code-whatsapp-meta-lawsuit-nso-group) have revealed for the first time that the Israeli cyberweapons maker ­ and not its government customers ­ is the party that “installs and extracts” information from mobile phones targeted by the company’s hacking software.

It sounds like the company was merely a front for the Mossad. If there was a little more distance between it and the Mossad, it also could have been considered a cut-out, knowing the source of information and the destination (Mossad)…and facilitating the transfer of information.

Whenever they get caught, which is always a risk, the company can fold and then perhaps resurrect under a different name and continue “business”. You can’t undo knowledge, especially if it is useful to you. Plus Mossad is not implicated.

The CIA does this all the time. In decades past, they even had their own airline…..not serving as a cut-out, but merely to facilitate movement of people and material.

This method gives governments plausible deniability, and they can honestly say that they are not involved in bugging opponent’s (or dissident’s) phones.

Yup,basically as with everything else – outsourcing. Plus here, the benefit is even bigger, instead of sloppy, incompetent government wannabe “spies” – you get R E A L Professionals. SaaS has a new meaning and it’s not wotcha think or are used to know, it’s Spying as a Service or HaaS. Give a man a fish a day, no, teach a man…, NO. I will Ph(f)ish for you and I’ll feed it to ya too, all ya gotsta do is just say “yum – I lika taste o’ dat.”

It’s dangerous and illegal, but we’re comfortable.

@Rontea

Lack of qualified staff to regulate rights frameworks and a “hodge-podge approach to the governance of data and technology.”

Additional government-wide law or guidance required:

*“To assist federal agencies with consistently implementing civil rights and civil liberties protections when collecting, sharing, and using data, we suggest that Congress direct an appropriate federal entity to issue government-wide guidance or regulations addressing this matter. In its direction, Congress should consider delegating to such entity the explicit authority to make needed technical and policy choices or explicitly stating Congress’s own choices.”*

@ALL

In many areas Privacy law does not cover emerging technologies that intrude into public, personal and intimate spaces. Privacy legislation was originally designed only for data, not to protect privacy and so does not cover collection, just the storage of that data.

Newer technologies since the conception of the Privacy Act are not mentioned by the legislation, yet it is the only legal guidance that is used to regulate invasive tech.

To enforce your rights requires appropriate legislation allowing you to take action.

NSO again refuses to hand over evidence claiming it doesn’t spy on activists.

@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards,

> “We assumed that those countries use the spyware themselves.”

I thought you were aware that NSO and several others run “A full Service Package” to customers. If for no other reasons than to stop the customer using the software against,

1, The licence fees requirements.
2, Various nations personnel.

The official excuse to customers was “the speed of change” that is the customer was “renting access to target” not “buying very quickly outdated access methods”.

> Now we’ve learned that that’s not true: that NSO Group employees operate the spyware on behalf of their customers.

Actually no, it’s not “on behalf of their customers” that’s a mistake those...
