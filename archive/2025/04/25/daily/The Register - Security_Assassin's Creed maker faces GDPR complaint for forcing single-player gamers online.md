## Collecting data from solo players is a Far Cry from being necessary, says noyb

For anyone who's ever been frustrated by the need to go online to play a single-player video game, the European privacy specialists at noyb have heard you, and they've filed a complaint against Ubisoft in Austria dealing specifically with the issue.

Noyb has [asked](https://noyb.eu/en/play-alone-ubisoft-still-watching-you) Austrian data protection authorities to investigate the French game studio, which publishes titles in popular series including Far Cry, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs, and others, for violations of [article 6(1)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for forcing players online when a game doesn't have any online functionality.

"Imagine if the Monopoly man sat at your table and took notes every time you want to play a board game with your family or friends," said noyb (none of your business) data protection lawyer Joakim Söderberg. "Well, that's the reality of video games … as long as you have an open internet connection when you play, your data is collected and analyzed."
