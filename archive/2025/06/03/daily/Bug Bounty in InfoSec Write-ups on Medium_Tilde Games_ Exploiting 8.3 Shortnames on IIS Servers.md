**IIS Tilde Enumeration? Sounds cool but what is that…**

Before diving into the vulnerability, it’s important to understand 8.3 filenames (also known as short names or SFNs). In the MS-DOS era, filenames followed a strict format: 8 characters for the name and 3 for the extension, like `secret~1.txt` or `admin~1.aspx`. This format was designed for compatibility with older systems. Modern Windows systems support long filenames but still generate these short-name aliases for backward compatibility. On older or misconfigured servers, these short names can sometimes be enumerated.

Yep, you guessed it! This leads to the IIS Tilde Enumeration vulnerability, where attackers can discover hidden files or directories by brute-forcing short names or by searching for similar paths on platforms like GitHub.

**Why Use Tilde Enumeration Instead of Normal Bruteforce?**

If this question crossed your mind — you’re thinking in the right direction. The key point is that **Tilde Enumeration doesn’t replace brute-force attacks but instead it complements them**. It offers a few distinct advantages that make it worth trying:

Here are three major benefits:

1. **It works even on non-public files**
   A file like `secret-notes-final-rev2.txt` may never show up in any wordlist. But Windows will generate `secret~1.txt` — and that can be discovered using tilde tricks.
2. **It narrows your attack surface**
   Once you know `admin~1.aspx` exists, you can try guessing the full name or abuse that path directly. You don't have to guess thousands of possible variations.
3. **Tilde enumeration leaks partial names**
    Unlike traditional brute-forcing (which requires full filenames), tilde enumeration gives you *fragments* of existing files or directories — like `admin~1`, `backu~1`, or `config~1`. This can reveal:

* That something **exists** behind the scenes
* A hint about its **actual name**, even if you don’t know the full name yet

Let’s begin the hunt.

There are several tools available to detect and potentially exploit this vulnerability. But before jumping in, keep this in mind: Tilde enumeration alone is often not accepted in bug bounty programs unless it leads to the disclosure of sensitive files or information. Without impact, such reports are frequently marked as informative or rejected.

### Step 1: Baseline Behavior

* Start by fetching the index page of a target hosted on IIS. In this case, we receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

Initial response

* Next, request a clearly non-existent file, such as `/nonexist`. You should see a `404 Not Found` error — this confirms normal behavior for missing files.

Fetching non-existing page

* Now try requesting `/ASPNET~1`. While the server still returns `404 Not Found`, observe closely — the **error message body or structure often changes**, which indicates the presence of short-name processing.

Tweaking via tilde

### Step 2: Confirmation

To confirm, you can use the **IIS ShortName Scanner extension for Burp Suite**. It automates the detection by analyzing subtle response differences in short-name probing.

Alternatively, use tools like `shortscan` by default, it runs recursively. Let it run and monitor for partial matches or name leaks. If no results appear, try using a custom wordlist tailored for IIS or enterprise file naming conventions.

### Step 3: Expanding the Discovery

Once you identify a short name path (e.g., /ASPNET\_CLIENT/SYSTEM\_WEB/4\_0\_30319), you can search GitHub using the filter:

```
path:/<KNOWN_SHORT_PATH>
```

This can help reveal source code, backups, or deployment artifacts that match the pattern. For example, you might find references to a `.cab` file. CAB files are Windows cabinet archives often used for bundling setup files, DLLs, or executables.

Path to cab file

### Step 4: Downloading and Analyzing Artifacts

If the path exists, attempt to download the CAB file directly using `wget` or `curl`. Extract its contents using:

```
cabextract file.cab
```

This will typically reveal `.exe` and `.dll` files. To analyze DLLs: Use **dotPeek** for static inspection and decompilation. Alternatively, use **dnSpy** — especially effective when dealing with custom .NET assemblies.

### Step 5: Nothing sensitive found, now what?

So you’ve found something that *looks* interesting but nothing immediately sensitive. Unfortunately, not every program will accept that as a valid finding unless it leads to clear impact.

In my case, I had to dig deeper. I collected wordlists from various sources, cleaned and deduplicated them, fed them into shortscan and continued enumerating to prove impact. Eventually, I landed on another custom DLL and this one finally had the real goods: **hardcoded internal IPs and API keys**.

If you’re feeling a little *unhinged* and h...
