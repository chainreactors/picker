## Malware Delivered through Google Search

Criminals using Google search ads to deliver malware isn’t new, but Ars Technica [declared](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/until-further-notice-think-twice-before-using-google-to-download-software/) that the problem has become much worse recently.

> The surge is coming from numerous malware families, including AuroraStealer, [IcedID](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/l/icedid-botnet-distributors-abuse-google-ppc-to-distribute-malware.html), Meta Stealer, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Formbook, and XLoader. In the past, these families typically relied on phishing and malicious spam that attached Microsoft Word documents with booby-trapped macros. Over the past month, Google Ads has become the go-to place for criminals to spread their malicious wares that are disguised as legitimate downloads by impersonating brands such as Adobe Reader, Gimp, Microsoft Teams, OBS, Slack, Tor, and Thunderbird.
>
> […]
>
> It’s clear that despite all the progress Google has made filtering malicious sites out of returned ads and search results over the past couple decades, criminals have found ways to strike back. These criminals excel at finding the latest techniques to counter the filtering. As soon as Google devises a way to block them, the criminals figure out new ways to circumvent those protections.

Google has had this problem for ages. The only successful ransomware incidents at my company years back came from users clicking Google search ads for the website they were trying to get to. Users searched “amazon.com” trying to get to amazon.com and the first line was an ad for Amazon store but took you to a page running exploits. Thankfully it did not spread between machines. We reported it to Google 7 times in 2 days. Eventually chrome safe browsing blocked the page but the ad was still there for a few days.

I think a whole bunch of them has “issues”. Like the case with DuckDuckGo and their acceptance of trackers from Microsoft, disclosed by security researchers last year.

Because of “an agreement in their syndicated search content contract between the two companies”.

Explains why DuckDuckGo search results are so similar to those of Bing. More than what could be expected if it actually was an independently indexed search engine.

Google is also pushing their new Manifest Version 3 to cripple ad-blockers. It looks like (I know that it isn’t so) they are trying to help these people distribute malware in order to make ad money.

@ ALL,

Re : Evolution in action.

I know some do not like the idea but when you read,

> *“These criminals excel at finding the latest techniques to counter the filtering. As soon as Google devises a way to block them, the criminals figure out new ways to circumvent those protections”*

Tells you three things,

1, It is an adverserial process.
2, The process evolves rapidly.
3, The defender is not proactive.

Thus you could ask why the corporation with the biggest financial risk in the Internet Add Revenue is reactive not proactive to threats against a major sorce of their income (if not profit).

There is the obvious but somewhat trite “Because they are the defender…” argument.

Or you could take a slightly more in depth view without necessarly “deep diving” down the rabbit hole, and ask “What high level advantage the attackers have?”

In the past it’s been discussed that frequently defending systems are in effect “static” and attacks are quite “agile”. To a certain extent this can be expected as “the longer the wall the easier it is to find a less guarded point to attack” which also moves slowely or not at all, thus fascilitating an attack

Sometimes we have to accept that a system is too large to effectively defend within the current resources.

So I’d be tempted to ask what the trade offs were at various points along the development and maintainence cycles.

And BTW Microsoft’s Bing has now changed so that you can ask it questions. Seems to be integrated with ChatGPT.

From a Dec 2022 ProPublica article:

“Legislators, including Sen. Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have warned that the [opaque and fraud-ridden digital ad ecosystem](https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/10/warner-calls-on-ftc-and-google-to-address-the-prevalence-of-digital-ad-fraud) led by Google poses a national security risk.”

If true, this probably doesn’t do much to soften the antitrust suit the DOJ and several AG’s recently filed against them.

@admin,

it could be best to disallow posts that only include a hyperlink or very little text besides a hyperlink.

@Clive Robinson

> “What high level advantage the attackers have?”

A few thoughts come to mind…

1. Asymmetry in the criteria of success. The defender has to find and correct/mitigate all exploitable vulnerabilities in the system (there are many of them); the attacker only needs to find one that the defender hasn’t found/fixed.
2. The defender’s system has a purpose to serve and many users/stakeholders to satisfy, besides being secure. Compromises need to be made to balance the different requ...
