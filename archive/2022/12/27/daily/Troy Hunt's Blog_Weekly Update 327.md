# Weekly Update 327

26 December 2022

It's my last weekly update on the road for a while! As enjoyable as travel is, I'm looking forward to getting back to a normal routine and really starting to smash out some of the goals I have for the coming year. For now though, I've published this a couple of days after recording, and a day after an awesome hot, beachside Christmas. Hope yours has been amazing too, see you from home next week ðŸ˜Š
