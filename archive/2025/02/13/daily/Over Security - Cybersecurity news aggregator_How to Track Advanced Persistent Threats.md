How to Track Advanced Persistent Threats

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) stand out as one of the most formidable challenges for businesses in the cybersecurity landscape. These threats can cause irreparable damage, leading to financial losses, data breaches, and reputational harm.

APTs are defined as sophisticated targeted attacks typically conducted by highly funded adversaries: national agencies, state-sponsored groups, organized crime groups, corporate espionage actors.

## What Are APTs

The name speaks for itself, APTs are:

* **Advanced:** Having at hackers’ disposal the full (and ever-growing) arsenal of techniques and tools to get and maintain access to the target.

* **Persistent:** The aim is to keep long-term access to the targeted system or network. This involves constant improving and updating of the tools to evade detection.

* **Threats:** Such campaigns are intentionally malicious and inevitably harmful. They are backed by coordinated actions of skilled, motivated, organized, and well-resourced professionals.

## Why Are APTs a Significant Threat to Businesses

APTs prefer to target large corporations, government entities, and critical infrastructure. Finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and energy are prime targets for APTs due to the high value of their assets, data and infrastructure. The consequences of a successful APT attack extend beyond financial loss and corporate damage — they can impact national security, cause market instability, disrupt economies, and put lives at risk.

But no business, however modest-scale and unrelated to strategic industries, can consider itself safe:

* Small and medium companies still possess valuable assets, handle sensitive customer information, financial data, or intellectual property
* They are part of supply chains that can be disrupted by attacks
* A successful infiltration into their communications grants access to larger partners or clients.
* Along with all this, they have weaker security posture, invest less in cyber threat prevention.

## Detect Early, Defend Better: The Power of Threat Intelligence

[Threat intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-explained/) is a pivotal element of an APT-resistant cybersecurity strategy. By gathering, analyzing, and applying intelligence on cyber threats, organizations can proactively detect and neutralize them before they escalate.

TI provides:

* **Early Detection**: Identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) before damage occurs.
* **Behavioral Analysis**: Understanding attacker [tactics, techniques, and procedures](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-ttps-explained/) (TTPs) to anticipate movements.
* **Threat Hunting**: Actively searching for hidden threats within the network.
* **Stronger Security Posture**: Defenses based on real-world threat insights.
* **Incident Response Efficiency**: Rapidly responding to and mitigating APT incidents.

## How Threat Intelligence Lookup Facilitates APT Reconnaissance

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) is a solution fit for all these tasks: a state-of-the-art search engine for threat researchers and cybersecurity teams. It provides detailed insights into [indicators of compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs), malware behavior, and attack patterns.

It supports over [40 search parameters](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-lookup-search-parameters/) to query a constantly updated database of threat data, collected from millions of public malware and phishing samples and manually analyzed by a team of threat analysts.

For a business, it’s a source of actionable information for preventing, detecting and mitigating all sorts of cyberattacks up to APTs, thus avoiding operational disruptions, financial and reputational damages.
