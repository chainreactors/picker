Ola, boa tarde!

**Reference**

This is the Part 2 of the blog article series I would like to describe the Value Management Approach for Chemical companies.

* The Part 1 could be found here: <https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/24/value-management-approach-for-the-chemical-companies-part-1/>

Previously in the Part 1 I have delivered my point of view to the common approach to the value estimation for the transformation programs and its main problem and gave the overview how to manage the value lifecycle more efficiently.

Part 1 concluded with the overview scheme describing the effective value management approach in common in one picture. I must post the picture again here to refer during this Part 2.

Picture 1. The effective Value Management Approach – high-level overview.

And I would like to start from the Step 1 “Define the target KPI List”

**The KPI list relevant for the Chemical Company | Step 1.**

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Navi_2-1.png)

There are many sources of the KPIs for industries, but for transformation programs realized with SAP I suggest using the public tool “SAP Value Lifecycle Manager” or SAP VLM (<https://vlm.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/index.html#/home>) which provides big list of advantages, but major one be especially described below.

*Note 1: the instruction of the SAP VLM tool usage is out of the scope of my blog. If you are interesting, you can self-register and proceed with “How to videos”*

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Pict_2-2.png)

Picture 2. The SAP Value Lifecycle Manager start screen and “How to videos” link.

*Note 2: if you are not SAP employee you can self-register using your corporate e-mail and try the SAP VLM, but available functions and data will be limited significantly. For better experience please contact your SAP Account Executive and ask to provide the special workshop with SAP Value Advisory Team.*

I would like to propose example of starting list of KPIs based on SAP VLM recommendations and my experience.

Picture 3. Example of proposed KPI list for the start of transformation program.

This list has been defined based on following assumptions:

1. Not many for each business process area.

   * 3 to 5 KPIs per area is a very good quantity to start the value journey,

   * Consider that each KPI baseline data should be collected for each business unit. That´s why for 5 business units (for example) every KPI be multiplied x5,

2. They lead to clear monetized benefits (Revenue, Costs, Margin, Working capital),

3. They are being selected by SAP Value Advisory experts for the Chemical Industry:

* + Asset management area is highly important for Chemicals asset-incentive industry with continuous production cycle where shutdown of the one equipment might cause stop all production line with losses of production volumes and with high costs and time of the process restart,

  + Manufacturing area and especially Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) also critically important for the process where equipment should run in 24x7x365 mode,

  + Sustainability with especially energy consumption ratio and manufacturing safety performance does not need any additional comments,

  + Material turnaround or “Days in Inventory” (DII) impacts significantly to the working capital and should be measured for every type of inventories separately (raw materials, semi-products, goods, MRO material, CAPEX materials, others),

  + Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) together with DII impact on Cash Conversion Cycle and possibility to manage and financing the operations with lower external credits to decrease the cost of capital.

Of course, this KPIs list is not cast in granite. You can adopt it on your own opinion about preferred value areas, but I suggest considering:

* Do not try to take many KPIs from the beginning. each additional KPI will increase your workload dramatically (see steps 1 to 16 on the Picture 1 and remember the multiplicator – quantity of business units), and you will have possibility to include them later (see steps 17 and 18 on the Picture 1),

* KPIs provided by SAP VLM can be compared with your industrial peers and it makes easy to find a waypoint to your next move.

During this blog I cannot proceed deeper into details of each KPI, the calculation formula and financial impact. I plan to dive into several examples further on, in Step 5 “Calculate Monetized Outcomes”. Also, you can get more information about each of KPIs in SAP VLM and in many external resources, I recommend starting with investopedia.com or even [Wikipedia (example – DII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_in_inventory).

Roles and responsibilities for the Step 1:

Step 1 should be performed by company’s Business Efficiency (BE) team with assistance and advisory of SAP Value Advisory team (SAP VA) on the KPI List preparation phase.

Outcomes for the Step 1:

After preparation the KPI List and approval by executives, the company should start the baseline data collection. That leads us to Step 2 which is much more complex.

**Measure current KPI Values as the Baseline | Step 2.**

As I mentioned previously this Step is mandatory with two very simple reasons:

* Any measurable improvement is the delta between “Befo...
