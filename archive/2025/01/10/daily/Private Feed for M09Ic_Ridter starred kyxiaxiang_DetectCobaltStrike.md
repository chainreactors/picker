# Detect CobaltStrike

CobaltStrike Beacon uses a well-known open-source static library: [libtomcrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt). During reverse engineering of Beacon, I discovered that Beacon uses the `rng_get_bytes` function.

This could potentially become a stronger detection method, even surpassing Wininet APIs. According to the release notes from CobaltStrike version 4.10, Fortra has introduced an evasion mechanism called **Beacon\_Gate**. The file `beacon_gate.h` gives us some insight into how this works.
