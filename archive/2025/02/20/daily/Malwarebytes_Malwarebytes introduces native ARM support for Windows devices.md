# Malwarebytes introduces native ARM support for Windows devices

Posted: February 19, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

For the last four years, Malwarebytes has been protecting ARM-based machines running on Apple’s M-series processors. Now, we’ve expanded our protection range to include ARM-based Windows machines such as Copilot+ PCs, including Microsoft Surface Pro, Lenovo Yoga Slim and ThinkPad, and Dell Inspiron, among others.

ARM-based chips offer advantages such as improved performance, longer battery life, lower costs, and advanced features like on-device [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) processing.

And with ARM processors gaining popularity in the PC market—[projections](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/arm-based-pcs-to-nearly-double-market-share-by-2027/) suggest that they could have 25% market share by 2027—there is no doubt that [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) creators will expand their reach into this area.

Malwarebytes helps you get ahead of these threats. With active protection layers that defend against system vulnerabilities, malicious links, and more, Malwarebytes has you covered across your devices.

**Where can I get it?**

Go to the [Malwarebytes website](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) and hit the Free Download button to try it yourself, or click the button below. Our installer will automatically detect if you have an ARM device.

We recommend Windows 11 or higher for this installation, because Windows 11 has been optimized to run on ARM processors.
