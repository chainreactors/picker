As promised, SAP BTP Innobytes is back with fresh new content for SAP BTP. We are very excited to kick-off 2023 with 3 top innovation highlights in the form of an easily consumable and engaging video! For our January edition, we are sharing updates for SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Integration Suite and SAP Build Apps. Check out the video to learn more!

# Ready. Set. Read!

## **Data & Analytics Innovations on SAP BTP**

### **Renovated SAP HANA Cloud tooling**

It’s no surprise that administration and monitoring tasks can be quite time consuming, especially when having to switch between multiple tools. To help our customers overcome this problem, we’ve recently **combined the administration and monitoring offerings** of SAP HANA Cloud on SAP Business Technology Platform into **one unified tool**! SAP HANA Cloud Central now includes capabilities previously provided by SAP HANA database explorer and SAP HANA cockpit.

The update offers a more **intuitive approach** for managing your landscapes and therefore significantly improves your user experience. And the best part is it’s based on a tool **you already know!**

To summarize, with this improvement, you’ll benefit from:

* **Simplicity**: You won’t need multiple tools anymore. A single tool will be sufficient for performing your database administration & monitoring tasks.

* **Performance**: With the updated tooling, you can perform tasks faster, which results in increased productivity.

* **Leverage your knowledge:** You don’t have to worry about learning yet another tool. Just apply what you know already!

**Learn more:**

## **Integration Innovations on SAP BTP**

### **Migration support for SAP Integration Suite**

Migration Support for SAP Integration Suite

You can now **safely, securely,** and **seamlessly** transition to SAP Integration Suite by using the following capabilities:

* **Migration Assessment:** to assess your current SAP PI/PO landscape​, evaluate based on a flexible rules framework​ and finally check for and use recommended best practices and guidelines.

* **Migration feature:** (part of the Cloud Integration capability) to migrate different scenarios based on templates.

* **Partner tools**: to automate regression testing, use tools from partner companies, such as Int4 and Figaf, to make sure that the migration was completed without any hiccups.

Why wait? Get started today and migrate to SAP Integration Suite!

## **Application Development Innovations on SAP BTP**

### **Try out visual cloud functions on the SAP Build Apps Sandbox**

Every business expert can identify a **process** in their line of work that could be **improved** or **simplified** with a **custom application**, though they don’t always have the technical skills or resources to develop it.

Last year at SAP TechEd, we launched **SAP Build Apps on SAP BTP** along with the new backend development feature: **visual cloud functions**.
