Dedicated to the branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. This field involves the application of several information security principles and aims to provide for attribution and event reconstruction following forth from audit processes. This subreddit is not limited to just personal computers and encompasses all media that may also fall under digital forensics (e.g., cellphones, video, etc.).

# BIRT Incident Response & Triage Beta update

[News](/r/computerforensics/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%22)

I had previously posted asking for beta testers and several of you responded, so thanks!

Since then, I've added a (very simple) YouTube channel that has quick tutorials on how to use the application and several small blog posts on LinkedIn (I know, I know...). The application has also been updated so that the documentation is front-and-center on the main ribbon menu.

The blog posts cover local/remote LLM integration and using Sysmon and the Win32 API data source. I think next week I'll have a text post on integrating Velociraptor.

What can BIRT do?

* Ingest endpoint artifact files ($MFT, Registry, EVTX, PCAP + more) and produce searchable, indexed timelines
* Reconstruct the endpoint and apply hundreds of included MITRE ATT&CK based rules
* Produce interactive investigations from endpoint evidence
* Integrate with remote or local LLM's like chatGPT or LLAMA for contextual lookups and automated report building
* API for orchestration & automation

Please check it out and let me know what you think, thanks!
