The US Federal Trade Commission has ordered international payments service MoneyGram to return $115.8 million to nearly 40,000 customers defrauded by scammers.

The FTC says MoneyGram failed to crack down on scammers abusing their payment system for almost two decades.

[The order](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/more-115-million-refunds-sent-consumers-result-ftc-doj-charges-moneygram-failed-crack-down-scams) to return funds to customer accounts comes after MoneyGram failed to follow previous settlements with the FTC and the Justice Department to improve its anti-fraud systems.

Previously, the FTC and the DOJ found that between 2004 and 2008, MoneyGram either knew or failed to crack down on more than 1,200 of its agents that accounted for the vast majority of fraudulent transactions on its platform.

These fraudsters would operate as telemarketers, contact consumers in the US and Canada, and trick them into wiring funds via the MoneyGram service. These groups used schemes like guaranteed loans, secret shopper programs, or told victims they won the lottery and needed to secure prizes.

In a [2009 action](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2009/10/moneygram-pay-18-million-settle-ftc-charges-it-allowed-its-money-transfer-system-be-used-fraud) against MoneyGram, the FTC said the company "knew that its system was being used to defraud people but did very little about it," and that in some cases, even some of its agents in Canada participated in the schemes.

The FTC ordered MoneyGram to refund $18 million to consumers in 2009, and the company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in 2012, promising to improve its anti-fraud and anti-money laundering systems.

In 2018, both the [FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/11/moneygram-agrees-pay-125-million-settle-allegations-company-violated-ftcs-2009-order-breached-2012) and [DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/moneygram-international-inc-agrees-extend-deferred-prosecution-agreement-forfeits-125-million) fined MoneyGram $125 million for failing to comply with the previous agreement. At the time, the FTC said MoneyGram had again failed to crack down on agents that had a large number of suspicious transactions, even in cases where 50% of transactions taking place at an agent location were found to be fraudulent.

Furthermore, in 2018, the FTC found that MoneyGram's computerized monitoring system, designed to spot and stop fraudsters from using its service, stopped working for a whopping 18-month period between 2015 and 2016, during which time known fraudsters abused MoneyGram unhindered.

The new round of $115.8 million consumer refunds is for US and Canadian consumers who submitted claims during 2021. A special website has been established for victims who lost funds to scammers and submitted a claim: [moneygramremission.com](https://www.moneygramremission.com/).

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Namecheap incident:** Domain registrar Namecheap [says](https://www.namecheap.com/status-updates/archives/74848) that hackers breached its account with email delivery service Sendgrid and abused it to send out DHL and Metamask-themed phishing campaigns. Because the emails had the proper DKIM signatures, they bypassed many email spam and security filters. Namecheap says it has shut down its Sendgrid account, which has caused downtime for some of its services that delivered authentication codes, helped with device verification, and with account password reset emails.

**Al-Toufan attacks:** A hacking group going by the name of **al-Toufan** (The Flood in Arabic) has taken down the websites of Bahrain's international airport, state news agency, and chamber of commerce. The attack, most likely DDoS, took place on the 11-year anniversary of the country's 2011 Arab Spring pro-democracy protests, brutally repressed by the government. [*Check out [AP's report](https://apnews.com/article/technology-persian-gulf-tensions-bahrain-9bd1288487bac78362fe4dca0c19a7f4) on the incident*]

### **General tech and privacy**

**Ubuntu RTOS:** Canonical has [released](https://canonical.com/blog/real-time-ubuntu-is-now-generally-available) the first version of its Real-time Ubuntu OS, a stripped-down version of the Ubuntu kernel designed to be used on lightweight devices with tiny hardware and stringent low-latency requirements.

> "From vision AI and 5G to robotics and autonomous vehicles, many of the solutions we develop rely on a real-time OS for ultra-low latency with end-to-end security. We are excited to see Real-time Ubuntu, an enterprise-grade, Linux operating system that will accelerate these markets."

**Jigsaw disinformation study:** Google's Jigsaw division says it ran the [biggest disinformation pre-bunking experiment](https://medium.com/jigsaw/defanging-disinformations-threat-to-ukrainian-refugees-b164dbbc1c60) on social media. The experiment took place last year, in two phases, in September and December, and targeted audiences in Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia. Jigsaw says it created videos to debunk Russian disinformation campaigns that tried to scapegoat Ukrainian refugees for the escalating cost of living. Jigsaw says the videos ran on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok, and reached large percentages of Czech, Slovakian, and Polish users, varying from 50% to 80% of that country's total internet population. Nonetheless, despite the campaign's reach, Jigsaw says it saw only a small improvement in the number of internet users capable of spotting disinformation. Similar experiments are also planned to run in Germany and India later this year.

> "Ultimately, we found the share of viewers who could correctly identify these misinformation tactics increased by as much as 8 percentage points after viewing one of these videos. The full results are reported in the tables below."
