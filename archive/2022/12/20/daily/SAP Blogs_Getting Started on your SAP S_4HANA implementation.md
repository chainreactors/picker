Starting line

Are you ready to modernize your information technology platform because it is a set of outdated legacy systems that no longer supports your business adequately? Today’s technology provides innovative solutions that bring more value, streamline processes, improve business agility, accelerate efficiency, and improve the bottom line. They can help scale, grow, and transform your business into an industry-leading entity. Many organizations are migrating from SAP ECC to S/4HANA or implementing SAP for the first time with S/4HANA. The key to success is getting started the right way.

Organizations looking to initiate an SAP S/4HANA transformation will want to ensure their investment brings value and the costs have a level of certainty preventing the program from becoming a money pit. They will want to ensure the project is in sync with business objectives, ensures your leaders and resources adapt to the change and will continue to derive optimum value over the lifetime of the solution. Staying on track requires top-down strategic and careful planning that follows the golden rules of a S/4HANA implementation

Getting the S/4HANA initiative right without a reliable set of guidelines can be tricky. Many decision-makers don’t know where to start and more often than not end up starting on the wrong foot which is evidenced by irregular and unpredictable follow on projects resulting in wasted time, energy and money while deferring the expected benefits. To avoid these issues and maximize the value of your investment, I have put together the 3 critical areas, that businesses need to focus on to make the S/4HANA program successful. Let’s dive in.

**Establish your Case for Change**
People think that your case for change is just a high-level business case along with the associated ROI. I think it is much more than that. It needs to answer the compelling question “Why are you doing this?” Is your current solution, out-of-date, end-of-life, or no longer scalable? Do you need something better to remain competitive? Is it something else? Every company is unique. Getting it right and communicating with your team and any partners will be critical to your success.

The business case should align with the real value you want to receive. At Applexus we suggest a value map that decomposes the high-level benefits all the way to the capabilities that will be enabled by your new solution. As you clearly define your scope, the processes you select should tie directly to the capabilities that drive value. At Applexus we recommend process mining to identify which processes are inefficient and where improvement will lead to high-value use cases.

Another angle on the process is to identify which processes are truly unique to your business or your brand and are worth additional investment in your solution. Those that are really commodity processes - that are mostly standard across the industry, should follow SAP best practices and avoid low-value enhancements.

Once the case for change is well defined, make sure your team understands and embraces it as project boundaries and where is and is not OK to deviate from standard. This will help ensure low-value pet perks are easily dismissed and kept out of scope.

Remember, your case for change is more than the business case, it needs to clearly define your mission and objectives and where you are expecting to get value. Then it needs to be communicated and enforced with the project team. This type of project is usually a once-in-a-generation investment. Getting your case for change right is your first step to getting it right.

Now that we have covered how to go about developing a business case, let’s get into the “Why’s” and “How’s” of developing a roadmap, without which you’re S/4HANA program is likely to wander, lose focus, and sub-optimize the results.

**Build your Roadmap**
Many consultants will talk to you about Brownfield vs. Greenfield, but that is very shortsighted and does not get you to the goal of a value-driven digital transformation. At Applexus, we have developed something we call the Runway Approach to Digital Transformation. We start with evaluating your current organization and landscape on these criteria:

1. Complexity of the current landscape
2. Adaptability to change
3. Risk aversion during the transformation process

Then we align it with your case for change.
Assessments of your current processes, data, application architecture, custom code, and infrastructure will provide an understanding of how complex your current landscape is. The more complex the more likely you will need to begin with some cleanup activities or a back-to-basics approach starting with industry best practices.

An assessment of your people and organization will determine if your organization will be able to adapt to a brand-new solution or if there will need to be extensive modifications to align with how they are used to doing things. The key will be to limit changes to those that are supported by the case for change discussed last time.

Your company’s po...
