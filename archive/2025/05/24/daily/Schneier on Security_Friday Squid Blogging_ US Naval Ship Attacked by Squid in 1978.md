## Friday Squid Blogging: US Naval Ship Attacked by Squid in 1978

Interesting [story](https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/05/when-the-frigate-uss-stein-was-attacked-by-a-colossal-squid-2/):

> *USS Stein* was underway when her anti-submarine sonar gear suddenly stopped working. On returning to port and putting the ship in a drydock, engineers observed many deep scratches in the sonar dome’s rubber “NOFOUL” coating. In some areas, the coating was described as being shredded, with rips up to four feet long. Large claws were left embedded at the bottom of most of the scratches.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce,

This is not the first time Navy vessels have been attacked by large marine creatures.

Although they sound like “mysterious tales” wooden vessels in particular have been attacked by whales, orca, squid and similar.

The attacks have been put down to “feeding” in that “jetsam” of waste etc attracts a hierarch of creatures and “feeding frenzies” can arise. Commercial fishing vessels like trawlers get to see such things occasionally.

But “submarines” have been known to run into not just fishing nets, but “biologics” as well and some have given whales a nasty surprise such as during the Falklands War (apparently three were torpedoed).

The fact is many submarines when submerged move at very slow speeds as part of the measures to avoid detection by enemy vessels and this means that “biologics” can surround them, the crew would be aware of them in general but not specifically what has been hit.

We know that aircraft have “flown into mountains” and the results have mostly been catastrophic. But it is known that a submarine has hit a “seamount” and survived. It happened Jan 8th 2005 to the USS San Francisco,

So if a sub of this type was to hit a whale it’s reasonably certain it would survive, the whale or other large marine creature not so much.

Wasn’t there a Russian (or Soviet) sub almost lost after a full speed collision with a whale ?

@ AlexT,

With regards,

> “Wasn’t there a Russian (or Soviet) sub almost lost after a full speed collision with a whale ?”

So the “Cold War” story goes…

But it was never officially confirmed so as was oh so common of those times “It never happened”…

Remember it was a different time with the Kola Peninsula incident becoming confirmed because of a summit between Clinton and Yeltsin. And a couple of decades earlier in Nov 74 there was “the kiss at Holy Loch”,

<https://history.scot/us-and-soviet-submarines-crash-in-scottish-waters/>

That only got confirmed because “diplomatic cables got leaked”.

A lot of this went on in the “cold war” and later with the “Atlantic Gateway” in the North sea with Norway being the geographic center of much that went on stretching up to Iceland and the North Pole and round into the Barents Sea.

The official history of GCHQ mentions the intelligence war with UK vessels carrying out “intelligence gathering” of many forms. It was probably more dangerous than has ever been acknowledge with the lives of hundred if not thousands of mariners lost and officially unacknowledged.

But even Russia eventually confirms some stories,

Whales need to get rid of barnacles and submarines look like a good scratching post. Boats are too noisy and often traveling at higher speeds or parked in inappropriate places. Not to mention that boats and submarines rarely adhere to normal seafaring behavior that has been established over the last 500 million years, apart from sinking and decomposition.

@ Bruce,

In the UK there has just been a couple of cases of legal representatives “up for sanction” for using AI to prepare briefs.

The defence given by one would kind of sound preposterous to someone who does not understand what has happened on the technology side of the curtain.

That is they said they were unaware they were using AI, as they had been using Google Search, as they did not at the time have access to the formal on-line legal databases.

As Corry Doctrow has pointed out Google is the king of “enshitification” with their search engine now barely worth the sack the crap gets shifted in.

Further as is now becoming obvious to the more astute investors there has been billions if not trillions sunk into AI and in some areas of enquiry the “Soft Bullshit / Hallucination” is creeping ever closer to 50% of the output.

With one major AI investment having just imploded into bankruptcy despite their excuses some will see it as the windvain moving adversely and the barometer changing from fair weather to foul and the whole AI journey now sailing into very stormy waters.

So it’s recognised that the AI donkey is going to get not just overloaded but whipped into the ground, as some try to recover lost investment and try to keep the boat afloat.

But you are going to think “Only in the UK” some very senior judges who have obviously not had sufficient oversight are now sug...
