The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday [announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-federally-charged-connection-danabot-malware-scheme-infected-computers) the disruption of the online infrastructure associated with **DanaBot** (aka DanaTools) and unsealed charges against 16 individuals for their alleged involvement in the development and deployment of the malware, which it said was controlled by a Russia-based cybercrime organization.

The malware, the DoJ said, infected more than 300,000 victim computers around the world, facilitated fraud and ransomware, and caused at least $50 million in damages. Two of the defendants, Aleksandr Stepanov (aka JimmBee), 39, and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin (aka Onix), 34, both from Novosibirsk, Russia, are currently at large.

Stepanov has been charged with conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, unauthorized impairment of a protected computer, wiretapping, and use of an intercepted communication. Kalinkin has been charged with conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, to gain unauthorized access to a computer to defraud, and to commit unauthorized impairment of a protected computer.

The unsealed criminal complaint and indictment show that many of the defendants, counting Kalinkin, exposed their real-life identities after accidentally infecting their own systems with the malware.

"In some cases, such self-infections appeared to be deliberately done in order to test, analyze, or improve the malware," the [complaint](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401361/dl?inline) [PDF] read. "In other cases, the infections seemed to be inadvertent – one of the hazards of committing cybercrime is that criminals will sometimes infect themselves with their own malware by mistake."

"The inadvertent infections often resulted in sensitive and compromising data being stolen from the actor's computer by the malware and stored on the DanaBot servers, including data that helped identify members of the DanaBot organization."

If convicted, Kalinkin is expected to face a statutory maximum sentence of 72 years in federal prison. Stepanov would face a jail term of five years. Concurrent with the action, the law enforcement effort, carried out as part of [Operation Endgame](https://operation-endgame.com), saw DanaBot's command-and-control (C2) servers seized, including dozens of virtual servers hosted in the United States.

"DanaBot malware used a variety of methods to infect victim computers, including spam email messages containing malicious attachments or hyperlinks," the DoJ said. "Victim computers infected with DanaBot malware became part of a botnet (a network of compromised computers), enabling the operators and users of the botnet to remotely control the infected computers in a coordinated manner."

| Example of typical Danabot infrastructure |

DanaBot, like the [recently dismantled](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fbi-and-europol-disrupt-lumma-stealer.html) Lumma Stealer malware, operates under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme, with the administrators leasing out access starting from $500 to "several thousand dollars" a month. Tracked under the monikers Scully Spider and [Storm-1044](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/microsoft-warns-of-malvertising-scheme.html), is a multi-functional tool along the lines of Emotet, TrickBot, QakBot, and IcedID that's capable of acting as a stealer and a delivery vector for next-stage payloads, such as ransomware.

The Delphi-based modular malware is equipped to siphon data from victim computers, hijack banking sessions, and steal device information, user browsing histories, stored account credentials, and virtual currency wallet information. It can also provide full remote access, log keystrokes, and capture videos. It's been active in the wild since its [debut in May 2018](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-new-banking-trojan-surfaces-down-under-0), when it started off as a banking trojan.

"DanaBot initially targeted victims in Ukraine, Poland, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Australia prior to expanding its targeting posture to include U.S.- and Canada-based financial institutions in October 2018," CrowdStrike [said](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-partners-with-doj-disrupt-danabot-malware-operators/). "The malware's popularity grew due to its early modular development supporting Zeus-based web injects, information stealer capabilities, keystroke logging, screen recording, and hidden virtual network computing (HVNC) functionality."

According to Black Lotus Labs and Team Cymru, DanaBot employs a layered communications infrastructure between a victim and the botnet controllers, wherein the C2 traffic is proxied through two or three server tiers before it reaches the final level. At least five to six tier-2 servers were active at any given time. A majority of DanaBot victims are concentrated around Brazil...
