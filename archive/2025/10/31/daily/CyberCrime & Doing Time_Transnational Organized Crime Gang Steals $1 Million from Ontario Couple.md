### [Transnational Organized Crime Gang Steals $1 Million from Ontario Couple](https://garwarner.blogspot.com/2025/10/transnational-organized-crime-gang.html)

Today my LinkedIn feed and Google News filter is showing me several stories that illustrate how we are failing to stop online scammers from stealing from our elderly.  It starts with the headlines.

[CTVNews](https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/consumer-alert/article/were-devastated-ontario-seniors-give-away-more-than-1-million-to-scammers/):  Ontario seniors GIVE AWAY MORE THAN $1 MILLION to scammers.
CTVNews: Ontario couple LOSES MORE THAN $1 MILLION DOLLARS to fraud.
[Toronto Only](https://www.instagram.com/toronto_only/p/DQaKhXiEh3n/): A couple ... LOST MORE THAN $1 MILLION
[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15235449/canada-bank-fraud-online-scam-couple-brantford.html):  Elderly couple transfer $1m to online scammers despite warning from bank

The tone of several of these stories, is victim shaming and leads with the wrong headline. They didn't "Give away" or "Lose" or "Transfer" these funds.  They were STOLEN FROM THEM.

## Illicit Call Centers: "Facebook Pop-Ups"

One of the ways that we learn about how these scams play out is that we engage with scammers.  I'm not a professional scam baiter or anything close to it, but it is a useful research tool. When I read the story of the Ontario couple, I knew exactly the type of script that was being followed, because I experienced it last month.  Usually when I call an illicit call center on purpose, I am asked very quickly to give remote control of my computer to the scammers. But one day last month, the call followed a very different script than the primary ones to which I am accustomed.  It started with a Facebook advertisement.

In the top right corner of my Facebook homepage, I had two advertisements displayed:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhlrKNfPh7xokPLirN5cXXwOurUC6MkLrGON198jw2QZruXEIiPc0kLpP8hDCFlrZZbjxkrkn2_6IjRn6n6anp5zH8ZzKHKy_sWFOcpu_ek1lgCtL5mmyRVNRn3kXBghlYs5b4BC_0RyFT9B9D61K58gbprKz14DTn-bZqyRz92OCQuhJG_qIJfsG09NHlZMg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhlrKNfPh7xokPLirN5cXXwOurUC6MkLrGON198jw2QZruXEIiPc0kLpP8hDCFlrZZbjxkrkn2_6IjRn6n6anp5zH8ZzKHKy_sWFOcpu_ek1lgCtL5mmyRVNRn3kXBghlYs5b4BC_0RyFT9B9D61K58gbprKz14DTn-bZqyRz92OCQuhJG_qIJfsG09NHlZMg)

The goal of these advertisements is to make a less than wary Facebook user believe that they have unread messages that need to be attended to.  I actually wrote a longer piece for LinkedIn about this type of advertisement about six months ago.  See: "[Dangerous Facebook Ads and Call Center Scams](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garwarner_facebook-ads-lead-to-call-center-scams-activity-7321211499748749313-uhRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABrrHABriF_d4eU6ILcCymCe1lnozPdSbE)" on my LinkedIn page.  In this case, the "vendor" who is providing the Facebook Ads portion of this scam is almost certainly operating from Vietnam.  Crime is global.  Who knew?

Clicking the ad, in the incident that I experience on October 17, 2025, led to exactly the same next steps as the ones I reported on April 24, 2025.

Whether you choose "Accept" or "Ignore" on this page, the next thing that happens is that your browser goes "Full Screen" and begins to play an audio warning on loop while displaying this Warning Page:

Mouse clicking is disabled while an audio warning tells us our Facebook account is going to be deleted if we don't call the indicated number immediately.  I know that I can "Alt-F4" out of this message, but many users would not know how to do so.

According to our friends at URLScan.io, they have received reports of the "Facebook Suspended" intermediate page in the scam delivery using 933 different URLs, most recently, today.  After a huge spike from November 2024 to January 2025, there has been a constant trickle of these nearly every day since ... often using Microsoft Azure nodes.

Checking the Meta Ad Library, it is easy to see that a new round of these ads launched on October 29, 2025 (two days ago):

The new ads redirect through a slightly different intermediary page (I have an incoming call from a pretty girl) and then tell me that "Microsoft Care has temporarily disabled your Internet connection" and that I need to call or my "Facebook and Internet accounts will be permanently disabled."
