# Group Policy Security Nightmares¬†pt2

In this second super short post, I want to explore an unusual Group Policy Object (GPO) configuration I recently encountered.

The GPO in question used a **File Preference** policy to copy a custom `HOSTS` file from a remote share to the local machine‚Äôs `HOSTS` file:

This caught my attention because it introduced an unexpected element to the hostname resolution process.

#### Understanding the Hostname Resolution Order

As many of you know, hostname resolution in Windows follows a predefined order. Typically, it prioritizes the `HOSTS` file over DNS. This means that any entry in the `HOSTS` file will take precedence over DNS lookups, effectively overriding network-level name resolution.

#### The Incredible Twist

So far, so good, this setup might make sense (??) in certain environments for hostname standardization. However, the **incredible discovery** was that the source `HOSTS` file on the remote share **granted ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù full control!**

This was a significant red flag. It meant any authenticated user on the domain could potentially modify the file, introducing malicious entries that would propagate to all machines affected by the GPO.

#### Why Is This a Problem?

With this level of access, an attacker could:

* **Redirect Traffic:** Point legitimate hostnames (e.g., `server.company.local`) to malicious IP addresses.
* **Create MitM Opportunities:** Use spoofed entries to route traffic through an attacker-controlled machine.
* **Disrupt Services:** Break connections to critical resources by pointing them to non-existent or incorrect IP addresses.

This configuration essentially opened the door for widespread abuse, leveraging the `HOSTS` file‚Äôs precedence over DNS.

#### Thinking Bigger: What Other Configurations Enable Hostname Spoofing?

This discovery led me to consider other scenarios where hostname spoofing might be possible. Here are a few additional configurations:

1. **DnsAdmins Group Privileges:** Members of the privileged `DnsAdmins` group can modify DNS records, giving them the ability to redirect traffic at will.
2. **Zones with Insecure Updates:** DNS zones configured with insecure updates allow even **anonymous users** to perform DNS record changes. Shockingly, this is not an uncommon misconfiguration:

In this example below, we can see that an anonymous user with network level access can modify DNS records:

With these scenarios in mind, I began exploring how these configurations could be abused, particularly in Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. This experimentation ultimately led me to develop and release my own tool, **KrbRelayEx**, which demonstrates how Kerberos relaying and forwarding can exploit these vulnerabilities and lead to a complete Domain takeover!
