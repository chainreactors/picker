**Summary**

Interested in enhancing your SAP SuccessFactors solution's resilience? Drawing from observations of operational issues impacting our customers, I offer insights into the requirements for SuccessFactors administrators in this blog post. It focuses on addressing commonly asked questions about SF Admin/SF Solution Owner skills, without delving into operational models.

### SAP SuccessFactors administrator, description

SF Admin will be mainly responsible for ongoing operation and administration, supporting (or conducting) minor configuration and change requests.

+ SF Admin should also participate in research and development to enable continuing innovation; in other words, s/he is part of the adoption team and works with other internal and external parties. One of the key roles is at bi-annual release opt-in feature enablement. Furthermore, the SF ecosystem offers several innovation partners enabling new capabilities.
  (e.g. AI-powered candidate filtering or paperless organization targets require some enhancements or even further 3rd part solutions)

+ SF Admin should also be able to conduct minor developments (e.g. copy from last year's PM forms and create the new PM forms with some minor adjustments, activate new features for the newer version of the interface via the upgrade center, or create some reports that business users require)

+ SF Admin sets systems administration requirements, communication, and system security administration.
  (e.g. Solution will not be available during maintenance or Solution IP is changed or new features will be activated; all of these should be followed and shared with end users)

+ SF Admin ensures that HR systems and related procedures adhere to organizational processes, policies, local regulations, and guidelines.
  (e.g. authentication system integration, some users have full access to SF solutions, and others have limited only to LMS. Follow the local regulations-add or remote some personal fields.)

+ SF Admin should also be aware of the landscape and manages it incl. other 3rd party systems (if any) and interfaces.
  (e.g. Refresh or synchronize the environment. Or manage the interfaces for reporting solution SAP BW, digital signature solution, a simulation tool for organization management etc.)

+ SF Admin should follow solution transitions as well as renewals of certificates.
  (e.g. SAP SF modernizes the platform and capabilities and informs admins to act on these, moreover, there are changes at SSO authorization token or SSL certificate renewals)

Remark: The SuccessFactors administrator is not necessarily SuperAdmin or Cloud Admin; these are different concepts!

### SuccessFactors administrator, expectation

The ideal skill set for the SF admin team can vary depending on factors such as company size, operational model, and other unique characteristics. Nevertheless, I believe the following provides a reasonable foundation:

As outlined in the SF admin description, it's advantageous for SF admins to possess a balanced combination of the following skills:

* Proficiency in basic XML concepts, as XML is utilized in various forms within BizX.
* Competency in reporting, given that the SF suite offers out-of-the-box reporting capabilities. However, enhancing these capabilities using built-in tools or SAP SAC for people analytics is common.
* Understanding of authorization concepts and the ability to maintain them, as SF operates on role-based permissions (RBP).
* Knowledge of integration basics and tools, including familiarity with flat files, APIs, connectors, etc.
* Basic development skills (good to have, similar to MS Office macros), as BizX utilizes the MDF object-low code platform, enabling customers to enhance the solution.
* Admin Certification (SFX, to be explained) in the relevant areas
* Other tasks include but are not limited to, handling SSL certificates, checking the IP setting of the company and whitelisting SF IPs, being aware of the landscape, and integrating 3rd party solutions.
