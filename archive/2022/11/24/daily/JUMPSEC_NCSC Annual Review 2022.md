# NCSC Annual Review 2022

**After reviewing the NCSC Annual Review for 2022, we discuss our 5 key takeaways and give our thoughts on the topic.
Read it here:** [**https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Annual-Review-2022.pdf**](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Annual-Review-2022.pdf)

### 1. The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War

The review has a notable focus on the escalating cyber threat posed by Russia. It has been both interesting and frightening to observe the role of cyber alongside traditional “kinetic” military capabilities, with notable attacks on ViaSat and the deployment of the WhisperGate wiper malware against Ukrainian Government targets.

The escalating use of hybrid techniques is something that we should take very seriously when considering the threat to UK infrastructure. Last month, The Centre for Strategic & International Studies published an insightful overview of Russia’s hybrid warfare strategies– explaining “Gray Zone” aggression tactics (including cyber capabilities) – stating that the NordStream sabotage is a wake-up call on the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.

There are early signs of such aggression targeting the UK in the recent damage to the Shetland subsea cables. Although purely speculative at this stage (with the issue just as likely caused by fishing trawlers), a clear trend is emerging. German police are also investigating an act of sabotage on the country’s rail infrastructure in October. While this is yet unconfirmed to have Russian involvement, it prompted NATO to re-state that “hybrid and cyber-attacks can trigger Article 5”, and therefore provoke a response.

In 2023, organisations forming part of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) should consider the potential for hybrid attacks combining cyber and kinetic methods designed to disrupt or destroy key public services. In most cases, cyber remains the optimal vehicle for state-sponsored aggression, with the least chance of discovery, complex attribution, and minimal risk to the attacker. Organisations that are likely targets for Russian aggression should ensure that such scenarios are considered when modelling the risks to the business in 2023, and implement mitigations and business continuity plans accordingly.

### 2. Ransomware’s Continued Growth

The report makes a number of interesting observations that we echoed in our own Ransomware Trends Report.

Over the last year, businesses and organisations in the UK reported hundreds of cyber incidents to the NCSC, 63 of which were significant enough to require a national level response. Of those, the NCSC co-ordinated the national response to 18 ransomware attacks including the attacks on a supplier to NHS 111, and South Staffordshire Water.

But the true numbers of ransomware attacks in the UK each year are far higher, as organisations often do not report the compromises. This is substantiated by our own research, showing that of 294 attacker-reported attacks since 2020, 85% of ransomware incidents claimed by attackers go completely unreported by the victims or the media.
