In episode 425 of ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù, Graham reveals how ‚ÄúCall of Duty: WWII‚Äù has been weaponised ‚Äì allowing hackers to hijack your entire PC during online matches, thanks to ancient code and Microsoft‚Äôs Game Pass. Meanwhile, Carole digs into a con targeting the recently incarcerated, with scammers impersonating bail bond agents to fleece desperate families.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
