On the night of Sept. 29, 2008, an explosion ripped through a crowded area in the predominantly Muslim city of Malegaon, Maharashtra in India, [killing six people and injuring more than a hundred](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/maharashtra/2008-malegaon-blast-case-all-you-need-to-know-3524864) others. Investigators alleged that the blast was triggered by a bomb planted in a motorcycle registered to Pragya Chandrapalsingh Thakur, then a 38-year-old nun and [Hindutva](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/16/youtube-is-autogenerating-videos-for-songs-advocating-the-expulsion-of-muslims-from-india/) (or Hindu nationalist) activist.

Thakur was the most high profile of the seven people arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the blast. Almost 17 years later, all of the accused have been acquitted, with the judge reportedly saying that the prosecution [could not prove](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/former-bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-ex-army-officer-shrikant-purohit-acquitted-in-2008-malegaon-blast-case-8989710) that [the bomb was fitted](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/ats-nia-witnesses-testimonies-sc-bombay-hc-flagged-flaws-probe-against-pragya-thakur-col-purohit-10161005/) to the  motorcycle or that it belonged to Thakur.

Appearing in court on Thursday, Thakur [reportedly](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-updates-pragya-thakur-ex-army-officer-shrikant-purohit-acquitted-in-2008-malegaon-blast-case-8989603#484190) told the judge that the investigation had “ruined [her] life”. She was quoted by several outlets saying that she had been “[arrested and tortured](https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/malegaon-blast-case-sandhvi-pragya-says-god-will-punish-those-who-are-guilty-2025-07-31-1001357)” by investigators. She also hailed her acquittal as a “[victory of Hindutva](https://www.thestatesman.com/india/pragya-thakur-acquitted-in-malegaon-blast-case-hails-nia-court-verdict-as-victory-of-hindutva-1503464823.html)”.

Meanwhile, the advocate for the victims’ families has [reportedly vowed to challenge](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/live-updates-pragya-thakur-ex-army-officer-shrikant-purohit-acquitted-in-2008-malegaon-blast-case-8989603#484184) the acquittals in India’s High Court.

Thakur’s court appearance on Thursday was a rare one: she has been notably absent for most of the trial, citing medical reasons including [brain swelling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DwM6vs3Rnulan2CHGU9R8SkOTg6lssOsKUU2DsQcH4/edit?gid=1508624714#gid=1508624714&range=E28), [impaired sight](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DwM6vs3Rnulan2CHGU9R8SkOTg6lssOsKUU2DsQcH4/edit?gid=1508624714#gid=1508624714&range=E43), and a doctor advising bed rest “[due to multiple ailments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DwM6vs3Rnulan2CHGU9R8SkOTg6lssOsKUU2DsQcH4/edit?gid=1508624714#gid=1508624714&range=E12)”.

Although attending hearings related to her case was a key condition of [her bail](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5z51pz0hp0q30an9766hz/pragyathakur_HC_bail_order.pdf?rlkey=uc7p11x33v3vlk882fxenmhxm&st=2ochec2q&dl=0), a Bellingcat analysis of documents from the NIA special court shows she was recorded as present at only three of the 162 court appointments that focused on final arguments of the case, from July 24, 2024 to May 8, 2025.

As of publication, Thakur has not replied to multiple requests for comment over email, text messages, and social media about her absences from court. One of her lawyers, Advocate JP Mishra, told Bellingcat that he only has the contact number of Thakur’s personal assistant, and not of Thakur herself.

Thakur has been on bail since April 2017, when organised crime charges against her were dropped by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), a state police body. A year later, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) – the main counter-terrorism investigation agency in India – initiated a new case against Thakur and six others over their alleged involvement in the same incident.

In 2019, Thakur was elected as a Member of Parliament for the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh under the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and served five years in the role before stepping down in 2024 at the end of her term.

Pragya Thakur: Murder Suspect Turned Politician

This is the second criminal case where Thakur has been charged, and then acquitted due to a lack of evidence.

She was previously accused, then [acquitted in 2017](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/Feb/01/sadhvi-pragya-seven-others-acquitted-in-sunil-joshi-murder-case-1565891.html), of being one of eight people involved in the December 2007 [murder of Sunil Joshi](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sunil-joshi-murder-a-case-of-twists-and-turns/), reportedly a [close aide of Thakur before they fell out](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Sadhvi-Pragya-acquitted-in-Joshi-murder-case/article17128304.ece).

Joshi was a suspect in the 2007 [Samjhauta Express train bombing](https://cat-uxo.com/explosive-hazards/incidents/samjhauta-express-bombings-2007) which killed 68 people, mostly Pakistan citizens. Based on local reports, the court acquitted Thakur and her co-accused after finding the case was not investigated with the “[required seriousness](https://caravanmagazine.in/perspectives/sunil-joshi-murder-trial-collapse-weakens-fight-hindu-fundamentalism)” by the NIA and state police, who it said produced “[weak and self-contradictory evidences](https://www.deccanherald.com/india/sadhvi-pragya-7-others-acquitted-in-sunil-joshi-murder-case-for-weak-evidence-572295.html)”. Thakur was not present in court when the verdict for this case was delivered.

When the BJP fielded her as a candidate in the 2019 general elections, Thakur had been accused of [terrorism, murder and criminal conspiracy](https://www.altnews.in/fact-check-was-pragya-thakur-kept-in-jail-without-any-ch...
