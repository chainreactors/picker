The outgoing boss of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel, has called on her colleagues to "quickly" adopt rules allowing the US regulator to stage a radio spectrum auction, the proceeds of which would fund the removal from American networks of equipment made by Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE.

Work to tear out the kit and replace it with less risky equipment has been under way [since 2021](https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/14/fcc_huawei_zte_replacement/), when $1.9 billion was allocated to a “Rip and Replace” program that Congress authorized on grounds Chinese-made devices posed a national security risk. In 2024 it [emerged](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/11/fcc_warns_yet_again_of/) the program saw just 12 percent of telcos and ISPs completely remove Chinese gear from their networks, and that at least another $3 billion is needed to finish the job.

Rosenworcel argued tirelessly for more funding, [urging Congress](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-402312A1.pdf) to find more cash.
