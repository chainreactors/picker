## Surveillance Used by a Drug Cartel

Once you build a surveillance system, you [can’t control](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/sinaloa-cartel-fbi-hackers) who will use it:

> A hacker working for the Sinaloa drug cartel was able to obtain an FBI official’s phone records and use Mexico City’s surveillance cameras to help track and kill the agency’s informants in 2018, according to a new US justice department report.
>
> The incident was disclosed in a justice department inspector general’s audit of the FBI’s efforts to mitigate the effects of “ubiquitous technical surveillance,” a term used to describe the global proliferation of cameras and the thriving trade in vast stores of communications, travel, and location data.
>
> […]
>
> The report said the hacker identified an FBI assistant legal attaché at the US embassy in Mexico City and was able to use the attaché’s phone number “to obtain calls made and received, as well as geolocation data.” The report said the hacker also “used Mexico City’s camera system to follow the [FBI official] through the city and identify people the [official] met with.”

> As one does, so one meets

I guess the whole surveillance system in Mexico city has been installed by US companies. And I even am bold enough to suggest that the American Embassy houses people who are using it in the very same way as I write this.

There are “better” ways to use mobile phones when you want to keep your public phone number separated from your mobile SIM number [1].

I understand people of “interest” have used this successfully for some time now. Anyone doing sensitive work should do this too.

@ Bruce, ALL,

The possibility of,

> “A hacker working for the Sinaloa drug cartel was able to obtain an FBI official’s phone records and use Mexico City’s surveillance cameras to help track”

Has very recently become a “political hot potato” with ICE “thugs” getting tagged by an application that runs anonymously on Apple Mobile Phones.

Called ICEBlock it’s become the number one app in the past couple of days,

<https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ice-tracking-app-surges-in-popularity-following-maga-meltdown/ar-AA1HQwhl>

It’s been “freely advertised” by more than one of the “Orange Man’s” bimbos and brain-deads mouthing off to the press that the users of the app are “terrorists” (they are not unlike the ICE thugs who are by dictionary definition traditional terrorist and in some case murderers).

So I can see there being significant issues in the very near future or some other “face preserving” numpty nonsense from the “OOOK”[1]

[1] The “OOOK” is a somewhat appropriate insult standing for

Orange Oval Office Koochie (grabber).

(Don’t ask what Koochie means it will get me time in the “sin bin” especially as it’s easy enough to look up.

Well, that’s one way to identify FBI informants and get rid of them.

I have dubbed this problem ‘capability creep’, by analogy to ‘feature creep’, and the canonical example is somebody having evidence provided in their divorce case that they were having an affair because they had a toll pass that showed that they were driving to a place on a regular basis they would have no other reason to need to drive to.

Opposing attorney subpoenaed the toll records, let the jury decide for itself what they thought.

If you build a data collection system, and you do not engineer protections against this sort of thing right into the lowest levels, you will get the worst possible outcome.

Now we know who’s watching the watchers. Who could’ve guessed? Oh wait, everyone.

@ Jay Ashworth, ALL,

With regards,

> “If you build a data collection system, and you do not engineer protections against this sort of thing right into the lowest levels, you will get the worst possible outcome.”

Sorry no.

If you build a surveilling or data collecting system, there is no protection system you can engineer to stop the “worst possible outcome” becoming the most desirable to those who can “work the system”.

A few years back we talked of “Parallel Construction” now nobody bothers because it’s become the “default reality”.

The security cameras in Mexico City aren’t the only ones we control. I have access to every camera in DFW, SFO, CHI, NYC, DC, and MIA. And we’re coming for your cameras next.

Mine has ducktape over it.

That should have been duct tape. My excuse is going to be that I listened to “I want a new duck” a fair amount over the last couple of weeks.
