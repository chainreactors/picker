### Evolution of Integration

As your Enterprise Business grows and evolves, you have newer challenges. One of them is Integration complexity. It is a good problem to have as Integration has evolved well and there are turnkey solutions supporting newer Integration styles and patterns.

There are many dimensions to an Integration project. It can be process, data or system- centric. There are many Integration styles-  for example, purely involving apps( A2A), with trading partners (B2B), with government agencies for taxes and other compliance (B2G), direct to consumers (B2C) and so on.

How do we navigate through this complex landscape and choose the best fitting Integration platform? This is what we will try to address in this session.

The session will include examples of Integration projects with SAP Customers and cover the following aspects : Leveraging API Management vs. Cloud Integration for realizing Integration patterns/use cases, Need for event driven messaging, Importance of integration in LCNC (low code no code) development and, Integrating business solutions with BTP services.

It is an honor to host two most experienced Integration Black Belts who have several years of Integration experience in the next session of [Integration Black Belts Live](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/19/integration-black-belts-live-is-now-part-of-sap-community/)!
