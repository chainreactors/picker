I noticed that I first wrote an entry on this blog twenty years ago. I figured that deserved some commemoration and recognition.

The blog started out as a personal blog (as evidenced by its early entries) and gradually morphed into being what it is today. I plan to keep writing it because it‚Äôs still fun for me and I can see that it‚Äôs helped folks out. First blog entry was naturally about starting the blog:

[Subject? I don‚Äôt need no steenking subject!](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2003/05/01/subject-i-dont-need-no-steenking-subject/)

At the time, I was using [LiveJournal](https://www.livejournal.com) as they had a client app for Mac OS X and that made it easy for me to get started with blogging. Over the years, the blog moved a few times:

* [LiveJournal](https://www.livejournal.com)
* Mac OS X 10.4.x Server‚Äôs [Blojsom-based](https://gitlab.com/another15y/blojsom) [blog platform](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2005/06/28/closing-down-here/)
* [Self-hosted WordPress](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2006/11/09/decided-it-was-time-for-a-change/)
* [WordPress.com](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/moved-to-a-new-home/)

I moved to WordPress.com in September 2008 and they‚Äôve been graciously hosting me ever since. Thanks, folks.

I‚Äôve been using [MarsEdit](https://redsweater.com/marsedit/) for at least the last six years to write my blog posts, so thanks also to [Daniel Jalkut](https://redsweater.com/about/DanielJalkut.html) at Red Sweater for putting out a quality product that helps me stay focused on the writing of a blog post and not the fiddly bits of how to post it.

For my past, present and future readers:

Thank you. This place wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without you.

   I‚Äôve been a full-time Mac admin since before you started this blog, and became an avid follower after I became a Jamf admin, about 8 years ago.

   I‚Äôve found this blog to be an invaluable resource for Mac & Jamf administration. Thanks for all you do!
