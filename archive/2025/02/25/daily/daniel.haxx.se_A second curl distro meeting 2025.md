# A second curl distro meeting 2025

[February 24, 2025](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/24/a-second-curl-distro-meeting-2025/) [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/author/daniel/)

We are doing a rerun of [last year’s successful curl + distro online meeting](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/03/25/curl-distro-report/). A two-hour discussion, meeting, workshop for curl developers and curl distro maintainers. Maybe this is the start of a new tradition?

[2025 event details](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/curl-distro-discussion-2025)

Last year I think we had a very productive meeting that led to several good outcomes. In fact, just seeing some faces and hearing voices from involved people is good and helps to enhance communication and cooperation going forward.

The objective for the meeting is to make curl better in distros. To make distros do better curl. To improve curl in all and every way we think we can, together.

Everyone who feels this is a subject they care about is welcome to join. The meeting is planned to take place in the early evening European time, early morning west coast US time. With the hope that it covers a large enough amount of curl interested people.

The plan is to do this on **April 10**, and all the details, planning and discussion items are kept on the dedicated [wiki page for the event](https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/curl-distro-discussion-2025).

Feel free to add your own proposed discussion items, and if you feel inclined, add yourself as an intended participant. Feel free to help make this invite reach the proper people.

See you in April.
