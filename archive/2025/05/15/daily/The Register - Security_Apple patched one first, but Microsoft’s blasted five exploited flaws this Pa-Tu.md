Patch Tuesday It's that time of the month again, and Microsoft has made it extra spicy by revealing five flaws it says are under active exploitation – but rates as important rather than critical fixes.

Microsoft's 78-fix bundle for this Patch Tuesday wasn't unusually large, but the five problems under attack right now all have CVSS severity scores of 7.5 or 7.8 out of 10, and hit Windows 10 and 11 devices, and Windows Server releases since 2019. They look like strong candidates to be top of your patching list in your next change window.

The five exploited flaws are:

* [CVE-2025-30397](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30397) allows attackers to bamboozle Microsoft's Scripting Engine with a type confusion attack. In this case an unauthorized user on the network can get full code execution on an unpatched system.
* [CVE-2025-30400](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30400) is an elevation of privilege attack that lets someone with basic network rights hit Windows Desktop Window Manager with a use after free attack.
