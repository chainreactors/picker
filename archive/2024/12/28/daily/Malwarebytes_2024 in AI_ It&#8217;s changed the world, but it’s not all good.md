# 2024 in AI: It’s changed the world, but it’s not all good

Posted: December 27, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A popular saying is: “To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.”

Even though the saying is [older](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/26/computer-error/) than you might think, it did not come about earlier than the [concept of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence).

And as long as we have been waiting for [AI technology](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) to become commonplace, if [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) has taught us one thing this year, then it’s that when humans and AI cooperate, amazing things can happen. But amazing is not always positive.

There have been some incidents in the past year that have made many people even more [afraid of AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/ai-is-everywhere-and-boomers-dont-trust-it) than they already were.

We started off 2024 with a warning from the British National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) [telling](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/ai-likely-to-boost-ransomware-warns-government-body/) us it expects AI to heighten the global [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) threat.

A lot of AI related stories this year dealt with social media and other public sources that were scraped to train an AI model.

For example, [X was accused of unlawfully using the personal data of 60 million+ users to train its AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/08/x-accused-of-unlawfully-using-the-personal-data-of-more-than-60-million-users-to-train-its-ai) called Grok. Underlining that fear, we [saw a hoax go viral on Instagram Stories](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/dont-share-the-viral-instagram-meta-ai-legal-post) that told people they could stop Meta from harvesting content by copying and pasting some text.

Facebook had to [admit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/facebook-scrapes-photos-of-kids-from-australian-user-profiles-to-train-its-ai) that it scrapes the public photos, posts and other data from the accounts of Australian adult users to train its AI models, which no doubt contributed to [Australia’s ban on social media for children under the age of 16](https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/).

As with many developing technologies, sometimes the race to stay ahead is more important than security. This was best demonstrated when an AI companion site called Muah.ai got breached and details of all its [users’ fantasies were stolen](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/ai-girlfriend-site-breached-user-fantasies-stolen). The [hacker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) described the platform as “a handful of open-source projects duct-taped together.”

We also saw an AI supply-chain breach when [a chatbot provider exposed 346,000 customer files](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/ai-chatbot-provider-exposes-346000-customer-files-including-id-documents-resumes-and-medical-records), including ID documents, resumes, and medical records.

And if the accidents didn’t scare people off, there were also some outright scams targeting people that were eager to use some of the popular applications of AI. A [free AI editor lured victims](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/free-ai-edito...
