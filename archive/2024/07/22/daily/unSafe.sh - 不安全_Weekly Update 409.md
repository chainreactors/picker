It feels weird to be writing *anything* right now that isn't somehow related to Friday's CrowdStrike incident, but given I recorded this video just a few hours before all hell broke loose, it'll have to wait until next week. This week, the issue that really has me worked up is data breach victim notification or more specifically, lack thereof. Following my time in Melbourne and Canberra during the week where I spent a bunch of time with smart people close to the legal, political and law enforcement aspects of infosec, it really hit home how aligned *most* of us are on protecting the individual victims. Most, but not all; the corporate victims (and yes, companies who suffer data breaches are still victims themselves), rarely set *individual* victim notification as a priority. That sucks, and it's at direct odds with the messaging we're now hearing loud and clear from our own government. I'm giving a lot of thought to how we bridge that gap so stay tuned, this area has to get better. *Much* better.
