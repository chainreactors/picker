NetWitness Endpoint EDR Agent
The RSA NetWitness detection and response (EDR) endpoint monitors activity across all your endpoints-on and off the network-providing deep visibility
into their security state, and it prioritizes alerts when there is an issue. NetWitness Endpoint drastically reduces dwell time by rapidly
detecting new and non-malware attacks that other EDR solutions miss, and it cuts the cost, time and scope of incident response.
[Vulnerability Type]
Incorrect Access Control / Code Execution
[CVE Reference]
CVE-2022-47529
[Security Issue]
CVE-2022-47529 allows local users to stop the Endpoint Windows agent from sending the events to SIEM or make the agent run user-supplied commands.
Insecure Win32 memory objects in Endpoint Windows Agents in the NetWitness Platform through 12.x allow local
and admin Windows user accounts to modify the endpoint agent service configuration:
to either disable it completely or run user-supplied code or commands, thereby bypassing tamper-protection features via ACL modification.
Interestingly, the agent was uploaded to virustotal on 2022-01-05 17:24:32 UTC months before finding and report.
SHA-256 770005f9b2333bf713ec533ef1efd2b65083a5cfb9f8cbb805ccb2eba423cc3d
LANDeskService.exe
[Severity]
Critical
[Impact(s)]
Denial-of-Service
Arbitrary Code Execution
[Attack Vector]
To exploit, open handle to memory objects held by the endpoint agent,
modify the ACL for the ones that have insecure ACLs, and DENY access to Everyone group
[Affected Product Code Base]
All versions prior to v12.2
[Network Access]
Local

1) Install "RSA NetWitness.msi" (Endpoint EDR Agent)
2) Run Exploit PoC as a Standard non-admin user, the PoC will:
a) Open a handle (copy) to Ecat002 event.
b) Open additional handles for events Ecat004 and Ecat002, modifying them to deny access to Everyone group.
c) Set/Reset event the Ecat002 handle.
d) if admin privs change the EDR service configuration
Non vulnerable agents will output "Not vulnerable to the console", customers can modify and use test to see if vuln.
