When did you last open a hard copy of a user manual for a home appliance in attempt to find certain instructions? Well, I can't remember either, because – well - we look for everything we need online – from cooking recipes via investment recommendations to medical advices. Looking (and finding) information online is amazing. But what about the quality? and authenticity? Is the information I just retrieved correct? Is it up to date? The greater the ocean of info gets, the harder it is to find what you really need in a timely manner. To make you job easier and your time more valuable, we created this one pager for you, listing all the official SAP Business One enablement assets:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/19_06_2022_1.jpg)

This page is available [here](https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/pdf/asset/preview/VoGMUGg?ltr=a&rc=10) . Your single point of entry to all resources in the various online platforms. In addition, a new "[Enablement in a Nutshell](https://dam.sap.com/mac/app/p/video/asset/preview/BFajJia?ltr=v&rc=10)" video (available for partners only) provides an overview for the different SAP Business One assets across variety of channels. Note that some of the assets are publicly available for everyone and indexed for search engines, while others are restricted to partners, or require credentials.

This tip and all the other tips are available on the [Tip of the week community page](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/02/17/sap-business-one-tips-are-one-click-away/). You can also visit the [Implementation Arena](https://blogs.sap.com/2016/04/01/sap-business-one-implementation-arena/) for useful implementation tips.
