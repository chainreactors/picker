# Malwarebytes awarded Parent Tested Parent Approved Seal of Approval

Posted: August 13, 2024
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

We’re delighted to say Malwarebytes has been awarded the [Parent Tested Parent Approved Seal of Approval](https://www.ptpaawards.com/blog/parent-tested-parent-approved-announces-latest-recipients-of-the-ptpa-seal-of-approval-for-product-excellence-and-innovation/) for product excellence.

The Seal of Approval is given to products that have earned the trust of families, and serves as a quick and reliable indicator of quality and dependability for parents and caregivers.

[Malwarebytes Plus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium), our Premium Security + Privacy [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) bundle, was tested and reviewed by a group of parents, and scored high in areas of ease of installation and use, value for money, and effectiveness.

Reviewers noted that Malwarebytes Plus not only enhanced their device security, but also provided them with peace of mind, making them feel more confident about their family’s [online safety](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/internet-safety-tips).

100% of the reviewers said they found it “very easy” to set up Malwarebytes on their device, with 94% saying they would continue using Malwarebytes after the testing period.

They also praised the user friendliness of the program:

> “Malwarebytes Plus is hands down the best [antivirus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus) system on the market. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to run it – it does all the work for you!”

94% said Malwarebytes was “very easy” to use for protecting their privacy online. One reviewer highlighted the peace of mind it offers: “I think every parent would feel safe about their children’s computer use after installing this software.”

Sharon Vinderine, Founder and CEO of Parent Tested Parent Approved said:

> “The Parent Tested Parent Approved Seal of Approval is much more than an award; it’s the at-a-glance symbol of trust and reliability for millions of families.”
