# BEC scammers go after more than just money

Posted: December 21, 2022
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In a joint [Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/221216.pdf) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently observed incidents of Business Email Compromise (BEC) with a new twist. In these incidents the threat actors didn’t go for money, instead stealing whole shipments of food products and ingredients valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

## Business Email Compromise

Up until recently, BEC attacks were almost exclusively targeted at money transfers. Malwarebytes’ [own glossary entry for BEC](https://www.threatdown.com/glossary/what-is-business-email-compromise-bec/) says:

> “A business email compromise (BEC) is an attack wherein an employee, who is usually the CFO or someone from the Finance department, is [socially engineered](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) into wiring a large sum of money to a third-party account.”

We may have to revise that entry since threat actors are now targeting physical goods as well.

In May 2022 we [discussed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/05/the-43-billion-business-email-compromise-threat) some numbers published by the FBI. A few highlights:

* $43 billion were stolen between June 2016 and December 2021. There were 241,206 domestic and international incidents between those two dates.
* The FBI observed a 65% increase in losses suffered between July 2019 and December 2021, which feels like a significant ramp-up.
* The overwhelming number of organizations filing victim complaints to the IC3 between October 2013 and December 2021 were based in the US.

This new type of attack will most certainly boost those numbers even more.

## Methods

The tactics, techniques, and procedures have stayed very much the same. For the best results, attackers can use every bit of knowledge about the target and the legitimate company they are pretending to be. With this information they can:

* Deploy email accounts and websites that closely mimic those of a legitimate company.
* Use [spear phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/01/spear-phishing-101-what-you-need-to-know) and other techniques to get access to a legitimate company’s email system and send fraudulent emails from there.
* Use the names of actual officers or employees of a legitimate business to communicate with the victim company to add extra credibility.
* Copy company logos to lend authenticity to their fraudulent emails and documents.
* Deceive the victim company into extending credit by falsifying a credit application. The scammer provides the actual information of a legitimate company so the credit check results in an approval of the application.

In the end, the victim company ships the product but never receives a payment.

## Targets

While this type of fraud can happen in many industries, the CSA specifically points out recent events in the food and agriculture sector. In the listed examples, attackers used email addresses that were slightly different from the ones they were mimicking and seem to be predominantly after milk powder. But they also tried stealing a truckload of sugar. During investigations it also became clear that some legitimate c...
