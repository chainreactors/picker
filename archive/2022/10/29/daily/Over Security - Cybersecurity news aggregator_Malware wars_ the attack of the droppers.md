## Another 130.000+ installations of malicious droppers from official store

A year ago, we [highlighted a trend](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/deceive-the-heavens-to-cross-the-sea.html) of malicious droppers in Google Play store used to distribute banking Trojans. We also predicted further efforts of cybercriminals to reduce the malicious footprint of their malware in order to stay undetected. Distribution through droppers on official stores remains one of the most efficient ways for threat actors to reach a wide and unsuspecting audience. Although other distribution methods are also used depending on cybercriminals targets, resources, and motivation, droppers remain one of the best option on price-efforts-quality ratio, competing with SMiShing.

The history of competition between malware authors and seсurity mechanisms knows several twists when new measures are introduced. Droppers on Google Play went from using AccessibilityService to auto-allow installation from unknown sources to using legitimate sources to control them and store malicious payloads. Following the updates to the “Developer Program Policy” and system updates, actors immediately introduce new ways to sneak to the official store, overcoming limitations or adjusting droppers to follow the guidelines and not arouse suspicion. A brief story of that battle is presented on the graph below.

In this blog we uncover additional tactics cybercriminals use in new Google Play droppers discovered by ThreatFabric analysts. These droppers have cumulative number of **130k+** installations distributing Sharkbot and Vultur banking Trojans.

## Sharkbot: the less you see, the more they get

In the beginning of October 2022 ThreatFabric analysts spotted a new campaign of banking Trojan Sharkbot, targeting Italian banking users. This campaign involved Sharkbot **version 2.29 – 2.32**. Following the research path, our analysts were able to identify the dropper app located on Google Play with 10k+ installations and disguised as an app to calculate tax code in Italy (“Codice Fiscale”) targeting Italian users.

![sharkbot_dropper](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Threatfabric/images/sharkbot_dropper.png?width=1920&height=1080&name=sharkbot_dropper.png)

This is not the first time that a Sharkbot dropper sneaks into the official Google store, but this time authors did their best to hide the malicious intents of the dropper. Previous versions of Sharkbot droppers as well as other droppers (including those we highlight below in this blog) include ability to download, install and launch the malicious payload. Obviously, such behaviour is quite suspicious and already made Google to introduce changes to the [Developer Program Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12766072?hl=en&ref_topic=9877065) where usage of **REQUEST\_INSTALL\_PACKAGES** permission was limited to apps that have it as core functionality.

However, in this new iteration, Sharkbot dropper authors tried their best to not include suspicious permissions at all, thus maintaining an extremely low profile. The new dropper has only 3 permissions that are quite common.

![permissions](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Threatfabric/images/permissions.png?width=1920&height=1080&name=permissions.png)

To ensure that the dropper is launched on a real targeted device, the app obtains the SIM coutry and compares it to “**it**” (Italy): if not matched, no malicious activity will be performed. Besides, additional checks are made on the C2 side to ensure that the dropper is running on the targeted device: if C2 is reached from a non-Italian IP address, the C2 will respond with a default “exit” message. Otherwise, it will receive a configuration data with the URL containing the payload.

![requests](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Threatfabric/images/requests.png?width=1920&height=1080&name=requests.png)

Here the interesting part starts: in order to avoid using REQUEST\_INSTALL\_PACKAGES permission, the dropper opens a fake Google Play store page impersonating Codice Fiscale app page. It contains fake information about the number of installations and reviews, and urges the victim to perform an update. Shortly after the page is opened, the automatic download starts. Thus, the dropper outsources the download and installation procedure to the browser, avoiding suspicious permissions.

![fake_update](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Threatfabric/images/fake_update.png?width=1920&height=1080&name=fake_update.png)

Obviously, such approach requires more actions from the victim, as the browser will show several messages about the downloaded file. However, since victims are sure about the origin of the application, they will highly likely install and run the downloaded Sharkbot payload.

During our investigation, we also found another Sharkbot dropper available on Google Play. It had zero installations at the time of discovery and was quickly removed from the website. The interesting detail about this dropper was that it had the REQUEST\_INSTALL\_PACKAGES permission in place and operated more in line with usual dropper’s behaviour. Actors were also following the updated policy of Google, as this dropper was masqueraded as file manager, a category that is allowed to have this permission due to it being a core functionality.

![sharkbot_dropper_2](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Threatfabric/images/sharkbot_dropper_2.png?width=1920&height=1080&name=sharkbot_dropper_2.png)

Similarities in code, C2 communication, and encryption used lead us to the same author behind the older versions of Sharkbot dropper, trying to reduce footprints and stay undetected.

### Targets

The new “Codice Fiscale” dropper discovered by ThreatFabric is configured to distribute Sharkbot payload to Italian users only, while the other “File Manager” dropper has Italy and UK in its configuration. At the same time, the payload delivered still has banks from Italy, UK, Germany, Spain, Poland, Austria, US, and Australia in its target list. Please, find the full target list in [Appendix](https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/the-attack-of-the-droppers.html#sharkbot-targets).

## Vultur: Brunhilda is back

Another malware family that has been very active in the last year has been Vultur. [First discovered by ThreatFabric in July 2021](https://www.threatfabric.com/blo...
