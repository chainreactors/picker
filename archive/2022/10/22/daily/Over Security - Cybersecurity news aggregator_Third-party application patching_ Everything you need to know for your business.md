# Third-party application patching: Everything you need to know for your business

October 20, 2022

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

[Patch management](https://www.threatdown.com/products/patch-management/) that is consistent and efficient has never been more critical in keeping your security infrastructure up to date and secure. Although today’s endpoint management solutions include patch management functionalities, third-party patching is an area that shouldn’t be forgotten.

In this post, we will cover the importance of third-party application patching and the challenges it can address for your organization.

## What is a third-party application?

A third-party application is a type of software designed by an independent vendor other than the initial manufacturer of the device. Common examples of third-party app vendors, include Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat Reader, TeamViewer, and others.

## What is third-party patching and why is it important?

Third-party patching involves applying patch updates to third-party applications that have been installed on your business endpoints, which includes desktops, laptops, servers, and other devices. Third-party patch management patches vulnerabilities that, if exploited, can jeopardize the security and functionality of software. Vulnerabilities expose your company’s attack surfaces to malicious actors looking for opportunities to access your network.

So, why is patching third-party applications important to your business?

Patching software vulnerabilities is a key driver for preventing future cyberattacks on your organization. The vulnerabilities found in your business’s third-party apps opens the flood gates for hackers.

These malicious adversaries spread in your systems through techniques such as privilege escalation and lateral movement, seeking out sensitive information and valuable data. Patching third-party vulnerabilities reduces the likelihood of an attack while also fixing the bugs to improve software functionality. Another reason your organization should consider third-party patching is that it can help your business satisfy necessary compliance regulations.

## The risks to your business when neglecting to patch third-party applications

In 2021[, 93% of companies](https://www.bluevoyant.com/resources/managing-cyber-risk-across-the-extended-vendor-ecosystem) experienced a cybersecurity breach of some kind due to third-party vendors or supply chain weakness. With [the average cost of a data breach](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) in the US at an astounding $9.4 million, the repercussions of a cyber incident caused by unpatched vulnerabilities are detrimental. Consequentially, an attack of such magnitude causes disruption to daily workflows, productivity, and in cases causes reputational harm. Neglecting to patch third-party apps is a risk your company can’t afford.

When security teams choose not to consistently patch endpoints, your risk of exposure to potential cyberattacks increases. In 2021 for instance, Log4Shell, a software vulnerability in Apache Log4j 2, took the world by storm. For more information on Log4Shell, read the Malwarebytes blog post – What SMBs can do to protect against Log4Shell attacks.

What can businesses learn from vulnerabilities like Log4Shell? The third-party application [patch management process](https://www.threatdown.com/glossary/what-is-patch-management/) is essential. Although third-party app vendors don’t strictly adhere to a patch release schedule, they normally do this when a vulnerability is discovered with a patch being released to address it. Read our article on Security vulnerabilities: 5 times businesses (and governments) got hacked for more information on how hackers exploited vu...
