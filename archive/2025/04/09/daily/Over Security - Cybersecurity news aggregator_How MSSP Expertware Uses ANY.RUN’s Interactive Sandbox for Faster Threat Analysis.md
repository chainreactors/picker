How MSSP Expertware Uses ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox for Faster Threat Analysis

At ANY.RUN, we love hearing about clients’ experiences. Quality feedback helps us improve and gives new and existing users a clearer understanding of our tools in actual security scenarios.

That’s why when we spoke with Augustin Alexandrovici, who leads Cyber Intelligence Operations at [Expertware](https://www.expertware.net/), we knew we had to share our conversation.

Check out the highlights to see how a Managed Security Service Provider employs ANY.RUN in its operations.

## Company Overview

Expertware is a leading IT consultancy with over 18 years of experience, specializing in cybersecurity and Security Operations Center (SOC) services. With a dedicated team of over 30 cyber experts, we can seamlessly build or extend internal teams to address evolving threats and ensure robust protection for businesses.

Our expertise spans AI and machine learning, full-stack development, IT architecture, and business optimization. Having completed over 500 successful projects for leading European clients across industries such as banking, insurance, retail, telecom, and more, we deliver innovative, high-impact solutions that foster growth and resilience.

## What Made Expertware Look for a Malware Sandbox

We started looking for a sandbox, because we wanted to offer to our customers an in-depth view of security incidents targeting their IT Infrastructure.

Before, we had to manually set up reverse-engineering environments, which was a time-consuming process. The extra steps required slowed down our ability to analyze and respond to malware threats in an efficient way.

We also wanted to improve the average turnaround time for malware investigations to make operations faster and be able to process more threats.

Another challenge we sought to address was the limited visibility into attacks. We needed a solution that would present us with an intuitive and streamlined view of threats’ entire kill chain.

With all of these taken into consideration, [ANY.RUN’s sandbox](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=expertware_story&utm_term=080425&utm_content=linktolanding) became our choice.

> *ANY.RUN has enabled us to actually interact with malicious files on the fly, which saves us from risky manual setups and cuts down on the resources we allocate to daily tasks*

One of the main factors behind our decision was the interactivity. It instantly solved the problem of building and maintaining our custom VMs for malware analysis. [ANY.RUN has enabled us to actually interact with malicious files](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/) on the fly, which saves us from risky manual setups and cuts down on the resources we allocate to daily tasks.

## How Expertware Use ANY.RUN

Our organization has been using ANY.RUN for over a year. Initially, we started with a proof of concept (POC) phase to see how it would fit into our SOC workflow, and we found it very effective, so we fully integrated it soon afterwards.

Now we use all the core products provided by ANY.RUN: the Interactive Sandbox, TI Feeds, and Threat Intelligence Lookup complementing and enriching our [SIEMBIOT](https://siembiot.eu/) cyber security. Our team relies on them for malware analysis, dynamic execution of files, and rapid threat intelligence analysis.

We use the sandbox specifically for:

* **Malware Investigations**: We submit suspicious files for dynamic analysis to observe malicious behavior, network indicators, and potential dropper actions.

* **Phishing Analysis**: We examine advanced phishing campaigns to see how attachments or malicious scripts are executed within a controlled environment.

* **Indicator Extraction and Mapping**: We extract IOCs, map the full scope of the attack to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and quickly integrate them into our threat intelligence feeds and det...
