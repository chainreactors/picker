So far we have seen strides for at least keeping messages private on mobile devices with end-to-end encrypted apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and iMessage. Encryption on the web has been widely adopted. We even declared in 2021 that “[HTTPS Is Actually Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere).” Most web traffic is encrypted and for a website to have a reputable presence with browsers, they have to meet certain requirements that major browsers enforce today. Mechanisms like certificate transparency, Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) rules, and enforcing HTTPS help prevent malicious activity happening to users every day.
