# smbtakeover

A technique to unbind and rebind 445/tcp on Windows without loading a driver, loading a module into LSASS, or rebooting the target machine. Implemented to ease the burden of SMB-based NTLM relays while operating over C2. Technical analysis of the technique is dicussed in more detail during the [Relay Your Heart Away: An OPSEC Concious Approach to 445 Takeover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBqOOkQGJEA) presentation at [x33fcon](https://x.com/x33fcon).

PoCs written in both Python and BOF format. Both utilize RPC over TCP (ncacn\_ip\_tcp) as transport when targeting remote machines.
