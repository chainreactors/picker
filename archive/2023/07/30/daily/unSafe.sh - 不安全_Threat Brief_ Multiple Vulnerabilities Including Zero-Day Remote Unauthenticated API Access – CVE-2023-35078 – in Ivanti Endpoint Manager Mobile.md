## Executive Summary

On July 24, 2023, Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM), previously known as MobileIron Core, publicly disclosed details about an unauthenticated API access zero-day vulnerability. [CVE-2023-35078](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-35078-Remote-unauthenticated-API-access-vulnerability?language=en_US) affects versions **11.10, 11.9 and 11.8,** but older versions are also at risk of possible exploitation.

At the time of writing, the only confirmed victims have been [Norwegian government agencies](https://www.dss.dep.no/aktuelle-saker/departementer-utsatt-for-dataangrep/). They confirmed their government ministries had been targeted in a cyberattack exploiting this vulnerability, but given the number of potentially vulnerable servers on the internet running this software, it's highly likely that other organizations will or already have fallen victim. Open source reporting indicates that these attacks most likely occurred prior to Ivanti knowing about the vulnerability.

As of July 24, our Cortex Xpanse attack surface management data scanning discovered over **5,500** Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile servers, spanning multiple versions, were publicly exposed on the internet. The highest number of exposures were found in Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.

The regional statistics from this scanning indicate over 80% of these servers reside in western countries and span multiple industry sectors including the following among many others:

* Local and national government departments
* Healthcare organizations
* Law firms and other legal entities
* Universities
* Banks and financial institutions
* Charities
* Retail

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users full API access through specific API endpoints. According to the [CISA advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/24/ivanti-releases-security-updates-endpoint-manager-mobile-epmm-cve-2023-35078), with this access malicious actors can extract personally identifiable information (PII) and perform administrative actions, like creating new accounts and making configuration changes, without needing any credentials.

Given the global reach of this incident, and the fact that the vulnerability has already been exploited in the wild, organizations should investigate exposures on their network, and remediate as quickly as possible, using the Ivanti-provided product upgrades.

Since the discovery of the Critical vulnerability CVE-2023-35078, another vulnerability with a High CVSS classification has also been reported within the Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile application. [CVE-2023-35081](https://www.ivanti.com/blog/cve-2023-35081-new-ivanti-epmm-vulnerability) is a remote file write vulnerability that requires an authenticated administrator to write files to the compromised server, which could include additional payloads providing further access.

Unit 42 recommends that users of the affected software upgrade to the latest versions that include fixes for the vulnerability. It’s especially important to review your network topology to ensure that any public-facing Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile services are up-to-date with the latest patch.

For those who can’t upgrade to fixed versions of the software, we also recommend taking precautionary measures to control access to vulnerable servers, and considering restricting access to the public until they can be patched.

[Cortex Xpanse](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xpanse) customers can identify external facing instances of the application through the “**Insecure Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (MobileIron Core)”** attack surface rule.

## Details of the Vulnerability: CVE-2023-35078

Of the [5,500 Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile servers](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/security-operations/dont-let-your-ivanti-exposures-go-unpatched/) discovered through Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse data, Figure 1 below shows a subset of those servers that we were able to obtain a product version for, and the count of said version. The Ivanti-supported version numbers are mentioned above. However, as you can see in the figure below, there are many other, older, unsupported versions still publicly exposed on the internet.

Just under a quarter of the servers we could obtain version information for were supported and, despite the partial information, that pattern is quite concerning. This is an important point to make: Software, especially when it’s internet-facing, should be protected and kept up to date.

![Image 1 is a column chart of the number of affected hosts captured by Unit 42 research where the version was known. The highest affected is version 11.1 with 1,372. ](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/chart-3.png)

The vulnerability has received a CVSS v.3.0 base score of 10.0, the highest rating possible, and a severity of Critical.

Given the ease of exploitation to the [internet-facing application's](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/) API, provided as default by each organization running the affected software, there is no so-called proof of concept code required to exploit the vulnerability. It is, unfortunately, as simple as interacting with the system's API using commands (many of which are documented and publically available) to perform various actions within the victim's environment. As [described by CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/24/ivanti-releases-security-updates-endpoint-manager-mobile-epmm-cve-2023-35078), such commands can extract PII and perform administrative actions, like creating new accounts and making configuration changes, without needing any credentials.

## Details of the Vulnerability: CVE-2023-35081

On July 28, 2023, another vulnerability with a High CVSS classification was reported within the Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile application. [CVE-2023-35081](https://www.ivanti.com/blog/cve-2023-35081-new-ivanti-epmm-vulnerability) is a remote file write vulnerability that requires an authenticated administrator to write files to the compromised server, which could include additional payloads providing further access.

According to Ivanti, there are reports of victims impacted by the new vulnerability used in conjunction with the original vulnerability. The original provides unauthenticated access while the second provides additional capabilities.

This news is somewhat reminiscent of the recent [MOVEit vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34362) where, in the weeks following the discovery, both the vendor and security researchers had uncovered additional vulnerabilities perhaps due to the focus drawn by the initia...
