# AI's Ultimate Use Case: Transition from Current to Desired State

The best way to think of AI is a system that can take us from where we are to where we want to be

When most people think of AI's potential to help humanity in 10, 100, or 1,000 years, they think much too small.

They think about what it does today, and then just imagine "more of that." Like AI agents providing more employees, or tutors, or companions.

All tremendously useful, but still tactical vs. strategic.

The best use case I've thought of so far is something far more general. It's *a pattern for solving problems generally*, as opposed to just a set of one-off solutions.

## Current to Desired State Transition [​](#current-to-desired-state-transition)

Applies to humans and anything else alive, it seems.

One way to characterize the universal challenge for anything alive is **how to go from its current situation to its desired situation**.

I wonder if play and meditation are states that break this rule.

This applies to finances, employment, starting a business, relationships, raising children, health, and so on. You can imagine this as the eternal problem for anything with goals.

Ultimately it's a *world-model* problem. Here are the pieces:

Context size seems even more important than intelligence here.

1. Understand how the world works at a very deep level
2. Be able to hold the current state of X in its mind
3. Be able to hold the desired state of X in its mind
4. Use its understanding of the world to determine the required steps to go from the current state to the desired state
5. Recommend or take the steps to make it happen

Likely one of many end-tier capabilities, such as the invention of new types of science. Impossible to say what they'll be.

In other words, one end-tier capability for any intelligence—human or otherwise—is the ability to turn any problem into a current-to-desired-state transition problem—at any scale.

This requires extraordinary understanding of how things work and significant intelligence, but what it needs most is what scientists call *working memory*. This is like the size of the space that a given intelligence can operate on at any given time.

These exercises will be useful at almost any level of compression, but will likely scale in usefulness as the detail increases.

It needs to hold all these things in its mind at once and then apply its intelligence, creativity, etc. These current and desired states will be summarized, compressed, and otherwise efficiently minified, but they will still be *vast*, so working memory (context size) matters a lot.

### Fully Contextual Decision Making [​](#fully-contextual-decision-making)

One of the primary use cases for this model of problem solving comes down to the most common questions ever.

1. Should I do this?
2. Which of these should I do?
3. Is this the right time?

You ask these questions when you're looking for a life partner, when you're trying to hire employees, trying to raise a child, and a thousand other things.

Being human means constantly making decisions like these.

If you squint your eyes a bit, you'll be able to see that even these types of questions are just another way to think about state transition.

This is not predicting the future, which is impossible at any scale. It's modeling likely outcomes and how similar they are to your desired state.

While we are asking technically different questions, about different situations, and at different times, they can all be reframed as:

> Which of these choices will get me closer to my desired state?

A State Managing AI will then model a dozen or a billion futures where you did this vs. that, and then advise you which one to choose.

The AI's intelligence will probably be far beyond any human by this time, but it's not even necessary for this to work.

It's like asking a human life coach the same thing, except the life coach can't hold petabytes of world knowledge in its mind at the same time and then apply beyond-human intelligence to the analysis.

## Examples [​](#examples)

To illustrate the point further, let's look at some examples of how this model can be applied to common problems in personal life, business, and other everyday challenges.

### Dating [​](#dating)

The eternal problem of finding the right person to build a life with.

| Problem | State-Transition Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Which of these guys should I choose? | Model out a million lives with him vs. the other guy, using 200 billion life parameters, compare those outcomes to ideal state, provide recommendations |
| Should I still be dating her? | Model out a million lives with her vs. someone more ideal, calculating for current level of bonding and shared experience, compare that to desired state, and advise if you should stay or go |
| Where Should I Go to Meet People? | Model the top meeting places, including online forums, dating apps, bars, churches, hobby spots, etc., and the people likely to hang out in those places. Take representative people and model out a life with them and compare to ideal situation |

### Customer Churn at a Business [​](#customer-churn-at-a-business)

One of the most common problems in business: seeing why people are cancelling or not renewing.

Note that this could be an interaction type, not a discount or offer.

| Problem | State-Transition Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| How do I keep this customer from cancelling? | Create a desired state for the customer and compare that to their current state with your company. Advise on what you can say, or change about their expeirence to make their situation best match their ideal state. |
| Which of my current customers are likely to cancel? | Create a current state model for all current customers, create an ideal state where they're perfectly happy with your product/service, analyze the difference between the two, recommend changes / take actions |

### Perfect Song Company/Application [​](#perfect-song-company-application)

This is for a startup that takes the context from any situation, like two friends riding bikes together in nature, and plays the perfect song (or soundtrack) as background music

| Problem | State-Transition Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| What's the perfect song to be playing in the background at this moment? | Build the current state maps for all human listeners, build their ideal state maps (e.g., feeling more connected to each other in this intimate moment), look at their individual and shared pasts, pick the perfect song to play to make that moment one they'll remember forever |

### Other example problem spaces [​](#other-example-problem-spaces)

These were just a few random examples of the types of problems that can be addressed using this framework. Here is a short list of others that I'm sure you could add 20 more to without much effort.

| Problem Space | State-Transition Model |
| --- | --- |
| Vulnerability Management | Current systems, current vulnerabilities, lack of the worst ones on the most important systems, transition plan, action |
| Tutoring | Current curiosity, self-confidence, knowledge, and curiosity level, ideal self-confidence and competence level, transition plan, incoming questions / challenges, response interactions |
