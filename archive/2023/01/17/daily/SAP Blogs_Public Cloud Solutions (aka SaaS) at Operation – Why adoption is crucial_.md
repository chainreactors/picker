## Summary,

This article is about Public cloud services (also known as software as a service) and not covering platform or infrastructure as a service. All core principles are valid for the SAP Cloud product family and all public cloud vendor offerings.

Cloud operations help companies operate, adopt and develop software applications. In this article, we explain why cloud operation should include adoption, how the teams should work together and what needs to be delivered to the business.

## Why is adoption crucial for your cloud solution?

### Characteristics of on-premise solutions

Characteristics of the on-premise solution

I am trying to simplify a bit here to provide the core message. Let's talk about on-premise solutions first. Let's assume, you have an SAP HCM solution, and a project team helped to deploy the solution. At GoLive, you cover all the business requirements. However, after some years, the business requirements increased. To cope with the new requirements, a costly upgrade project was conducted so that capabilities meet requirements. Such upgrade projects are typically every two to three years.

Per definition, it is about "need coverage" and software solutions trying to cover the business blueprint.

(For the sake of simplicity, as mentioned, I am discarding the EHP activation and providing changes around legal requirements).

### Characteristics of on-cloud solutions

Characteristics of cloud (also hybrid) solutions

Here it gets more complex to understand. The baseline when the solution went live is the blue line shown above. Even if customers do not conduct projects or adoption activities, thanks to ongoing global release changes, better and more compliant solutions are available over time (the gray line).
The cloud solutions' ground-breaking innovation capability could be seen in the blue line. Third-party solution extensions, other easy-to-integrate cloud solutions, and new optional capabilities introduced by the vendors make the solution capability much better than business requirements.

Here the core mindset is not trying to cover the business blueprint but provide the best meaningful cover via fit-gap analysis where customers can discover new and valuable capabilities that the new solution offers; therefore, it has a "want generation." nature. Solution capabilities are much higher than business requirements. The delta between the solution capabilities and available solutions without adoption could be considered an adoption gap.

### Ideal operation of cloud solutions

*Ideal operation of cloud solutions*

For the sake of clarity, I am simplifying here again. At the high-level, adoption should not be a one-time activity like on-premise but a continuous effort for long-term value realization. As you can see in the blue line, solution capabilities are improved over time between release cycles. SAP Successfactors offers a new release and off-cycle mobile releases every six months and several innovations via its ecosystem.
Here the cloud solution provides capabilities (blue line) that are more comprehensive than the business requirement (red line). The solution covers not only the blueprint requirement but also new capabilities for business. For example, the digital signature was not in the scope, but it is available and straightforward to integrate. Therefore we could enrich the initial scope. Or mobile native reporting via tables was not part of the initial blueprint but became available out of the box. Therefore again, we could enhance the initial scope. These scope enhancements (innovations) are the area between red and blue lines. Per definition, such enhancements are not readily available at the on-premise option.

To deliver the ongoing change(adoption), a cultural and structural shift must occur within an organization to support successful business innovation via cloud technologies. This foundational change is often referred as cloud mindset.

## How to govern the cloud solution for Change & Success?

Let's be specific and take SAP SuccessFactors and HR as example solutions. As explained in "Why is adoption crucial for your cloud solution?" section, a cloud solution without ongoing adoption is a waste of investment and missed opportunity.

Here are some key areas you need to address for your cloud journey.
