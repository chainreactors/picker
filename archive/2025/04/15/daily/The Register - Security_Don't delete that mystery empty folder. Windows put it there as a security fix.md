Canny Windows users who've spotted a mysterious folder on hard drives after applying last week's security patches for the operating system can rest assured – it's perfectly benign. In fact, it's recommended you leave the directory there.

The folder, typically `C:\inetpub`, is empty and related to Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS). It will be created when you install the security patches whether or not you're using that optional web server. The purpose of the folder is to mitigate an exploitable elevation-of-privileges flaw within Windows Process Activation, classified as CVE-2025-21204.

That CVE, which can give malware on a system or a rogue user system-level file-management privileges, was fixed in the [April Patch Tuesday](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/patch_tuesday_microsoft/) batch from the Windows maker; installing the fix on Windows 11 and 10 will create the directory as additional protection, we're told.
