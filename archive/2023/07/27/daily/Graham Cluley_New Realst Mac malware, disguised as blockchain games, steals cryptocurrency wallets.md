Fake blockchain games, that are being actively promoted by cybercriminals on social media, are actually designed to infect the computers of unsuspecting Mac users with cryptocurrency-stealing malware.

Security researcher Iamdeadlyz was the first to [describe](https://iamdeadlyz.gitbook.io/malware-research/july-2023/fake-blockchain-games-deliver-redline-stealer-and-realst-stealer-a-new-macos-infostealer-malware "Link to Iamdeadlyz blog") how Web3 play-to-earn games with names such as ‚ÄúBrawl Earth‚Äù, ‚ÄúWildWorld‚Äù, ‚ÄúDawnland‚Äù, ‚ÄúDestruction‚Äù, ‚ÄúEvolion‚Äù, ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, ‚ÄúOlymp of Reptiles‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSaintLegend‚Äù ‚Äì have been aggressively promoted via websites, ‚Äúverified‚Äù Twitter accounts, and Discord channels in the hunt for victims.

The attackers have even used private direct messages to intended targets, offering purported ‚Äúaccess codes‚Äù allowing download of the fake games. In all likelihood, victims are being selected based upon their enthusiasm for all things cryptocurrency-related.

The latest version of the Mac malware, which has been named ‚ÄúRealst‚Äù, even works on the macOS 14 Sonoma, which hasn‚Äôt even been officially released yet ‚Äì indicating that the threat continues to be actively developed by its creators.

Once installed, Realst steals information from victims‚Äô Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi web browsers, as well as cryptocurrency wallets, and sends it back to the cybercriminals. At the time of writing, the Safari browser appears to not be targeted by the malware.

Security researchers at SentinelOne, who have also examined the Realst malware, say that they have [identified 16 distinct variants of the threat for macOS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/apple-crimeware-massive-rust-infostealer-campaign-aiming-for-macos-sonoma-ahead-of-public-release/ "Link to SentinelOne blog").

A Windows version of the malware, known as ‚ÄúRedLine Stealer‚Äù, has also been distributed.

Clearly the perpetrators of this malware campaign are banking on investor‚Äôs enthusiasm to earn free cryptocurrency over-riding their common-sense.
