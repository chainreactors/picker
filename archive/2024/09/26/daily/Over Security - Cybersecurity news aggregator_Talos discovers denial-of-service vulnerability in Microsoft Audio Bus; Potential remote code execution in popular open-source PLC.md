[Vulnerability Roundup](/category/vulnerability-roundup/)

Cisco Talos’ Vulnerability Research team recently disclosed two vulnerabilities in Microsoft products that have been patched by the company over the past two Patch Tuesdays.

One is a vulnerability in the High-Definition Audio Bus Driver in Windows systems that could lead to a denial of service, while the other is a memory corruption issue that exists in a multicasting protocol in Windows 10.

Additionally, Talos researchers have disclosed three vulnerabilities in OpenPLC, a popular open-source programmable logic controller.

For Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from [Snort.org](https://snort.org/), and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on [Talos Intelligence’s website](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports).

# Microsoft High-Definition Audio Bus Driver denial-of-service vulnerability

*Discovered by Marcin “Icewall” Noga.*

[TALOS-2024-2008](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2008) (CVE-2024-45383) is a vulnerability in the Microsoft HD Audio Bus Driver that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service.

The driver allows the Windows operating system to communicate with external audio devices that play sound, including those that are integrated into machines’ motherboards or connected via HD audio interfaces.

A mishandling of IRP requests in the driver’s interface could allow an attacker to send multiple IRP Complete requests to the driver, causing the DoS and forcing the operating system into the “Blue Screen of Death.”

# Stale memory dereference in Microsoft Pragmatic General Multicast Server

*Discovered by a Cisco Talos researcher.*

A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Pragmatic General Multicast server in the Microsoft Windows 10 Kernel.

The Pragmatic General Multicast protocol is an IP-based multicasting protocol that is implemented by Microsoft as part of the Message Queueing service available in different versions of Windows.

A specially crafted network packet can lead to the access of stale memory structure, resulting in memory corruption. An attacker can send a sequence of malicious packets to trigger [TALOS-2024-2062](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2062) (CVE-2024-38140).

Talos independently discovered this issue and reported it to Microsoft prior to their patch release earlier this year. However, Microsoft informed us that an internal researcher had already discovered this issue.

# Three vulnerabilities in OpenPLC

*Discovered by Jared Rittle*.

Talos recently discovered three vulnerabilities in OpenPLC, an open-source programmable logic controller designed to provide a low-cost option for automation in many manufacturing and logistics settings.

Two of the issues — [TALOS-2024-2004](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2004) (CVE-2024-36980, CVE-2024-36981) and [TALOS-2024-2016](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2016) (CVE-2024-39589, CVE-2024-39590) — can lead to a denial-of-service on the targeted device. An adversary could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a series of specially crafted Ethernet/IP requests.

Another stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability, [TALOS-2024-2005](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2005) (CVE-2024-34026), can also be exploited in this way. However, in this case, it could lead to remote code execution.
