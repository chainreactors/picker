## Get Tails 6.17

### To upgrade your Tails USB stick and keep your Persistent Storage

* Automatic upgrades are available from Tails 6.0 or later to 6.17.
* If you cannot do an automatic upgrade or if Tails fails to start after an automatic upgrade, please try to do a [manual upgrade](https://tails.net/doc/upgrade/#manual).

### To install Tails 6.17 on a new USB stick

Follow our installation instructions:

* [Install from Windows](https://tails.net/install/windows/)
* [Install from macOS](https://tails.net/install/mac/)
* [Install from Linux](https://tails.net/install/linux/)
* [Install from Debian or Ubuntu using the command line and GnuPG](https://tails.net/install/expert/)

The Persistent Storage on the USB stick will be lost if you install instead of
upgrading.

6.17 directly:
