A summary of all the information I learned while looking for new jobs and how I ended up getting hired on Google's red team.

On June 20th 2023 I started as a Red Team Specialist at Google (insert confetti emoji). I’m super excited about this position but I would in no way be able to have this opportunity if it weren’t for the countless helpful people in the security community that guided me along the way. I wanted to take some time to reflect on the steps I went through to get here so that others who wish to follow a similar path can do so.

It is impossible for me to give tailored advice to everyone’s specific situation, so I am not going to attempt to do so. Instead, I’ve created a list of information that would have been helpful to me in my specific situation as that is the only thing I know is 100% *true*. My hope is that some of the information I learned from looking back on my job hunt can be picked up and molded to your specific situation, but remember, there is no *one size fits all* advice for such nuanced topics and you should be skeptical of anyone who gives very specific advice for such a personal topic.

For some context, here is the TLDR of my resume I sent out to many places. I will provide screenshots of my resume further down.

* **Certs:** A+, Net+, Security+, Project+, Linux+, eJPT, eCPPT, GSEC, GCIH, GSTRT, GPYC, GCIA, GDSA, GCED, GXPN
* **Education:** BS in Cybersecurity (UNG), SANS Masters Information Security Engineering (almost done)
* **Job Experience:** ~2.5 years in offensive security (pentesting, vulnerability analysis). About 4 years working random jobs (grocery store, warehouse, etc)

The following is a graph of all the jobs I applied for over about a 5 month period. As you can see the majority of the applications I sent went straight to `/dev/null` and another large portion got denied with pretty generic “sorry, maybe next time” messages. While I was denied from the majority of jobs, looking back, I’m not surprised by this for reasons I’ll get into in the next section.

Lets break down what conclusions I take away from this data.

1. I applied to ALOT of positions and cast a wide net.
2. I got denied from ALOT of positions.
3. While I didn’t have too many interviews, I was doing reasonably well on the interviews I did get. Personally I think this means that I was doing fine interviewing, it was just hard to *get* that interview in the first place.
4. It’s ok to withdraw from an interview process if you don’t get good vibes.

When I first began my search for a new role, I was blissfully ignorant in my thinking of how long it would take to get and accept an offer. I (incorrectly) thought that I would have an offer within a month. Much to my dismay, that turned out to be very incorrect. In fact, I didn’t sign an offer until about 6 months later. I believe there were many factors that were at play here:

1. The entire industry is having massive layoffs, not exactly the best time to be looking for a new gig.
2. I was aiming VERY high. With a few exceptions, I was aiming for senior roles with only ~2.5 years of security experience" (I’m a strong believer that number of years of experience != experience level. You can be terrible at your job for many years. There are too many factors at play, but that is a whole different tangent for another time.) The exception to my “aiming for senior roles” was companies that either A: Didn’t do the whole *senior*/*junior* role thing or B: companies where a non-senior level employee is equivalent to a *senior* position at another company (these were mostly tech companies).
3. I had a long list of companies I didn’t want to work for either by name, market vertical, or job type. I won’t air out all my grievances, but generally I wasn’t looking for “consultant-style” pentesting (AKA: doing PCI compliance pentests every other week for a new company that isn’t going to fix the critical findings you call out in the report) and a few other types of work as well as market verticals. I am confident I could have found another “consultant-style” pentesting gig very quickly if need be.

I sent out my first application on December 27th 2022 and didn’t accept an offer until mid May, nearly 5 months after my first application was sent out. This was a bit demoralizing but I am grateful for two things. 1. I was already in a very safe job, I wasn’t in any rush to find something new, I could afford (both financially and to a lesser degree, mentally) to take my time. 2. I work VERY hard to make myself competitive. It took a while, but I am very glad I stuck it out for so long. The last situation I wanted to be in was one where I was going to be searching for jobs again within the next two years.

I was trying to bat way out of my league when it came to jobs I was applying for. The biggest mistake I see people making is not understanding how valuable they could be to the company they join. This is a very important step, it would be a big mistake to move laterally to a job that would not meet all of my criteria just to be left wanting more and having to repeat the job hunt. Knowing myself and the industry I am in, I am comfortable batting way out of my league because I know that I have put in a lot of work to get where I am at, and I know there are jobs out there that DO meet all of my criteria.

Don’t sell yourself short if you have the luxury of time. The higher you aim, the more time it will likely take and the more mental bandwidth you will have to exert, but getting a job you’re excited about should be your #1 priority.

Interviewing is tough even if you know all the answers. Not only does it take a long time, but it is mentally draining. I took a lot of PTO from my previous position solely to interview for new positions. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend doing so, because if you have a set amount of PTO and you don’t land a new job, you can put yourself in a bad spot. Unfortunately I could not handle working full time, interviewing, working on my masters, and doing security consulting on the side. If you’re going to leave, you need to use the PTO anyway, so it may be worth it to take the day off, just be careful.

Interviewing in and of itself is a skill. During the 5ish months I was interviewing, I developed the odd habit of asking myself common interview questions in my head whenever I was driving, doing the dishes, or doing some other mundane task. I think this REALLY helped. I would ask myself things such as “What is your biggest weakness, tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult coworker, describe the TCP 3 way handshake, etc”. Workshopping the answers to these very common questions in my head gave me a good starting place when it came to real interviews. I wouldn’t rehearse an answer, so much as refine my thinking on those types of questions. I would highly recommend looking up a list of common interview questions and learning how to answer them.

Tech interviews are a large time investment, don’t be afraid to end your candidacy for a position if you don’t love the job. I did my best to only apply for jobs where an interview would be a good investment of my time and I ended my candidacy for a position I knew I wouldn’t love.

Whether you’re researching a company or a specific position, make sure you do your research. here are a few tips that helped me.

Talk to people at that company ...
