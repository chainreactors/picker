With a choice of seven tracks and supporting sub tracks on today's most tech topics, we asked a group of [SAP Champions](https://community.sap.com/programs/influencer-programs/champions) and [SAP Mentors](https://community.sap.com/programs/influencer-programs/mentors) for their tips on which sessions they look forward to attending.

Their responses on the key learning paths were very insightful.
