A sophisticated SS7 protocol vulnerability that enables unauthorized SMS interception and real-time phone tracking is now being offered for sale on underground forums, raising serious concerns about mobile network security worldwide.

The exploit, priced at $5,000, provides buyers with comprehensive tools to compromise telecommunications infrastructure at a fundamental level.

Security researchers have identified a listing on a prominent cybercrime forum where a newly registered vendor offers what they claim is a zero-day vulnerability affecting SS7 gateways.

## **New Exploit Targets Critical Telecom Infrastructure**

Despite its age and known security limitations, the Signaling System 7 ([SS7](https://cybersecuritynews.com/years-old-ss7-vulnerability/)) protocol, developed in 1975 and standardized in 1980, remains a critical component of global telecommunications networks.

According to a Dark Web Informer post shared on X, the package includes the zero-day payload, a curated target list of vulnerable telecom infrastructure, and specialized dorking tools for Shodan, [Censys](https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisa-threat-hunting-staff-censys-virustotal/), Fofa, Google, and ZMap designed to identify additional vulnerable systems.

This represents a significant threat to telecom security. SS7 exploits have been around for years, but a fresh zero-day targeting gateway infrastructure could potentially bypass existing security measures implemented by carriers.

The SS7 protocol facilitates interoperability between telecommunications networks globally, managing everything from call routing to SMS delivery and roaming capabilities.

Its architecture includes critical components such as Mobile Switching Centers (MSCs), Home Location Registers (HLRs), and Visitor Location Registers (VLRs).

According to the listing, the exploit leverages weaknesses in the Mobile Application Part (MAP) of the SS7 protocol stack, specifically targeting the UpdateLocation and AnyTimeInterrogation messages to manipulate network responses.

By spoofing legitimate Point Codes (PCs), attackers can impersonate trusted network nodes and redirect communications.

The exploit could potentially allow attackers to:

* Intercept one-time passwords sent via SMS for two-factor authentication
* Track mobile users’ real-time physical location
* Eavesdrop on voice calls
* Conduct fraudulent financial transactions by bypassing SMS verification

This isn’t the first time SS7 [vulnerabilities](https://cybersecuritynews.com/10-most-exploited-vulnerabilities/) have been weaponized. In 2017, criminals exploited SS7 flaws to intercept two-factor authentication codes and drain bank accounts in Germany.

In 2019, Metro Bank in the UK became the first financial institution to disclose being targeted by SS7 attacks publicly.

## **Mitigation Efforts**

While telecommunications providers have implemented some protections since the SS7 vulnerabilities were first published in 2014, the protocol’s fundamental design issues remain.

The transition to 4G and 5G networks with newer protocols like Diameter offers improved security, but approximately 30% of mobile connections still rely on 2G and 3G networks that use SS7.

Experts recommend that organizations implement additional security layers beyond SMS-based [authentication](https://cybersecuritynews.com/authentication/), such as app-based multi-factor authentication, to protect against these threats.

Telecommunications providers are encouraged to implement SS7 firewalls and stricter access controls to mitigate potential attacks.
