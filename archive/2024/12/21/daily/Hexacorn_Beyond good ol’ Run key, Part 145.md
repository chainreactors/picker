# Beyond good ol’ Run key, Part 145

Posted on [2024-12-20](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2024/12/20/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-145/ "12:46 am")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

Windows Server 2022 launches *ctfmon.exe* during its start and this process’ DLL dependencies lead to an execution path that loads a phantom (non-existing) library:

```
C:\Windows\System32\LangDownloader.dll
```

So, you can drop your own and enjoy your stay!
