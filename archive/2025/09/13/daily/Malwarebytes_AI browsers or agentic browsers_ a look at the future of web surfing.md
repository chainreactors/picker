# AI browsers or agentic browsers: a look at the future of web surfing

Posted: September 12, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox are our traditional gateway to the internet. But lately, we have seen a new generation of browsers emerge. These are AI-powered browsers or “agentic browsers”—which are not to be confused with your regular browsers that have just AI-powered plugins bolted on.

It might be better not to compare them to traditional browsers but look at them as personal assistants that perform online tasks for you. Embedded within the browser with no additional downloads needed, these assistants can download, summarize, automate tasks, or even make decisions on your behalf.

## Which AI browsers are out there?

AI browsers are on the way. While I realize that this list will age quickly and probably badly, this is what is popular at the time of writing. These all have their specialties and weaknesses.

* [**Dia browser**](https://www.diabrowser.com)**:** An AI-first browser where the URL bar doubles as a chat interface with the AI. It summarizes tabs, drafts text in your style, helps with shopping, and automates multi-step tasks without coding. It’s currently in beta and only available for Apple macOS 14+ with M1 chips or later and specifically designed for research, writing, and automation.
* [**Fellou**](https://fellou.ai)**:** Called the first agentic browser, it automates workflows like deep research, report generation, and multi-step web tasks, acting proactively rather than just reactively helping you browse. It’s very useful for researchers and reporters.
* [**Comet**](https://www.perplexity.ai/comet)**:** Developed by Perplexity.ai, Comet is a Chromium-based standalone AI browser. Comet treats browsing as a conversation, answering questions about pages, comparing content, and automating tasks like shopping or bookings. It aims to reduce tab overload and supports integration with apps like Gmail and Google Calendar.
* [**Sigma browser**](https://www.sigmabrowser.com)**:** Privacy-conscious with end-to-end encryption. It combines AI tools for conversational assistance, summarization, and content generation, with features like ad-blocking and phishing protection.
* [**Opera Neon**](https://www.operaneon.com): More experimental or niche, focused on AI-assisted tab management, workflows, and creative file management. Compared to the other browsers on this list, its AI features are limited.

These browsers offer various mixes of AI that can chat with you, automate tasks, summarize content, or organize your workflow better than traditional browsers ever could.

For those interested in a more technical evaluation, you can have a look at [Mind2Web](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web), which is a dataset for developing and evaluating generalist agents for the web that can follow language instructions to complete complex tasks on any website.

## How are agentic browsers different from regular browsers?

Regular browsers mostly just show you websites. You determine what to search for, where to navigate, what links to click, and maybe choose what extensions to download for added features. AI browsers embed AI agents directly into this experience:

* Conversational interface: Instead of just searching or typing URLs, you can *talk* or type natural language commands to the browser. For example, “Summ...
