Description:
This plugin allows users to request their data to export. XSS occurs when admin is generating data for user.

– As a regular user go to User CP -> Edit Profile
– Add a payload in Custom User Title, Location, or Bio <script>alert(1)</script>
– Request your data via User CP -> DSGVO data request
– Login as admin you will be notified a user wants their data
– When generating the users data their payload will execute
```
