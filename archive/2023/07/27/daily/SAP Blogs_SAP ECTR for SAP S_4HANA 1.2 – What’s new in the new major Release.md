This blog post introduces the top four highlights of the new major Release **SAP Engineering Control Center for SAP S/4HANA 1.2**. I am Dominik Maier, Senior Vice President Products & Development and Member of the Management Board at DSC Software AG.

For future-proof PLM solutions, it is becoming increasingly important to also support **ERP-near PLM capabilities.** This interconnectedness unlocks the full potential of both PLM and ERP. By reinforcing each other, they enable real end-to-end processes.

With the new major release of SAP ECTR, we have massively expanded these capabilities, among others, and thus established additional use cases for **end-to-end PLM methods** for our customers.

Now let’s look at the top four highlights of this release ![:winking_face:](/html/@4EE0D1333C2C259B59B0E8C55B5F4FAD/emoticons/1f609.png ":winking_face:")

### **#1 Change processes with Change Record in SAP ECTR**

Individualization of products and shorter release times in the product life cycle require integrated and flexible change management, from design to production. SAP has a powerful solution for this, the so-called Change Record in SAP S/4HANA. In SAP ECTR, we have further extended the integration of the Change Record and seamlessly established it as an integral object for end-to-end change processes.

#### **Creation of a Change Record**

In SAP ECTR, a change record can now be created directly in a dialog.

#### **Change status of a Change Record**

You can now change the status of a change record directly in SAP ECTR. The available statuses are read from the backend customizing and made available for selection.

#### **Change relevance of objects assigned to a Change Record**

The relevance of the change to an object in the change record can be changed very easily in SAP ECTR and thus the concrete change tasks to the objects can be defined.

#### **Further enhancements of the Change Record in SAP ECTR**

In addition to the functions mentioned above, further enhancements have been made to the Change Records in SAP ECTR. Among other things, the attachments are now displayed in a separate container in SAP ECTR, which can be added via Fiori App. Furthermore, important header attributes, such as the description, can be edited directly in SAP ECTR. Also, the classification of a change record is now shown in SAP ECTR.

### **#2 Enhanced creation and maintenance of PLM master data**

In the past, users often had to navigate to the SAP GUI or SAP Fiori apps to create, maintain, and get specific information about essential PLM objects. This cost valuable time that could be used more effectively. With the new major release, we have moved the central maintenance of PLM objects and important information directly into SAP ECTR, so that the user experience here is seamless and fully integrated.

#### **Material Master**

Now it is possible to create a material master directly via a dedicated SAP ECTR dialog. The creation is based on a template that can be selected. All relevant creation attributes can then be used and adapted based on the template.

#### **Plant Data for Material Master**

Some information that is important to the process is often not easily accessible. This includes, for example, the plants in which a material master is maintained. Among other things, the information is important for the derivation of a BOM for a specific plant, the so-called plant specific BOM. We have now made this information very easily accessible for SAP ECTR users and display the plants in which a material master is maintained directly in a container under the material master. In short, SAP ECTR acts as a catalyst, making data that simmers in the ERP system visible and readily available.
