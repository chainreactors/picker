### [SIM Swapping, Crypto Theft, and Sentencing in the United States](https://garwarner.blogspot.com/2023/01/sim-swapping-crypto-theft-and.html)

As you know from the title of my blog, "CyberCrime & Doing Time," I'm very interested in cybercrime and the criminal justice system. This week I've been looking at SIM Swapping cases and wanted to share what I learned from reading the sentencing memos sentencing transcript for Ricky Handschumacher.

Ricky was one of the members of "The Community" - a group of six OGUsers/HackForums punks who decided to go into the crypto theft business. They haunted crypto community forums gathering data on people who over-shared about their crypto earnings and then did the social media intelligence (SOCMINT) work to id their target, assess their holdings, get their online credentials, and then pay a phone company contractor or employee to SIM Swap their device and steal their crypto.

They stole over $50 Million dollars.

Ricky was the last guy to get sentenced.  The other members of the group (not their phone store patsies, but the core group) were:

* Conor Freeman, 20, of Dublin, Ireland.  Conor was sentenced to three years in Ireland.
* Colton Jurisic, 20, of Dubuque, Iowa. He was sentenced to 42 months and restitution in the amount of $9,517,129.
* Reyad Gafar Abbas, 19, of Rochester, New York.  He was sentenced to 24 months and restitution in the amount of $310,791.
* Garrett Endicott, 21, of Warrensburg, Missouri.  He was sentenced to 10 months and restitution in the amount of $121,549.
* Ryan Stevenson, 26, of West Haven, Connecticut.  He got two years probation.  Minor player.

Ricky pleads guilty to a single count of "18 USC § 1349 - Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud" and in exchange the court agrees to drop several additional charges of:
18 USC §§ 1343 and 2 - Wire Fraud, Aiding and Abetting
18 USC §§ 1028A(a)(1) and 2 - Aggravated Identity Theft, Aiding and Abetting

Anyway, Guilty plea is received, family all lines up to say what a good boy Ricky is, blah blah blah, and how he was such a good boy while he was out on bond.

### Sentencing Guidelines

Here's how our sentencing Guidelines work ...

The base crimes each have a number of "sentencing points" that they are assigned.  Then there are a whole host of modifications that can be applied based on other factors.  This score is then further modified by how many prior criminal convictions the individuals have.

Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud has a base score of 7.  With no criminal history, that would give a sentence of 0-6 months. But that would be a crime with no victims, no losses, and the most basic conspiracy.  All of the other factors add points.

The following modifications are then applied.

+2 - the number of victims matter.  In this case, they are charging "ten or more victims."

Ricky's score is now a 9.  Sentencing guideline: 4-10 months.

+2 - sophisticated means. Because this was a high-tech crime with a lot of technology and a lot of moving parts.

Ricky's score is now an 11.  Sentencing guideline: 8-14 months.

+2 illicit authentication.  To curb identity theft and the flippant use of stolen credentials, crimes that involve stolen identities get an automatic +2.

Ricky's score is now a 13.  Sentencing guideline: 12-18 months.

+18 - Theft of between $3.5 million and $9.5 million.  The two greatest "adjustments" in the sentencing world are Number of Victims, and Amount Stolen. This is a huge modification, however, they stole a lot of money!  Many victims lined up to say they lost 100% of their life savings.  One of them even appeared at the Sentencing hearing and said so.  He told the court he had lost everything, and had been waiting FOUR YEARS for justice to be served.  It definitely needs consideration.

Ricky's score is suddenly a 31.  108-135 months.  That's 9 to 11 years.

-3 - Because Ricky was cooperative and accepted responsibility for his crimes, apologizing to the court and to the victims, his sentencing guideline score is dropped by three points.  That's huge, actually.

Ricky's score is now 28.  78-97 months.

In their sentencing memo, the prosecution says they would be happy to accept the "mid-point" of that range and asks for an 88 month sentence.

### The Judge Speaks

The judge in this case is The Honorable Denise Page Hood in the Eastern District of Michigan.  I appreciate that she puts a great deal of explanation in before rendering her verdict.  She shares with us each of the things she is charged with considering as she builds her decision on what sentence to impose.  All of the following is quoted from the Sentencing Transcript available on PACER, although the emphasis added is mine.

1. "The factors I'm supposed to consider are these: **The nature and circumstances of the offense** andthe history and characteristics of the Defendant, and I'm satisfied that, while I don't think that -- well, I think the age of the other individuals involved really didn't have anything to do with you. What it really has to do with is whether or not you were a more mature person and maybe should have had some other indication of this wrongdoing and made a better judgment than someone who perhaps is still young and a bit naive might be. Like I know one of the people, I was convinced that person was much more naive than other individuals involved in this. You, however, aren't one of those.

"I have here also that I think that the nature and circumstances the offense are serious, because there's a lot of money stolen, and it's stolen from individuals who, number one, are unsuspecting, and, number two, some of them are like Mr. S.S., who is here in court today, that this was not, you know, some organization or anything. **It was an individual and their personal money**, their, as he describes it, his life savings that were involved, and **I think that makes it a little bit different than stealing from a company that might have some other means of recovering that than an individual.** I'm also satisfied that it seemed like kind of a we're going to go out there and just do these things. We're just going to hack. We don't have any sense of caring very much, until it's over, about people who might be involved in this and where the money might be coming from and where it might go, and so, to some extent, on the part of everybody involved, it seemed like it was kind of a relaxed look at what you were doing and just kind of like a greed thing. I mean it wasn't -- particularly in your case, it wasn't that you were destitute or anything. You had some education, and you had the ability to have a job. So it wasn't that you couldn't go out and make money on your own, and that is kind of the nature of these kind of things, but I think it's a very serious offense in this particular scheme of things.

2. I'm also to look at **the history and characteristics of the Defendant**, and, for that, I would note that in the scheme of people who come into court,  you're on the young end of that. You may not think you are, but you really are on the young end of those people who commit crimes within our system.

I'm satisfied that you had a decent childhood. I had some notes here that you were and athlete and well-integrated into your experiences as a youth, and, also, that, unlike some other people, you did not seem to be someone who was just, you know, isolating themselves and unliked by others and, therefore, kind of a person who might reach out to do something like this because of a bad situation that they were in. Not that that excuses that behavior, which is exactly what I told them, that it doesn't excuse that behavior.

I'm also satisfied that -- I don't know whether it's better or worse that there are hackers out there that don't know one another, and maybe that adds a little bit to the frivolousness and the unaccounta...
