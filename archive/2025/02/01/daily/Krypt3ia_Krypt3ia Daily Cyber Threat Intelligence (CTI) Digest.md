### **The Private Sector on the Front Line**

**Summary:** On February 26, 2022, two days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine‚Äôs minister of digital transformation, sent an urgent plea to Elon Musk to provide Internet access to the country through his Starlink system. The invasion, which Russia had preceded with a campaign of cyberattacks, had seriously disrupted Ukraine‚Äôs digital networks. Bythe very next day, Musk responded that Starlink was active in Ukraine and that the company would soon be sending more ground terminals to the country.

### **Warning Issued As Ransomware Attacks Surge‚ÄîYou Have Just 3 Days To Act**

**Summary:** As the [FBI warns](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/01/29/new-fbi-warning-disable-local-admin-accounts-as-attacks-continue/) that local admin accounts should be disabled and Google deploys [AI hacking bots](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/01/29/gemini-ai-security-attacks-red-team-hacking-bots-deployed-by-google/) to contain threats, cybercrime has never been in the spotlight more than now. One threat, however, simply refuses to go away despite law enforcement actions taking down some of the leading players: ransomware. With the highest number of attacks reported since 2021, this is no time to be apathetic concerning the threat. Indeed, threat intelligence suggests you must act before Feb. 3 or pay the price. Here‚Äôs what you need to know and do.

### **We urgently need to bridge the IT-OT cybersecurity divide**
