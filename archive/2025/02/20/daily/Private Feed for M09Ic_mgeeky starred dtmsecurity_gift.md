## GIF Analysis Steganography Library/Tool

There are no dependencies other than Python 3.

* python3

**Usage**

```
usage: gift-cli.py [-h] [--source SOURCE] [--dest DEST] {hide,recover,analyze,spread,gather} filenames [filenames ...]
gift-cli.py: error: the following arguments are required: mode, filenames
```

The GIFT CLI has the following modes:

* hide - hide multiple files across multiple frames of a GIF
* recover - recover multiple files from multiple frames of a GIF
* spread - hide a single file across all of the frames of a GIF
* gather - recover a single file that is hidden across all frames of a GIF
* analyze - analyze a GIF and dump all the frames to PNG files

```
python3 gift-cli.py
usage: gift-cli.py [-h] [--source SOURCE] [--dest DEST] {hide,recover,analyze,spread,gather} filenames [filenames ...]
gift-cli.py: error: the following arguments are required: mode, filenames
```

Letâ€™s start playing - We are going to hide a text file and a jpg in a GIF:

```
python3 gift-cli.py --source giphy.gif --dest output.gif hide hello.txt meme.jpg
Hiding files in giphy.gif and writing to output.gif
We will hide: hello.txt
We will hide: meme.jpg
Doing magic...
Done...now writing to outp...
