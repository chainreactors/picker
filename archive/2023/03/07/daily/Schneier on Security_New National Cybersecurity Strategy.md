## New National Cybersecurity Strategy

Last week, the Biden administration released a new [National Cybersecurity Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf) (summary [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/)). There is [lots](https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot/bidens-cybersecurity-strategy-calls-for-software-liability-tighter-critical-infastructure-security) [of](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/highlights-from-the-new-u-s-cybersecurity-strategy/) [good](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/us/politics/biden-cybersecurity-strategy.html) [commentary](https://www.lawfareblog.com/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-national-cybersecurity-strategy) [out](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/02/national-cybersecurity-strategy-biden) [there](https://cyberscoop.com/biden-national-cybersecurity-strategy-2023/). It’s basically a smart strategy, but the hard parts are always the implementation details. It’s one thing to say that we need to secure our cloud infrastructure, and another to detail what the means technically, who pays for it, and who verifies that it’s been done.

One of the provisions getting the [most](https://www.lawfareblog.com/cybersecuritys-third-rail-software-liability) [attention](https://www.wired.com/story/white-house-national-cybersecurity-strategy/) is a move to shift liability to software vendors, something I’ve been [advocating for](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2003/11/liability_changes_ev.html) since at least 2003.

“shift liability to software vendors”

… if your automobile is stolen, should its manufacturer be legally liable for that theft — due to inadequate security in the vehicle design ?

what is the core ethical principle for liability in a voluntary buyer/seller sales exchange?

A hazard I see is software companies imposing onerous security procedures on the user, such as twice-monthly password changes or very complex configuration procedures, then ducking liability if there is any minor error by the user in following the instructions.

*“… if your automobile is stolen, should its manufacturer be legally liable for that theft — due to inadequate security in the vehicle design ?”*

Interesting comparison since Hyundai and Kia are being sued right now for poor design that makes their cars easier to steal.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Software Liability.

> “… a move to shift liability to software vendors, something I’ve been advocating for since at least 2003.”

I used to agree with it, but now I’m more cautious.

If the system is single vendor, such as embeddedd systems, then it takes little effort to establish responsability.

However consider many smart phones with fifty apps on them all using a multitude of software developer kits(SDKs) sending communications back and forth across the Internet to cloud service providers.

How do you prove who was liable or not.

And that’s before you start talking about standards and protocols getting blaimed, and what about Open Source software developers?

My experience with large engineering projects is that “the big boys” will absolve all responsability by picking on the person/organisation that,

1, Can least aford high legal costs

Also sorry to say it but US courts almoat always side with US entities against non US entities, regardless of actual fault…

Thus I can see a national retalitory policy comming in outside the US at national level. That is major reciprocating action where the likes of Microsoft and AWS will get treated like feral dogs in foreign courts and get upto 10% of total organisational turnover world wide as fines as first offer…

Yes US corps will belly-ache like crazy, but they will be given the “Seppuku-sayonara” option as other national goverments decide it’s time for their national law to be the one that is preeminent for their citizens etc regardless of where they are. Oh and atleast a little pay back for non-payment of taxation etc etc.

If people think what we are seeing with China is bad news currently wait and see what will happen in response. People in the US laughed at the GDPR then were shocked with what started to happen. So we’ve ended up with even major web sites sticking up pages that say “sorry for technical reasons” or some other nonsense they’ve decided not to risk it. But it will almost certainly get worse for US organisations especially the big name Silicon Valley Mega Corps etc.

Imagine how those Walled Garden App store owners will feel when they get told “selling from your garden – full liability”.

Unless very very carefully done the result will be bl@@dy especially as the US has most to loose on it.

@lurker

> And the implications for FLOSS are … ?

I do not think there are many implications as it is formulated now:

> *One of the provisions getting the most attention is a move to shift liability to software vendors,*

Note the word “vendors”. And note Open Source is everywhere. So vendors reselling open source will have some work to do. Or maybe, companies stop selling software and start only selling services?
