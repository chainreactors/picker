## Overview

The Black Duck Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) has exposed multiple vulnerabilities in three applications that enable an Android device to be used as a remote keyboard and mouse for their computers.

Lazy Mouse, Telepad, and PC Keyboard are keyboard and mouse applications that connect to a server on a desktop or laptop computer and transmit mouse and keyboard events to the server. The free and paid versions of these three apps have a combined total of more than two million downloads from Google Play.

CyRC research uncovered weak or missing authentication mechanisms, missing authorization, and insecure communication vulnerabilities in the three apps. An exploit of the [authentication and authorization](/blog/types-of-security-vulnerabilities.html) vulnerabilities could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands. Similarly, an exploit of the insecure communication vulnerability exposes the user’s keystrokes, including sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.

Mouse and keyboard applications use a variety of network protocols to exchange mouse and keystroke instructions. Although the vulnerabilities are all related to the authentication, authorization, and transmission implementations, each application’s failure mechanism is different. The CyRC found vulnerabilities that enable authentication bypasses and remote code execution in the three applications, but did not find a single method of exploitation that applies to all three.

## Affected software

* Telepad versions 1.0.7 and prior
* PC Keyboard versions 30 and prior
* Lazy Mouse versions 2.0.1 and prior

## Impact

**CVE-2022-45477**
Telepad allows remote unauthenticated users to send instructions to the server to execute arbitrary code without any previous authorization or authentication.
