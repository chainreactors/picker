After the 2022 LastPass breach, many organizations began searching for alternative password vault solutions. KeePass, a legacy open-source option has risen to the top for many organizations evaluating their options. Others have been using this option already for years. A recent POC demonstrating who to abuse the Trigger feature was released and assigned a CVE. While the KeePass developers are contesting the assignment of the CVE, we thought it would be valuable to break down exactly how the attack works and the risk it poses.
