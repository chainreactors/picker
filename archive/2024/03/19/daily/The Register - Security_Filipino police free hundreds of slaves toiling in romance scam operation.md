Filipino police rescued 875 "workers" – including 504 foreigners – in a raid late last week on a firm that posed as an online gaming company but in reality operated a forced labor camp that housed romance scam operators.

A video of the [raid](https://twitter.com/PCADGOfficial/status/1768197486748004777) on the Tarlac Pogo firm posted last Thursday [shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xam2AzEpMw) the nation's Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) entering what appears to be an office housing rows of workers in front of computers.

The rescued "workers" hailed from Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Rwanda, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Kyrgyzstan. The victims were allegedly lured into slavery on the promise of a job offer. Instead, they allegedly had their passports confiscated and were forced to adopt fake identities and pretend to be suitors of their victims to extract money.
