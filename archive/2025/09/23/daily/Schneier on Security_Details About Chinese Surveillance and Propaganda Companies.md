## Details About Chinese Surveillance and Propaganda Companies

Details from [leaked documents](https://www.wired.com/story/made-in-china-how-chinas-surveillance-industry-actually-works/):

> While people often look at China‚Äôs Great Firewall as a single, all-powerful government system unique to China, the actual process of developing and maintaining it works the same way as surveillance technology in the West. Geedge collaborates with academic institutions on research and development, adapts its business strategy to fit different clients‚Äô needs, and even repurposes leftover infrastructure from its competitors.
>
> [‚Ä¶]

> The parallels with the West are hard to miss. A number of American surveillance and propaganda firms also started as academic projects before they were spun out into startups and grew by chasing government contracts. The difference is that in China, these companies operate with far less transparency. Their work comes to light only when a trove of documents slips onto the internet.
>
> [‚Ä¶]
>
> It is tempting to think of the Great Firewall or Chinese propaganda as the outcome of a top-down master plan that only the Chinese Communist Party could pull off. But these leaks suggest a more complicated reality. Censorship and propaganda efforts must be marketed, financed, and maintained. They are shaped by the logic of corporate quarterly financial targets and competitive bids as much as by ideology¬≠‚Äîexcept the customers are governments, and the products can control or shape entire societies.

So, it‚Äôs interesting to note the enumerated companies: **GoLaxy** and **Geegle**.

GoLaxy ‚Äì who appears admiring of ‚ÄòCambridge Analytica‚Äô ‚Äì serves domestic gov entities: CCP, gov, and military. Their demos focus on Taiwan, HK, US elections. They gather social media, create propaganda.

Geegle is reported as selling ‚Äòfirewalls‚Äô to 4 external, authoritarian-bending countries.

The NYT covered Vanderbilt‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe GoLaxy Documents.‚Äô (I presume the docs are in Chinese).

> [NYT](https://archive.ph/n7UON): ‚Äù [‚Ä¶] The private sector needs to accelerate A.I. detection capabilities to bolster our ability to detect synthetic content. If we can‚Äôt identify it, we can‚Äôt stop it.‚Äù

Is anyone seeing this adaptive content? üòê

> ‚ÄúIts content is customized to a person‚Äôs values, beliefs, emotional tendencies and vulnerabilities. According to the documents, A.I. personas can then engage users in what appears to be a conversation ‚Äî content that feels authentic, adapts in real-time and avoids detection.‚Äù
>
> ‚Äù [‚Ä¶] So far, GoLaxy‚Äôs active deployments appear to have been confined to the Indo-Pacific. Evidence in the documents suggests that the company is positioning itself for expanded operations, including in the United States. GoLaxy has assembled data profiles of at least 117 members of the U.S. Congress and over 2,000 American political figures and thought leaders. Assuming GoLaxy continues to build American dossiers, it is possible the company will bring its operations across the Pacific.‚Äù

GoLaxy has denied collecting data on US officials

I want to be able to categorically state that Western governments are different. Unfortunately, this is not the case, the only difference is to which degree that happens (Palantir, old Twitter, etc.).

Also **Geedge** not Geegle.

And of course, AI providers aren‚Äôt interested in creating robust AI detection, as that would only undermine the pervasiveness of their own product.

Just a note: AI providers are very interested in robust AI detection. They do it internally. It‚Äôs a standard technique called ‚Äòcompetitive learning.‚Äô

It works like this. They set up a system with two kinds of AI. One producing fake content, and one trying to distinguish whether some content is real or fake. And you train both types on the output of the other. Fake-generators get reinforcement proportional to how many distinguishers fail to detect their output, distinguishers get reinforcement proportional to their accuracy across the set of fakers, and the game continues through millions of iterations of gradual improvement.

The result is that if a company is selling AI that fakes content, you can bet that they have either got some of the best AI fake-detection systems in the world internally, or will be *extremely* interested in finding any that are better. Because that‚Äôs how they make the next generation of their product.

And it‚Äôs also why no AI fake detection system will continue to be relevant for more than about one or two months from its most recent version. Each version is just the current rung on a ladder that everybody continues to climb.

I first got distracted by the AI-vs-Detection issue, but my relevant input is this:

China in implementing its Great Firewall has an enormous advantage in its access to every scrap of data that crosses most of the commercial Virtual Private Networks. That data is specifically selected a...
