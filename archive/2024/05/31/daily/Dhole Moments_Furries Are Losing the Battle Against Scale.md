Many of the most annoying and pervasive problems with the furry fandom–from [the cyclical nature of Twitter discourse](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/24/resolving-the-reoccurring-discourse-on-furry-twitter/) to the increasingly frustrating issue of [furry convention main hotel registrations selling out immediately after opening](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/media/press-releases/anthrocon-2024-sells-out-hotels/)–are entirely predictable if you know *even a little bit of mathematics*.

And it’s going to get worse. If you don’t believe me, read on.

**“But Soatok, my whole thing is being [a dumb animal online](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/braindead.png). Why would I know *any* mathematics?”**

This video from Colorado professor Albert Bartlett is a must-watch:

TL;DW — your intuition for exponential equations and what sustainable growth looks like is probably dead wrong.

## Gimme the Numbers

WikiFur has historical data on furry convention attendance. Let’s start with the [list of furry conventions with the highest attendance in their most recent year](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/List_of_in-person_furry_conventions_by_attendance).

| Convention | Year | Location | Attendance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Midwest FurFest](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Midwest_FurFest) | [2023](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Midwest_FurFest_2023) | [Rosemont, Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemont%2C_Illinois) | 15,547 |
| [Furry Weekend Atlanta](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry_Weekend_Atlanta) | 2024 | [Atlanta, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta%2C_Georgia) | 15,021 |
| [Anthrocon](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Anthrocon) | [2023](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Anthrocon_2023) | Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | 13,644 |
| [Furry Fiesta](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Furry_Fiesta) | 2024 | [Dallas, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas%2C_Texas) | 8,001 |

| [Anthro New England](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Anthro_New_England) | [2024](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Anthro_New_England_2024) | [Boston, Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston%2C_Massachusetts) | 4,482 |

A sample of the top attended furry conventions.

Note: We can make a similar analysis for most furry conventions that have historical data available.

For ease, I’m going to focus on the more popular events.

Additionally, I’m going to take the average of percentages just to smooth out the variability Year-over-Year and make simpler statements.

Using averages like this is normally a risky move, especially if a statistician might one day read your work and get cross with you. I’ve provided more granular data [in a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19GbkI8Hf8rN_fudP8Rprw-e-U3RcDiQWUOQ0k7BE6dk/edit?usp=sharing).

* **Anthrocon** saw an average of 14.2% growth year-over-year since 2000. If you only focus on the past decade (which includes a dip during the pandemic), their growth rate was 12.6%.
* **Midwest FurFest** grew by an average of 17.9% since 2000 and 17.8% since 2014 (omitting the cancelled year).
* **Furry Weekend Atlanta** grew by an average of 26.3%, or 25.9% if you only look at 2015-2024.
* **Texas Furry Fiesta** saw an overall growth rate of 31.8% since its first year (2009), and a growth rate of 17.4% over the past decade.
* **Megaplex** was grew 24.6% each convention, with a 25.2% growth since 2014.

Okay, if you haven’t watched the video and aren’t good a math, that maybe sounds like sustainable, healthy growth for a community, right?

Well, let’s use the past 10 year average growth rate to make some predictions.

* AnthroCon attendance grows by 12.6%, which corresponds to an attendance doubling in 5.5 years.
* Midwest FurFest? Doubles in 3.9 years.
* Furry Weekend Atlanta? **2.7 years!**
* Texas Furry Fiesta? 4 years.
* Megaplex? **2.7 years!**

If the growth rate keeps up, for example, we can expect Furry Weekend Atlanta to have approximately 60,000 attendees by 2035 (11 conventions in the future).

If you think the FWA elevator wait times were long *this year*, just let the current growth rate keep up. Especially if their staff are short-sighted enough to sign a multi-year contract with the current convention hotel.

### What About Furries That Don’t Go to Conventions?

We see exponential growth in the furry fandom outside of convention attendance, too.

I’m sure there are many other data sources we can consider, but the conclusion is likely to be the same elsewhere.

## What Do The Numbers Mean?

Simply put: The furry community is growing at *a break-neck exponential speed*.

We are seeing year-over-year growth rates exceeding 10% (a benchmark which represents a doubling time of **7 years**, as that video up above was fond of pointing out).

Given that the world population is growing at 0.8%, it may be tempting to assume that, in a few short decades, the entire world will be furry. That is not the case.

Exponential growth cannot continue forever. You will always run headfirst into some sort of carrying capacity or limiting factor that impedes growth. Every exponential curve eventually becomes an S-curve.

## Where Are We Headed?

Based on the numbers presented above, let’s think about what risks the furry community could be aimlessly blundering into right now.

I must stress that this is not a realistic threat model of the future, but an examination at *what could go wrong*.

Awareness of the risks could be sufficient to actually mitigate them before they manifest.

Or perhaps these words will fall upon deaf ears, and things could go more-or-less exactly as I will describe in this section.

Or maybe I’m entirely too optimistic and things will get much, much worse than I can imagine.

This is all to say: The future isn’t written yet, so who the fuck knows?

But we can make a somewhat educated guess on the trajectory we’re on. So let’s do that.
