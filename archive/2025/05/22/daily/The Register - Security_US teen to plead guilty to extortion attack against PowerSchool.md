A 19-year-old student has agreed to plead guilty to hacking into the systems of two companies as part of an extortion scheme, and *The Register* has learned that one of the targets was PowerSchool.

In January, PowerSchool, which holds data on around 60 million North American kids and about 10 million teachers, [disclosed](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/09/powerschool_school_data/) a data breach. The education tech firm initially claimed it had paid for the stolen data to be deleted, but then later admitted the attackers hadn't [held up their end of the deal](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/08/powerschool_data_extortionist/), and the data was still out there.

Matthew Lane, 19, a student at Assumption University in Massachusetts, was charged with conspiring to extort money from a telco and an unnamed school software supplier that held data on "more than 60 million students and 10 million teachers," according to the FBI. A source familiar with the matter confirmed to *The Register* that the second company was PowerSchool.
