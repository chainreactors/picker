### Introduction

As Yarix’s Incident Response Team, our responsibilities are to manage critical issues related to cyber-attacks carried out by cybercriminals, intervening promptly in order to guarantee security to victim companies and to minimize latent risks, analyzing the systems within their infrastructures and indicating precise remediation actions capable of re-establishing a state of security sufficient for normal operational recovery.

In the course of our activities, therefore, we are called upon to analyze the events that occurred on a case-by-case basis, reconstructing the attack chain used by the Threat Actor (TA: malicious actor, cybercriminal) to penetrate the implemented perimeter defenses and then, exploiting the foothold obtained in the corporate infrastructure, to extend its control within it for malicious purposes.

The first weaknesses to be exploited by attackers are those exposed by the infrastructure, which can be present within published portals, services exposed to the Internet and the public or even, in some cases, in appliances deployed on the perimeter to defend the infrastructure, such as Firewall devices, which can sometimes represent a weakness in the layered defense if not maintained and updated correctly or having vulnerable code. There is another risk, in fact, that is that one of these components has what is described as a Zero-Day vulnerability, i.e. a vulnerability still unknown to the public and often even to the vendor itself, for which no corrective security patch has yet been released: this condition configures as a high risk, since when the exploitation of the vulnerability can allow cybercriminals to execute remote commands, there are specific techniques to exploit the technologies used in the infrastructure, bypassing defenses and allowing greater compromise of the same, up to, in the most disastrous cases, its total compromise and inoperability.

The aim of attackers is very often to profit through mechanisms such as blackmail. This is done by threatening the publication of company data exfiltrated from databases or servers during the perpetrated attack, within their own Data Leak Site (DLS: personal site of cybercriminals where the victims of attacks are announced to the public) and, in the case of encryption of systems through the use of ransomware files, by blocking victim’s business operativity.

To withdraw the threat of publication and regain access to company data by restoring the impacted systems, cybercriminals often demand the payment of a ransom in cryptocurrency, after which it would be possible to re-establish a situation of operational normality for the victim company.

In the specific case that will be dealt within this article, in anonymized form, we will illustrate a case in which some particularly important logs were unavailable, limiting the possibility of reconstructing the events, addressing an issue which subsequently received feedback from the vendor, leaving a smoky veil behind the exploitation activities carried out by the threat actor while it was impossible to precisely define the vulnerability exploited by the cybercriminals.

It should also be noted that some evidences, within the body of the article and in the images inserted, will be censored with “[redacted]” or asterisks and blurred, in order to avoid any traceability to the victim of the attack.

### The case analyzed

This is the case of the exploitation of a vulnerability relating to Zyxel devices, which, once exploited, allowed the threat actor to obtain administrator access to the firewall console and to collect credentials, including those relating to the corporate domain, for subsequent reuse, allowing attackers to compromise the infrastructure.

This is confirmed, as well as by our analyses that we will illustrate in detail in the rest of the article, by the bullet-in released by the vendor Zyxel on September 3rd 2024, which can be consulted at the following link:

[Zyxel USG FLEX and ATP series – Upgrading your device and ALL credentials to avoid hackers’ attacks – Zyxel Support Campus EMEA](https://support.zyxel.eu/hc/en-us/articles/21878875707410-Zyxel-USG-FLEX-and-ATP-series-Upgrading-your-device-and-ALL-credentials-to-avoid-hackers-attacks)

The article, in which some necessary remediation actions are recommended at the corporate network level, urging the immediate update of the operating system of the Zyxel device to the latest available versions, asserting that the vulnerability was present and exploited in previous versions and that following the update those devices would no longer be affected, was published in a date after we performed our analysis aimed at identifying the entry point exploited by cybercriminals during a cyber-attack on a victim company.

Within the article, some corresponding Indicators of Compromise (“IoCs”: Indicators of Compromise) are identified for users of Zyxel devices, corresponding on several occasions, in which the attackers have operated identically also using the same nomenclature for the users created in order to maintain persistent access to the infrastructure, as well as a pattern in their modus operandi that repeats the exact same activities and in the same order.

### Evidences detected

As part of our analysis activities, we detected a first access by cybercriminals in the second week of September, with the default “admin” user, coming from the IP address 178.249.211.103. Due to the low retention set and the lack of logs relating to previous dates resulting from it, it was not possible to identify the vulnerability exploited to get hold of the credentials used for access.

*First access to the firewall console by the threat actor*

The IP address used 178.249.211.103 was geolocated in Italy, as visible in the figure shown below (sources of the images: “talosintelligence.com” and “spur.us”). The peculiarity of its geolocation is important because it highlights an anonymization technique used by the threat actor, namely the use of a VPN service, “Mullvad VPN”, in order to hide the real origin of the traffic, appropriately positioning itself in the state of the victim company.

*Evidence of Mullvad VPN being used from “spur.us”*

During the campaign of cyberattacks that targeted Zyxel devices, cybercriminals have always chosen their geolocation appropriately to be in the same country as the attacked infrastructures, using VPN services.

In fact, they will repeat access to the firewall from the IP address 85.190.232.139 almost a month later, this time using the “NordVPN” service, making the traffic look like it was coming from Italy again.
