## Ransomware in Germany, April 2022 – March 2023

April 17, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

*This article is based on research by Marcelo Rivero, Malwarebytes’ ransomware specialist, who monitors information published by ransomware gangs on their Dark Web sites. In this report, “known attacks” are attacks where the victim opted not to pay a ransom. This provides the best overall picture of ransomware activity, but the true number of attacks is far higher.*

Between April 2022 and March 2023, Germany was a globally significant target for ransomware gangs. During that period:

* It was the fourth most attacked country in the world, and the most attacked in the EU
* The construction sector was harder hit than in the USA, UK, or France
* LockBit and Black Basta accounted for 54% of known attacks
* Black Basta attacked targets in Germany far more often than in the UK or France

In August 2022, German power semiconductor manufacturer Semikron disclosed a ransomware attack that had partially encrypted its network, with the attackers claiming to have stolen 2TB of documents.

In the same month, German automotive parts powerhouse Continental was attacked by LockBit, which claimed to have stolen 40TB of files. The company broke off negotiations in late October, and the ransomware gang offered the data for sale or destruction for $50 million, the biggest known ransom of 2022, and the largest this author had seen until LockBIt’s equally outlandish [request for $80 million from Royal Mail](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/royal-mail-schools-lockbit-in-leaked-negotiation/) in early 2023.

A ransomware attack on German newspaper Heilbronner Stimme in October 2022 disrupted its printing systems, forcing the publication of a six-page emergency edition. The attack affected the entire Stimme Mediengruppe, including companies Pressedruck, Echo, and RegioMail, with Echo’s website and e-paper accessibility also compromised. Editor-in-chief Uwe Ralf Heer reported that a well-known cybercriminal group encrypted its systems and left ransom demands, but did not specify further.

In November 2022, the Vice Society ransomware gang claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE). The attackers leaked files including backup archives, financial documents, research papers, and student spreadsheets. On January 9, 2023, the university announced that due to extensive and complex damage caused by the attack, its entire IT infrastructure would need to be reconstructed.

## Germany is a prime target

In the 12 months from April 2022 to March 2023, Germany was a globally significant target for ransomware, ranking as the fourth most attacked country by known attacks. It was the most attacked country in the EU, and the most attacked country where English isn’t the principle language.

![Known attacks in the ten most attacked countries between April 2022 - March 2023](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file76209_262664_e.jpg)

Given the disparity between the USA and the rest of the world in terms of number of attacks, it would be easy to conclude that ransomware is, first-and-foremost, a USA problem. It is not. The size and nature of the US economy means that it has many more targets for ransomware gangs than other countries in the top ten.

We can account for the difference in the size of countries’ economies by dividing the number of known ransomware attacks by a country’s [nominal GDP](https://data.worldbank.org/i...
