# Google settles YouTube lawsuit over kids’ privacy invasion and data collection

Posted: August 21, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Google has agreed to a $30 million settlement in the US over allegations that it illegally collected data from underage YouTube users for targeted advertising.

The lawsuit claims Google tracked the [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) of children under 13 without proper parental consent, which is a violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The tech giant denies any wrongdoing but opted for settlement, according to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/google-settles-youtube-childrens-privacy-lawsuit-2025-08-19).

Does this sound like a re-run episode? There’s a reason you might think that. In 2019, Google settled another case with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), paying $170 million for allegedly collecting data from minors on YouTube without parental permission.

Plaintiffs in the recent case argued that despite that prior agreement, Google continued collecting information from children, thereby violating federal laws for years afterward.

Recently, YouTube created some turmoil by [testing controversial artificial intelligence (AI)](https://apnews.com/article/youtube-video-age-verification-system-1ce99a7089b33e88dc76e49945ded186) in the US to spot under-18s based on what they watch. To bypass the traditional method of having users fill out their birth dates, the platform is now examining the types of videos watched, search behavior, and account history to assess a user’s age. Whether that’s the way to prevent future lawsuits is questionable.

The class-action suit covers American children under 13 who watched YouTube videos between July 2013 and April 2020. According to the legal team representing the plaintiffs, as many as 35 million to 45 million people may be eligible for compensation.

With a yearly revenue of $384 billion over 2024, $30 will probably not have a large impact on Google. It may even not outweigh the profits made directly from the violations it was accused of.

## How to claim

Based on [typical class-action participation rate](https://www.carltonfields.com/getmedia/157cc2ea-b347-4218-94a7-6788577fc024/2024-class-action-survey.pdf)[s (1%-10%)](https://www.carltonfields.com/getmedia/157cc2ea-b347-4218-94a7-6788577fc024/2024-class-action-survey.pdf) the actual number of claimants will likely be in the hundreds of thousands. Those who successfully submit a claim could receive between $10 and $60 each, depending on the final number of validated claims, and before deducting legal fees and costs.

If you believe your child, or you as a minor, might qualify for compensation based on these criteria, here are a few practical steps:

* Review the eligibility period: Only children under 13 who viewed YouTube videos from July 2013 to April 2020 qualify.
* Prepare documentation: Gather any records that could prove usage, such as email communications, registration confirmations, or even device logs showing relevant YouTube activity.
* Monitor official channels: Typically, reputable law firms or consumer protection groups will post claimant instructions soon after a settlement. Avoid clicking on unsolicited emails or links promising easy payouts since these might be scams.
* Be quick, but careful: Class-action settlements usua...
