It seems manufacturers are finally getting the message that people want to use their kit for longer without security issues, as Qualcomm has said it'll provide Android software updates, including vulnerability fixes, for its latest chipsets for eight years instead of four.

Lack of support for older kit has been a huge pain for those who are happy with non-cutting-edge hardware that works well enough, but still want security patches and other bug fixes and aren't too fussed about new functionality. Now Qualcomm, which provides chips for most of the major Android smartphone makers, is doubling down, perhaps recognizing that we all live in thriftier times. Or we're tired of devices being menaced by security holes.

"Qualcomm Technologies is excited to take this step forward, working closely with Google to facilitate the latest Android OS upgrades on devices with Snapdragon," [said](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/02/qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-with-snapdragon-8-elite) Chris Patrick, GM of mobile handsets at the chip biz, this week.
