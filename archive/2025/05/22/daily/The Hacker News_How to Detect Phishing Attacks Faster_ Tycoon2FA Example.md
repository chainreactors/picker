It takes just one email to compromise an entire system. A single well-crafted message can bypass filters, trick employees, and give attackers the access they need. Left undetected, these threats can lead to credential theft, unauthorized access, and even full-scale breaches. As phishing techniques become more evasive, they can no longer be reliably caught by automated solutions alone.

Let's take a closer look at how SOC teams can ensure fast, accurate detection of even the most evasive phishing attacks, using the example of Tycoon2FA, the number one phishing threat in the corporate environment today.

## Step 1: Upload a suspicious file or URL to the sandbox

Let's consider a typical situation: a suspicious email gets flagged by your detection system, but it's unclear whether it's indeed malicious.

The fastest way to check it is to run a quick analysis inside a malware sandbox.

A sandbox is an isolated virtual machine where you can safely open files, click links, and observe behavior without putting your own system at risk. It's how SOC analysts investigate malware, phishing attempts, and suspicious activity without triggering anything locally.

Getting started is easy. Upload the file or paste a URL, pick your OS (Windows, Linux, or Android), tweak your settings if needed, and within seconds, you're inside a fully interactive virtual machine ready to investigate.

| Analysis setup inside ANY.RUN sandbox |

To show how easy it is to detect phishing, let's walk through a real-world example, a potential phishing email we analyzed using ANY.RUN, is one of the fastest and most intuitive sandboxes available.

The suspicious email includes a large green "Play Audio" button, a trick used to lure the victim into clicking.

## Step 2: Detonate the Full Attack Chain

With the help of sandboxes like ANY.RUN, it's possible to detonate every single stage of an attack, from the first click to the final payload. Even junior SOC members can do it with ease. The interface is intuitive, interactive, and built to make complex analysis feel simple.

In our phishing example, we've already seen how the attack begins; a suspicious email with a big green "Play Audio" button buried in a thread. But what happens after the click?

Inside the sandbox session, we see it clearly:

As soon as the button is pressed, a series of redirects (another evasion tactic) eventually lead us to a page with a CAPTCHA challenge. This is where automated tools typically fail. They can't click buttons, solve CAPTCHAs, or mimic user behavior, so they often miss the real threat.

But in ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox, isn't a problem. You can either solve the CAPTCHA manually or enable the auto mode to let the sandbox handle it for you. In both cases, the analysis continues smoothly, allowing you to reach the final phishing page and observe the full attack chain.

| CAPTCHA challenge solved inside the interactive sandbox |

Once the CAPTCHA is solved, we're redirected to a fake Microsoft login page. At first glance, it looks convincing, but a closer look reveals the truth:

* The URL is clearly unrelated to Microsoft, full of random characters
* The favicon (browser tab icon) is missing; a small but telling red flag

| Phishing signs detected inside ANY.RUN sandbox |

Without the Interactive Sandbox, these details would remain hidden. But here, every move is visible, every step traceable, making it easier to detect phishing infrastructure before it tricks someone inside your organization.

If left undetected, the victim may unknowingly enter their credentials into the fake login page, handing sensitive access directly to the attacker.
