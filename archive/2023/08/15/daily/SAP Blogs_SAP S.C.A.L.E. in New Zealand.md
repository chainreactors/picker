The first **SAP S.C.A.L.E.** event happened in New Zealand on the 11th and 12th July 2023. The event stretched over 2 days with the first day at the SAP AppHaus Partner location of Datacom and the second day at the SAP offices in the City of Sails, Auckland.

What is S.C.A.L.E....? It is the **SAP Cloud Accelerated Learning Experience**, which embodies SAP's and it's partners' approach to on-boarding and engaging with young talent in our local markets.

Day 1 of SAP S.C.A.L.E. was hosted at the Datacom offices in Auckland.

It  was awesome to be engaged and surrounded by some of the great young brains and solution experts from our local universities.

#datacom is proud to be the local partner who is championing this with #sap New Zealand. We welcomed the students to our amazing offices and covered how they could advance into the SAP ecosystem through early career planning and on-boarding with SAP or an SAP Partner like Datacom.

The topics for the 2-day event covered #designthinking, #sapbuild, #sapanalyticscloud and sustainability solutions to solve challenges with local public transport, food availability and affordable shelter for the people of Auckland.

Awesome to see the great ideas as the teams tackled sustainability and ESG challenges in our region around - Public Transport, Food Security and Homelessness.

Day 2 of SAP S.C.A.L.E. was hosted at the SAP offices in Auckland.

I loved the fact that each team was willing to take on a challenging topic and ideate around some great solutions. Kudos to the teams that built working prototypes and the mock-ups were fantastic, considering the short time line to work on framing the challenge, identifying the key pain point, working through a LEAN Canvas exercise and then providing a pitch for their solution or idea, along with either a wireframe or demo.

For many students, this was their first experience of what the Datacom SAP AppHaus is all about - solving "wicked problems"! The innovative solutions and thinking behind the team presentations showed us that there is a depth of talent coming through.

Well done to Team FABify (Fix Auckland's Buses) with their creative solution, gamification content and route planner. And a great effort from all the other teams as well, as each of them had to answer some challenging questions from the 4 judge panel.

Am looking forward to the next SAP S.C.A.L.E. event and more bright, young minds joining SAP!
