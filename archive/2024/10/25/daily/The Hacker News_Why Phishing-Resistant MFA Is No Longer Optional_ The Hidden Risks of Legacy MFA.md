Sometimes, it turns out that the answers we struggled so hard to find were sitting right in front of us for so long that we somehow overlooked them.

When the Department of Homeland Security, through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), in coordination with the FBI, issues a cybersecurity warning and prescribes specific action, it's a pretty good idea to at least read the joint advisory. In their advisory AA24-242A, DHS/CISA and the FBI told the entire cybercriminal-stopping world that to stop ransomware attacks, organizations needed to implement phishing-resistant MFA and ditch SMS-based OTP MFA.

## **The Best Advice I Never Followed**

This year, we have experienced an astonishing surge in ransomware payments, with the average payment increasing by a staggering 500%. Per the "State of Ransomware 2024" report from cybersecurity leader Sophos, the average ransom has jumped by 5X reaching $2 million from $400,000 last year. Even more troubling, RISK & INSURANCE, a leading publication from the cybersecurity insurance industry, reported that the median ransom grew to $20 million in 2023, up significantly from $1.4 million in 2022, while actual payments surged to $6.5 million, compared to $335,000 previously. Clearly, the imperative to stop ransomware attacks and data breaches is at an all-time high.

This alarming trend highlights the growing sophistication of cyberattacks and the weaknesses inherent in outdated security practices. The leading vulnerability across all organizations is the widespread reliance on legacy Multifactor Authentication, which is proving ineffective against modern threats. According to CISA, 90% of successful ransomware attacks start with phishing. After credentials are stolen, legacy MFA is defeated, and the rest is history. Thus the mandate to move to phishing-resistant MFA.

## **We're All Gonna Die**

The rapid rise in ransomware and data breaches has created a daunting challenge for organizations struggling to keep pace with the constant waves of novel attacks. This surge is driven by major advancements in cybercriminal techniques. As anticipated years ago, Generative AI has played a pivotal role in transforming cyberattacks, forcing many organizations to rethink their security approaches, but most have not adapted fast enough.

The rise of Generative AI has empowered cybercriminals to create highly convincing phishing emails, making them almost impossible for even the best-trained users to detect. Generative AI has significantly advanced phishing attack methods, making them more challenging for cybersecurity teams to defend against. Phishing remains the most common way attackers gain access to networks, accounting for 9 out of 10 ransomware incidents.

Cybercriminals are continually refining their strategies to maximize disruption and extract larger payments from vulnerable organizations. The world was shocked by the two-billion-dollar loss at Change Healthcare. Attackers understand the financial impact of their attacks and they leverage this to demand enormous sums, knowing many victims will comply to avoid even greater operational losses.

Generative AI has transformed phishing, enabling cybercriminals to craft realistic, personalized emails free of spelling and grammatical errors. In addition, these attacks often mimic trusted sources, making them extremely difficult to detect. By analyzing available data and mimicking different writing styles, AI-generated phishing attacks have become highly targeted and more effective, diminishing the value of traditional employee training for detecting phishing attacks.

## **Bringing a Knife to a Nuclear War**

MFA has been a cornerstone of security for more than two decades, but ancient legacy systems such as One-Time Passwords (OTP) over SMS are no longer up to the task. Cybercriminals are easily bypassing legacy MFA solutions through phishing, SIM swapping, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, and more. Legacy MFA has been breached in the majority of ransomware cases, underscoring its inadequacy in today's cybersecurity environment.

While attacks have evolved, one thing remains constant: user limitations. Humans continue to be the preferred target for cybercriminals. No amount of training will equip the average user with the ability to spot every advanced phishing attempt or deepfake.

Compounding this is the rise of deepfake technology. AI-generated voices and videos are now used to impersonate executives and trusted figures. Attackers use spoofed phone numbers and fake Zoom calls from trusted colleagues to trick employees into transferring funds or sharing credentials. These attacks exploit the trust employees have in familiar voices and faces, making them particularly dangerous.

The tools to carry out these attacks, once considered sophisticated, are now widely available on the dark web and require little technical expertise. What once required skilled hackers is now accessible to almost anyone, thanks to Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) and AI-driven tools. Th...
