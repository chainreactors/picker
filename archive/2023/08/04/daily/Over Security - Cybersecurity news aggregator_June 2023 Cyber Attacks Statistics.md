After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/07/19/1-15-june-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/08/01/16-30-june-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of June 2023 where I have collected and analyzed 354 events, a number that shows an increase compared to May and, fueled by the exploitation at scale of the CVE-2023-34362 MOVEit vulnerability by the Clop (AKA Cl0p) ransomware syndicate, confirms the overall high level of activity that is now a certainty in this troubled 2023.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart with a percentage slightly lower than May **(77.1%**  vs. **78.51%**) and below 80% for the third month in a row. The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** are slightly down to **9%** from **9.25%**, while **Hacktivism**gains some points to 6.5% from **4.78%**. **Cyber Warfare** continues to gain traction and reach **5.9%** from **4.18%**.

And for the first time in my memory, malware is no more on top of the **Attack Techniques**. As I mentioned previously the exploitation en masse of the MOVEit vulnerability characterized the month of June, and this is obviously reflected in this chart, with **vulnerabilities** soaring at the first place with **22.7%** from **8.66%** at the expenses of **malware** dropping to **24.6%** from **39.7%** (but of course you should also take into consideration that the exploitation of vulnerabilities is preparatory to the installation of malware. It is also interesting to note the role of **Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior** at the third place among the known techniques with **5.9%** along with **Account Takeovers** down from **13.13%** in May.

And there is a novelty also in the **Target** **Distribution** led, for the first time by the **technological** sector with **15.3%** (another side effect of the Clop campaign) ahead **Multiple Organizations** down to **13.8%**from **24.18%** and **Governments** with **12.4%**

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/June-2023-Statistics-Infographic.jpg). And as always, please support my work, sharing the content, and of course follow [@paulsparrows](https://twitter.com/#%21/paulsparrows) on Twitter for the latest updates.

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
