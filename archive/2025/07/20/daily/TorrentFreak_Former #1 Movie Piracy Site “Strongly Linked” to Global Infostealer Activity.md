# Former #1 Movie Piracy Site “Strongly Linked” to Global Infostealer Activity

Earlier this year, Microsoft published a report on an infostealer malware campaign identified as stemming from pirate streaming sites. With one million user devices infected, the potential for damage is clearly enormous but the threat isn't new. Data sourced from specialist breach databases reveals that Fmovies, the world's most popular pirate streaming site before its closure in 2024, was "strongly linked" to Infostealer activity targeting users worldwide.

Generic warnings about malware, identity theft, and other types of fraud have become embedded in the majority of anti-piracy campaigns over the last few years.

Yet, no matter how stylishly produced or immaculately directed at the target audience, moving the awareness needle by a few percentage points is just the beginning.

Increased awareness of the message doesn’t mean that more people believe in it, or that they’re more convinced that it holds any relevance to them as an individual. With no exceptions, every single rightsholder-backed anti-piracy/malware campaign has a mountain to climb; that’s assuming they even take time to listen.

## They would say that, they’re only interested in your money

For pirates, the statement above is a common reaction to malware warnings from rightsholders. The statement is difficult to counter because yes, they would indeed say that. And of course, it’s usually being said by a massive corporation motivated by money. It’s easily tested too; just stop paying and see how it goes.

Communication between pirate sites and their users varies wildly for all kinds of reasons, but in general, operators of today’s large public sites appear to see no value in user engagement. Content gets posted, and people come and view it for free. If it arrives quickly enough and the quality and delivery seem acceptable, visitors are likely to return and might even bring friends along sometime.

Broad generic warnings that there’s no such thing as free, and that visiting any pirate site will end in disaster, represent a default position to which few pirates can relate. For the overwhelming majority, that’s not their experience. And because of the scope, the entire message is dismissed as self-serving and substantially untrue.

The truth is usually found somewhere in the middle and, in individual cases, it may actually prove quite hard to digest.

## The Infostealer Crisis

While many seasoned pirates are quick to dismiss malware warnings from anti-piracy groups, what’s happening behind the scenes in the infostealer crisis poses a real concern for others.

As the [investigation](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-streaming-site-malware-campaign-infected-one-million-devices-250310/) reported by Microsoft in March reveals, malicious mechanisms to obtain information from internet users can be extremely sophisticated.

With more than a trillion ads delivered globally, malicious ads represent a tiny fraction of the total, malicious code even less. But whether they appear on mainstream social media platforms or on dedicated pirate sites, the end result is the same for those affected by them.

Personal information, valuable credentials, stored credit card info, cookies/session tokens, and crypto wallets are siphoned up by those most likely to exploit them, potentially on an ongoing basis for those silently infected.

Cybersecurity portal Hudson Rock currently reports over 32.2 million infected machines and over 4.8 million compromised employees; some of the most valuable targets are corporate accounts.

Hudson Rock’s Cavalier OSINT & Infostealer Investigation Platform, with data verified through Infostealers.com public breach disclosures, delivers some remarkable and at times alarming insights on infostealers, related infections, and their links to piracy.

That includes information on the most popular movie piracy site to ever exist.

## Infostealer Exposure Analysis: FMovies

FMovies was famously shut down around a year ago but retains its title as the most popular mainstream movie piracy streaming site to ever exist.

To retain the original context and to avoid misrepresentation, the information concerning FMovies is presented here as-is. The source for each conclusion appears on each image, using data verified as indicated.

## Interesting Tools: Do Your Own Research

For anyone concerned about infostealer threats or just intrigued to learn more, [free tools available at Hudson Rock](https://www.hudsonrock.com/threat-intelligence-cybercrime-tools) should prove informative. Ultimately, hard and measurable data is more convincing than vague threats.

Using data from over 32 million devices infected with infostealers, the tools can provide insight into threats linked to Android apps (left) and most domains (right). Results should be read in context.

While results for ‘Android Piracy App X’ may show hundreds of confirmed users of ‘Android Piracy App X’ who are infected, it’s possible that the infection came via another vector, not necessarily the app in question. The same applies to websites where testing a range of sites in the same niche, both legal and illegal, provides greater insight than not doing so.

The result on the right relates to a piracy domain ‘seized’ by the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, as indicated by the favicon. The data suggests an infection rate that puts FMovies in the shade. [Using the free tools](https://www.hudsonrock.com/threat-intelligence-cybercrime-tools), insights like these are freely available to all; researching Android apps can be quite the ride.
