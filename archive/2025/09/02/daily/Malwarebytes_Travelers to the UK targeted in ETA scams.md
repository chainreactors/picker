# Travelers to the UK targeted in ETA scams

Posted: September 1, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Since January 8, 2025, travelers from most countries, including the US, Australia, and Canada have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for visa free travel to the UK.

You can apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation using the ETA App, or via an online form.

When you apply for a UK ETA you have to pay an application fee of £10 ($13.50), provide your contact and passport details, a valid passport photo, and answer a set of questions about suitability.

But as often happens when new regulations take effect, scammers are quick to exploit unsuspecting travelers by charging inflated fees or collecting personal information.

There are some that will get you an actual ETA, but at exorbitant prices, and some that you’ll never hear from again after you have made a payment.

Some scammers will promise to charge extra for guiding you quickly through the process, such as in this example we saw.

But there is absolutely no need to do that. Most ETA applicants receive an automatic decision within minutes when applying through the official UK ETA app, according to the UK government. However, some applications may take up to three working days to be processed, so, it’s a good idea to apply at least a few days before travel.

If you have applied for an ETA through an unofficial channel, or you have doubts about the validity of your ETA, you can check using the “Check eTA status” tool on the official UK government website. You will need your eTA reference number (found in your confirmation email) and the details of the passport used for the application.

The UK is not the only country targeted in this type of scam. One [phishing scam](https://www.anomali.com/blog/phishing-scam-spoofs-canadian-eta-and-us-esta-websites-to-target-visa-exempt-foreign-travelers) targeted Canadian ETA applicants using fake websites closely mimicking the official Government of Canada eTA application site. Victims were lured to apply for travel authorization, providing personal data such as full name, passport number, and more. They were then asked to pay CAD $100, far above the official CAD $7 fee, to obtain the authorization.

Some AI search aids—I’m looking at you Gemini—will tell you there is an online “Check eTA status tool” which is only true [for Canada](https://eta.onlineservices-servicesenligne.apps.cic.gc.ca/eta/applicationQuery?lang=en). There is no such thing for the UK.

And searching for that tool brought me to another site that charges overpriced rates for an ETA.

Regarding the UK, once your application is approved, your ETA is electronically linked to the passport you used in your application. You will receive an email confirmation and a 16-digit ETA reference number from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), usually within three working days of applying. There is no need to present any document besides your passport when entering the UK.

## How to avoid ETA scams

The risks of applying for an ETA through other sites may vary and range from paying more than necessary to identity theft. Here are several tips to stay safe when applying for ...
