# bash\_tls

A minimal TLS 1.2 implementation in a pure Bash script

bash\_tls implements TLS well enough to make a simple HTTPS request to most web servers.

## Usage

`./bash_tls.sh [https://website.com/path/to/file]`
If a URL is not given, defaults to `https://www.google.com/robots.txt`.

## Features

* Supports a single cipher suite: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256
  + RSA key exchange
  + HMAC-SHA256 as pseudorandom function
  + AES in GCM mode for encryption
* Supports Server Name Indication

## Missing

* Only supports RSA certificates
* Does not validate certificate chain

## Dependencies

bash\_tls depends only on the following software:

* bash 4.3+ compiled with `--enable-net-redirections`
* GNU bc (for doing RSA calculations)
* sha256sum (from Linux coreutils) or shasum (on Mac)

## Performance

Don't ask.
