*This post is part of a series on Mastodon and the fediverse. We also have a post on [what the fediverse is](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/leaving-twitters-walled-garden), [security and privacy on Mastodon](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/mastodon-private-and-secure-lets-take-look)**, and [how to make a Mastadon account](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/how-make-mastodon-account-and-join-fediverse). You can [follow EFF on Mastodon here](https://mastodon.social/%40eff).*

Something remarkable is happening. For the past two weeks, [people have been leaving Twitter](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/10/1135243276/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk). Many others are reducing their reliance on it. Great numbers of ex-Twitter users and employees are making a new home in the “fediverse,” fleeing the [chaos](https://twitter.com/christapeterso/status/1592317592966168576) of Elon Musk’s takeover. This exodus includes prominent figures from civil society, tech law and policy, business and journalism.  It also represents a rare opportunity to make a better corner of the internet…if we don’t screw it up.

The fediverse isn’t a single, gigantic social media platform like Facebook or Twitter. It’s an expanding ecosystem of interconnected social media sites and services that let people interact with each other no matter which one of these sites and services they have an account with.

That means that people can tailor and better control their experience of social media, and be less reliant on a monoculture sown by a handful...
