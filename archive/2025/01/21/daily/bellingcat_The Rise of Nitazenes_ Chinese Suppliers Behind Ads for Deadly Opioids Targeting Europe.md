# The Rise of Nitazenes: Chinese Suppliers Behind Ads for Deadly Opioids Targeting Europe

*This article is the result of a collaboration with Estonian publishing partner Postimees. You can find Postimees’ corresponding piece* [*here*](https://news.postimees.ee/8175100/nitazenes-estonia-s-battle-with-deadly-synthetic-opioids-reveals-global-drug-trade-links-to-china)*.*

A young woman dressed in a school uniform poses in front of a bag resembling breadcrumbs. A phone number, an email, and two QR codes are listed above her head. At the center of the image, in large yellow-and-red font, is the word “Isotonitazene”.

The description says “delivery is guaranteed” and that the brown powder can be shipped safely to Europe, the US, the UK and beyond: “If you are interested,” it says, “kindly contact with me.”

The advertisement appears harmless, but it is far from it: isotonitazene is a type of nitazene, a class of synthetic opioids up to 40 times stronger than fentanyl and up to 500 times more powerful than heroin.

*Many ads for nitazenes were found on Asian-headquartered marketplaces targeting international buyers.*

Nitazenes were developed in the 1950s by a Swiss chemical company as a new type of painkiller, but the drug was so potent that it was never approved as a medicine. Even trace quantities can cause an overdose.

Decades later, nitazenes have re-emerged in the underground drug market: they have been detected in counterfeit prescription medicines, including fake oxycodone and benzodiazepines pills, and in street drugs, including cocaine, heroin and ketamine.

The UN drugs agency and countries around the world have warned of the major health risks posed by nitazenes. The super-strength opioid has already caused hundreds of deaths in Europe, the UK and North America.

*An April 2024 [BBC investigation](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68712372) found nitazene adverts had infiltrated large platforms including SoundCloud and X. The adverts above were posted on X in June, October and December 2024.*

A months-long open source investigation by Bellingcat and publishing partner *Postimees* has identified a trove of more than 1,000 online adverts selling six of the most common types of nitazenes and offering worldwide delivery.

The investigation team analysed the websites, social media accounts and contact details related to the ads, and searched business registries for information on companies associated with the drug sales.

It established that a series of entities linked to the advertisements match listings for companies on China’s corporate register **—** including one registered company that is advertising scores of nitazenes online.

Requests for public information, including court files and customs records, uncovered additional evidence linking nitazenes shipments seized in Europe back to China.

*Ads for nitazenes posted on LinkedIn over the past two years.*

The findings come as recent geopolitical events threaten to exacerbate the flood of nitazenes globally. In 2019 China banned all variants of fentanyl, a potent opioid that is fuelling the most lethal drug crisis in America’s history. And in 2022, a “poppy ban” imposed by the Taliban led to a massive drop in opium production in Afghanistan, the source of virtually all the heroin supplied to Europe.

Experts say these factors have opened up a vacuum for alternative synthetic opioids – such as nitazenes – to emerge. “At some stage we know for sure heroin will dry out, and then there’s a danger that some of those people [drug users] may go into nitazenes,” said Thomas Pietschmann, a senior research officer with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. “And that’s a particular danger because of its high potency.”

## Hiding in Plain Sight

Advertisements for nitazenes have infiltrated all corners of the internet: from an Australian sport fishing forum and a Congolese media outlet, to a Singaporean property site and ISSUU, a major publishing platform.

They were found on dozens of websites, including prominent Asian-headquartered marketplaces targeting international buyers, such as TradeFord, TradeKey, TradeAsia and IndiaMART. The ads also appeared on LinkedIn and the social media site X.

The platforms that responded to questions from Bellingcat last week pledged to pull nitazenes ads from their websites, but at the time of publication listings for the drugs still littered the internet.

Often, the suppliers of nitazenes are listed as Chinese companies. But these organisations are shape-shifting entities. Sellers hide behind opaque business structures: they regularly change addresses, use multiple emails and phone numbers, and promote contact via messaging platforms such as Telegram. Some appear to photoshop their names onto images of large factories. Many use generic photographs of young models or celebrities to market their drugs.

Corporate Chameleons: Food Additives, Nitazenes and Sanctions

Hebei Yingong New Material Technology Co Ltd is one of many purported chemical manufacturers linked to multiple online advertisements for nitazenes and other designer drugs. While this company is listed in corporate records as “inactive” and its websites are down, as is typical with other Chinese nitazene suppliers, its ads are still visible online.

An archive of Hebei Yingong’s profile on Alibaba.com includes the contact details and a photo of a salesperson named “Lisa Lau”. However, a reverse image search on Yandex shows that the image is, in fact, of a Taiwanese actress named Ning Chang.
