After the cyber attacks timelines ([part I](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/04/03/1-15-march-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/) and [part II](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2023/04/13/16-31-march-2023-cyber-attacks-timeline/)), it’s time to publish the statistics of March 2023 where I have collected and analyzed 334 events, which beats the record of the previous month.

**Cyber Crime**leads the **Motivations** chart, once again above 80% with a value slightly lower, but always in line with the previous month (**82.6%** vs. **83.7%**). The operations driven by **Cyber Espionage** are stable at **9.3%**(it was **9.2%**) while **Hacktivism** records a small increase to **5.1%** from **4%** from **6.4%** and **Cyber Warfare** is stable at **1.4%**from **1.2%**.

**Malware** is always on top of the **Attack Techniques**, but its value drops to **32.3%**from **40%**  ahead of **Vulnerabilities** that, thanks to the massive exploitation of Fortra CVE-2023-0669, jump at number two with **16.5&** (it was **7.4%** in February); and  **Account Takeovers**, down to **10.5%**from **20.9%**.

The **Target** **Distribution** chart is led, once again, by campaigns against **Multiple Organizations**, slightly down to **21%** from **25.5%**, and ahead of **Public Admins** (**12%**) and **Healthcare** with **10.5%** (it was exactly the same value in February).

Check out the interactive charts and the statistics, also available as an [infographic](https://www.hackmageddon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Infographic-March-2023-RS.jpg).

As always bear in mind that the sample refers exclusively to the attacks included in my [timelines](https://www.hackmageddon.com/category/security/cyber-attacks-timeline/), available from public sources such as blogs and news sites. Obviously the sample cannot be complete, but only aims to provide an high level overview of the threat landscape.
