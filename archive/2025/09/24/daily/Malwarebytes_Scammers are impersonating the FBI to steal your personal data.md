# Scammers are impersonating the FBI to steal your personal data

Posted: September 23, 2025

Been scammed? Hoping to report it to the FBI? Definitely do so, but be careful. Spoofed versions of the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website are now circulating online, and they lead straight back to the scammers.

The FBI issued an [advisory](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250919) last week, warning that cybercriminals are setting up fake versions of their site to tempt people into entering their personal information:

> “Members of the public could unknowingly visit spoofed websites while attempting to find FBI IC3’s website to submit an IC3 report.”

Criminals spoof legitimate sites like the IC3 portal using techniques including ‘typosquatting’. They’ll create web domains that look like the target, but have subtle differences in the URL. They’ll often misspell or add characters to a domain name, which can deceive users attempting to report cybercrime incidents.

The IC3 is the primary hub for cybercrime reporting in the US, and its services are now in high demand. According to the [2024 IC3 Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf), victims filed 859,532 complaints with it last year, totalling $16.6 billion in losses (up a third from 2023).

Criminals recognize that victims seeking help are often vulnerable to secondary attacks. After all, they already got caught out once, and are likely already at an emotional disadvantage. So they often succeed in attracting those victims to fake portals like these, with a view to scamming them again. A distracted or distraught victim can often hand over their sensitive data for a second time, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and banking information.

This threat follows a disturbing pattern of law enforcement impersonation lately. In April this year, the FBI [reported](https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250418) that criminals were targeting victims via social media, emails, and phone calls. In some cases, scammers would use fake social media accounts to approach members of fraud victim groups, convincing them that their funds had been recovered.

Attackers often impersonate law enforcement directly. In March, the FBI Philadelphia Field Office [reported](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/philadelphia/news/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-scammers-impersonating-law-enforcement-and-government-officials) that scammers were routinely spoofing authentic law enforcement and government agency phone numbers to extort money from victims. A 2023 [NPR investigation](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/13/1182001331/a-sophisticated-scam-uses-technology-to-impersonate-real-law-enforcement-agents) revealed how criminals leverage caller ID spoofing and voice cloning technology to impersonate real US Marshals.

As far back as 2022, the FBI reported that people were impersonating its officials. In one particularly nasty scenario, people were being duped by romance scammers, and when they became wise to the trick and cut communications, the organization behind the scam would contact them pretending to be a government official asking for help to catch romance scammers. Or they would tell the victim that they need to clear their name, which has been linked to a crime.

If you do fall victim to this kind of fraud, it’s far from certain that you’ll get your money ba...
