'Name' => 'WordPress Backup Migration Plugin PHP Filter Chain RCE',
'Description' => %q{
This module exploits an unauth RCE in the WordPress plugin: Backup Migration (<= 1.3.7). The vulnerability is
exploitable through the Content-Dir header which is sent to the /wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/backup-heart.php endpoint.
The exploit makes use of a neat technique called PHP Filter Chaining which allows an attacker to prepend
bytes to a string by continuously chaining character encoding conversions. This allows an attacker to prepend
a PHP payload to a string which gets evaluated by a require statement, which results in command execution.
