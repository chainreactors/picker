# A Better Way to Think About AI Job Replacement

AI really just lets founders and owners do all the work themselves

You don’t have to believe that companies want to fire all their employees to see AI’s threat to jobs.

That’s negative framing. Most company leaders are regular, decent people who generally care about others.

A clearer way to think about this is to realize that most of them wish they could do all the work themselves—and they absolutely would if they could.

AI just enables that.

So it’s not that they want to fire people because they’re mean. They just want to be self-sufficient, with the minimum number of human employees possible.

Ideally zero.

So I recommend you think about the whole thing differently:

It's not that AI is replacing jobs that should exist...

The AI will just be doing the work that founders wish they could do themselves, so they’d never have to hire anyone in the first place.

The effect will be much the same—which is millions of jobs lost.

But seeing this as enabling founders/owners to do all the work themselves is a cleaner, simpler, and more logical way of interpreting this change that's happening.

It switches it from a malicious thing that people are doing to us, to a technological weather event.

AI, just like electricity and internet before it, is just technological weather. Nobody is doing it to us. It's just happening.

So don't waste energy on being angry about it. Why be mad at an earthquake?

Put your effort into preparing yourself to survive and thrive during and after.
