It's no secret that the job of SOC teams continues to become increasingly difficult. Increased volume and sophistication of attacks are plaguing under-resourced teams with false positives and analyst burnout.

However, like many other industries, cybersecurity is now beginning to lean on and benefit from advancements in automation to not only maintain the status quo, but to attain better security outcomes.

## Automation across multiple phases of the SOC workflow

The need for automation is clear, and it is apparent that it is becoming table stakes for the industry. Of all cyber resilient organizations, IBM estimates that [62%](https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/cyber-resilient-organization-study/) have deployed automation, AI and machine learning tools and processes.

Up until now, much of these advancements in automation have been focused on response, with SOAR and incident response tools playing an instrumental role in tackling the most urgent phase of the SOC workflow.

Centering the focus only on response, however, means we're treating the symptoms instead of the root cause of the disease. By breaking down the SOC workflow into phases, it is easy to see more instances where automation can improve the speed and efficacy of security teams.

The four phases where it is possible to expand coverage of automation include:

* **Data ingestion and normalization:** Automating data ingestion and normalization can empower teams to handle huge amounts of data from multiple sources, laying the foundation for additional automated processes
* **Detection:** Offloading the creation of a significant percentage of the detection rules can free up time for security analysts to focus on the threats that are unique to their organization or market segment
* **Investigation:** Offloading manual and tedious work to shorten investigation and triage processes
* **Response:** Automatically responding to known and discovered threats for rapid and accurate mitigation

## Data: Laying the foundation for automation

Ingesting huge amounts of data may sound overwhelming to many security teams. Historically, teams have had a hard time connecting data sources or have simply had to ignore the data volumes that they couldn't handle due to cost-prohibitive models of legacy tools that charge for the amount of data that they store.

With the world continually migrating to the cloud, it is imperative that security teams do not shy away from massive data. Instead, they need to enact solutions that help them manage it and in turn, achieve better security outcomes by having increased visibility on the entire attack surface.

Security data lakes have brought with them a paradigm shift in security operations. They support the ingestion of massive volumes and variety of data, at the speed of cloud, and allow security platforms to run analytics on top of them with reduced complexity and at a predictable cost.

## Detection: Automating the 80%

As more data is ingested, there will inherently be more alerts discovered. Again, this may sound intimidating to overworked security teams, but automated processes, such as out-of-the-box detection rules across attack vectors, is another perfect example where automation can lead to an improvement in coverage.

Generally speaking, there are many similarities in the way networks are attacked, with approximately [80% of threat signals](https://www.hunters.ai/blog/the-rise-of-security-data-lakes-and-automation) being common across most organizations.

A modern SOC platform offers out-of-the-box detection rules that cover this 80% by plugging into threat intelligence feeds, open-source knowledge bases, social media, or dark web forums, to create logic protecting against the most common threats. Combining those with additional rules written by in-house security teams, platforms are able to keep up-to-date with threat techniques and utilize automated detection around them.

## Investigation: Separate the signal from the noise

The investigation phase of the SOC workflow is one that is not often associated with automation. It is traditionally bogged down by numerous tools and manual investigations limiting the efficiency and accuracy of security teams.

The processes that can be bolstered with automation within the investigation phase include:

* **Threat-centric clustering of alerts:** Security tools will give you thousands of alerts, but in reality these boil down to only a few threats. At scale, this becomes an enormous resource drain. If the [alerts are automatically grouped based on their threat context](https://www.hunters.ai/blog/introducing-threat-clustering-eliminate-redundant-triage-work-at-the-soc), then security analysts can more easily understand and respond to single incidents as opposed to chasing hundreds of alerts and false-positives.
* **Enrichment:** By automatically enriching the entities associated with each signal or alert with additional information from many different data sources, teams get all the available context to understand the risk of the alert.
* **Correlation:** Automatically correlating events leads to better visibility into the path of attackers...
