Twitter has announced that it's limiting the use of SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to its Blue subscribers.

"While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used – and abused – by bad actors," the company [said](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter).

"We will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers."

Twitter users who have not subscribed to Blue that have enrolled for SMS-based 2FA have time till March 20, 2023, to switch to an alternative method such as an authenticator app or a hardware security key.

After this cutoff date, non-Twitter Blue subscribers will have their option disabled.

The alternative methods "require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure," Twitter noted.

Given that SMS has been the [least secure form of 2FA](https://thenextweb.com/news/twitter-suspends-sms-feature-after-ceo-dorseys-account-was-hi-jack-ed), the latest enforcement is likely to force people to move towards secure forms of authentication.

According to [Twitter's own data](https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/account-security.html), only 2.6% of all active accounts have enabled at least one form of 2FA. SMS accounts for 74.4%, followed by authenticator apps (28.9%) and security keys (0.5%).
