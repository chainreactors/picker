# Our Santa wishlist: Stronger identity security for kids

Posted: December 20, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Sorry for the headline, but we have to get creative to get anyone to read an article on a Friday like this one, even if it is an important story.

As we enter the holidays and parents begin to rest after another hectic year of shopping for their kids, Malwarebytes Labs wants to draw some attention to a part of most children’s lives that deeply affects their [online security](https://www.malwarebytes.com/internet-security): The education system.

Although children in the US can’t take out loans or get credit cards on their own, they can end up as victims of [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft), which can end up being a lifelong burden in the form of bad credit ratings and even criminal records.

An [old study by Experian](https://web.archive.org/web/20190805094052/https%3A/www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/know-protect-child-identity-theft/) estimated that 25 percent of children will be victims of [identity fraud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/identity-fraud) or theft by the time they are 18 years old. In the current system it’s even possible that a newborn gets assigned a Social Security Number ([SSN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web)) which has already been used by a criminal.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has already assigned more than half of all available SSNs and because there is no check before the number gets issued, a baby could end up getting one with a bad history.

But usually, it happens later on. According to [Javelin’s 2022 Child Identity Fraud Study](https://javelinstrategy.com/press-release/17-million-us-children-fell-victim-data-breaches-according-javelins-2022-child), approximately 1.7 million US children had their [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) exposed and potentially compromised due to [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) in 2021.

Many of the leaked information about children comes, unsurprisingly, from the educational institutions that they visit.

Breaches in education don’t follow a pattern or affect only children. They range from [leaky school apps](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/childrens-personal-information-is-at-risk-due-to-data-leaks-in-school-apps) to [ransomware](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hackers-are-leaking-childrens-data-s-little-parents-can-rcna1926) and from [childcare](https://www.cyberdaily.au/security/10650-victorias-largest-childcare-org-discloses-data-breach-id-document-scans-stolen) to the [teacher’s retirement system](https://www.cta.org/educator/posts/calpers-and-strs-data-breach).

Even though the Taxpayer First Act of 2019 mandates that the IRS notify taxpayers, including parents and guardians, when there is suspected identity theft, it has been [criticized](https://reason.com/2024/12/16/the-irs-is-required-to-protect-kids-from-identity-theft-theyre-not-complying/) for not complying with this obligation.

So, parents and guardians need to be vigilant themselves.

## How to keep an eye on your children’s identities

There are a few things you can do.

* Contact the three major credit bureaus (Equifax,...
