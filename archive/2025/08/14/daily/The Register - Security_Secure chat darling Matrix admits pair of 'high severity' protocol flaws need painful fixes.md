Updated The maintainers of the federated secure chat protocol Matrix are warning users of a pair of "high severity protocol vulnerabilities," addressed in the latest version, saying patching them requires a breaking change in servers and clients.

"Last month we issued 'pre-disclosure: upcoming coordinated security fix for all Matrix server implementations,' describing a coordinated release to fix two high severity protocol vulnerabilities," Jim Mackenzie, veep for trust and safety at the Matrix.org Foundation, said.

"That release is now available as of 1700 UTC on August 11, 2025. Server updates are now available, and MSCs & spec updates will follow on Thursday, August 14, 2025, bringing us to version 1.16 of the spec later in the month, and introducing room version 12."
