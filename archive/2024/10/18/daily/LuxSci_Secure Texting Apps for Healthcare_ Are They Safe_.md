# Secure Texting Apps for Healthcare: Are They Safe?

October 17th, 2024

As today’s healthcare patients demand more personalized and efficient care, secure communication tools have become a requirement for modern multi-touch engagement. With increasingly tech-savvy patients and customers, today’s providers, payers and suppliers are turning to secure texting apps for healthcare to open up new communications channels, enhance engagement, and improve overall health outcomes.

Sounds great, right? Well, secure text must not only be efficient, but also secure and compliant with strict regulations, including [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).

In this blog post, we’ll explore how secure texting can make healthcare more efficient, adding a new and commonly used channel to better connect with your patients and customers—and we’ll provide some useful tips for companies looking to bring secure text into their healthcare engagement strategies.

### **The Value of Secure Texting Apps for Healthcare**

Healthcare providers, payers and suppliers often face the challenge of quickly sharing critical information with patients and customers, all while maintaining data privacy and securing protected health information (PHI). Traditional texting and SMS methods are inherently insecure, leaving sensitive health information vulnerable to breaches. Text messages have a number of widely known security vulnerabilities, including issues with confidentiality, only optional encryption, and inadequate authentication.

In healthcare, a data breach isn’t just a technical issue—it can lead to severe consequences, including legal penalties and the loss of patient trust, as well as harming your brand and future business. Secure texting ensures compliance with HIPAA regulations, protecting patient data and safeguarding healthcare organizations and companies from fines.

### **HIPAA Compliance Considerations for Secure Texting**

One of the key concerns when implementing secure texting in healthcare is HIPAA compliance. HIPAA mandates strict guidelines for the handling, transmission, and storage of Protected Health Information (PHI). Any communication containing PHI must be encrypted, auditable, and only accessible by authorized users. Here are some HIPAA compliance factors to consider:

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure that your secure texting app offers end-to-end encryption. This means that the email service provider (ESP) encrypts and transmits data using the TLS security protocol, securely stores data at rest, and data is never kept on a recipient’s device, preventing interception and access by unauthorized parties.
* **Audit Controls**: HIPAA requires organizations to maintain an audit trail of all communications. Your secure texting solution should provide a record of when messages are sent, delivered, and read, as well as details on who accessed the information.
* **Access Controls**: Only authorized personnel should have access to sensitive patient data or PHI. Secure texting apps for healthcare should offer user authentication features such as PINs, biometrics, or two-factor authentication to ensure the identity of the user. The safest approach is to not include PHI in your text message at all, but rather direct users to a secure communications platform via text message.
* **Remote Wipe Functionality**: In the event that a device is lost or stolen, healthcare providers must be able to remotely wipe PHI from the device to prevent unauthorized access, if needed.

### **Tips for Implementing Secure Texting in Healthcare**

If you’re a healthcare organization considering secure texting apps, here are some practical tips to ensure a smooth implementation:

1. **Choose the Right Platform**: Not all secure texting apps are created equal. Look for platforms that are specifically designed for healthcare, as they are more likely to include features designed for HIPAA compliance. LuxSci Secure Text, for example, is built for healthcare environments, with encryption, audit trails, and other compliance tools integrated into the solution.
2. **Train Your Staff**: Technology is only as secure as the people using it. Ensure that all staff members who will use the secure texting app are trained on best practices for handling PHI and following compliance protocols. Regular training sessions and refresher courses are a must to keep everyone up to date with the latest rules and regulations.
3. **Encourage Patient and Customer Adoption**: Secure texting is a powerful tool for patient and customer engagement. Inform patients about the benefits of secure messaging and how it protects their privacy. Offer your patients and customers—especially those less likely to respond to other channels—the option to receive text messages as part of a multi-channel or omnichannel engagement approach.
4. **Integrate with Existing Systems**: A seamless workflow is crucial for the success of any new technology. Ensure that your secure texting solution can integrate with your existing Electronic Health Records (EHR) system, CDP platform, and other healthcare engagement channels and portals, so communication between providers, payers, suppliers and patients is not siloed.
5. **Monitor and Review**: After implementing secure texting, regularly review its usage and ensure compliance protocols are being followed. Monitor audit logs and address any potential security concerns promptly. Continuous improvement is key to maintaining both security and efficiency.

### **Improving Personalization and Engagement with Secure Texting**

Beyond compliance and data protection, secure texting apps for healthcare can significantly enhance patient engagement and improve the overall healthcare experience. In fact, personalized, timely communication has been shown to improve health outcomes and boost patient satisfaction. Here’s how:

* **Appointment Reminders and Care Management**: Send patients personalized appointment reminders, medication prompts, or follow-up instructions, reducing no-shows and improving adherence to treatment plans. For instance, sending a patient a personalized text reminder for their diabetes check-up or alerting them to the results of medical tests can improve and accelerate care management.
* **Product Offers, Renewals and Upgrades**: Secure messaging enables healthcare providers and suppliers to reach out to patients and customers to remind them about a prescription renewal, to upgrade or offer a new product, or to drive plan renewals and new services.
* **Patient Education**: Use secure texting to alert patients that new educational materials, such as care instructions, post-surgery protocols, or health tips tailored to the patient’s specific condition, are available. This not only empowers patients with more information but improves outcomes with better adherence to treatment plans and ongong care needs.

### **How LuxSci’s Secure Text Works**

LuxSci Secure Text transmits its data with TLS protection, stores its information with 256-bit AES, and data is never kept on the recipient’s device. Recipients use password-based authentication to access the information and messages are securely stored in LuxSci’s databases and dedicated secure infrastructure.
