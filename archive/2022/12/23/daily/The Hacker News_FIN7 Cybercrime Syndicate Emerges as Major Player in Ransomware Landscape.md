[![Ransomware Hackers](data:image/png;base64... "Ransomware Hackers")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu9YKd02vdFX9q7nH_mj_COAplqIClED8G3-bIqGZfD9uEAVx2YkW4pnR4oTHEKnrj9qtpM11W6mYLnGXvGxEt9IFdVd2PCh0jnop8BOe_IT_acIv-VKs3Q-JjeXkZPvJplINEolBZljwID-Ev26al_uOtbkyFHFd7atp9dyswl66CcZIVuWykjyr6wg/s790-rw-e365/cyber.png)

An exhaustive analysis of **FIN7** has unmasked the cybercrime syndicate's organizational hierarchy, alongside unraveling its role as an affiliate for mounting ransomware attacks.

It has also exposed deeper associations between the group and the larger threat ecosystem comprising the now-defunct ransomware [DarkSide](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/us-proposes-1-million-fine-on-colonial.html), [REvil](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/new-revil-samples-indicate-ransomware.html), and [LockBit](https://thehackernews.com/2022/11/amadey-bot-spotted-deploying-lockbit-30.html) families.

The highly active threat group, also known as Carbanak, is [known](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/fin7-hackers-leveraging-password-reuse.html) for employing an extensive arsenal of tools and tactics to expand its "cybercrime horizons," including adding ransomware to its playbook and setting up fake security companies to lure researchers into conducting ransomware attacks under the guise of penetration testing.

More than 8,147 victims have been compromised by the financially motivated adversary across the world, with a majority of the entities located in the U.S. Other prominent countries include China, Germany, Canada, Italy, and the U.K.

FIN7's intrusion techniques, over the years, have further diversified beyond traditional social engineering to include infected USB drives, software supply chain compromise, and the use of stolen credentials purchased from underground markets.

"Nowadays, its initial approach is to carefully pick high-value companies from the pool of already compromised enterprise systems and force them to pay large ransoms to restore their data or seek unique ways to monetize the data and remote access," PRODAFT [said](https://www.prodaft.com/resource/detail/fin7-unveiled-deep-dive-notorious-cybercrime-gang) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

According to the Swiss cybersecurity company, the Russian-speaking hacking crew has also been observed to weaponize several flaws in Microsoft Exchange such as [CVE-2020-0688](https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/top-30-critical-security.html), [CVE-2021-42321](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/microsoft-issues-patches-for-actively.html), [ProxyLogon, and ProxyShell](https://thehackernews.com/2021/11/hackers-exploiting-proxylogon-and.html) to obtain a foothold into target environments.

[![FIN7 Cybercrime Syndicate](data:image/png;base64... "FIN7 Cybercrime Syndicate")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXWJSj-lP5zgkimydTc-CwuBckZJpMoZ8KlEOqjTK1s14n8Ry6x7NcJHE6iuaC2p2llH7aphAnF9AGSkY-IMY3ofTAKq1rATS5XB5z-Fnxh6v2Lr3_wmyfCwBsAALRjmoyzwRDHWnMfGyS3UC_ftVWp1CnJeC09vF4HmeUbM2J0Y7BwIeouLTThKTe/s790-rw-e365/fin7.png)

The use of [double extortion tactics](https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/cuba-ransomware-extorted-over-60.html) notwithstanding, attacks mounted by the group have deployed SSH backdoors on the compromised systems, even in scenarios where the victim has already paid a ransom.

The idea is to resell access to other ransomware outfits and re-target the victims as part of its illicit money-making scheme, underscoring its attempts to minimize efforts and maximize profits, not to mention prioritize companies based on their annual revenues, founded dates, and the number of employees.

This "demonstrates a particular type of feasibility study considered a unique behavior among cybercrime groups," the researchers said.

[![FIN7 Cybercrime Syndicate](data:image/png;base64... "FIN7 Cybercrime Syndicate")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1L6lSPfanTW7NwX9INlkaghoZj0MyjyyCHu7VJ2WOAB0-a8ipVazPaPiLkSPVkIBBeBrgcnwVzrKGh7hIH0N52sNHSgp7Vbg9K4Rqm_6NIALFtTqkkLtv6AkE8lDtTL7ZEb5WVXABPi3XMY0clFfTSBtJq_7t66O_imTe8dVlT7-vL0MHcB3e1LBL/s790-rw-e365/data.png)

Put differently, the modus operandi of FIN7 boils down to this: It utilizes services like Crunchbase, Dun & Bradstreet (DNB), Owler, and Zoominfo to shortlist firms and organizations with the highest revenue. It also uses other website analytics platforms like MuStat and Similarweb to monitor traffic to the victims' sites.

Initial access is then obtained through one of the many intrusion vectors, followed by exfiltrating data, encrypting files, and eventually determining the ransom amount based on the company's revenue.

These infection sequences are also designed to load remote access trojans such as [Carbanak](https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/fin7-supervisor-gets-7-year-jail-term.html), [Lizar](https://thehackernews.com/2021/10/hackers-set-up-fake-company-to-get-it.html) (aka Tirion), and [IceBot](https://www.recordedfuture.com/fin7-flash-drives-spread-remote-access-trojan), the latter of which was first documented by Recorded Future-owned Gemini Advisory in January 2022.
