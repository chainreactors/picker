Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to phishing campaigns that impersonate popular brands and trick targets into calling phone numbers operated by threat actors.

"A significant portion of email threats with PDF payloads persuade victims to call adversary-controlled phone numbers, displaying another popular social engineering technique known as Telephone-Oriented Attack Delivery (TOAD), also known as callback phishing," Cisco Talos researcher Omid Mirzaei [said](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/pdfs-portable-documents-or-perfect-deliveries-for-phish/) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

An analysis of phishing emails with PDF attachments between May 5 and June 5, 2025, has revealed Microsoft and Docusign to be the most impersonated brands. NortonLifeLock, PayPal, and Geek Squad are among the most impersonated brands in TOAD emails with PDF attachments.

The activity is part of wider phishing attacks that attempt to leverage the trust people have with popular brands to initiate malicious actions. These messages typically incorporate PDF attachments featuring legitimate brands like Adobe and Microsoft to scan malicious QR codes that point to fake Microsoft login pages or click on links that redirect users to phishing pages posing as services like Dropbox.

QR code phishing emails with PDF payloads have also been found to leverage PDF annotations to embed the URLs within a sticky note, comment, or form fields within a PDF attachment, while linking the QR codes to an authentic web page to give the impression that the messages are trustworthy.

In TOAD-based attacks, victims are coaxed into calling a phone number in a purported attempt to resolve an issue or confirm a transaction. During the phone call, the attacker masquerades as a legitimate customer representative and tricks the victim into either disclosing sensitive information or installing malware on their devices.

Most TOAD campaigns rely on the illusion of urgency, but their effectiveness often hinges on how convincingly attackers imitate real support workflows – using scripted call center tactics, hold music, and even spoofed caller IDs.

This technique has been a [popular method](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/androids-new-feature-blocks-fraudsters.html) among [threat actors](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/hackers-are-calling-your-office-fbi.html) to install banking trojans on Android devices and remote access programs on victim machines to gain persistent access. In May 2025, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned of such attacks perpetrated by a financially motivated group called Luna Moth to breach target networks by posing as IT department personnel.

"Attackers use direct voice communication to exploit the victim's trust in phone calls and the perception that phone communication is a secure way to interact with an organization," Mirzaei said. "Additionally, the live interaction during a phone call enables attackers to manipulate the victim's emotions and responses by employing social engineering tactics."

Cisco Talos said most threat actors use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) numbers to remain anonymous and make it harder to trace, with some numbers reused consecutively for as many as four days, allowing the attackers to pull off multi-stage social engineering attacks using the same number.

"Brand impersonation is one of the most [popular social engineering techniques](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/from-trust-to-trickery-brand-impersonation/), and it is continuously being used by attackers in different types of email threats," the company said. "Therefore, a brand impersonation detection engine plays a pivotal role in defending against cyber attacks."

In recent months, phishing campaigns have also capitalized on a legitimate feature in Microsoft 365 (M365) called [Direct Send](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-microsoft-365-or-office-365) to spoof internal users and deliver phishing emails without the need for compromising an account. The novel method has been employed to target more than 70 organizations since May 2025, per Varonis.

These spoofed messages not only seem to originate from inside the victim organization, they also take advantage of the fact that [smart host addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_host) follow a predictable pattern ("<tenant\_name>.mail.protection.outlook.com") to send the phishing emails without requiring authentication.

This tactic shares similarities with vishing, tech support scams, and business email compromise (BEC), but differs in delivery vector and persistence. While some attackers push victims to download remote access software like AnyDesk or TeamViewer, others route them through fake payment portals or impersonate billing departments to harvest credit card information, broadening the attack surface beyond just credential theft.

In one phishing email sent on June 17, 2025, the message body resembled a voicemail notificati...
