Today, I am incredibly proud to announce that with Cortex XDR, Palo Alto Networks has been named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms for the third year in a row.

We believe this recognition validates our unwavering commitment to delivering the world’s most effective AI-driven endpoint security to our customers.

For us, it isn't just about where we rank in the industry. It's about setting a new standard for what security operations can achieve, while earning and maintaining the trust of the organizations that rely on us to protect them from increasingly sophisticated threats.

In addition to being recognized as a Magic Quadrant™ Leader, we are honored by our customer feedback:

* [A Historic First in MITRE ATT&CK® Evaluations](/cortex/cortex-xdr/mitre) **–** Cortex XDR achieved an unprecedented **100% detection with technique-level detail** in the round 6 evaluations. This was accomplished in real-time with zero configuration changes.
* [The Highest Recommendation Rating out of All Vendors Recognized as a Customers’ Choice](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-voc-epp-peer-insights) **–** We have received a 98% **"Willingness to Recommend"** from customers on Gartner Peer Insights™ for Endpoint Protection Platforms based on 198 reviews, as of January 2025. We truly believe when security professionals overwhelmingly endorse a solution, it cuts through the noise.

Being named a Leader again is a moment of pride for us, and in our opinion it is a direct result of the partnership we share with our customers. Your feedback, your challenges, as well as your trust make us better. We are deeply grateful for your confidence in us as we continue to push the boundaries of what AI-driven security can achieve.

To get the full story and a comprehensive analysis of the endpoint security market, I invite you to read the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant report.
