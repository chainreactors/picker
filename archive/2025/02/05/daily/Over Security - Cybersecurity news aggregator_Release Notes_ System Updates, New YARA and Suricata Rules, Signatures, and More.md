Release Notes: System Updates, New YARA and Suricata Rules, Signatures, and More

Hello, cybersecurity enthusiasts!

January may often feel like a slow month, but at [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_jan_25&utm_term=040225&utm_content=linktolanding), we’ve been hard at work behind the scenes, focusing on system and threat coverage updates.

As the new year kicked off, our team dived straight into fine-tuning the platform, optimizing performance, and strengthening detection capabilities.

Now that February is here, let’s take a look at what we’ve been up to and how these updates enhance your malware-hunting experience.

## System Updates: Keeping Things Running Smoothly

In January, we focused on making ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox and [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) faster, more stable, and overall better for you.

Our team has been fixing bugs, fine-tuning the system, and optimizing performance so that everything runs like clockwork. These aren’t the kind of changes you immediately notice, but they make a big difference in keeping your malware analysis smooth and hassle-free.

While January was all about optimizations, stay tuned as we have plenty of exciting updates coming your way soon!

## Threat Coverage Updates

We continued expanding ANY.RUN’s detection capabilities and strengthening its ability to identify emerging threats. This included adding new malware signatures, refining [YARA rules](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/yara-rules-explained/), and enhancing [Suricata rule sets](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/detection-with-suricata-ids/) to keep up with evolving attack techniques.

### New Malware Signatures

We’ve introduced new signatures to detect a wide range of malware families. Here are some of the threats we now cover:
