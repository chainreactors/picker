# On the 20th Safer Internet Day, what was security like back in 2004?

Posted: February 7, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Today is the 20th Safer Internet Day. Since 2004, there’s been an [annual event](https://saferinternet.org.uk/safer-internet-day/safer-internet-day-2023) designed to “Promote safer and more responsible use of online technology and mobile phones, especially amongst children and young people across the world.”

2004 was a key year for several safety activities, encompassing both Safer Internet Day and the [Safer Internet Forum](https://www.betterinternetforkids.eu/policy/better-internet/policy-roadmap/key-events). As it would turn out, a wide range of group security activities would follow hot on its heels the year after, not just through the public but also in professional security, legal, and government circles too.

You may be asking, why 2004? Was the general state of the Internet at the time so bad that all of these events sprang up almost out of necessity? Well, the answer to this makes a compelling case for a “yes”, because security was quite the mess back in the day.

## Help required. Apply within

In 2004, a big slice of security advice was most definitely needed from somewhere. The dedicated security firms were primarily big [antivirus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus) organisations, some of which were struggling to keep up with the threats now spilling across the Internet.

You had very rich and powerful [adware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware) companies, making liberal use of bundled installers. Those meme pictures of someone’s browser filled with 50+ toolbars may be funny to look at now, but it definitely wasn’t at the time.

The adware was frequently incredibly invasive, with affiliate networks often in meltdown promoting every kind of rogue install under the sun. One day, the “agree to install” button would be missing. The next day, the adware would be installed via exploit without permission, something which the adware companies would swear is “not possible”. When it turned out to be entirely possible, and recorded on a Quicktime file, the same old excuses would be made and you knew it’d all be happening again a week later.

[Exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) were rampant. People had pretty much no idea about even the most basic of scams as inventive fraudsters came up with everything bar the kitchen sink in the brave new world of social media, AKA “all my fish in one barrel”. Sometimes it felt like all you could do was read the [Windows XP vs Linux comparisons](https://www.theregister.com/2004/10/22/security_report_windows_vs_linux) while waiting for the [inevitable infection to strike](https://www.theregister.com/2004/05/04/sasser_worm/).

As for those “time it takes to become infected” numbers…well, they made for grim reading.

## Spreading the infection

20 minutes was an important number in 2004. How so? It turns out that 20 minutes was the average amount of time it took your average, unprotected Windows XP installation to become infected with something horrible.

Data [collected by the Internet Storm Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20040820024826/http%3A//isc.sans.org/survivalhistory.php) dug into “Survival Time History”, which is “calculated as the average time between reports for an average target [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/wha...
