## **The Vulnerability Treadmill**

The reactive nature of vulnerability management, combined with delays from policy and process, strains security teams. Capacity is limited and patching everything immediately is a struggle. Our Vulnerability Operation Center (VOC) dataset analysis identified 1,337,797 unique findings (security issues) across 68,500 unique customer assets. 32,585 of them were distinct CVEs, with 10,014 having a CVSS score of 8 or higher. Among these, external assets have 11,605 distinct CVEs, while internal assets have 31,966. With this volume of CVEs, it's no surprise that some go unpatched and lead to compromises.

Why are we stuck in this situation, what can be done, and is there a better approach out there?

We'll explore the state of vulnerability reporting, how to prioritize vulnerabilities by threat and exploitation, examine statistical probabilities, and briefly discuss risk. Lastly, we'll consider solutions to minimize vulnerability impact while giving management teams flexibility in crisis response. This should give a good impression, but if you want the full story you can find it in our annual report, the [Security Navigator](https://www4.orangecyberdefense.com/security-navigator-25-thn3).

## **Can You CVE What I CVE?**

Western nations and organizations use the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to track and rate vulnerabilities, overseen by US government-funded programs like MITRE and NIST. By September 2024, the CVE program, active for 25 years, had published over 264,000 CVEs, and by 15 April 2025, the number of total CVEs increased to approximately 290,000 CVEs including "Rejected" or "Deferred".

NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) relies on CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) to record CVEs with initial CVSS assessments, which helps scale the process but also introduces biases. The disclosure of serious vulnerabilities is complicated by disagreements between researchers and vendors over impact, relevance, and accuracy, affecting the wider community [1, 2].

By April 2025, a backlog of more than 24,000 unenriched CVEs accumulated at the NVD [3, 4] due to bureaucratic delays that occurred in March 2024. Temporarily halting CVE enrichment despite ongoing vulnerability reports, and dramatically illustrating the fragility of this system. The temporary pause resulted in this backlog that is yet to be cleared.

On 15 April 2025, MITRE announced that the US Department of Homeland Security will not be renewing its contract with MITRE, impacting the CVE program directly[15]. This created a lot of uncertainty about the future of CVEs and how it will impact cybersecurity practitioners. Fortunately, funding for the CVE program was extended due to the strong community and industry response[16].

CVE and the NVD are not the sole sources of vulnerability intelligence. Many organizations, including ours, develop independent products that track far more vulnerabilities than the MITRE's CVE program and NIST NVD.

Since 2009, China has operated its own vulnerability database, CNNVD [5], which could be a valuable technical resource [6, 7], though political barriers make collaboration unlikely. Moreover, not all vulnerabilities are disclosed immediately, creating blind spots, while some are exploited without detection—so-called 0-days.

In 2023, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant identified 97 zero-day exploits, primarily affecting mobile devices, operating systems, browsers, and other applications. Meanwhile, only about 6% of vulnerabilities in the CVE dictionary have ever been exploited [8], and studies from 2022 show that half of organizations patch just 15.5% or fewer vulnerabilities monthly [9].

While CVE is crucial for security managers, it's an imperfect, voluntary system, neither globally regulated nor universally adopted.

This blog also aims to explore how we might reduce reliance on it in our daily operations.

## **Threat Informed**

Despite its shortcomings, the CVE system still provides valuable intelligence on vulnerabilities that could impact security. However, with so many CVEs to address, we must prioritize those most likely to be exploited by threat actors.

The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), developed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) SIG [10], helps predict the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the wild. With EPSS intelligence, security managers can either prioritize patching as many CVEs as possible for broad coverage or focus on critical vulnerabilities to maximize efficiency and prevent exploitation. Both approaches have pros and cons.

To demonstrate the tradeoff between coverage and efficiency, we need two datasets: one representing potential patches (VOC dataset) and another representing actively exploited...
