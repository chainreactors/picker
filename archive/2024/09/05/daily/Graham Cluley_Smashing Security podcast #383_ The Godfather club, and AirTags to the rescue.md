There‚Äôs a whole new dating scam that could mean you end up out of pocket (or beaten up) after a first date with a glamorous admirer, and a woman in Los Alamos uses an Air Tag to entrap a thief.

Plus ‚Äì don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with Maya Levine of Sysdig.

All this, and a very bad Cockney accent, in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by industry veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
