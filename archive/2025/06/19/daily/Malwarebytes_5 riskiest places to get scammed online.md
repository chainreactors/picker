# 5 riskiest places to get scammed online

Posted: June 18, 2025

Scammers love your smartphone.

They can text you fraudulent tracking links for packages you never bought. They can profess their empty love to you across your social media apps. They can bombard your email inbox with [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts, impersonate a family member through a phone call, and even trick you into visiting malicious versions of legitimate websites.

But, [according to new research from Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile-scams), while scammers can reach people through just about any modern method of communication, they have at least five favored tracts for finding new victims—emails, phone calls and voicemails, malicious websites, social media platforms, and text messages. It’s here that people are most likely to find phishing attempts, romance scams, sextortion threats, and more, and it’s here that everyday people should stay most cautious when receiving messages from unknown senders or in responding to allegedly urgent requests for money or information.

For this research, Malwarebytes surveyed 1,300 people over the age of 18 in the US, UK, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, asking about the frequency, type, impact, and consequences of any scams they found on their smartphones. Capturing just how aggravating today’s online world is, a full 78% of people said they encountered or received a scam on their smartphone at least once a week.

Here are the top five places that people actually encountered those weekly scams:

* 65% of people encountered a scam at least once a week through their **email**
* 53% encountered a scam at least once a week through **phone calls and voicemails**
* 50% encountered a scam at least once a week through **text messages (SMS)**
* 49% encountered a scam at least once a week through **malicious websites**
* 47% encountered a scam at least once a week through **social media platforms**

Unfortunately, scam prevention cannot fixate on only these five channels, as scammers change their tactics based on how they’re trying to trick their victims. For instance, though people were least likely to encounter a scam once a week through a buying or selling platform like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist (36%), such platforms were of course the most likely place for scam *victims* to have their credit card details and passwords stolen by a scammer masquerading as a legitimate business.

The noise from such daily strife has become deeply confusing, as just 15% of people strongly agreed that they could confidently identify a scam on their phone.

## **Daily dilemma**

While 78% of people encountered a scam on their smartphone at least once a week, a shocking 44% of people encountered a scam at least *daily*. Similar to the weekly breakdown, here are the top five ways that people encountered scams once a day:

* 34% of people encountered a scam at least once a day through their **email**
* 25% encountered a scam at least once a day through **malicious websites**
* 24% encountered a scam at least once a day through **phone calls and voicemails**
* 24% encountered a scam at least once a day through **social media platforms**
* 22% encountered a scam at least once a day through **text messages (SMS)**
