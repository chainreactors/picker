A GCHQ intern forgets the golden rule of spy school ‚Äî don‚Äôt take the secrets home with you ‚Äî and finds himself swapping Cheltenham for a cell. Meanwhile, an Australian hacker flies too close to the sun, hacks his way into a US indictment, and somehow walks free‚Ä¶ only to get booted back Down Under.

Plus: flow states, Bob Mortimer, and the joys of pretending to carry an owl around on a cushion.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
