# Pig butchering scams, how they work and how to avoid them

Posted: March 1, 2024

[Pig butchering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pig-butchering-scam) scams are big business. There are hundreds of millions of dollars involved every year. The numbers are not very precise because some see them as a special kind of [romance scam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2023/08/an-influx-of-elons-a-hospital-visit-and-magic-men-lock-and-code-s04e18), while others classify them as [investment fraud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/01/investment-fraud-a-serious-money-maker-for-criminals).

The victims in Pig Butchering schemes are referred to as pigs by the scammers, who use elaborate storylines to fatten up victims into believing they are in a romantic or otherwise close personal relationship. Once the victim places enough trust in the scammer, they bring the victim into a [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) investment scheme. Then comes the butchering‚Äìmeaning they‚Äôll be bled dry of their money.

And they usually start by someone sending you a message that looks like it‚Äôs intended for someone else.

Scammers trying to initiate pig butchering scams

The accounts sending the messages often use stock photographs of models for their profile pictures. But even though you won‚Äôt know these people, a simple reply of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Steve, but‚Ä¶‚Äù is almost exactly what the scammers want‚Äîan initial foothold to talk to you a bit more.

After some small talk, the scammer will ask if you‚Äôre familiar with investments, or cryptocurrency. They‚Äôll then do one of two things:

* Direct you to a genuine cryptocurrency investment portal, and send you some money to invest or have you do it on your own dime. Eventually you‚Äôre asked to transfer all funds and/or profit to a separate account which belongs to the scammer. At that point, your money has gone and the proverbial pig has been butchered after a period of so-called ‚Äúfattening up‚Äù (in other words, gaining your trust and convincing you to go all out where investing is concerned).
* Direct you to a fake cryptocurrency site, often imitating a real portal. The site may well have its numbers tweaked or otherwise deliberately altered to make it look as though your suggested investments are sound bets. The reality is that they are not, and by the time you realize it, your money has gone.

Once you are satisfied with the profit on your investment and decide to cash out, the problems come at you from different directions. A hefty withdrawal fee, a huge tax to be paid, will need to be paid to get your money back. Which you won‚Äôt, but this is the last drop the scammers will try to wring out of you.

John Oliver talked at length about Pig Butchering scams in the latest episode of [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)](https://youtu.be/pLPpl2ISKTg?si=Fx0-wEOPnhDTc-Ba), lifting the lid on some shocking examples of people who got scammed, and the role that organized crime plays behind the scenes. (Note that you‚Äôll need to be in the USA to watch it, or have a good [VPN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/vpn) üòâ

As John Oliver put it:

> ‚ÄúYou may have an image of a person who might fall for pig butchering, but unless you are looking in a mirror, you might be wrong.‚Äù

So here are some poi...
