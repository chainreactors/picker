The sprint is on. The energy industry is transforming to balance energy security with sustainability and resiliency, driven by stakeholder demands for low-to-no carbon energy system; and growing stakeholder demands for improved ESG performance is driving decarbonization. Industry is diversifying their energy product portfolio: LNG, hydrogen, alternate/renewable fuels (e.g., Sustainable Aviation Fuels and biofuels), renewables, CO2 capture services, etc. Among many needs, Industry requires support in their transformation by having the capability to simulate and optimize their supply chain and operations, and to manage both the carbon footprint to produce new energy products as well as to manage the carbon intensity of the products themselves.

To meet the many challenges of the energy transition, SAP is addressing a number of areas in the context of a climate framework:

1. Counting: “1,2,3: Get the numbers right”

2. Mitigation: “Make it small: reduce emissions in your span of control”

3. Markets: “Use carbon credits and markets to get to zero and buy and sell low carbon products and services”

4. Transition: “Reset your business model as part of the energy transition”

5. Adaptation: “Protect your business from a changing climate”

SAP brings together many elements of our solution portfolio, in addition to our Sustainability portfolio, as core solution building blocks.  Our active engagement with leading external groups (WEF, CEO Alliance for Green Hydrogen, etc.) and with customers (Sustainable Procurement Think Tank, Carbon Trading, etc.) provide both keen insights in how to shape our complete solution portfolio and provides opportunity to share, influence, and shape the digital requirements for energy transition topics.

Here's a [short video](https://content-discovery.int.sap/explore?assetId=05e2cb07-4d7d-404e-b452-b0003134dfe7) of our activities to support industry in this seismic transformation to a low-carbon world.
