![How to find and remove malware on Weebly sites](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_Weebly-malware-820x386.png)

Weebly is an easy-to-use website builder that allows admins to quickly create and publish responsive blogs and sites. Website builder environments are usually considered to be very safe and not prone to malware infections, but during a recent investigation I found some malicious behavior which revealed that even closed proprietary systems for [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) website builders like Weebly can be abused.

Let’s dive in!

## Fake Adobe updates on Weebly website builder

Threat actors are always on the hunt for new attack vectors.  So when I was tasked with investigating a new client who purchased our services after finding some malicious behavior on their Weebly site, my interest was piqued.

The site admin was complaining about unwanted pop-ups and ads that had recently appeared on their homepage. Navigating to their domain immediately revealed the following pop-up:

![Fake Adobe software update dialog on Weebly site redirects to ads](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/adobe_flash_update-650x275.png)

Fake Adobe software update dialog redirects to ads

This fake Adobe Flash Player prompt is displayed whenever a user visits the infected Weebly site. Closing the dialog or clicking anywhere on the web page immediately opens a new browser tab with ads.

I poked around in Weebly’s custom theme editor and quickly found the culprit:

[![Weebly’s code editor, displaying the contents of the header.html file at the top and live preview at the bottom. ](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/software_update_header_code.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/software_update_header_code.png)

Weebly’s code editor, displaying the contents of the **header.html** file at the top and live preview at the bottom.

Nestled in the **header.html** file was the following malicious JavaScript files responsible for launching the fake Adobe Flash pop-up on every page load.

* hxxp://circuitingratitude[.]com/2b/2b/cf/**2b2bcfdf41e8054fd6cffb25bfa1103c.js**
* hxxp://circuitingratitude[.]com/0cc5f9c34508562fd68249288d4fc036/**invoke.js**

## Unwanted ads on homepage

A number of new unwanted banner ads had also been placed at the top of the homepage.

[![Unwanted banner ads found at the top of the Weebly site. ](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unwanted_homepage_ads.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/unwanted_homepage_ads.png)

Unwanted banner ads found at the top of the Weebly site.

I checked for locations where the client (or bad actor) may have added custom code to the website. The header and footer code sections were completely empty.

[![No custom code in Weebly Settings > SEO > Footer/header ](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/weebly_settings.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/weebly_settings.png)

No custom code in Weebly Settings > SEO > Footer/header

The SEO Settings for the homepage did not contain any obvious custom code, either.

[![No custom code found in Weebly Pages > [Page name] > SEO Settings](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/page_seo_settings.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/page_seo_settings.png)

No custom code found in Pages > [Page name] > SEO Settings

It wasn’t until I started poking around in the homepage’s visual WYSIWYG editor that I found the next culprit. A transparent custom HTML code block had been added and edited on the homepage precisely where the ads were found on the live site.

I needed to click on the empty space to reveal the block and its editor options.

[![Weebly custom HTML module ](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/edit_custom_module.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/edit_custom_module.png)

Clicking on **Edit Custom Code** uncovered the following script, which had been placed in the invisible block to serve banners for the popular **PopCash** affiliate ad network.
