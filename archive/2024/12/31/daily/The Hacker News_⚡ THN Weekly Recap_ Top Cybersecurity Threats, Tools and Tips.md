Every week, the digital world faces new challenges and changes. Hackers are always finding new ways to breach systems, while defenders work hard to keep our data safe. Whether it's a hidden flaw in popular software or a clever new attack method, staying informed is key to protecting yourself and your organization.

In this week's update, we'll cover the most important developments in cybersecurity. From the latest threats to effective defenses, we've got you covered with clear and straightforward insights. Let's dive in and keep your digital world secure.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Flaw Under Attack** ‚Äî Palo Alto Networks has [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/palo-alto-releases-patch-for-pan-os-dos.html) a high-severity flaw impacting PAN-OS software that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on susceptible devices by sending a specially crafted DNS packet. The vulnerability (CVE-2024-3393, CVSS score: 8.7) only affects firewalls that have the DNS Security logging enabled. The company said it's aware of "customers experiencing this denial-of-service (DoS) when their firewall blocks malicious DNS packets that trigger this issue."

## **üîî Top News**

* **Contagious Interview Drops OtterCookie Malware** ‚Äî North Korean threat actors behind the ongoing Contagious Interview campaign have been observed dropping a new JavaScript malware called [OtterCookie](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-deploy-ottercookie.html). The malware, likely introduced in September 2024, is designed to establish communications with a command-and-control (C2) server using the Socket.IO JavaScript library, and awaits further instructions. It's designed to run shell commands that facilitate data theft, including files, clipboard content, and cryptocurrency wallet keys.
* **Cloud Atlas Continues its Assault on Russia** ‚Äî Cloud Atlas, a hacking of unknown origin that has extensively targeted Russia and Belarus, has been observed using a previously undocumented malware called [VBCloud](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/cloud-atlas-deploys-vbcloud-malware.html) as part of its cyber attack campaigns targeting "several dozen users" in 2024. The attacks employ phishing emails containing Microsoft Word documents, which, when opened, trigger an exploit for a seven-year-old security flaw to deliver the malware. VBCloud is capable of harvesting files matching several extensions and information about the system. More than 80% of the targets were located in Russia. A lesser number of victims have been recorded in Belarus, Canada, Moldova, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, and Vietnam.
* **Malicious Python Packages Exfiltrate Sensitive Data** ‚Äî Two malicious Python packages, named [zebo and cometlogger](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/researchers-uncover-pypi-packages.html), have been found to incorporate features to exfiltrate a wide range of sensitive information from compromised hosts. Both the packages were downloaded 118 and 164 times each, before they were taken down. A majority of these downloads came from the United States, China, Russia, and India.
* **TraderTraitor Behind DMM Bitcoin Crypto Heist** ‚Äî Japanese and U.S. authorities officially blamed a North Korean threat cluster codenamed TraderTraitor (aka Jade Sleet, UNC4899, and Slow Pisces) for the theft of cryptocurrency worth $308 million from cryptocurrency company DMM Bitcoin in May 2024. The attack is notable for the fact that the adversary first compromised a system belonging to an employee of Japan-based cryptocurrency wallet software company Ginco under the pretext of a pre-employment test. "In late-May 2024, the actors likely used this access to manipulate a legitimate transaction request by a DMM employee, resulting in the loss of 4,502.9 BTC, worth $308 million at the time of the attack," authorities [said](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-pull-off-308m.html).
* **WhatsApp Scores Legal Victory Against NSO Group** ‚Äî NSO Group has been [found](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/us-judge-rules-against-nso-group-in.html) liable in the United States after a federal judge in the state of California ruled in favor of WhatsApp, calling out the Israeli commercial spyware vendor for exploiting a security vulnerability in the messaging app to deliver Pegasus using WhatsApp's servers 43 times in May 2019. The targeted attacks deployed the spyware on 1,400 devices globally by making use of a then zero-day vulnerability in the app's voice calling feature (CVE-2019-3568, CVSS score: 9.8).
