If you run a site on the open web, chances are you've noticed a [big increase in traffic](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/) over the past few months, whether or not your site has been getting more viewers, and you're not alone. Operators everywhere [have observed](https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/) a drastic increase in automated traffic—bots—and in most cases attribute much or all of this new traffic to AI companies.

## Background

AI—in particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI (genAI)—rely on compiling as much information from relevant sources (i.e., "texts written in English" or "photographs") as possible in order to build a functional and persuasive model that users will later interact with. While AI companies in part distinguish themselves by what data their models are trained on, possibly the greatest source of information—one freely available to all of us—is the open web.

To gather up all that data, companies and researchers use automated programs called scrapers (sometimes referred to by the more general term "bots") to "crawl" over the links available between various webpages and save the types of information they're tasked with as they go. [Scrapers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/scraping-just-automated-access-and-everyone-does-it) are tools with a long, and often beneficial, history: services like search engines, the Internet Archive, and all kinds of scientific research rely on them.

When scrapers are not deployed thoughtfully, however, they can contribute to higher hosting costs, lower performance, and e...
