LastPass, the popular password manager, is out of good will. Ever since the company first [disclosed a breach in August](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7b7xa/hacker-steals-lastpass-source-code-company-says), it has slowly provided consumers with drips of information, and the new details that do come out increasingly paint a picture of a company that should not be trusted with your passwords.

On Monday, LastPass [published a blog post](https://support.lastpass.com/help/incident-2-additional-details-of-the-attack) which provided more information on that breach, which it is now calling “Incident 2,” because the hacker leveraged its initial access to then steal data.

“Our investigation has revealed that the threat actor pivoted from the first incident, which ended on August 12, 2022, but was actively engaged in a new series of reconnaissance, enumeration, and exfiltration activities,” LastPass wrote.

The hackers managed to access LastPass’ corporate vault by targeting the home computer of one of four engineers who had access to decryption keys needed to access cloud data storage where sensitive information was kept. The hackers did this by exploiting a vulnerability in a third-party media software package, [which](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/) *[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/)* [later reported to be Plex](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/). From here, the hacker installed a keylogger, captured the engineer’s master password, bypassed the company’s multi-factor authentication protections, and accessed the corporate vault. In there, the hacker stole the keys needed to access “LastPass production backups, other cloud-based storage resources, and some related critical database backups,” the blog reads.

The post shows that the hacker against LastPass was resourceful and persistent, but also that LastPass was not treating its own crown jewels with the serious security practices it should have. A LastPass engineer was accessing critical services from their home computer and network. LastPass had difficulty distinguishing between the activity of the worker and that of the hacker. The sensitive information—in this case, customers’ password vaults that need the user’s master password to decrypt, but could theoretically be brute forced at some point—were stored less in a bank vault and more in a closet.

“4 people who have access to ‘the keys to the kingdom’. At least 1 of them was accessing them from a home computer. For how long without anyone noticing? If that didn’t raise flags, then it won’t for an attacker either,” the [pseudonymous security researcher MG tweeted](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1630434842361090048) after LastPass published its blog post. “Helping them harden their home network is nice, but there needs to be some big cultural improvements & better controls/detections.”

In [an August blog post](https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/08/notice-of-recent-security-incident), LastPass said a hacker compromised a developer account and stole portions of company source code and some “proprietary LastPass technical information.” Crucially, LastPass spokesperson Nikolett Bacso Albaum told Motherboard in a statement at the time “We have no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults.”

Then in December, the story changed. [In a new blog post](https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/), LastPass said the hacker “was also able to copy a backup of customer vault data from the encrypted storage container.” LastPass stressed that customers’ website usernames and passwords were encrypted, and could only be decrypted with the individual customer’s master password. But as LastPass acknowledges, the hacker may attempt to bru...
