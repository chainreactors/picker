# Tiger Sheikhs: The Emirati Royals and Covert Celebrity Wildlife Shoots

Over the years, two Dubai-based social media personalities with millions of followers have posted photos and videos of themselves alongside tiger and lion cubs, despite strict rules in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) regulating the possession and trading of ‘dangerous’ or exotic, animals.

Intriguingly, the pair have claimed that two of their photoshoots, one held in 2019 and another in 2020, were facilitated by a royal friend.

Open source evidence buttresses these claims and suggests at least one of these photoshoots took place in a property owned by one of the UAE’s royal families.

In a 2021 [investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2021/02/08/how-instagram-celebrities-promote-dubais-underground-animal-trade/), Bellingcat uncovered how several celebrities were acquainted with underground procurers of the animals they posed with in Instagram stories to their millions of followers. A variety of young exotic animals, including tigers, lions, monkeys and even endangered species like cheetahs were found to be kept in a small apartment and sold internationally by an individual operating an anonymous account.

Celebrities such as MoVlogs, a YouTuber with over 10 million followers, and Saygin Yalcin, an influencer with over one million followers on both Instagram and Youtube, were acquainted with this dealer. They had visited the dealer’s apartment and tagged his name in their posts. Shortly after Bellingcat reached out for comment in 2021, the dealer deleted his account that had thousands of followers.

However, both MoVlogs and Saygin Yalcin have since continued to pose with tiger and lion cubs in private homes.

In two separate vlogs from 2019 and 2020, the influencers claimed these cubs were brought by their royal friend because they were either “rescued” or outside a zoo for a “quick medical checkup”.

However, there is no sign of a veterinarian in either of the videos. Wildlife experts told Bellingcat that removing cubs from their mother for a prolonged period at such a young age could endanger their development, their health and leave them distressed. Experts Bellingcat spoke to said that claims of “rescue” or “medical checkup” appear to make little sense.

Animal welfare campaigners have repeatedly [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/04/celebrity-ape-selfies-harming-efforts-to-curb-wildlife-trafficking-un-body-warns) that the widespread practice of animal photoshoots perpetuates a booming [illegal trade](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/how-you-can-help-fight-the-illegal-cheetah-cub-trade) in exotic and often endangered animals. “It’s two-fold”, says Chris Lewis, captivity researcher at international wildlife charity, [Born Free](https://www.bornfree.org.uk/). “There’s the element of seeing animals on social media, which creates a feeling of someone else wanting it. There’s also the element of an animal in a non-native, or domestic setting, which desensitises people to what that animal actually is and needs.”

The vloggers are reluctant to reveal much information about the true identity of their ‘royal friend’, but Bellingcat has been able to discover that one of the videos was filmed at a house owned by the ruling Al Mualla family of the Emirate of Umm Al-Quwain, one of the constituent emirates of the UAE.

Bellingcat reached out to the royal family of Umm Al-Quwain to ascertain why videoshoots with two popular vloggers had taken place at the property, but received no response by the time of publication.

## **Cubs and Claims**

The claim that royalty is involved is made in two videos, one featuring lion cubs and another featuring tiger cubs.

On 15 June 2019, Saygin published a video to YouTube that showed two lion cubs (hereafter referred to as the ‘lion cub vlog’).

In both the video as well as the description, Saygin says that “my friend from the royal family has rescued 2 baby lions”, but does not specify who this royal family member is.

The cubs are brought to what is described as Saygin’s home, where he plays around with them. He is later joined by MoVlogs, who uploaded his own YouTube video of the same visit. In MoVlogs’ video, Saygin adds that “they found and they rescued them, and now they are here”, but does not elaborate on where the royal family member found these cubs, nor what they needed rescuing from.

“These are called Tsavo lions”, explains Saygin with a smile, “and they’re really, really rare!”

In June 2020, almost exactly a year after this video was published, MoVlogs uploaded a video (hereafter referred to as the ‘tiger cub vlog’) in which he met up with Saygin Yalcin again to see newborn tigers.

At the start of the video MoVlogs [states](https://youtu.be/qCfjwfFkK0Y?t=279): “My friend Saygin, he actually invited me to his friend’s house, who is a part of the royal family because.. To own a pet tiger… I mean regular people aren’t allowed to own pet tigers. I don’t think that’s a sane thing to have*.”*

A UAE federal law introduced in 2016 [states](https://archive.org/details/federal-law-no.-22-of-2016-regulating-the-possession-of-dangerous-animals/page/n1/mode/2up?view=theater): “Every natural or legal person shall be prohibited from owning, possessing, trading or breeding dangerous animals*”.* The accompanying list of “dangerous” animals includes all ‘Felidae’ with the exception of domestic cats. Lions and tigers are members of the Felidae genus.

While this law does make exceptions for licensed facilities such as zoos and breeding centres, even these facilities cannot “move animals from one place to another” without obtaining consent from the ministry and meeting stringent conditions. It is not fully clear from the videos alone whether any laws were broken or if any of the exceptions within the legal framework were met.

According to both MoVlogs and Saygin, the tiger cubs are about five days old, and can’t open their eyes yet. Both also state, five times in all throughout the tiger cub vlog, that the reason the cubs were at this building that day is for a “quick medical checkup” before they are “...
