# "Pwned", The Book, Is Now Available for Free

06 December 2024

Nearly four years ago now, [I set out to write a book with Charlotte and Rob](https://www.troyhunt.com/im-writing-a-book-with-rob-conery-and-its-gonna-be-awesome/)It was the stories behind the stories, the things that drove me to write my most important blog posts, and then the things that happened afterwards. It's almost like a collection of meta posts, each one adding behind-the-scenes commentary that most people reading my material didn't know about at the time.

It was a strange time for all of us back then. I didn't leave the country for the first time in over a decade. I barely even left the state. I had time to toil on the passion project that became this book. As I wrote about years later, [there were also other things occupying my mind at the time](https://www.troyhunt.com/divorce/). Writing this book was cathartic, providing me the opportunity to express some of the emotions I was feeling at the time and to reflect on life.

Speaking of reflecting, [this week was Have I Been Pwned's 11th birthday](https://www-troyhunt-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/www.troyhunt.com/introducing-have-i-been-pwned/?ref=troyhunt.com). Reaching this milestone, getting back to travel (I'm writing this poolside with a beer at a beautiful hotel in Dubai), life settling down (while sitting next to [my amazing wife](https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1601122643998298112?ref=troyhunt.com)), and it now being [2 years since we launched the book](https://www.troyhunt.com/pwned-the-book-is-finally-here/), I decided we should just give it away for free. I mean *really* free, not "give me all your personal details, then here's a download link" I mean, here are the *direct* download links:

1. [PDF](https://download.book.troyhunt.com/Pwned.pdf?ref=troyhunt.com)
2. [EPUB](https://download.book.troyhunt.com/Pwned.epub?ref=troyhunt.com)

I hope you enjoy the book. It's the culmination of so many things I worked so hard to create over the preceding decade and a half, and I'm really happy to just be giving it away now. Enjoy the book ðŸ˜Š
