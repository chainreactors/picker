Dedicated to the branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. This field involves the application of several information security principles and aims to provide for attribution and event reconstruction following forth from audit processes. This subreddit is not limited to just personal computers and encompasses all media that may also fall under digital forensics (e.g., cellphones, video, etc.).

# Wanting to get into computer forensics from tech support.

I am a level 1-3 (wear many hats) tech support rep for a security company in NYC. I have always admired the field and wanted to use my skills in that respect as opposed to just support. I am really only supporting other security professionals as opposed to end users but still...I feel my skills are being stagnant.

I primarily specialize in video surveillance and access control. I have no formal training other than some vendor specific security manufacturer certs. I do have almost 10 years in the security industry doing this kind of work.

My real passion is to dig into data and seek out anomalies, or strange behavior from software..as opposed to logging in to switches and rebooting ports for devices.

Could any of you guys share your experiences getting into the industry? I like my company and they treat me well...just have always had an immense respect for computer forensic work and wonder if it could be within reach for a guy like me.
