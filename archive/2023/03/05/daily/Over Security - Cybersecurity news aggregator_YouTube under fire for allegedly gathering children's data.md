# YouTube under fire for allegedly gathering children’s data

Posted: March 3, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

The UK’s children’s code, introduced three years ago by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), is all about [ensuring that companies make children’s privacy a primary consideration](https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/news-blogs/what-is-the-age-appropriate-design-code/) when creating sites and services, games, and toys. The code, also known as the Age Appropriate Design Code (AADC), may now be stepping into the digital privacy ring. Duncan McCann, who works for child advocacy group 5Rights, has [lodged a complaint with the ICO](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64786968) about YouTube.

The [Children’s code](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/age-appropriate-design-code/) applies to UK-based companies and also companies outside the UK involved in processing the personal data of UK children. In short, if an app or website is likely to be accessed by children, then there’s a good chance the code applies.

The complaint focuses on how YouTube collects children’s data and alleges that it is being handled poorly. If the allegations are true we could see the ICO [ordering Google to stop collecting the data](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/01/father-reports-youtube-to-watchdog-over-harvesting-uk-childrens-data), Google could by in line for a large fine.

McCann [claims that YouTube has broken the law](https://www.reuters.com/technology/youtube-child-data-gathering-faces-uk-scrutiny-after-complaint-2023-03-01/) by collecting “the location, viewing habits and preferences” of anything up to five million children. He wants YouTube to change how the platform is designed, and to delete the data which it has gathered. The Guardian also mentions that another part of the complaint asks the ICO to consider ordering YouTube to rollback or delete any [machine learning](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-machine-learning) systems trained on this data.

That’s quite the request, and McCann says that the ICO has three months to [let him know whether or not it will take on the investigation](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/youtube-ico-building-ofcom-b2291788.html).

Children uner 13 are, in theory, banned from using YouTube, and are supposed to use [YouTube Kids](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6172308?hl=en-GB) instead, which is stricter about data collection. For example, there are [no personalised ads](https://privacy.commonsense.org/privacy-report/YouTube-Kids) on YouTube Kids, and no sensitive video categories. This is not the case on the main site. You may have seen for yourself how easy it is for videos on YouTube that are about one thing to autoplay their way into content which is about something quite different, including content that is not suitable for those under 13.

Child data is a prominent topic for Google. Back in 2019, YouTube was fined $170m due to the [collection of children’s data without their parent’s consent](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/youtube-kids-fine-personal-data-collection-children-).

## Setting up YouTube Kids

If your children are making use of YouTube Kids, it’s a good idea to check out some of the [security and privacy settings available to you](https://support.google.com/youtubekids/answer/6172308). Assuming you are signed in, you can:
