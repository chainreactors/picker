Black Duck recently cosponsored "[The Cost of Poor Software Quality in the U.S.: A 2022 Report](/resources/analyst-reports/cost-poor-quality-software.html)” with the Consortium for Information and Software Quality (CISQ). The report investigates the ever-increasing financial impact of poor software quality, and the factors that further its continued growth.

At a high level, the report's findings reflect that as of 2022, the cost of poor software quality in the U.S.—which includes cyberattacks due to existing vulnerabilities, complex issues involving the software supply chain, and the growing impact of rapidly accumulating technical debt—will total approximately $2.41 trillion.

The report’s author, Herb Krasner, found that cybercrime is predicted to cost the world $7 trillion in 2022, making it a top priority for those tasked with security. According to the report, “the average cost of a data breach in the United States amounted to $9.44 million, up from $9.05 million in the previous year.”
