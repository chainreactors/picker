###### In recent weeks, two videos detailing the apparent execution of Armenian soldiers by Azerbaijani troops have been posted and shared widely on social media channels.

The footage is graphic and readers are warned that they may find some of the details in this article disturbing.

Bellingcat carried out an analysis of one of the videos, geolocating it (alongside others in the open source community) and identifying several pieces of evidence that would support chronolocation.

## **The latest escalation**

Armenia has claimed that intensive shelling by Azerbaijani forces beginning on September 13 culminated in a “large-scale provocation” in which several border areas were attacked.

While the Azerbaijani government confirmed the attacks, they said they were in response to Armenian provocations. The International Crisis Group (ICG) [stated](https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/upholding-ceasefire) that 207 Armenian and 80 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed.

The violent incidents were just the latest between the neighbouring nations.

In a six-week war in 2020, Azerbaijan seized much of the Armenian-governed Nagorno-Karabakh region, as well as adjacent regions under its control, which had declared independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The 2020 war ended in an unstable ceasefire agreement which saw Azerbaijani forces stationed along Armenia’s internationally recognised borders.

This is the context in which recent fighting occurred.

On October 2, Armenia’s foreign ministry said in a [statement](https://www.mfa.am/en/interviews-articles-and-comments/2022/10/02/Statement_PoWs/11661) that it would file a case with the international criminal court (ICC) in relation to footage showing the extrajudicial execution of prisoners of war. Its Azerbaijani counterpart [dismissed](https://www.mfa.gov.az/az/news/no46422) this as “hypocritical” in a statement of its own and highlighted several historical incidents dating back to the first Karabakh war in 1992 where it said Armenian forces were responsible for “unprecedented massacres”.

Azerbaijan’s statement added that “comprehensive investigations” had been launched by the Military Prosecutors Office of Azerbaijan to determine whether the videos were genuine.

Bellingcat’s analysis of the videos found no clear signs of editing or tampering. Bellingcat has obscured graphic content in stills from the video and associated images from the same location.

## **Geolocating the footage**

One of the videos, which depicted the mutilated body of an Armenian servicewoman, first appeared on September 15. It has, at time of publication, not been possible to geolocate this footage.

The second video was first posted on October 1 and depicts a similarly graphic event but a different location. It shows a group of men in military uniforms at a mountain-top position which they have just seized. Another group of men, who appear to have been captured and are wearing different military uniforms, are lined up without their weapons.

Seventeen seconds into the video, at least three men open fire at those who have been lined up and disarmed. Voices shouting “don’t shoot” and “stop firing” in Azerbaijani can be heard, the former just before shots are fired and the latter after the men have been shot. It is not clear who makes these shouts due to the quality of the footage.

The video has been shared widely on pro-Azerbaijani channels, claiming that it showed the execution of Armenian soldiers by Azerbaijani troops.

Both the Azerbaijani language spoken in the video and camouflage patterns on the shooters’ uniforms (as will be explored in detail later) could suggest that they are members of the Azerbaijani armed forces, though the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Bellingcat that the authorities are investigating the authenticity of the video and cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.

Several posts circulated on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/armenia_empire/status/1576604537171103744) and [Telegram](https://t.me/gorbagor20222022/178401) shortly after discussing the area around [Lake Sev](https://goo.gl/maps/uACFPS1U4QVCnacs6), located at Mount Mets Ishkhanasar, as a potential location for where this video was filmed. However, the [coordinates](https://goo.gl/maps/5LBBP2xDCPbwgoB8A) did not appear to match with the footage.

On October 3, the Libération journalists Alexandre Horn and Fabian Leboucq [claimed](https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/execution-de-prisonniers-armeniens-comment-checknews-a-geolocalise-le-crime-de-guerre-a-partir-dune-video-20221005_IV2SDMSKAZAHXKBNEPMCCX7EXQ/?utm_medium=Social&xtor=CS7-51-&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1664976127) to have geolocated the footage to a mountain ridge in Armenian territory on the border with Azerbaijan, south of the lake.

> We (with [@LeboucqF](https://twitter.com/LeboucqF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)) might have found the location where at least 7 armenians POWs were killed by AZ forces sept 13th :

Bellingcat had at the time been looking in the same area and has been able to independently confirm Horn and Leboucq’s geolocation.

Looking at the video itself there were interesting features contained within it, but not enough to confirm exactly where the incident took place

A message posted to a Telegram channel focusing on the Azerbaijani military on September 13 provided further clues. It also showed what appeared to be dead Armenian soldiers. Items and elements seen in these images were identical to those seen on the execution video that would be published just over two weeks later.

These included a metal grille, ammo boxes, rocks and distinctive terrain markings. The dead soldiers in these images were also wearing the same uniform as those seen in the execution video and the number visible (nine) was the same in the images and videos.
