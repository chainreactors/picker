Everything feels secure‚Äîuntil one small thing slips through. Even strong systems can break if a simple check is missed or a trusted tool is misused. Most threats don't start with alarms‚Äîthey sneak in through the little things we overlook. A tiny bug, a reused password, a quiet connection‚Äîthat's all it takes.

Staying safe isn't just about reacting fast. It's about catching these early signs before they blow up into real problems. That's why this week's updates matter. From stealthy tactics to unexpected entry points, the stories ahead reveal how quickly risk can spread‚Äîand what smart teams are doing to stay ahead. Dive in.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[U.S. Disrupts N. Korea IT Worker Scheme](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/us-arrests-key-facilitator-in-north.html)** ‚Äî Prosecutors said they uncovered the North Korean IT staff working at over 100 U.S. companies using fictitious or stolen identities and not only drawing salaries, but also stealing secret data and plundering virtual currency more than $900,000 in one incident targeting an unnamed blockchain company in Atlanta. The actions are the latest steps to stop the scheme, which has seen North Korea earn millions through thousands of people who use fake identities to get hired as IT workers at companies based in the West and other parts of the world. Authorities conducted 21 searches across 14 states last month, adding to searches that were conducted at eight locations in October 2024 spanning three states. In at least one case, North Korean IT workers gained access to "sensitive employer data and source code, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) data," after they were hired by a California-based defense contractor that develops artificial intelligence-powered equipment and technologies, the Justice Department said. In all, the coordinated action led to the arrest of one individual, and the seizure of 21 web domains, 29 financial accounts used to launder tens of thousands of dollars, and nearly 200 laptops and remote access devices, including KVMs. The U.S. State Department is [offering rewards](https://rewardsforjustice.net/index/?north-korea=north-korea) of up to $5 million for information leading to the "disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support North Korea." The actions reveal that North Koreans didn't merely falsify IDs to insinuate themselves into Western tech firms, but also allegedly stole the identities of "more than 80 U.S. persons" to impersonate them in jobs at more than 100 U.S. companies and funnel money to the Kim regime.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Chinese Threat Actor Targets French Orgs Using Ivanti Flaws](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/chinese-hackers-exploit-ivanti-csa-zero.html)** ‚Äî A China-linked intrusion set known as Houken targeted a number of entities spanning governmental, telecommunications, media, finance, and transport sectors in France in early September 2024 using three vulnerabilities in Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance (CSA) devices as zero-days. The attacks have been observed paving the way for PHP web shells, deploying a kernel rootkit, and even attempting to patch the vulnerabilities, likely to prevent exploitation by other unrelated actors. It's suspected that Houken is an initial access broker that obtains a foothold into target networks, and passes on that access to other threat actors for follow-on post-exploitation activities.
* **[New Chrome 0-Day Exploited in the Wild](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/google-patches-critical-zero-day-flaw.html)** ‚Äî Google released security updates to address a type confusion flaw in its Chrome web browser that it said has been exploited in the wild. The exact nature of the attacks is presently not known, although it's believed to have been deployed as part of highly-targeted attacks due to the fact that it was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), which specializes in detecting government-backed attacks. It has been patched in versions 138.0.7204.96/.97 for Windows, 138.0.7204.92/.93 for macOS, and 138.0.7204.96 for Linux.
* **[U.S. Sanctions Russian Bulletproof Hosting Provider Aeza](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/us-sanctions-russian-bulletproof.html)** ‚Äî The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Russia-based bulletproof hosting (BPH) service provider Aeza Group for providing the infrastructure that enabled threat actors to deliver stealer malware and ransomware like BianLian, RedLine, Meduza, and Lumma, as well as host illicit drugs marketplace on the dark web. In addition, three of the company's subsidiaries and four main individuals linked to it have been sanctioned.
