I've been doing bug bounties for over 10 years now and over time, I have grown fonder of the life changing effects it has had for me. From job prospects, to being able to financially support those around me and myself. I believe that if you're passionate about information security and you take pride in your work, you can also find success in bug bounties, and hopefully it causes a ripple of positivity in your career and life.

I'm writing this blog post because I genuinely believe that hard work and a dedication to learning will lead you to success in bug bounties. Additionally, I am eternally grateful for the number of free resources that I have relied on to teach myself the skills to be good at bug bounties. I hope that this blog post explains the many learnings I have had over the last ten years.
