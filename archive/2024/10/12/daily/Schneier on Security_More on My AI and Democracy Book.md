## More on My AI and Democracy Book

In July, I [wrote](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/07/upcoming-book-on-ai-and-democracy.html) about my new book project on AI and democracy, to be published by MIT Press in fall 2025. My co-author and collaborator [Nathan Sanders](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nathan-sanders) and I are hard at work writing.

At this point, we would like feedback on titles. Here are four possibilities:

1. Rewiring the Republic: How AI Will Transform our Politics, Government, and Citizenship- The Thinking State: How AI Can Improve Democracy- Better Run: How AI Can Make our Politics, Government, Citizenship More Efficient, Effective and Fair- AI and the New Future of Democracy: Changes in Politics, Government, and Citizenship

What we want out of the title is that it convey (1) that it is a book about AI, (2) that it is a book about democracy writ large (and not just deepfakes), and (3) that it is largely optimistic.

What do you like? Feel free to do some mixing and matching: swapping “Will Transform” for “Will Improve” for “Can Transform” for “Can Improve,” for example. Or “Democracy” for “the Republic.” Remember, the goal here is for a title that will make a potential reader pick the book up off a shelf, or read the blurb text on a webpage. It needs to be something that will catch the reader’s attention. (Other title ideas are [here](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/07/upcoming-book-on-ai-and-democracy.html)).

Also, FYI, this is the current table of contents:

> Introduction
>
> Part I: AI-Assisted Politics
> 4. Background: Making Mistakes
> 5. Talking to Voters
> 6. Conducting Polls
> 7. Organizing a Political Campaign
> 8. Fundraising for Politics
> 9. Being a Politician
>
> Part II: AI-Assisted Legislators
> 10. Background: Explaining Itself
> 11. Background: Who’s to Blame?
> 12. Listening to Constituents
> 13. Writing Laws
> 14. Writing More Complex Laws
> 15. Writing Laws that Empower Machines
> 16. Negotiating Legislation
>
> Part III: The AI-Assisted Administration
> 17. Background: Exhibiting Values and Bias
> 18. Background: Augmenting Versus Replacing People
> 19. Serving People
> 20. Operating Government
> 21. Enforcing Regulations
>
> Part IV: The AI-Assisted Court
> 22. Background: Being Fair
> 23. Background: Getting Hacked
> 24. Acting as a Lawyer
> 25. Arbitrating Disputes
> 26. Enforcing the Law
> 27. Reshaping Legislative Intent
> 28. Being a Judge
>
> Part V: AI-Assisted Citizens
> 29. Background: AI and Power
> 30. Background: AI and Trust
> 31. Explaining the News
> 32. Watching the Government
> 33. Moderating, Facilitating, and Building Consensus
> 34. Acting as Your Personal Advocate
> 35. Acting as Your Personal Political Proxy
>
> Part VI: Ensuring That AI Benefits Democracy
> 36. Why AI is Not Yet Good for Democracy
> 37. How to Ensure AI is Good for Democracy
> 38. What We Need to Do Now
> 39. Conclusion

Everything is subject to change, of course. The manuscript isn’t due to the publisher until the end of March, and who knows what AI developments will happen between now and then.

EDITED: The title under consideration is “Rewiring the Republic,” and not “Rewiring Democracy.” Although, I suppose, both are really under consideration.

@ Bruce,

I would not go with titles 2&3, 1&4 are more open to change that will happen when you are writing the book.

Also,

> “What we want out of the title is that it convey (1) that it is a book about AI, (2) that it is a book about democracy writ large (and not just deepfakes), and (3) that it is largely optimistic.”

As the old joke punchline has it

“You can have any two out of three”

The one you won’t get is the third.

Politics is about power, and power is about discrimination and theft along with other harms to those who lack power.

AI of any form, not just the current LLM/ML fetish is a tool, and tools are agnostic to use.

It’s the “Directing Mind” that decides the use, and supposedly impartial observers that decide if the use is as far as society is concerned “Good or Bad”.

The general societal concern about technology is as it has been since the early 1990’s and what the fall of the Berlin Wall revealed was happening in the CCCP states. Much as it still is in Belarus and Hungary with one supposedly on either side of the EU and Russia sphere of influence boundary. But the reality both effectively run as “strong men” dictatorships held in place under Putin influence.

The result is people are aware of the “survailance state” in ways they formerly were not, and importantly the key factor technology plays in it.

You only have to look at Robo-Debt and similar to see how “political mantra” can be put in place with technology with few people involved to devastating effect.

AI will reduce the numbers involved whilst increasing the ability of those “strong men” to not just put in place their mantras but plunge them knife like into the very heart of society. All whilst maintaining an apparent “arms length distance”.

Thus those who should be named and shamed will have a defence of “the computer says” or similar to walk away unblamed and without consequence.

If you doubt this, reflect on what is happening on the US south boarder currently and what is turning into a battle ground driven by political mantra not rational thought. Now imagine boarder patrol by heavily armed drone carrying out “wish fulfilment” for certain “Congress Critters” and similar… If you doubt this there are a couple of other places in the world to think of right now where such things have got to the point of significant bloodshed, and worse, all because “individuals” who prance around as “strong men” and are shoring up their political position on piles of corpses strewn around vast areas of destruction.

Then turn your attention to the daily events in and around the South China Seas area and consider what is happening there and how.

What about the use in China of technology to “surveille the masses” and “weed out” by “social scoring” those that are seen as not being suitable citizens.
