# No thanks: Google lets its Gemini AI access your apps, including messages [updated]

Posted: July 8, 2025

If you’re an [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) user, you’ll need to take action if you don’t want Google’s Gemini [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) to have access to your apps. That’s because, regardless of your previous settings, Google now allows Gemini to interact with third-party apps.

Through [Gemini extensions](https://9to5google.com/2024/11/27/heres-the-full-list-of-gemini-extensions-and-what-they-can-do/), it already had the ability to integrate with apps to lend a helping hand and make Google Assistant obsolete. From an email I received in April from Google Gemini:

> **Gemini uses info from your devices and services to help you**
>
> Gemini uses this info to provide more customized and context-aware help. Gemini accesses certain system permissions and data, like call and message logs, contacts (to help you keep in touch), and screen content (to help you act on it).
>
> **Gemini works with apps**
> Gemini can respond with real-time info from other tools, apps, and services like Google Keep and YouTube. To allow connected apps to generate helpful responses, Gemini shares some of your info with them. You can manage your apps in your settings.

Then further on, it said:

> **Gemini activity and your choices**
> When you use Gemini, Google collects your activity, like your chats (including recordings of your Gemini Live interactions), what you share with Gemini (like files, images, and screens), product usage information, feedback, and info about your location. This data is stored in Activity (if it’s on), reviewed by trained reviewers, and used to improve Google services, including generative AI.

The bit about trained reviewers was enough for me to decide against using it. There are many AI options that offer a lot more privacy.

But now, according to [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/unless-users-take-action-android-will-let-gemini-access-third-party-apps/), Google has sent an email to Android users that takes it one step further.

> “We’ve made it easier for Gemini to interact with your device
> We’re updating how Gemini interacts with some of the apps on your Android device.
> Gemini will soon be able to help you use your Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and utilities on your phone, **whether your Gemini Apps Activity is on or off**.
>
> This change will **start automatically rolling out** on July 7, 2025.
> If you don’t want to use these features, you can turn them off in the Apps settings page.
>
> **If you have already turned these features off, they will remain off.**
>
> For more details on how these features work with your data, please see the [Gemini Apps Privacy Hub](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en).”

*Note: I did not receive this email and the Gemini app is not on my phone. That could be because I’m using a Samsung phone and Samsung offers Bixby as a virtual assistant. It might be my location: sometimes...
