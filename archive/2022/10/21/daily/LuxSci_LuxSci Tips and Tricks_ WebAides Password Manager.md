# LuxSci Tips and Tricks: WebAides Password Manager

October 20th, 2022

We are starting a new blog series to help you understand some of the more advanced LuxSci features. First, did you know that LuxSci has a password manager tool? We designed this tool to make it easy to securely share passwords across your organization.

## What is a Password Manager?

Password managers are software applications designed to store passwords securely. They require the use of one primary password to access an encrypted vault where passwords for other accounts are stored. There are many different password managers out there, with varying features and levels of security.

## **LuxSci’s WebAides Password Manager**

WebAides Password Manager allows LuxSci users to create and securely store lists of passwords. It was designed to suit the needs of businesses and IT administrators.

With just a single primary password to remember, it’s easier to protect and store unique, complex passwords. This offers both security and convenience. WebAides Password Manager uses PGP encryption to safely store passwords for individual users or groups. This setup means that LuxSci employees cannot access the password data of our customers.

The tool is flexible, allowing administrators to control access to shared passwords. If someone is not a group member, they cannot decrypt the password. Administrators can easily add or remove users from groups to tightly control access to sensitive accounts.

## Why Use WebAides Password Manager

The granular level of access control makes it extremely easy to share passwords among designated individuals from a central, secure location. Administrators can create multiple password folders to tightly control access to sensitive credentials. For example, when an employee is promoted, they may need to access different accounts. The administrator can add the employee as a member of a management password group and provide them with the primary password to access those account logins.

The tool also includes an export feature for business continuity and disaster recovery. Administrators can decrypt and backup the entire password web archive for offline storage. An offline backup of company passwords protects the organization in case of a catastrophe that brings standard systems down.

LuxSci’s WebAides Password Manager also includes a notes section for each entry. This is a great place to securely document account numbers, previously used passwords, and the security question and answers used to reset passwords or verify identity.

These features are useful for organizations with complex security and compliance needs.

## How to Set Up WebAides Password Manager

Detailed instructions can be found in our Help documentation. To access your WebAides Password Manager, log in to your WebMail account and look under Apps -> Passwords. Before creating a new entry, you’ll need to generate a PGP certificate to encrypt the password. This can be done by going to the Account Settings â€“> Security -> Security Certificates settings.

Our support team is also available and ready to help. Contact us today to learn more.
