***Here's How to Enhance Your Cyber Resilience with CVSS***

In late 2023, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v4.0 was unveiled, succeeding the eight-year-old CVSS v3.0, with the aim to enhance vulnerability assessment for both industry and the public. This latest version introduces additional metrics like safety and automation to address criticism of lacking granularity while presenting a revised scoring system for a more comprehensive evaluation. It further emphasizes the importance of considering environmental and threat metrics alongside the base score to assess vulnerabilities accurately.

## Why Does It Matter?

The primary purpose of the CVSS is to evaluate the risk associated with a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities, particularly those found in network products, present a clear and significant risk as unauthenticated attackers can easily exploit them to gain remote control over affected systems. These vulnerabilities have frequently been exploited over the years, often serving as entry points for ransomware attacks.

Vulnerability assessment systems employ predefined factors to quantify vulnerabilities' likelihood and potential impact objectively. Among these systems, CVSS has emerged as an internationally recognized standard for describing key vulnerability characteristics and determining severity levels.

CVSS evaluates vulnerabilities based on various criteria, utilizing metrics with predefined options for each metric. These metrics contribute to calculating a severity score ranging from 0.0 to 10.0, with 10.0 representing the highest severity level. These numerical scores are then mapped to qualitative categories such as "None," "Low," "Medium," "High," and "Critical," mirroring the terminology commonly used in vulnerability reports.

The metrics employed in determining severity are categorized into three groups:

1. Base Metrics
2. Temporal Metrics
3. Environmental Metrics

Each group provides specific insights into different aspects of the vulnerability, aiding in a comprehensive assessment of its severity and potential impact.

By utilizing Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) identifiers:

* companies can effectively track known vulnerabilities across their systems, allowing them to allocate resources for patching and remediation based on the level of risk posed by each vulnerability.
* They ensure that limited resources are utilized efficiently to address critical security concerns.
* Standardization through CVSS and CVE **enhances interoperability between security tools and systems**, enabling more accurate detection and response to potential threats by correlating network events with known vulnerabilities.
* Integration of threat intelligence feeds into security tools is facilitated by CVSS and CVE, allowing for identifying and prioritizing threats based on their association with known CVEs.
* Knowledge of CVSS scores and CVE identifiers also enables **faster and more effective incident response,** with tools automatically correlating network events with relevant CVEs to provide security teams with actionable information for prompt mitigation.
* Understanding CVSS and CVE aids companies in meeting **regulatory compliance requirements**, enabling them to identify, prioritize, and address vulnerabilities in accordance with regulatory frameworks.

CVSS assists in assessing vulnerability severity, allowing companies to prioritize patches and mitigation efforts effectively, focusing resources on addressing critical vulnerabilities first.

## Where is it Used?

Security tools like EDR benefit from regularly incorporating data sourced from reputable CVE databases. These databases furnish details regarding known vulnerabilities, including their unique CVE identifiers and corresponding CVSS scores.

1. By aligning CVEs with signatures, EDR develops rules or signatures based on CVE particulars, with each signature corresponding to a specific vulnerability identified by its CVE.
2. Upon detecting activity that matches a signature, the EDR triggers an alert.
3. Subsequently, EDRs can hinder or isolate endpoints in response to CVE-related alerts.
4. Security teams typically utilize multiple CVE databases to monitor vulnerabilities and update their security arsenal to safeguard clients against potential threats.

Result: when a novel CVE arises, the EDR solution is promptly updated with its signature, enabling preemptive blocking of zero-day attacks at the network periphery, often preceding vendor patch deployment on vulnerable systems.

While EDR and firewalls effectively obstruct attempts to exploit known CVEs, they commonly face challenges in devising generic rules and conducting behavior analysis to identify exploit attacks from emerging or unfamiliar threat vectors.
