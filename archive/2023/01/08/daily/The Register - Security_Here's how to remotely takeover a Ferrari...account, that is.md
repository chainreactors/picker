Multiple bugs affecting millions of vehicles from almost all major car brands could allow miscreants to perform any manner of mischief — in some cases including full takeovers —  by exploiting vulnerabilities in the vehicles' telematic systems, automotive APIs and supporting infrastructure, according to security researchers.

Specifically, the vulnerabilities affect Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Ford, Porsche, Toyota, Jaguar and Land Rover, plus fleet management company Spireon and digital license plate company Reviver.

The research builds on Yuga Labs' Sam Curry's earlier car hacking expeditions that uncovered flaws affecting [Hyundai and Genesis vehicles](https://twitter.com/samwcyo/status/1597695281881296897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1597695281881296897%7Ctwgr%5E7ffcb9ffe2f6f234cdb9dbb3d019b76c5eec10df%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsamcurry.net%2Fweb-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry%2F), as well as Hondas, Nissans, Infinitis and Acuras via an authorization flaw in [Sirius XM's Connected Vehicle Services](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/30/siriusxm_connected_cars_hacking/).
