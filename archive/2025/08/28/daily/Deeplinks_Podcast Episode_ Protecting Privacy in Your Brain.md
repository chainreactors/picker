The human brain might be the grandest computer of all, but in this episode, we talk to two experts who confirm that the ability for tech to decipher thoughts, and perhaps even manipulate them, isn't just around the corner – it's already here. Rapidly advancing "neurotechnology" could offer new ways for people with brain trauma or degenerative diseases to communicate, [as the New York Times reported this month](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/science/brain-neuroscience-computers-speech.html?unlocked_article_code=1.eE8.HKxe.lfZy4CQNJQlR&smid=url-share), but it also could open the door to abusing the privacy of the most personal data of all: our thoughts. Worse yet, it could allow manipulating how people perceive and process reality, as well as their responses to it – a Pandora’s box of epic proportions.
