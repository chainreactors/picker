# HackBench: Can Language Models Hack Real-World Bugs?

Every other day, a new benchmark emerges, and before long, the latest LLM saturates it. Among these, swe-bench stands out, as it evaluates LLMs on real-world GitHub issuesâ€”where state-of-the-art models already solve half of the challenges. This naturally raises a critical question: How capable are LLMs in identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities?

This question holds significant weight, as advanced models can be leveraged for both ethical security auditing and malicious exploitation. To address this concern, we introduce HackBench a continuously evolving benchmark designed to assess LLMs' proficiency in vulnerability detection and exploitation.
