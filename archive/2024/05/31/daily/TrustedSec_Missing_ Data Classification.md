## Picked Last Again

Data Classification is generally missing from many Information Security programs, unfortunately. The growth and maturity of most security programs is typically organic and follows in the wake of the growth of the business itself. This organic growth naturally results in less mature programs remaining reactive for many years, focusing on the deployment of controls to help protect business-critical data from being breached.

So, unsurprisingly, Data Classification isn't generally picked first when assembling a team of top security program components. Organically grown programs tend to stack their lineups with heavy-hitting controls like VPNs, backup solutions, MFA, and EDRs, which are all important components for sure.

## Program Measurements

Measuring an organization's security program boils down to three (3) primary focus areas:

* Program Maturity - Does the program include all of the components that it should?
* Organizational Effectiveness - How effectively are those components protecting business-critical data?
* Business Risk - What is the likelihood that business-critical data becomes breached or unavailable, and what are the financial ramifications if this happens?

The above list is not a knock on Compliance, which is a crucial component for many industries. It is generally agreed upon in infosec circles that the best way to achieve compliance is to focus more on the security components of the program and less on complying to specific frameworks. Compliance being the result of a strong security-focused program.

Maturity and Risk are commonly measured in most organizations who take the protection of business-critical data seriously. Effectiveness is less commonly measured in both organically grown as well as highly mature security programs. I have several hypotheses as to why this is generally the case, but that can be for a different blog post.

Organizational effectiveness can be measured many ways. One example of measuring effectiveness is using a framework like MITRE ATT&CKÂ® to map the current tools in an organization's security stack to ATT&CK's data sources and components that can detect the known attack techniques documented in the framework. That being said, just because a tool that can detect certain attack techniques is present in an environment, it doesn't guarantee that those attack techniques will be detected, making it crucial to understand how well the tool has been deployed and is actively maintained to better measure its effectiveness.

This type of effectiveness measuring has been well documented across TrustedSec blogs and webinars (see [Attack Path Effectiveness](https://trustedsec.com/resources/webinars/a-more-efficient-attack-path-effectiveness-assessment)); however, it is not the only valuable measurement of effectiveness, and circles us back to Data Classification.

## Data Classification Applications

Data Classification is both a simple concept and a foundational aspect of Information Security and Risk Management. It is crucial in the identification of business-critical systems and their associated RTOs and RPOs. As organically grown security programs mature and become better aligned with business needs and priorities, risk analysis that looks at ...
