Hallo fellow researchers,

Myself, **Rafi Ahamed**. I am a Cyber Security Researcher from Bangladesh. I love to do things differently. Anyway, without further ado letâ€™s get to todayâ€™s topic.

**Todayâ€™s topic is all about exploitation of API endpoints using AuthToken. Not about finding one.**

Many of us finds **AuthToken** in our recon process but due not being able to show any impact this critical finding often gets rejected. I got rejected a few times myself.

## What is an API?

> API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.

## Assumptions

Letâ€™s assume you find an AuthToken or API token of any user in your recon process. Simply reporting that will give you a ***Not Applicable*** in most cases.

## Exploiting API via AuthToken

Recently I was testing a private program in **Bugcrowd** and in my recon process I found a **AuthToken** which you always get your hands on. But the tough part was exploiting it. First of all, the program didnâ€™t provided any ***credentials*** for testing and there wasnâ€™t any way to ***Sign Up*** either. So, I had no idea how their infrastructure actually works.

In my recon the token that I found was an **AuthToken** (written in the code) which could be an alternative to **Authentication Bearer** token that an API use for Authentication. Now, I got a hint that the token was more like an API token. But I had no idea how their API infrastructure works as I had no access to any user account or anything. So, I gave up on it.

The next when I was testing another web application, I saw an API call when updating the user info. I thought may be I can use this API call to exploit yesterdayâ€™s one. So, I send that request to **Repeater** using **Burp**. Changed the Host & request endpoint with one that I found in my recon process. This gave me a response like below:

I got **403 forbidden**. But this gave us some info that what Headers are missing. Then I added the token that I got using the **Header Name** that the response showed. This gave me a response like below:

**500 Internal Server Error!!**

That means I got a connection to the API. As you can see, the request is a POST request and there are no POST data in the request. Thatâ€™s why the application was showing **500 Internal Server Error.** Then I recon a little bit more & got some POST data that could use to test the endpoints. I sent the request again adding the POST data and I was shocked to see the response.

I got access to 100 clientâ€™s data. That moment I was like BoomðŸ¤¯

> *I quickly reported the bug to* ***Bugcrowd*** *& got triaged as* ***P1*** *along with a nice 4digit bounty.*

**Reported:** November 10th.

**Not Applicable**: November 13th.

**Triaged:** November 13th.

**Resolved:** November 14th.
