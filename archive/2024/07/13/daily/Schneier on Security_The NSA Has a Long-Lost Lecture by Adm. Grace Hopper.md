## The NSA Has a Long-Lost Lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper

The NSA has a video recording of a 1982 lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper titled “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People.” The agency is (so far) [refusing](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/jul/10/grace-hopper-lost-lecture-found-nsa/) to release it.

Basically, the recording is in an obscure video format. People at the NSA can’t easily watch it, so they can’t redact it. So they won’t do anything.

> With digital obsolescence threatening many early technological formats, the dilemma surrounding Admiral Hopper’s lecture underscores the critical need for and challenge of digital preservation. This challenge transcends the confines of NSA’s operational scope. It is our shared obligation to safeguard such pivotal elements of our nation’s history, ensuring they remain within reach of future generations. While the stewardship of these recordings may extend beyond the NSA’s typical purview, they are undeniably a part of America’s national heritage.

Surely we can put pressure on them somehow.

I’m still unhappy with her for at one point weighing in against public access to strong encryption. I haven’t been able to find a current reference to that comment. I don’t remember if it was in reference to the Davida lawsuit, the Bernstein lawsuit or the Clipper chip discussion.

Let me guess: It was recorded in Betamax, wasn’t it?

I understand that NSA needs to do some special handling to view this obscure format, but they **can** do that, but maybe for not much longer.

When you can view something, you surely can copy it (with a smart phone, or any ordinary video camera). Preferably, using a tripod.

Not preserving this presentation is simply lazyness. A 42 year old video surely does not contain important information that still must be kept secret.

Pressure on NSA? Good luck with that.

There are many companies built around helping customers digitize old media. It is hard to imagine this is a difficult technical problem. Maybe NVIDIA would donate a tiny fraction of the money they make selling “Hopper” GPUs to fund the digitization.

Finally we know how to hide our tracks from the omnipotent National
Security Agency… just communicate using obscure video formats.

This doesn’t ring true. Unless the legendary, unaparalleled technical
expertise of the agency is stumped by a Betamax cassette?

> Surely we can put pressure on them somehow.

To upgrade to VHS?

Gov SOP. When in doubt, do nothing.

In my early career years (1970-80s), I was fortunate to attend a guest lecture given by RADM Hopper (I think her rank at that time was either Commodore or Captain; I’d need to check a history book to recall that correctly), including a brief time “after class” to meet her and ask yet-another-question. What a wonderful lady, wit, spirit she was — and rather formidable in person. Truly and obviously one of technologies most important pioneers and teachers.

That a bunch of bureaucrats at a U.S. TLA-agency think that they should classify and withhold such an historically important document on the basis of “an obscure video format” is simply ludicrous, another deep-state overreach. A proposed solution? Have someone simply transcribe (manually, such services exist — or even AI?) this video into plain text — then the security weenies can REDACT those few phrases that she might have then-said which might still endanger “national security”. My own best guess is that there are from zero to three phrases/sentences which would rise to the level of “redactable”.

“Surely we can put pressure on them somehow.” If a public petition or letter-writing campaign emerges from this article, I’ll certainly contribute my signature or 2¢-worth.

Simple, create a video communication network using that video format. They will decode it in no time.

Did they even TRY opening it in VLC?
