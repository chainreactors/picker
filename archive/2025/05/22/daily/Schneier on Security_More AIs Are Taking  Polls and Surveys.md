## More AIs Are Taking Polls and Surveys

I already knew about the declining response rate for polls and surveys. The percentage of AI bots that [respond to surveys](https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/the-quiet-collapse-of-surveys-fewer) is also increasing.

Solutions are hard:

> 1. *Make surveys less boring.*
>
> 2. *Bot detection.*
> There’s a growing toolkit of ways to spot AI-generated responses—using things like response entropy, writing style patterns or even metadata like keystroke timing. Platforms should start integrating these detection tools more widely. Ideally, you introduce an element that only humans can do, e.g., you have to pick up your price somewhere in-person. Btw, note that these bots can easily be designed to find ways around the most common detection tactics such as Captcha’s, timed responses and postcode and IP recognition. Believe me, way less code than you suspect is needed to do this.
>
> 3. *Pay people more.*
> If you’re only offering 50 cents for 10 minutes of mental effort, don’t be surprised when your respondent pool consists of AI agents and sleep-deprived gig workers. Smarter, dynamic incentives—especially for underrepresented groups—can make a big difference. Perhaps pay-differentiation (based on simple demand/supply) makes sense?
>
> 4. *Rethink the whole model.*
> Surveys aren’t the only way to understand people. We can also learn from digital traces, behavioral data, or administrative records. Think of it as moving from a single snapshot to a fuller, blended picture. Yes, it’s messier—but it’s also more real.

If a survey or survey link is hosted by a third party, don’t do it. If it is hosted by the company that wants results but has many offsite scripts, don’t do it. If the company wants survey results but the questions they ask shows a thinking person that they will likely be used to increase prices or decrease service, don’t do it. If the survey demands positively identifying you (not just that you are a customer and haven’t already answered the survey) and you don’t trust the company not to store or forward to a company that will add it to their dossier (e.g. Lexus Nexis), don’t do it.

Come to think of it, I can’t recall many surveys that I answered because they don’t show me any respect for my privacy or give me reason to trust them.

I’ve starting making doctors appointments using \*67 (this blocks CID, but not ANI) because my provider didn’t understand that just because someone makes a call from a phone, that doesn’t mean they control it and they shouldn’t be texting surveys to every phone that calls them. The ironic thing is I verbally give them suggestions from time to time on how to improve their service (for me at least) and so far they have been ignored.

@ Bruce, ALL,

When I get accosted by “survey takers” be they electronic or human I know one thing,

“They will not pay what my time or knowledge / insight is worth.”

And as they know this before they even approach me, Their obvious intent is at best to rip me off or in some other way rob me.

I’m reasonably certain that others feel that way not just me.

So the suggestion of,

> *“3. Pay people more.”*

Is going to be at best ineffective.

It’s even more interesting when you deal with “focus groups” or what I call “Bogus groups” because the members are selected by their likely hood of being “yes-men”.

To see why you have to realise that the whole purpose of such groups is to say that what somebody already wants to do is a good idea… Not tell them the truth in plain unvarnished words they should be able to understand.

The organisers of such groups know that their income long term is based on their ability to get not “honest answers” or “correct answers” but “What we want to hear answers” of the people paying for the group to be set up…

I’ve had the misfortune to be the equivalent of “head hunted” by people wanting to get my thoughts on the cheap, it’s why I don’t give out information I can be traced by, nor do I respond to attempts by people to “get friendly” or equivalent beyond the boundaries I set.

I think one of the funniest ways I’ve ever seen to avoid being hunted is the “Eric Cantona” response.

For reasons that are not really relevant he got mobbed by a very large pack of journalists, doing what they can do, which if you’ve ever been on the receiving end can be quite scary.

They were asking some very stupid questions so Eric gave what is considered one of the most enigmatic answers,

> *“When the seagulls follow the trawler”*

And left them completely baffled (though if you’ve ever seen the seagulls descend as the nets get hauled in… you know exactly what he ment).

It was not long after that, that he retired from football for the second time, arguably when he was just coming into his best performance. It left people not just surprised but shocked. He eventually pointed out that,

> *“When you quit football it is not easy, your life becomes difficult. I should know because sometimes I feel I quit too young. I loved the game but I no longer had the passion to go to bed early, not to go out with my friends, not to drink, and not to do a lot of other things, the things I like in life.”*

So yeh the point is,

“Do you need that nonsense?”

And my view is not just “What’s in it for me?” But more importantly “Are there better things I could be doing?”

And that’s when you realise there is not enough money to answer those questions in the way they want.

So rather than be a “trawler” be a “sail boat gracefully heading for distant horizons via golden sunsets”.

ALL current public opinion polls are statistically invalid and do NOT measure what they boldly claim to measure. No fix is possible — polling is huge scam.

The ‘Non Response Rate’ is a catastrophic/fatal deficiency in all malor polls — typically over 90% of a poll’s initial people “Sample” do not participate and their views are unknown to pollsters & simply ignored totally.

Several o...
