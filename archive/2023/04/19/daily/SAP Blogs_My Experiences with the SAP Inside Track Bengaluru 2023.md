**Hello SAP Community**,

Here is my experience on [SAP Inside Track Bengaluru 4th March 2023](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/08/announcing-sap-inside-track-in-bengaluru-2023-sitblr2023/)

First time I was just an attendee in [SAP Inside Track Bengaluru 2022](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/16/sap-inside-track-bengaluru-oct-1st-2022/) and as always lot of learnings from the event!

This is the second time I attended this event as a speaker and very fortunate to get this opportunity to talk on **SAP Fiori for S/4HANA - Key User Extensibility Concepts**.

**Thank you SAP and the Core Team** - All our SAP Inside Track events have been successful today and this wouldn't have been possible without your support and dedicated team work!

Keep it going and can't thanks enough.
