## Dumb Password Rules

Examples of [dumb password rules](https://dumbpasswordrules.com/).

There are some pretty bad disasters out there.

My worst experiences are with sites that have artificial complexity requirements that cause my personal password-generation systems to fail. Some of the systems on the list are even worse: when they fail they don’t tell you why, so you just have to guess until you get it right.

Worse, I have had cases where you are told nothing, you are in, but are unable to login again.

What would be a really good companion to this is a set of good password rules.

Not rules for people who are generating passwords. We all know to use correct horse battery stapler by now.

Rules for people writing password checkers. Because, on a quick look through, most of the “dumb” password rules come from people who are honestly trying to help their customers out and make them choose good passwords. They just don’t know how to do it. Have a laugh at them by all means, but could we try to educate them too?

I’m not prepared to put up a complexity metric or a set of rules – it would inevitably be laughed at.

‘…but could we try to educate them too?’

“Hello, we here at Big Money Company value your business but don’t give a crap if all of your assets are stolen because WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR YOUR LOSSES HA HA HA HAAAAAAA. So, if you want to keep your stuff safe, create a complicated password (again, we don’t give a rat’s butt what you call ‘complicated’ so go for it). If you really don’t care about your information and money, let us suggest ‘password’ for your password…nobody will know . Have a great day.”

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : You say potata…

> “Some of the systems on the list are even worse: when they fail they don’t tell you why, so you just have to guess until you get it right.”

That is,

“Very obviously a security feature”

Thought up after a person realised it would make the coding cheaper and the rules could be changed when ever…

Sadly I’d like to think that it’s a joke, but…

As has been observed,

“Many a true word, spoken in jest”.

Looking at some of the examples, I am reminded by something that annoys me:
Random online store I will never use again and I will pay with PayPal so they don’t have my credit card info? Use whatever password you want!

Financial or medical site full of private information? Only 12 characters and limit which special characters are allowed!

Please Add: programmers who think they can validate email addresses using an algorithm they created. [And worse, they didn’t apply the algorithm when you created the account [link sent to validate], but DO apply it when you’re logging-in later]

To Those Programmers: Yes, “My.Name+YourCompany@gmail[.]com” is a valid address. It allows me to know where the spammer bought/stole my email address, and more importantly, “why would PayPal be using my email address to Walmart to inform me of a problem?”

Side Note: In his 1st edition of “Mastering Regular Expressions” Jeffrey E.F. Friedl spent half of his book creating a regular expression that “validated” email addresses following all current standards. It came with a final caveat: it didn’t allow ALL possibilities!

My least favorite rule is the one that forces you to change your password frequently for no good reason. There is very little to gain by changing a good password that works, and the very process opens you up to all sorts of phishing attempts. We have all been conditioned to respond to prompts and emails asking us to update our password, when in reality those could be fake phishing prompts.

Agree with @tom

That site appears to be nothing but a list of any site with password rules?

Surely it’s a good thing to try and encourage users to choose better passwords?

Probably the most useless, eventually proven counterproductive, password rule is the compulsory changing of passwords on a scheduled basis. Being a favourite of IT departments for applying internally to staff members, I guess that wouldn’t make such a site-focused list?

Regardless, probably the greatest systemic password policy failure in history is anything but site-specific: expecting users to nominate and remember a password at all.

This failure continues to this very day but at least was finally acknowledged and partially addressed by Mozilla when, decades too late, they stopped poking fun at individuals, like the linked list does, and actually integrated a password suggestion / generation function into Firefox.

Step one of providing users with the means to remember credentials has been built in to browsers for the longest time.

But to store what? Imagined passwords? Different for every site? Holding people hostage to this need when they’re just trying to get a sign up task done and get on with their day is ridiculous.

Step two was to provide access and synchronisation, to a user’s stored credentials, across multiple devices.

Step three: instead of neckbeard BOFH types clacking away in nanoseconds at some `pwgen` command line and laughing, abusing (flaming) anybody who doesn’t run Linux and use terminals to do the same, Firefox finally got right-click password suggestions.

Combined with using a master password to access Firefox, this makes a browser – not a separate app which is more cumbersome – a fairly reasonable, and practical – “password safe”.

Step four? Integrat...
