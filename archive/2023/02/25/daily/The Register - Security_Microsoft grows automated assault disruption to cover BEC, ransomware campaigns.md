## There’s no HumOR in cyberattacks

At last year's Ignite show, Microsoft talked up a capability in its 365 Defender that automatically detects and disrupts a cyberattack while still in progress, hopefully stopping or reducing any resulting damage. Now it's extending that to include additional criminal areas.

The [automatic attack disruption](https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/12/microsoft_ignite_security/) functionality aimed at corporate security operation centers (SOCs) uses millions of data points and signals to identify active malware campaigns – including ransomware – and take steps to automatically isolate the device under attack from the network and to suspended accounts compromised by the attackers.

The software and cloud services giant has now expanded the public preview of the automatic attack disruption capability to cover business email compromise (BEC) and human-operated ransomware (HumOR) attacks.
