## **Introduction**

The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack (2021) and SolarWinds supply chain attack (2020) were pivotal moments in cybersecurity, starting a new challenge for **Chief Information Security Officers** (**CISOs**). These attacks highlighted the importance of collaboration between CISOs and DevOps teams to ensure proper cloud security configurations.

In this article, we will outline the 6-step approach to fostering strong partnerships between CISOs, DevOps teams, IT management, and organizations that can help to drive innovation while maintaining a robust security posture. You will learn how a CISO can effectively communicate with IT leadership and what methods to try. Our narrative will emphasize the most crucial aspect of an organization's security - growing your strong security team and moving to a proactive approach.

Understanding such breaches, such as the Capital One data breach (2019), Epsilon data breach (2019), Magecart compromises (ongoing), and MongoDB breaches (2023-), presented the consequences of misconfigured cloud security. More than the fight against hackers and the consequences of their attacks, several vital problems stand out —the evolution of CISO's role and responsibilities, the challenge of improving cloud security, and how security operations teams collaborate with business units.

In the end, we will show you how to amplify your voice as CISO in your organization and touch on another critical question: How can a **[Managed Detection and Response](https://underdefense.com/services/managed-detection-and-response/?utm_source=hackernews.com&utm_medium=online_media&utm_campaign=article_may)** (MDR) provider help you? Augmenting your in-house team, providing additional layers of security and 24/7 monitoring - we will break down everything you need to know.

As our final thought - collaboration and using additional resources with expertise provided by an MDR prover will empower you to make better decisions as a CISO.

## **The High-Stakes Reality of Cybersecurity Leadership**

Imagine a race car speeding down the development track. The CTO, at the wheel, pushes for breakneck innovation. But in the backseat, the CISO sweats, gripping the metaphorical handbrake of security. This picture represents the ever-present dilemma for CISOs in the age of DevOps: **maintaining control over security** in a lightning-fast development environment.

We can agree that previously, security often came as an afterthought, bolted onto applications long after being put in production. There is a myth we want to debunk that MDR services are way too high, and small or medium businesses cannot afford them. For example, you get a pricing calculator and **[several MDR pricing models](https://underdefense.com/mdr-pricing/?utm_source=hackernews.com&utm_medium=online_media&utm_campaign=article_may)** to help you determine a cost-effective solution that aligns with your organization's specific requirements and budget.

Why it's important? While promoting agility, DevOps can introduce vulnerabilities if security isn't taken care of from the start. Successful development teams focused on speed might unintentionally introduce security gaps. Legacy security approaches, reliant on manual processes and limited resources, simply need to catch up with the breakneck pace of DevOps.

One view of the modern view of IT management places the CTO at the forefront of tech-related business concerns, including moving all the infrastructure to the cloud. At the same time, the CISO focuses on security, and securing the cloud becomes one of the top priorities. The pace of change and the completely new architecture, in the case of the cloud, present new challenges for CISOs who face a constantly changing environment. It's important to adapt their communication style to effectively collaborate with CTOs increasingly focused on bringing innovations and driving business growth.

### **The Real-World Consequences for CISOs**

The Securities and Exchange Commission (**SEC**) **filing alleges that SolarWinds** failed to disclose adequate information to investors regarding cybersecurity risks. The filing states that the company and its CISO *Timothy Brown only disclosed generic and hypothetical risks despite internal knowledge of specific deficiencies in SolarWinds' cybersecurity* practices and a heightened threat possibility.

The most infamous cases that everyone should be aware of, **SolarWinds** and **Uber breaches**, weren't just data breaches. They were wake-up calls. Legal repercussions for security failures are a growing concern, with the SEC mandating public companies to disclose incidents within four days and requiring detailed security plans. This puts immense pressure on CISOs like Joe Sullivan (Uber's former Chief Security Officer) and Timothy G. Brown (SolarWinds' former CISO), who could face criminal charges for failing to implement adequate safeguards.
