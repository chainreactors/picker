If you Google "third-party data breaches" you will find many recent reports of data breaches that were either caused by an attack at a third party or sensitive information stored at a third-party location was exposed. Third-party data breaches don't discriminate by industry because almost every company is operating with some sort of vendor relationship – whether it be a business partner, contractor or reseller, or the use of IT software or platform, or another service provider. Organizations are now sharing data with an average of 730 third-party vendors, according to a [report by Osano](https://www.osano.com/privacy-breach-link#:~:text=The%20Osano%20Data%20Privacy%20and%20Data%20Breach%20Link%20reveals%20a,over%20the%20past%20fifteen%20years.), and with the acceleration of digital transformation, that number will only grow.

## **The Importance of Third-Party Risk Management**

With more organizations sharing data with more third-party vendors, it shouldn't be surprising that more than 50% of security incidents in the past two years have stemmed from a third-party with access privileges, according to a [CyberRisk Alliance report.](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8dfc263a3c38a639103d4a/61f00a89548fd60bfbced0d5_ThirdPartyRisk_report_Trava.pdf)

Unfortunately, while most security teams agree that supply chain visibility is a priority, the same report notes that only 41% of organizations have visibility into their most critical vendors and only 23% have visibility into their entire third-party ecosystem.

The reasons for the lack of investment into Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) are the same that we consistently hear – lack of time, lack of money and resources, and it's a business need to work with the vendor. So, how can we make it easier to overcome the barriers to managing third-party cyber risk? Automation.

## **The Benefits of Automation**

Automation empowers organizations to do more with less. From a security perspective, here are just some of the benefits automation provides, as [highlighted by Graphus](https://www.graphus.ai/blog/10-facts-about-security-automation/):

* [76 % of IT executives](https://resources.stottandmay.com/cyber-security-in-focus-2020) in a cybersecurity survey said that automation maximizes the efficiency of security staff.
* Security automation can [save more than 80%](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-45839https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-45839) over the cost of manual security.
* [42% of companies](https://resources.stottandmay.com/cyber-security-in-focus-2020) cited security automation as a major factor in their success at improving their cybersecurity posture.

With regards to TPRM, automation can transform your program by:

### **Step 1 - Assess your vendors with Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)**

Continuous threat exposure assessments include comprehensive assessments that incorporate the following:

* Automated asset discovery
* External infrastructure/Network Assessments
* Web application security assessment
* Threat intelligence informed analysis
* Dark web findings
* More accurate security rating

This is a more comprehensive analysis of third parties compared to just sending questionnaires. A manual questionnaire process can take between 8-40 hours per vendor, provided that the vendor responds quickly and accurately. But this approach doesn't allow the ability to see vulnerabilities or validate the effectiveness of the required controls in a questionnaire.

Incorporating an automated threat exposure assessment capability and integrating it with questionnaires can reduce the time to review vendors, and we've found that the combination can [reduce the time to assess and onboard new vendors by 33%.](https://fortifydata.com/case-study/fortifydata-helps-riskonnect/)

### **Step 2 – Use a Questionnaire Exchange**

Organizations that manage many questionnaires, or vendors that respond to many questionnaires, should consider using a questionnaire exchange. Simply stated, it's a hosted repository of completed standard or custom questionnaires that can be shared with other interested parties upon approval.

If you select a platform that performs the automation described above, both parties get a verified and automated approach to the most recent questionnaires that are auto-validated by continuous assessments. Again, this can save your team time by requesting access to existing questionnaires or scaling their time in the response of a new questionnaire that can be reused upon request.

### **Step 3 - Continuously combine threat exposure findings with the questionnaire exchange**

Security ratings alone don't work. Using questionnaires alone to assess third parties doesn't work. Threat exposure management, which incorporates accurate security ratings from the direct assessments, combined with validated questionnaires - where the questionnaire is querying the assessment and updating the security rating - provides you with a powerful solution for continuous Third-Party Risk Management. Platforms that use active and passive assessments, and don't solely rely on historical OSINT data, provide the most accurate attack surface visibility – since it's of a third-party at that time.

This information can be leveraged to auto-validate the applicable controls in the questionnaire for security and compliance framework requirements and flag any discrepancy between the client answer and...
