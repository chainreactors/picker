If you read the message below and get a sense of déjà vu, it's probably because you like to spend time in the [Coffee Corner](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/coffee-corner/gh-p/Coffee-Corner) -- and this post copies what I wrote over there. Yes, I know that means I'm breaking the rules of engagement about duplicate content (and, yes, I know that's especially bad considering that I dedicate myself to community moderation), but I really want to make sure that I'm getting the word out -- so I hope you'll overlook my violation because I really have the best interests of the community in mind!

To repeat what I posted in the Coffee Corner: If you have profiles with [groups.community.sap.com/](https://groups.community.sap.com/), people.sap.com, and [learning.sap.com](http://learning.sap.com/), we're interested in your input.

Our product design team will be conducting 45-minute sessions this month to get a sense of how people are using profiles, and I'd like to invite you to participate.

There’s absolutely nothing for you to prepare, and there are no right or wrong answers. All that is required is your time and honest opinion! This is a great opportunity to give direct feedback and help shape the future profile experience.

Volunteer slots are limited, and we can't guarantee that all volunteers will be selected, so if you want to join a session, please let us know at your earliest convenience by sending an email to sapcommunity@sap.com with your full name and time zone. We'll then forward your information to our product design team, who will handle scheduling.

Thanks so much for your consideration (and for not reporting me!). I mean...I did mix things up by adding an image, so it's not *exactly* the same. See?
