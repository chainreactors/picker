Release Notes: TI Lookup Notifications, Upgraded Linux Sandbox, STIX Reports,
and More

Welcome to [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_oct_24&utm_term=061124&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s monthly updates, where we share our latest achievements and improvements.

October has been another productive month here at ANY.RUN, filled with new features to enhance your cybersecurity toolkit. We’ve introduced **TI Lookup Notifications** for real-time threat updates, rolled out a newly improved **Linux sandbox** for smoother malware analysis, and added the ability to export **STIX reports** for seamless data sharing.

In addition, we’ve expanded our detection capabilities with a range of **new signatures** and **YARA rules**, empowering you with even stronger threat coverage.

And that’s just the beginning!

Let’s dive into all the exciting updates from ANY.RUN this month.

## Product Updates

### Upgraded Linux Sandbox

At ANY.RUN, we’re always working to improve our services, and this time, we’ve focused on making our [**Linux sandbox**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/linux-malware-analysis-sandbox/) even better. This upgrade brings a seamless, stable experience on par with our Windows environment, making it easier than ever to analyze Linux malware in real time.

We’ve fine-tuned the Linux sandbox with new features and enhancements to boost both performance and usability. Here’s a quick overview of what’s new and how these updates benefit you:

* **File events tracking**: Monitor and log all file actions—whether malware is creating, modifying, or deleting files, you’ll see it all in the analysis report.
* **Improved process tree**: Navigating the process tree is now lag-free, letting you analyze malware behaviors more efficiently.
* **Real-time file uploads**: You can now upload files during an active session, adding flexibility to your investigation without needing to restart.

### STIX Reports

In October, we enhanced ANY.RUN’s capabilities by introducing the option to export threat analysis data in the [Structured Threat Information eXpression](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-analysis-report/#3-stix-reports-2690) (STIX) format. STIX is a standardized language that facilitates consistent and machine-readable sharing of cyber threat intelligence.

***Key features of STIX reports:***

* **Comprehensive data inclusion:** Each STIX report encompasses a wide range of information from your analysis, such as sandbox session links, file hashes, [network traffic](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-analyze-malicious-network-traffic/) details, file system modifications, and [Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-ttps-explained/) (TTPs).

* **Seamless integration:** These reports are compatible with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and other automated tools, promoting efficient threat detection and response.

* **Enhanced collaboration:** By utilizing STIX reports, analysts and incident response teams can effortlessly share threat data across various platforms, improving communication and coordination.
