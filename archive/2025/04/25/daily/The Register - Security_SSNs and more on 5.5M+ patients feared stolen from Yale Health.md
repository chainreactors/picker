Yale New Haven Health has notified more than 5.5 million people that their private details were likely stolen by miscreants who broke into the healthcare system's network last month.

The organization is affiliated with Yale University and Yale School of Medicine. It is Connecticut's largest provider of its kind, with five hospitals and medical clinics throughout the US state as well as New York and Rhode Island.

It [disclosed](https://www.ynhhs.org/news/yale-new-haven-health-statement-addressing-it-services) it had suffered a "cybersecurity incident" on March 11, alerting patients and staff they may experience on-site phone and internet and application connectivity issues as a result of an IT breach a few days earlier. The healthcare system brought in Mandiant's incident response team, which determined a cyberattack had indeed taken place, and also notified the Feds and law enforcement.
