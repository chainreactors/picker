# Update your Chrome today: Google patches 4 vulnerabilities including one zero-day

Posted: September 18, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Google has [released](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_17.html) an update for its Chrome browser to patch four security vulnerabilities, including one zero-day. A zero-day vulnerability refers to a bug that has been found and exploited by cybercriminals before the vendor even knew about it (they have “zero days” to fix it).

This update is crucial since it addresses one vulnerability which is already being actively exploited and, [reportedly](https://cybersecuritynews.com/google-chrome-0-day-vulnerability-exploited), can be abused when the user visits a malicious website. It probably doesn’t require any further user interaction, which means the user doesn’t need to click on anything in order for their system to be compromised.

The Chrome update brings the version number to 140.0.7339.185/.186 for Windows, Mac and 140.0.7339.185 for Linux. So, if your Chrome is on the version number 140.0.7339.185 or later, it’s protected against exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

The easiest way to update Chrome is to allow it to update automatically, but you can end up lagging behind if you never close your browser or if something goes wrong—such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.

To manually get the update, click the more menu (three stacked dots), then choose **Settings** > **About Chrome**. If there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then all you have to do is reload Chrome in order for the update to complete, and for you to be safe from the vulnerabilities.

You can find more elaborate update instructions and how to read the version number in our article on [how to update Chrome on every operating system](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/explained/2025/06/how-to-update-chrome-on-every-operating-system).

## Technical details on the zero-day vulnerability

Google describes the zero-day vulnerability tracked as [CVE-2025-10585](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-10585) as a type confusion in V8. Reported by Google Threat Analysis Group on 2025-09-16.

Despite the short statement—Google never reveals a lot of details until everyone has had a chance to update—there are a few conclusions we can draw.

It helps to know that V8 is Google’s open-source Javascript engine.

A “type confusion” vulnerability happens when code doesn’t verify the object type passed to it and then uses the object without type-checking. So, a program mistakenly treats one type of data as if it were another, like confusing a list for a single value or interpreting a number as text. This mix-up can cause the software to behave unpredictably, creating opportunities for attackers to break in, steal data, crash programs, or even run malicious code.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) focuses on spyware and nation-state attackers who abuse zero days for espionage purposes.

So, it stands to reason that an attacker used Javascript to create a malicious site that exploited this vulnerability and lured targeted victims to that website.

TAG reported the bug on September 16, and Google issued the patch one day later. That ...
