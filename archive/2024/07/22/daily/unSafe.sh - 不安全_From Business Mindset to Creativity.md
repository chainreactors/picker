What happens when an optimizer tries to embrace chaos?

For someone who thrived on structure and predictability, diving into the world of creativity was like stepping into a tornado.

My brain, wired for business goals and outcomes, struggled to adapt.

How do you balance the relentless pursuit of optimization with the limitless nature of creativity?

This is the journey I've embarked on, and it's been anything but straightforward.

To understand my struggle, let me take you back to where it all started.

## **Some background**

For the past six years, I ran a 7 figure real estate investment firm, growing it from scratch.

My approach was simple: optimize everything. I standardized processes to ensure predictability and scalability.

For years, my brain was wired for business, **driven solely by goals and** **outcomes**.

It was pretty straightforward for an analytical brain like mine:

* I wanted to sell more houses, so I did more marketing.
* I wanted the renovations to go faster, so I always bought the same types of properties.
* I wanted predictable rehabs, so worked with the same contractors.

It was a relentless quest for optimization, always asking the same question: “How can I do to do more of what we do, without increasing the use of resources needed to scale?”

So, I doubled down on standardizing. I bought the same houses, in the same neighborhoods, used the same paint, the same cabinets, the same flooring, the same door knobs, the same everything.

I created a very strict buying sheet where I promised to buy any property within 10 days, sight unseen. The only requirement was that it checked out a list of 37 non-negotiable parameters.

This allowed me to have maximum leverage and scalability, because I would always buy these properties at the same price.

There was no room for questioning.

There was no room for error.

Everything was predictable, including the income I would make, because I would simply add a fixed markup before reselling it.

In fact, it even allowed me to sell these properties before I even bought them.

The way I saw it, I wasn't selling houses—I was selling a financial product, replicated 550+ times with a specific return, like high-value chocolate croissants.

The point of the story is that I enjoyed optimizing the win.

I’ve tried optimizing my creative journey, and it has not been as easy, because it creates a paradox.

## **My struggle with the pursuit of creativity.**

Creativity thrives on the freedom to wander without a set destination.

This tension between structure and spontaneity is a struggle that I have been facing.

I find myself torn between writing about what interests me and [writing to attract readers](https://hackernoon.com/the-advice-paradox-why-we-cant-follow-our-own-wisdom?ref=hackernoon.com).

My business mind craves clear objectives, but my creative spirit needs space to explore.

It’s a constant push and pull.

Just as I once listened to business mentors at the start of my real estate journey, I've now turned to successful creatives for guidance.

**Turns out, I was asking the wrong questions.**

One specific podcast that featured Rick Rubin caught my attention and shifted my perspective.

He views creativity as *a devotional practice*, focused on the process, not the outcome. This radical shift taught me that true creativity thrives without fixed goals.

Creativity should be about the process and the growth that comes with it.

If you ask yourself if what you are working on it “worth it”, that means it’s reliant on an outcome. When you are trying to be creative, the goal should not be the outcome.

The outcome happens when you make the best thing you can make.

Because whatever happens after that.. happens. That part is 100% out of your control.

If you try to put any energy in that part that is out of your control, it’s really just a waste a time because it undermines your work.

When faced with a problem, I always try to figure out universal rules, the most basic common denominator. I’ve discussed a while back my approach to [solving problems](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-should-forget-everything-you-know-about-problem-solving?ref=hackernoon.com) using first principle thinking. The experiment is the same here.

I believe that in business, like in the creative world, the same underlying fundamentals apply.

It boils down to **trying your absolute best**. And I have to admit, I had not been.

I’m sure that if you were to ask yourself the same question, I think you would admit that you haven’t either.

I’m not talking about *pretending to try your best*.

I’m not talking about *trying your best 90% of the time*.

I’m not talking about *trying your best with excuses*.

I talking about **actually and genuinely** doing your best.

All the time.

All day.

Every day.

This is the level of intensity that I am now striving for. Now, on to the practical and philosophical lessons I got out of this podcast.

## **4 lessons from Rick Rubin**

### 1. Authenticity is Everything

> "Each of us is here to play our part, not somebody else's part. And I think it's a big mistake that people see something successful outside of themselves and they want to have that. So they follow the path. They follow someone else's path that led to their success instead of following their own path to lead to your own success.”
>
> R.R

So, here's the deal. Being yourself isn't just some feel-good advice. It’s a neurological must. Your brain’s reward system lights up like a Christmas tree when you are being authentic.

Think about it. Have you ever tried to mimic someone else's success only to feel like a fraud? I know I have.

Early in my real estate career, I followed the strategies of industry gurus, hoping to replicate their success. Sure, I saw some results, but something always felt off.

It wasn't until I embraced my unique approach that I truly hit my stride. I created my niche instead of just following a formula.

The same goes for my writing. I started by imitating the style and tone of seem popular writers. But it didn’t feel right.

Why not be yourself when everyone else is taken?

Plus, when you are [true to yourself](https://hackernoon.com/the-fck-it-effect?ref=hackernoon.com), your brain releases dopamine, which enhances our mood and motivation. **Authenticity is a neurological imperative**.

So, take a moment to reflect: are you living your truth?

Are you showing up as your authentic self in your work and life? If not, what’s holding you back?

### 2. The Best Work Divides the Audience

> “The best art divides the audience. If everyone likes it, you probably haven’t gone far enough”.
>
> R.R

Great work divides opinions.

Bold, risky work evokes strong emotions and stands out. If everyone likes it, you're playing it too safe.

Think of your favorite movies. They didn’t aim to please everyone, and neither should you. So, take those creative risks. If you’re not pissing someone off, you’re not doing it right.

Whatever you create, a rather large number of people are probably going to end up hating it. And that's *good news.*

It means you’ve broken the rules, pushed the limits, and ventured into risky territory. Your art isn’t...
