# SecTKG

A Knowledge Graph for Open Source Security Tools

## Research paper

We present the findings of this work in the following research paper:

Sun S, Huang C, Shen Y, et al. SecTKG: A Knowledge Graph for Open Source Security Tools[J]. International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 2023. [view](https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ijis/2023/4464974.pdf)
