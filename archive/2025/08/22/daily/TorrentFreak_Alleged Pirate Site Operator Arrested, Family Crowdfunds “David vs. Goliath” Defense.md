With millions of monthly visits, sports streaming service 'Al Ángulo TV' was a massive success. The operator of the service, who wasn't shy about appearing in public, was very active on social media. This brazen stance didn't go unnoticed by rights holders. This week, Argentinian authorities arrested the alleged operator, Alejo Leonel Warles, who now faces a criminal prosecution. His family is reportedly backing a fundraiser to aid a "David vs. Goliath" defense.

In Latin America, the Magis TV brand is particularly popular but another name also popped up more frequently: ‘Al Ángulo TV’.

Al Ángulo was available through various domain names as well as an Android app, offering access to a variety of pirated sports streams. As its logo suggests, football was a particularly popular sport on the service.

## ‘Al Ángulo TV’ Operator Arrested

The streaming service stood out as its alleged operator, known online as ‘Shishi’ (real name Alejo Leonel Warles), was both active and visible on social media. Just a few days ago, Al Ángulo’s official X account celebrated [100,000 followers](https://x.com/AIAnguloTV/status/1957132575253647520), a figure that has since skyrocketed to over 125,000 today. The reasons for the increase aren’t what Warles had hoped for.

Yesterday, Warles was arrested by local authorities in the city of Paraná, Argentina. The arrest, carried out by the San Isidro DDI, was approved by a local court following a month-long criminal investigation led by the Specialized Cybercrime Investigation Unit (UFEIC) of San Isidro, Buenos Aires.

The investigation received key support from international organizations, including the Alliance Against Audiovisual Piracy (ALIANZA) and Spain’s professional football league, LaLiga, which were both directly affected by Al Ángulo’s activities.

At the time of writing, the main domain of the service, which received over three million visits in July, is unreachable. This suggests that the operation was effectively shut down by the law enforcement operation.

## Catch Me if You Can

According to a report from [Infobae](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2025/08/21/pediran-la-excarcelacion-del-creador-de-al-angulo-tv-y-su-familia-lanzo-una-colecta-para-ayudarlo/), Warles previously acknowledged the illegal nature of the service, while informing followers that ‘no one could catch him’. The alleged operator had also appeared in press interviews and was [active](https://x.com/lukyano/status/1958255227007824007) on YouTube as [W4RLES](https://www.youtube.com/%40W4RLES).

With this and other information, the authorities were able to connect the dots and then arrest the presumed brain behind the operation. Warles now faces charges for violating Law 11.723, Argentina’s copyright law, risking a multi-year prison sentence.

‘Al Ángulo TV’ reportedly generated revenues through advertising and direct user donations through virtual wallets and cryptocurrencies. During the raid on Warles’ home, authorities seized computers, cell phones, electronic devices, and various funds stored in the virtual accounts.

## David vs. Goliath Fundraiser

The defendant is represented by attorney Fernando Madeo Facente, who will file a request for Warles to be released on bail, arguing that he has no prior criminal record. The attorney sees this case as a “David versus Goliath” battle.

“It’s similar to the case against the Fútbol Libre site. They’re multinational companies, and the Spanish LaLiga is involved in this. It’s David versus Goliath. A very powerful company versus a kid from a humble family,” Facente said, quoted by Infobae.

Shortly after the arrest, a fundraiser was launched to cover legal expenses and travel costs. This effort, [purportedly](https://x.com/Tomiscopa/status/1958276699390726631) backed by the family, is widely shared [on social media](https://x.com/Tomiscopa/status/1958276692121899459).

According to Warles’ attorney, this swift action demonstrates that powerful forces, including LaLiga, are driving the case. Rightsholders, in turn, will see it as evidence that Argentinian authorities are taking piracy seriously.
