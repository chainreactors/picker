![SiteCheck Mid-Year Report Hacked Websites](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Blog-Page-Thumbnail-SiteCheck-Mid-Year-Report-2023-1490x700-1-820x385.jpg)

Conducting an external website scan for indicators of compromise is one of the easiest ways to  identify security issues.

While remote scanners may not provide as comprehensive of a scan as server-side scanners, they allow users to instantly identify malicious code and detect security issues on their website without installing any software or applications.

Our free SiteCheck [remote website scanner](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) provides immediate insights about malware infections, blocklisting, website anomalies, and errors for millions of webmasters every month.

In our latest mid-year report, we’ve analyzed data from the first half of the year to identify the most common malware infections found by SiteCheck. We also provide examples to help webmasters understand how to identify malware in their own environments.

[![Download Full Report](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BlogPost_FeatureImage_1490x700_2021-Website-Threat-Report-download-button-green.png)](https://sucuri.net/reports/sitecheck-remote-website-scanner-mid-year-2023-report/)

## Website Malware Infections

In the first half of 2023, SiteCheck scanned a total of **54,743,804** websites. From this number we detected **628,085** infected sites, while another **851,164** sites were found to contain [blocklisted resources](https://sucuri.net/reports/sitecheck-remote-website-scanner-mid-year-2023-report/#1-b).

Website infections can occur for a multitude of reasons. But most often, they’re the result of an attacker exploiting a vulnerable website for its valuable resources — credit card information, traffic, SEO, or even server resources.

We analyzed the most common signatures to pinpoint which types of malware were frequently detected on compromised systems. Injected malware and redirects were the most common infection in our remote scan data, followed by SEO Spam.

[![SiteCheck Mid-Year Malware Family Distribution Graph for most common malware found during remote website scan](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-Malware-Family-Distribution1.5.jpg)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/01-Malware-Family-Distribution.jpg)

An overlap in distribution percentages exists, as hacked websites are often infected with more than one type of malware at a time.

### Malware & Redirects

A total of **388,388** sites were detected with injected malware and redirects, accounting for **61.84%** of website infections detected by SiteCheck in the first half of 2023.

Malware injections are defined as malicious external script injections, iframes, inline scripts – and exclude any detections already flagged as SEO spam. They are typically found injected into JavaScript files or nestled within a site’s HTML code.

#### SocGholish

One malware injection of significant note was [SocGholish](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html), which accounted for over **17.66%** of injections in the first half of 2023. In addition to script injections, a total of **15,172** websites were found to contain external script tags pointing to known SocGholish domains.

This malware is responsible for redirecting site visitors to malicious pages designed to trick victims into installing fake browser updates. JavaScript is used to display notices in the victim’s web browser and initiate a download for remote access trojans, allowing the attacker to gain full access and remotely control the victim’s computer including mouse and keyboard, file access, and network resources.

SocGholish is also known to be the first stage in ransomware attacks against large corporations.

In 2023, several distinct website malware campaigns were known to serve SocGholish malware:
