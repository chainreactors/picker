EFF has spent this year urging governments around the world, from [Canada](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/canadas-leaders-must-reject-overbroad-age-verification-bill) to [Australia](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/australia-banning-kids-social-media-does-more-harm-good), to abandon their reckless plans to introduce age verification for a variety of online content under the guise of protecting children online. Mandatory age verification tools are [surveillance systems](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online) that threaten everyone’s rights to speech and privacy, and introduce more harm than they seek to combat.

### **Kids Experiencing Harm is Not Just an Online Phenomena**

In November, Australia’s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, [claimed](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/australia-to-ban-social-media-for-children-under-age-16-1) that legislation was needed to protect young people in the country from the supposed harmful effects of social media. Australia’s Parliament later passed the [Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Bill 2024](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7284), which bans children under the age of 16 from using social media and forces platforms to take undefined “reasonable steps” to verify users’ ages or face over $30 million in fines. This is similar to [last year’s ban](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/artic...
