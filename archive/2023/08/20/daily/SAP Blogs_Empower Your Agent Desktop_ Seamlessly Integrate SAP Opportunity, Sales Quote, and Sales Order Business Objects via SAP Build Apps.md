The Agent Desktop lacks native integration for SAP functions like Opportunity, Sales Quote, and Sales Order. To address this gap, we're utilizing custom-built Apps to enable the creation of these business Objects.

Once businessÂ  Objects are created, it seamlessly appears in the timeline for enhanced visibility and tracking. ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@94401D39447508D148B9179130A10607/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

**Benefits**

1. **Enhanced Efficiency:** Custom-built Apps streamline the creation of Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Sales Orders directly from the Agent Desktop, minimizing the need to switch between systems.

2. **Unified Workflow:** Integrating these functions into the Agent Desktop provides a unified and cohesive workflow, reducing the complexity of managing different systems.

3. **Real-time Visibility:** Transactions created through the custom Apps are instantly reflected in the timeline, allowing agents to monitor and track progress without delays.

4. **Improved Customer Service:** Faster access to crucial information and faster transaction processing lead to quicker response times and better customer service.

5. **Data Accuracy:** By eliminating manual data entry across systems, the integration helps maintain data accuracy and consistency, reducing errors and enhancing decision-making.

#### **Key Capabilities**

* Easily integrate with SAP Service Cloud
