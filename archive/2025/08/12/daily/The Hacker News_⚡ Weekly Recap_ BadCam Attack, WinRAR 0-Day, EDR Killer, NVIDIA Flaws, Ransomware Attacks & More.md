This week, cyber attackers are moving quickly, and businesses need to stay alert. They're finding new weaknesses in popular software and coming up with clever ways to get around security. Even one unpatched flaw could let attackers in, leading to data theft or even taking control of your systems. The clock is ticking‚Äîif defenses aren't updated regularly, it could lead to serious damage. The message is clear: don't wait for an attack to happen. Take action now to protect your business.

Here's a look at some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this week: from new flaws in WinRAR and NVIDIA Triton to advanced attack techniques you should know about. Let's get into the details.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Trend Micro Warns of Actively Exploited 0-Day](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/trend-micro-confirms-active.html)** ‚Äî Trend Micro has released temporary mitigations to address critical security flaws in on-premise versions of Apex One Management Console that it said have been exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-54948 and CVE-2025-54987), both rated 9.4 on the CVSS scoring system, have been described as management console command injection and remote code execution flaws. There are currently no details on how the issues are being exploited in real-world attacks. Trend Micro said it "observed at least one instance of an attempt to actively exploit one of these vulnerabilities in the wild."

## **üîî Top News**

* **[WinRAR 0-Day Under Active Exploitation](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/winrar-zero-day-under-active.html)** ‚Äî The maintainers of the WinRAR file archiving utility have released an update to address an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability. Tracked as CVE-2025-8088 (CVSS score: 8.8), the issue has been described as a case of path traversal affecting the Windows version of the tool that could be exploited to obtain arbitrary code execution by crafting malicious archive files. Russian cybersecurity vendor BI.ZONE, in a report published last week, said there are indications that the hacking group tracked as Paper Werewolf (aka GOFFEE) may have leveraged CVE-2025-8088 alongside CVE-2025-6218, a directory traversal bug in the Windows version of WinRAR that was patched in June 2025.
* **[New Windows EPM Poisoning Exploit Chain Detailed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/researchers-detail-windows-epm.html)** ‚Äî New findings presented at the DEF CON 33 security conference showed that a now-patched security issue in Microsoft's Windows Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication protocol (CVE-2025-49760, CVSS score: 3.5) could be abused by an attacker to conduct spoofing attacks and impersonate a known server. The vulnerability essentially makes it possible to manipulate a core component of the RPC protocol and stage what's called an EPM poisoning attack that allows unprivileged users to pose as a legitimate, built-in service with the goal of coercing a protected process to authenticate against an arbitrary server of an attacker's choosing.
* **[BadCam Attack Targets Linux Webcams From Lenovo](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/linux-based-lenovo-webcams-flaw-can-be.html)** ‚Äî Linux-based webcams from Lenovo, Lenovo 510 FHD and Lenovo Performance FHD, which are powered by a System on a Chip (SoC) and firmware made by the Chinese company SigmaStar, can be weaponized and turned into BadUSB vectors, allowing attackers to tamper with the firmware of the devices to execute malicious commands when connected to a computer. "This allows remote attackers to inject keystrokes covertly and launch attacks independent of the host operating system," Eclypsium researchers Paul Asadoorian, Mickey Shkatov, and Jesse Michael said.
* **[The Far-Reaching Scale of VexTrio Revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/fake-vpn-and-spam-blocker-apps-tied-to.html)** ‚Äî A new analysis of VexTrio has unmasked it as a "cybercriminal organization with tendrils that are far-reaching," operating dozens of businesses and front companies across Europe, while posing as a legitimate ad tech firm to conduct various types of fraud. The cyber fraud network is assessed to be active in its present form since at least 2017. That said, suspected key figures behind the scheme have been linked to scam reports and sketchy domains since 2004. VexTrio's nerve center is Lugano, melding scam operations and traffic distribution schemes to maximize illicit revenue. It's also the result of two businesses, Tekka Group and AdsPro Group, joining forces in 2020. "The merger created a formidable suite of commercial entities that touch every part of the ad tech industry," Infoblox said. VexTrio is known for using traffic distribution systems (TDSes) to filter and redirect web traffic based on specific criteria, as well as relying on sophisticated DNS manipulation techniques like fast-fluxing, DNS tunneling, and domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to rapidly change the IP addresses associated with their domains, establish covert command-and-control (C2) communication, and maintain persistent access with infected systems.
