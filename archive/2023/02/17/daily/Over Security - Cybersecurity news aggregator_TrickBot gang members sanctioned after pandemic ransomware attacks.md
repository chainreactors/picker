# TrickBot gang members sanctioned after pandemic ransomware attacks

Posted: February 15, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

In a collaborative partnership, officials in the United States and the United Kingdom [unmasked and imposed financial sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1256) against seven members of the notorious Russian gang [TrickBot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trickbot) (alias “TrickLoader”), a mainstream banking [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) turned malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform for other criminals.

Apart from taking over bank accounts, [TrickBot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trickbot) has been instrumental in spreading ransomware across multiple healthcare organizations, and critical infrastructure in the US, especially during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said in a [statement](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1256):

> “Cybercriminals, particularly those based in Russia, seek to attack critical infrastructure, target US businesses, and [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) the international financial system. The United States is taking action today in partnership with the United Kingdom because international cooperation is key to addressing Russian cybercrime.”

According to the sanctions notice, in one attack the group deployed ransomware against three Minnesota medical facilities, disrupting their computer networks and telephones, and causing ambulances to divert.

> “Members of the TrickBot Group publicly gloated over the ease of targeting the medical facilities and the speed with which the ransoms were paid to the group.”

TrickBot debuted in 2016 after [succeeding](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/10/trick-bot-dyrezas-successor) Dyreza (alias “Dyre”), another banking Trojan also operated by cybercriminals based in Moscow, Russia. TrickBot has since evolved into “a highly modular [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) suite that provides the TrickBot Group with the ability to conduct a variety of illegal cyber activities, including ransomware attacks”. Among the ransomware strains TrickBot collaborated with was [Ryuk](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ryuk-ransomware), which was then [succeeded by](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/05/threat-spotlight-conti-the-ransomware-used-in-the-hse-healthcare-attack) or identified as [related to](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ryuk-successor-conti-ransomware-releases-data-leak-site/) the now-defunct Conti ransomware.

## Sanctions

Coinciding with the US sanction notice, the UK’s Office of Financial Sanction Implementation (OFSI) released [a guidance on ransomware and sanctions](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1135587/Ransomware___Sanctions_guidance__Feb_2023_.pdf). Sanctioning generally has a two-fold effect. On the one hand, people (usually victim organizations of a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware)) are prohibited from making ransom payments to a sanctioned entity (usually the organized ransomware gang behind the attack) as doing so is “a serious criminal offence” with imprisonment and fines. On the other hand, sanctioned entities have their assets frozen and are subjected to a travel ban.

Indeed, sanctions are powerful tools to deter and disrupt b...
