The Ukrainian government has jammed Russian satellite TV signals to occupied Ukrainian territories since December 2022, according to Chris Greenway, a monitor for BBC Monitoring, a division of the British Broadcasting Corporation that monitors and reports on mass-media activities across the globe.

"Ukraine is uplinking its own multiplex (a "mux") to various Russian satellites, mimicking the mux being uplinked by Russia," [Greenway said](https://archive.ph/pn0ur) last week.

"The Ukrainian uplink is much stronger than the Russian one, fooling the Russian satellite into relaying the Ukrainian uplink instead," he added.

Greenway says Ukraine assigned its TV channels on the "fake" mux the same IDs as the Russian ones, which means that terrestrial transmitters in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine had been tricked into relaying its channels instead of the Russian ones.

The BBC expert says this trick has allowed Ukrainian officials to [broadcast messages](https://www.facebook.com/oleh.baturin/posts/pfbid0Fu3MrEhYVyMCMFiHjLz6kvEQambm2CgJ8CUr1fRBLTRCiXpBfswje7RvWeMWNQQgl) inside occupied territories, such as President Zelenskyi's recent New Year address, often on the frequency of Rossiya 1 (Russia 1), Russia's main state-owned TV and radio network.

In a Telegram post, Alexander Malkevich, the General Director of the St Petersburg TV Channel, blamed the incident on... and I kid you not... "[Anglo-Saxon IT terrorists from Ukraine](https://t.me/alexandr_malkevich/11987)... whatever that means.

Greenway says that since the disruptions, Russian TV stations have constantly been changing their satellite signal configurations in an effort to outrun Ukraine's jamming.

The incident marks the most successful jamming and hijacking of Russian TV broadcasts inside occupied territories after Ukrainian IT specialists also hijacked Russian TV stations in [September](https://24tv.ua/krimu-po-telebachennyu-pokazali-zvernennya-zelenskogo_n2154785) and [August](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/08/20/7364150/) last year as well.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Chick-fil-A security incident:** Fast-food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A says it's [investigating suspicious activity](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/customer-support/chick-fil-a-one-membership-program/suspicious-activity) on a number of customer accounts. The incident appears to be a generic credential stuffing attack that typically targets companies that run loyalty and reward-points programs. These accounts are often hacked and then sold on underground forums. Buyers purchase these accounts and then use the loyalty points to place orders in their name. Several Chick-fil-A users reported on social media having their accounts hacked and emptied of loyalty points in recent weeks, which most likely triggered the company's investigation.

**AirFrance-KLM incident:** French-Dutch airline company Air France–KLM notified customers last week of a security breach that impacted the account owners of its FlyingBlue loyalty program. In an[email sent to affected customers](https://mastodon.social/%40tarik%40infosec.exchange/109647720194286008), the company says details such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and latest transactions were exposed in the incident.

**Ray-Ban lawsuit:** A US judge has [ruled](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/41562/jpmorgan-must-face-ray-ban-lawsuit-over-cyber-theft) that JPMorgan Chase must face a [lawsuit](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/40144/ray-ban-manufacturer-sues-jpmorgan-over-272-million-cyber-theft) from EssilorLuxottica, the company behind Ray-Ban glasses, after the bank failed to detect and stop suspicious transactions that originated from the eyewear company's New York bank account. EssilorLuxottica lost $272 million in 2019 after hackers recruited one of the company's Thai employees, which then made several rogue transactions to a third-party account. In its lawsuit, EssilorLuxottica claimed that JPMorgan should have detected the sudden spike in its regular monthly transfers jumping from $15 million to $100 million.

### **General tech and privacy**

**New AWS defaults:** Amazon says that starting January 5 this year, all data stored in AWS S3 servers is now [encrypted by default](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-encrypts-new-objects-by-default/). Server-side data encryption has been available to S3 customers since 2011, but the feature has only been optional until now. Amazon also plans to change another AWS default [in April](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/12/amazon-s3-automatically-enable-block-public-access-disable-access-control-lists-buckets-april-2023/), when all new S3 servers will block access to stored data by default. Until now, all AWS S3 servers were open to public access unless administrators took intentional steps to set the servers private.

**WhatsApp gets proxy support:** Meta has [announced](https://blog.whatsapp.com/connecting-to-whatsapp-by-proxy) support for proxy connections in its WhatsApp service. The company says the new feature will prove useful for users who want to bypass censorship in oppressive regimes. Besides that, it can also be used to bypass firewalls in corporate environments too. (wink-wink)

**Apple fined in France:** CNIL, France's privacy watchdog, has fined Apple [€8 million](https://www.cnil.fr/en/advertising-id-apple-distribution-international-fined-8-million-euros) for showing targeted ads to French users. The agency says that Apple did not obtain explicit consent from users to have their data harvested and used for targeted ads, a clear violation of the EU's GDPR rules.

**Louisiana porn law:** A [new law](https://www.fox8live.com/2022/12/28/watching-porn-now-requires-age-verification-la-because-new-law/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=snd&utm_content=wvue) has entered into effect in the US state of Louisiana where any website where more than a third of its content is adult-related must perform age verification of its visitors. This has led to some websites, [such as PornHub](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4axe8d/loui...
