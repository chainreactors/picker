SAP Build is out since TechEd 2022 and many customers are already using our Low-Code/No-Code capabilities. Now it’s your chance to try out SAP Build and get your hands dirty - because for April 2023 we are offering another Hackathon which is dedicated to SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Build Apps. This is your opportunity to create business applications or to build your own automation prototype to automate mundane tasks, that occur on your day-to-day business.

**Background**:

SAP Build addresses the growing gap of developers worldwide by empowering users with any skill level to create applications, automate processes and design engaging business sites. It provides people closest to the business problems The unified low-code portfolio has three core components:

* **SAP Build Apps** – Enables the creation of applications with drag-and-drop simplicity

* **SAP Build Process Automation** – Automates processes and tasks visually

* **SAP Build Work Zone** – Facilitates rapid creation of engaging and personalized business sites

The goal of this Hackathon is to give you a better understanding of our LCNC capabilities and practical introduction to the development environment of Build Process Automation and Build Apps. We are using graphical layout-designer, pre-developed components and Design Thinking to generate a prototype within 3 days of development that you can take back home for further development and investigation. Please keep in mind that we are not going to include Work Zone in this format. If you have your own Work-Zone tenant, you are free to embed your prototypes into your Work Zone tenant by yourself.

During the event, you will meet our experts and learn directly from them. So, you would get access to the state-of-the-art technology, receive professional support and exchange knowledge with your peers from other companies.

**Setup:**

In this Hackathon we will provide a list of predefined Use-Cases and real-life business challenges which can be realized with SAP Build. You can decide which challenge is most suitable for you and start working on it right away.  In order to give you a broad spectrum of our capabilities and to see your requirements reflected in the Hackathon we will include challenges related to workflow-orchestration, RPA-based automation, Machine Learning extraction, Fiori interfaces & mobile development into our challenges. The tool comes with a user-friendly, web-based interface which is absolutely ideal for this format. We are also planning to give presentations, hands-on exercises and involve expert trainers who can support your team if you are stuck.
