# This Blog Has 20 Years!

[January 25, 2023](https://blog.rootshell.be/2023/01/25/this-blog-has-20-years/ "20:54") [People / Places](https://blog.rootshell.be/category/people-places/) [2 comments](https://blog.rootshell.be/2023/01/25/this-blog-has-20-years/#comments)

Twenty years ago‚Ä¶ I decided to start a blog to share my thoughts! That‚Äôs why I called it ‚Äú/dev/random‚Äù. How was the Internet twenty years ago? Well, they were good things and bad ones‚Ä¶

![](https://blog.rootshell.be/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-20230125-1-1024x550.png)

With the years, the blog content evolved, and I wrote a lot of technical stuff related to my job, experiences, tools, etc. Then, I had the opportunity to attend a lot of security conferences and started to write wrap-ups. With COVID, fewer conferences and no more reviews. For the last few months, I‚Äôm mainly writing diaries for the [Internet Storm Center](https://isc.sans.edu) therefore, I publish less private stuff here, and just relay the content published on the ISC website. If you have read my stuff for a long time (or even if you are a newcomer), thank you very much!

A few stats about the site:

* 2056 articles
* 20593 pictures
* 5538 unique visitors to the RSS feed in the last 30 days
* 85000 hits/day on average (bots & attacks included ?)

I know that these numbers might seem low for many of you but I‚Äôm proud of them!
