## Introduction

A large number of post-quantum cryptography schemes are built on a mathematical structure called “lattice“, on which hard-to-solve problems can be defined even for a quantum computer.

Cryptosystems belonging to this class, so-called lattice-based cryptography, base their security on some well-known computational problems that have been studied for several decades and conjectured to be intractable in the presence of both classical and quantum computers.

During the [NIST standardization](https://www.telsy.com/post-quantum-cryptography-pqc-a-classical-solution-to-the-quantum-threat/) process aimed at identifying new quantum-resistant schemes in public key cryptography, several lattice-based schemes have been proposed.

Given their security and remarkable efficiency, many of them prevailed in the advanced stages of selection: three of the four winners, the [Key Encapsulation Mechanism](https://www.telsy.com/key-negotiation-in-the-post-quantum-era-kem/) (KEM) Kyber and the [digital signatures](https://www.telsy.com/digital-signature-algorithms-present-and-future/) Dilithium and Falcon, are based on lattices.
