Microsoft on Tuesday shipped fixes to address a total of [78 security flaws](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2025-May) across its software lineup, including a set of five zero-days that have come under active exploitation in the wild.

Of the 78 flaws resolved by the tech giant, 11 are rated Critical, 66 are rated Important, and one is rated Low in severity. Twenty-eight of these vulnerabilities lead to remote code execution, 21 of them are privilege escalation bugs, and 16 others are classified as information disclosure flaws.

The updates are in addition to [eight more security defects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security) patched by the company in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of last month's [Patch Tuesday update](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/microsoft-patches-126-flaws-including.html).

The five vulnerabilities that have come under active exploitation in the wild are listed below -

* **[CVE-2025-30397](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30397)** (CVSS score: 7.5) - Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability
* **[CVE-2025-30400](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30400)** (CVSS score: 7.8) - Microsoft Desktop Window Manager (DWM) Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
* **[CVE-2025-32701](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-32701)** (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
* **[CVE-2025-32706](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-32706)** (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
* **[CVE-2025-32709](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-32709)** (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

While the first three flaws have been credited to Microsoft's own threat intelligence team, Benoit Sevens of Google Threat Intelligence Group and the CrowdStrike Advanced Research Team have been acknowledged for the discovery of CVE-2025-32706. An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting CVE-2025-32709.

"Another zero-day vulnerability has been identified in the Microsoft Scripting Engine, a key component used by Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge," Alex Vovk, CEO and co-founder of Action1, [said](https://www.action1.com/patch-tuesday/patch-tuesday-may-2025/) about CVE-2025-30397.

"Attackers can exploit the flaw via a malicious web page or script that causes the scripting engine to misinterpret object types, resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, attackers could gain full system control – enabling data theft, malware installation, and lateral movement across networks."

CVE-2025-30400 is the third privilege escalation flaw in DWM Core Library to be weaponized in the wild since 2023. In May 2024, Microsoft issued patches for CVE-2024-30051, which Kaspersky [said](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-patches-61-flaws-including.html) was used in attacks distributing QakBot (aka Qwaking Mantis) malware.

"Since 2022, Patch Tuesday has addressed 26 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in DWM," Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.

"In fact, the April 2025 release included fixes for five DWM Core Library elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. Prior to CVE-2025-30400, only two DWM elevation of privilege bugs were exploited as zero days – CVE-2024-30051 in 2024 and [CVE-2023-36033](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/alert-microsoft-releases-patch-updates.html) in 2023."

CVE-2025-32701 and CVE-2025-32706 are the seventh and eighth privilege escalation flaws to be discovered in the CLFS component and have been exploited in real-world attacks since 2022. Last month, Microsoft [revealed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/pipemagic-trojan-exploits-windows-clfs.html) that CVE-2025-29824 was exploited in limited attacks to target companies in the U.S., Venezuela, Spain, and Saudi Arabia.

CVE-2025-29824 is also said to have been [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/play-ransomware-exploited-windows-cve.html) as a zero-day by threat actors linked to the Play ransomware family as part of an attack targeting an unnamed organization in the U.S., Broadcom-owned Symantec revealed earlier this month.

CVE-2025-32709, likewise, is the third privilege escalation flaw in the Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock component to have come under abuse within a span of a year, after [CVE-2024-38193](https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/microsoft-patches-zero-day-flaw.html) and [CVE-2025-21418](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/microsofts-patch-tuesday-fixes-63-flaws.html). It's worth noting that the exploitation of CVE-2024-38193 has been attributed to the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group.

The development has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add all five vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by ...
