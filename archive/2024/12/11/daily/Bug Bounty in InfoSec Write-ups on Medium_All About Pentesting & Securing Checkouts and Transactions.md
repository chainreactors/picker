In this article, I’ll walk you through my approach to pentesting payment gateways and securing checkouts. I will talk about my approach toward pentesting any features which require some monetary transactions. I am going to talk more like an attacker and at the end.

let's understand how payment gateways work or how any e-commerce application accepts payments.

Let’s assume you selected a T-shirt to buy, added it to the cart, and clicked on checkout. You then select “Credit Card” as the payment method and enter your credit card details. Since this is sensitive information, the data will be encrypted to maintain confidentiality.

Once you submit the payment, the encrypted data is sent to a payment gateway. The payment gateway then sends the data to a payment processor, which communicates with the issuing bank (the bank that issued your credit card).

On the bank’s side, the system verifies the card details and checks your account for balance, card validity, and other factors. Based on these checks, the bank decides whether to approve or decline the transaction:

* **If approved**: The bank sends an authorization code back through the payment processor to the payment gateway, which then notifies the e-commerce platform. You will see an “Order Placed” confirmation message on your screen.
* **If declined**: You will see a “Transaction Declined” message, along with a reason for the decline, such as insufficient funds or an expired card.

**Note** - A **payment gateway** is basically like an online cashier - it gathers up your payment info and sends it off securely. Then there's the **payment processor**, which does all the behind-the-scenes work to move money from your bank to the merchant's bank.

Now that we’ve got the payment flow down, let’s jump into what to look out for, the potential vulnerabilities, and the best mindset to have while digging into these features.

### Improper Validation of Payment Amounts / Price Tampering

So basically, what we’re doing here is changing the price parameter value to a lower or any arbitrary amount. For example, let’s say a product is listed at $100, and by intercepting the request via a proxy tool, you modify the price of this product to $1 and are able to purchase it for that amount.

What people often miss is that they only try to manipulate the primary price, but there are other parameters involved in calculating the total amount, like delivery charges, handling & platform fees, discounts, and possibly additional service fees like gift wrapping, etc.

Additionally, while trying to manipulate price check if you can make it a negative value.

what I am trying to say is that most of the developers implement strict validation on the primary amount, but they most of the time forget to implement proper validation on other parameters. so it's always worth validating other parameters too.

## Order Manipulation via Quantity Tampering

When we’re ordering services like food, movie tickets, etc., have you ever wondered how the application calculates the price? For example, when you choose 1 seat, it costs you $10, and when you add another seat, the price increases, right?

Well, there’s some logic written behind that to calculate the total price. While doing pentesting, it’s important to understand what that logic is, so we can try to abuse it.

A straightforward calculation might look like this:
**Quantity × Price per Seat = 3 × 10 = $30**
So, if you select 3 seats, you should pay $30. However, if you intercept the request and change the quantity parameter to 0.3, the application might still book 3 seats, but the bill could be calculated as **0.3 × 10 = $3**.

There are other possibilities, depending on the application’s price calculation logic.

## Coupon and Discount Abuse

Most of the time, apps offer discounts or let users apply coupons — maybe something like 10% off the cart or a discount on specific items. Sometimes, they even let you use cashback coins or rewards. So, there are a lot of different factors that come into play when calculating the final price. Our goal here is to understand how it all works so we can try to ...
