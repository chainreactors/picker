## Jim Sanborn Is Auctioning Off the Solution to Part Four of the Kryptos Sculpture

Well, [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/14/science/kryptos-sculpture-cia-solution-auction.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) is interesting:

> The auction, which will include other items related to cryptology, will be held Nov. 20. RR Auction, the company arranging the sale, estimates a winning bid between $300,000 and $500,000.
>
> Along with the original handwritten plain text of K4 and other papers related to the coding, Mr. Sanborn will also be providing a 12-by-18-inch copper plate that has three lines of alphabetic characters cut through with a jigsaw, which he calls “my proof-of-concept piece” and which he kept on a table for inspiration during the two years he and helpers hand-cut the letters for the project. The process was grueling, exacting and nerve wracking. “You could not make any mistake with 1,800 letters,” he said. “It could not be repaired.”
>
> Mr. Sanborn’s ideal winning bidder is someone who will hold on to that secret. He also hopes that person is willing to take over the system of verifying possible solutions and reviewing those unending emails, possibly through an automated system.

Personally I can not understand the need for people to play with such things.

Other than ciphers that have a unicity distance greater than the length of the message (ie perfect secrecy) we know that the strength of the enciphered message rests on two things,

1, Special Knowledge

Put simply one gives rise to information on the other in a tight lockstep dance that usually “lacks rhythm or rhyme”.

Thus the chance of solving even a moderately complex hand cipher like VIC but where you only have just a single short message and no context is mostly a “fools errand”.

> About 10 years ago, he started charging people $50 for a “short personal response” to emails in order to weed out most of the guesses.

At $50 a pop, it’s curious to think there was enough erroneous confidence to generate $40,000.

After fielding tens of thousands of guesses from code-crackers for 35 years, it’s understandable Mr. Sanborn may be [expletive] ‘tired’ and ready to share the weight and honor of an elusive enigma.

“my proof-of-concept piece” seems to confirm what I suspected, this is a non-visual artist’s version of conceptual art. The intended audience is almost certainly not those interested in art but cryptography – a sort of convoluted Jenny Holzer.

Sanborn revealed that Berlin wall is part of K4. A piece of the Berlin wall is part of the whole piece of art which is as big as the entire garden. Sanborn was seen digging in the evenings when building it. Taken together, the K4 puzzle is larger than the plate, parts of the garden are parts of it. Maybe you need to add a candle to K4 to illuminate the garden through the plate or you need to follow the water from the center of the ground within the semicircular plate… As the garden is not accessible for the public, we cannot solve K4 if the “the entire garden is part of K4”-hypothesis is true. I am sad that Sanborn does not reveal the solution.

Sanborn has confirmed that the Berlin wall monument/segment and the Berlin clock are part of the puzzle!

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr?wprov=sfla1>

And he revealed exactly which letters correspond to “Berlin” in K4!

And he revealed “East” and “Northeast” as additional hints in 2020!

Given the logic/mechanism of the Berlin clock, it should not be too hard to solve K4.

Young cryptographers, go!

I dug into Kryptos years ago, after attempts at K4 had already stalled.
For all the brain power that’s been applied and documented,
and presumably countless undocumented attempts,
and the new ability to simply brute force textual problems,
I believe K4 is unsolvable.
May as well be a one-time pad.
