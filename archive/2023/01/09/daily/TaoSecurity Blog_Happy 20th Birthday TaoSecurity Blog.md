Happy 20th birthday [TaoSecurity Blog](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/), born on [8 January 2003](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2003/01/welcome-to-my-blog-main-new-content.html).

## Thank you Blogger

[Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) (now part of Google) has continuously hosted this blog for 20 years, for free. I'd like to thank Blogger and Google for providing this platform for two decades. It's tough to find extant self-hosted security content that was born at the same time, or earlier. Bruce Schneier's [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/) is the main one that comes to mind. If not for the wonderful [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), many blogs from the early days would be lost.

## Statistics

In my [15 year post](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2018/01/happy-15th-birthday-taosecurity-blog.html) I included some statistics, so here are a few, current as of the evening of 7 January:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCxcThtGMupoQEucIYaF1m2YRVp9vtCObwzOondALVDmUBhwWIGhLiBeEe_hK_BxbCtNKcA95cSMg3NoT4k79k3rco0BYVugwM9dMOoKLX7eSDqTMVMjTHegX0d0kkg6raamB_akd0qCeCKiJcYQH1XsqQt-V1kpoI2un2ymp_kLV0KCrDpw/w640-h140/capture_001_07012023_201618.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCxcThtGMupoQEucIYaF1m2YRVp9vtCObwzOondALVDmUBhwWIGhLiBeEe_hK_BxbCtNKcA95cSMg3NoT4k79k3rco0BYVugwM9dMOoKLX7eSDqTMVMjTHegX0d0kkg6raamB_akd0qCeCKiJcYQH1XsqQt-V1kpoI2un2ymp_kLV0KCrDpw/s2533/capture_001_07012023_201618.jpg)

I think it's cool to see almost 29 million "all time" views, but that's not the whole story.

Here are the so-called "all time" statistics:

It turns out that Blogger only started capturing these numbers in January 2011. That means I've had almost 29 million views in the last 12 years.

I don't know what happened on 20 April 2022, when I had almost 1.5 million views?

## Top Ten Posts Since January 2011

Here are the top ten all time posts:

I'm really pleased to see posts like [Security and the One Percent: A Thought Exercise in Estimation and Consequences](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2020/10/security-and-one-percent-thought.html) and [Digital Offense Capabilities Are Currently Net Negative for the Security Ecosystem](https://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2021/02/digital-offense-capabilities-are.html) in this list. We've had some discussion on these topics since I posted them in the fall of 2020, but not enough. The 99% continue to suffer at the hands of adversaries and those in the security 1% who ignore them.

## The Monetization Experiment

I ran an advertising experiment from April 2021 through December 2022. I "earned" $116.96 by February 2022 and $104.39 by December 2022. I don't have view numbers for that whole period, but for calendar year 2022 I attracted a little over 7.5 million views. You can see that I earned about 1.4 x 10^-5 dollars per view. I disabled ads at the end of December.

## From Twitter to Mastodon

One big change I can discern since my 15 year post is that I have now abandoned Twitter and migrated to Mastodon. You can find me at [infosec.exchange/@taosecurity](https://infosec.exchange/%40taosecurity). My current Twitter follower count is about 59.7k, down from just over 60k. My current Mastodon follower count is 1.9k. I don't really care about followers, but I figured I would capture these numbers to see if there is any change in the next five years.

## The Latest Books

I spent the early years of the pandemic collecting my 3,000 or so favorite blog posts into a four volume set called [The Best of TaoSecurity Blog](https://amzn.to/3XdChgJ). I'm really pleased with these books, available via Amazon in print or digital format. They include original posts, but each receives commentary with modern thoughts on the original content. The fourth volume includes material not found in the blog, such as unpublished writings from my abandoned War Studies PhD program or Congressional testimonies.

It looks like Amazon is randomly running a promotion on volume 2 of [The Best of TaoSecurity Blog](https://amzn.to/3CUhur5) while I am writing this post. The print edition is regularly $19.95, but it's currently priced at $7.89. I don't know how long it will last, but if you're interested please check it out.

I also co-wrote and published a book on stretching with a subject matter expert -- [Reach Your Goal: Stretching & Mobility Exercises for Fitness, Personal Training, & Martial Arts](https://amzn.to/3Gn1u1r).
