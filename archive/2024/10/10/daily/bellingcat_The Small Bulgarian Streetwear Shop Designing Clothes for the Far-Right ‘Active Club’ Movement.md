# The Small Bulgarian Streetwear Shop Designing Clothes for the Far-Right ‘Active Club’ Movement

A Bellingcat investigation has found that a far-right fashion brand affiliated with the white supremacist Active Club movement has its products designed by a streetwear shop in the Bulgarian city of Stara Zagora.

The decentralised Active Club movement was founded by American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo. It focuses on using fitness, fighting and fashion – particularly [Will2Rise (W2R)](https://symbols.globalextremism.org/details?recordId=rec08k3xo3bcv8Dz8), the fashion brand Rundo founded alongside Active Clubs – to recruit young men and boys into the far right, normalise fascist ideas and prepare them for physical violence against perceived enemies.

A 2022 [Bellingcat investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/05/24/fascist-fashion-how-mainstream-businesses-enable-the-sale-of-far-right-merchandise/) into far-right webshops detailed how fashion and merchandise sales can help promote racist ideas among youth, provide revenue for hate movements and help the far right strengthen bonds across borders and continents.

A [geolocation](https://x.com/ColborneMichael/status/1630569562516369409) by Bellingcat’s reporter in February 2023 led to our more recent discovery that the designs of almost all of the W2R brand’s recent merchandise – almost 20 separate products, ranging from fashion to flags and stickers – can be traced to a small streetwear shop in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.

Bellingcat has also found that this Bulgarian streetwear shop lists other names from the international far-right movement as its clients. These include a Canadian far-right fashion brand, a 2024 far-right combat sports event that [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2024/03/15/geolocating-a-us-far-right-fight-night/) geolocated earlier in the year, as well as one of the most prominent Active Clubs in the United States.

W2R did not respond to Bellingcat’s requests for comment.

## Old ID, New Story

In February 2023, Robert Rundo was a fugitive in southeastern Europe, evading US federal charges for violence at rallies across California in 2017 and 2018. He had already been the subject of several [Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/?s=rundo) investigations into his activities in southeastern Europe; we had most recently geolocated him to Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in November 2022.

But he wouldn’t stop posting. On Feb. 28, 2023, Bellingcat geolocated two photos that Rundo had posted on W2R’s Telegram channel several days before. Despite attempts to obscure the location, including blurring out background details, Bellingcat was able to [geolocate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QU72y9G5pW3zfPes5) the photos to Stara Zagora, Bulgaria’s sixth-largest city less than 100 kilometres from Plovdiv.

How We Geolocated These Will2Rise Photos to Stara Zagora

These photos might look nearly impossible to geolocate, particularly when background details including signage have been deliberately blurred out. It is also unclear if the photos show Rundo himself, as the person’s face has been obscured.

But there’s plenty of detail here. Here’s how Bellingcat found the location:

1. We hypothesised that the location was somewhere in Bulgaria since we had geolocated Rundo to the country several months earlier, so we started our search there.

2. We noticed that the streets in the second image appear to be laid out in a square grid pattern, with a one-way street. This allowed us to limit our search areas to parts of Bulgarian cities with similar grid patterns.

3. We reviewed Google Street View imagery from these parts of Bulgarian cities to rule out possible matches:

– Google Street View imagery from larger cities including Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna – cities we knew from previous geolocations and research that Rundo had visited – did not reveal similar-looking streets, which suggested that this location was likely in a smaller Bulgarian city.

– The city of Stara Zagora, however, had a similar grid layout – with one-way streets that include left-turn-only intersections – to what is visible in the second photo Rundo posted.

4. After searching Google Street View imagery of central Stara Zagora, focusing on intersections with left-hand turns into one-way streets, Bellingcat found a match for the location of the two photographs based on the placement of street signs and building features.

Just over a month after Bellingcat’s geolocation, Rundo was [arrested](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2023/03/31/violent-white-nationalist-rob-rundo-arrested-romania) in neighbouring Romania and eventually extradited back to the United States. In September 2024, Rundo [pleaded](https://www.bellingcat.com/app/uploads/2024/09/031143179562.pdf) [guilty](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/former-orange-county-resident-linked-white-supremacist-group-pleads-guilty-plotting) in a Los Angeles federal court to planning and engaging in riots across California in 2017. His sentencing hearing is scheduled for December 2024 and he remains in custody.
