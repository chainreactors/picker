# Ulfberht

Shellcode loader

Features :

* Indirect syscall.
* Module stomping.
* Load a stomped module using APC.
* Execute the payload with a direct jump (jmp) without creating a new thread.
* API hashing implemented using the DJB2 algorithm.
* Payload encrypted with RC4 and encoded in UUID format, implemented directly in the loader without loading rpcrt4.dll.
* No CRT is used.

How to use :

```
python3 utils.py C:\Path\To\beacon.bin
```

Copy the output in payload.h and build the project

NB :

* If your shellcode lacks evasion features (e.g., Cobalt Strike without UDRL), it can be detected by AV/EDR

# Evasion Tips

Compiling this executable and using it directly can be risky, as it may expose potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as:

* The file was compiled within the last 5 minutes.
* The Import Address Table (IAT) is empty.

Also

* If you're using a beacon, avoid using an IP for C2 communication. Instead, use a redirector with a good reputation.
* Add an icon to the executable.
* Sign the executable; ideally, use a trusted signature.
* Add delay and sandbox detection.
