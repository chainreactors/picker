[Complete Apple product novice here (my devices all run a non-Apple
OS), but I'm asking for a friend]

Could someone please clarify the following part of the advisory for me:
```

> ```
> This update is available through iTunes and Software Update
> on your iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's
> Software Update application
> ```

```
Does this mean the update will be available via the "Software Update"
feature on an iPhone - or not ?

The quoted paragraph of Apple's advisory is a bit
Schroedinger's-Cat-ish - the update is both available and not
available.

Thanks,

Nick
