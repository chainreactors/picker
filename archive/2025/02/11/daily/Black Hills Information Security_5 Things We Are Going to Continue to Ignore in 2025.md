In this video, John Strand discusses the complexities and challenges of penetration testing, emphasizing that it goes beyond just finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. He highlights the importance of addressing legacy applications and the buildup of obsolete systems within organizations, which often lead to security oversights. Additionally, the discussion covers the need for compensating controls to manage exceptions and vulnerabilities that are difficult to fix, while also touching on the role of cloud services and how they relate to legacy systems.

* Penetration testing should focus on areas beyond automated tasks like vulnerability scanning and exploitation, allowing human testers to engage in activities that AI cannot perform.
* Legacy applications, often neglected by organizations, accumulate vulnerabilities over time, leading to potential security issues when new vulnerabilities or classes of vulnerabilities are discovered.
* Organizations tend to focus on critical vulnerabilities, often creating exceptions for harder-to-fix issues, which can lead to significant security risks if not properly managed.

**John Strand**

Best, you’re an outright liar and a charlatan at worst. And I know, I know, I know that there are people that I actually care for that are on the other side of this fence.

But I’m telling you right now that if you think the penetration testing is just a vulnerability scan, find vulnerabilities, find an exploit, exploit that vulnerability and then pivot, you’ve missed the entire point of the entire industry.

Yes, that is stuff that we do. Yes, that should be automated, but that type of stuff should be automated so that pen testers can do this type of stuff that AI can’t do, won’t do.

So when we’re looking at these things, it once again comes back to these legacy apps, right? If we’re going to blame these things, we’re going to blame the legacy applications that stay forever, we’re going to blame the servers that stay forever.

And when you look at it also from a vulnerability analysis perspective, I have noticed in organizations that the more like aged an organization is, the more legacy crap build up they have.

And this just makes sense. So I, want you all to envision a great big snowball, but I want you to think of a snowball as a great big snowball of crap. And every year it does a rotation and it picks up more crap, it picks up more servers, it picks up more services, it, it picks up more applications and it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

And literally organizations ignore anything that isn’t a critical or a high and they just focus on criticals and highs. And then the lows and the mediums continue to grow, the informationals continue to grow and they get bigger and bigger and bigger and all of these legacy apps kind of fill in to that and then all of a sudden a new vulnerability or class of vulnerabilities comes out and then we start freaking out.

So these legacy apps are things that you have ignored. I’m not blaming you, it’s just that’s the way it works. It’s things that organizations continue to ignore. And it’s something that I’m just going to predict that we’re going to continue to ignore well into the future.

Right? And now some of you may tell me, oh, oh, oh, that’s why cloud services are so much better. I have a special place for cloud, but I’m going to talk about cloud as it relates to legacy services.

I’ve been doing this a long time. I’m not going to name any cloud services not specific to like Microsoft or Azure or anybody like Microsoft Azure or Amazon, or anything like that.

But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but there are a lot of SaaS applications that when you look at the SaaS application, you can see th...
