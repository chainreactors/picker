A 59 year-old Florida telco engineer was sentenced to 48 months in prison after he served as a spy for China and provided Beijing with details like his employer’s cybersecurity, according to the US Department of Justice.

According to the DoJ, Ping Li, a US citizen and Chinese immigrant, [admitted](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/florida-telecommunications-and-information-technology-worker-sentenced-conspiring-act-agent) to being a "cooperative contact" for China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) since as early as 2012 – meaning he assisted in activities like conducting research and obtaining information on behalf of the Ministry.

Li sought info on Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy advocates, members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, US-based non-governmental organizations, and information he obtained from his employer. He used anonymous Gmail and Yahoo*!* accounts, and other online services, to communicate to MSS, and even travelled to China for meetings.
