The last few years have made keeping up with innovation and growth in the financial services industry difficult. Fortunately, SAP is bringing the best in the business together in Boston. On March 8 and 9, we will let you hear from industry experts, connect 1:1 with others in Financial Services, and meet with SAP's executive team privately. The SAP & SAP Fioneer Financial Services Forum Americas has ten amazing pre-conference workshops to give you an industry deep dive. Located at The [InterContinental Boston](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/sap-and-sap-fioneer-financial-services-forum-americas/venue-location), the conference provides you with significant value through networking opportunities. After a global pandemic, economic concerns, and an energy crisis, learn how to navigate thru these difficult waters. This in-person conference gives you the chance to learn what everyone else in the industry has been up to. You'll also be able to expand your horizons beyond the crisis that we've been operating in the past couple of years.

On day one you will enjoy a presentation by Jim Marous, Influencer, Podcast Host and Co-Publisher at The Financial Brand. This will include intriguing visuals and thought-provoking concepts that will challenge the audience to embrace change, take greater risks, and disrupt both themselves and their organization. During this forum, you'll have access to 27 unique sessions about the insurance and banking industries. Digital access after the event allows you to catch all the sessions again if you wish.  Here's a quick glance at four of the innovative sessions. They're just a sample of what you can expect to experience during the conference:

Insurance:

* *Sun Life's Strategy to Modernize Finance Platforms* *- Technology Partners, Experiences and Opportunities.* Dariush Shoja, Sun Life. Finance platforms can be onerous to update, but Shoja walks us through the process of how Sun Life created a solid strategy to modernize their finance platforms effectively, tailored to their business.

* *Charting a New Path Forward for Insurance Company Operating Models*. Christopher Dvorak, Northern Trust and Joerg Pappert, Compiricus. Digital transformation is causing disruption in every industry, including the insurance market. Dvorak and Pappert will show us the process to help insurance companies adopt new operating models to remain relevant in managing Financial Assets, with a BPO operation in place for insurers.

Banking:

* *Is Regulatory Compliance a Boon or a Bane While Moving Workloads to Cloud? How SAP and IBM Have This Figured Out!* Falk Rieker, SAP & Sandy T. Carroll, IBM. Rieker and Carroll cover how IBM helps move workloads to the cloud while remaining in full regulatory compliance.

* *Transforming the Finance Function at Standard Chartered Bank to be Fit-for-Future*. Tom Pfaff, Standard Chartered Bank. How do you move your business' finance function so that it will work well in the future? Pfaff covers how Standard Chartered Bank managed the task.

The past couple of years have caused serious havoc for most people in the financial services industry. In many cases, digital transformation was moved up several years in a matter of weeks. This caused a lot of problems as workers in FinTech adapted to "the new normal". Now it's time to get back on track with strategic digital transformation and proactive planning. But with many workers wanting to keep working remotely, what does that look like? SAP and SAP Fioneer are ready to help you re-shape your organization, innovate in the cloud, and get back into a proactive digital strategy. This in-person event gives you the chance to reconnect, have fun and gain inspiration to take home to your organization. Take advantage of the chance to learn from our executive team, global solutions’ experts, and other industry visionaries. Your registration includes the full one-and-a-half-day event. That means an evening drinks reception, event app access and post-event recordings on-demand of plenary and track sessions. Don't forget to take the opportunity to visit the show floor and see what our partners and sponsors have to offer!  Registration is very easy, just [click on the registration link here](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/sap-and-sap-fioneer-financial-services-forum-americas/)to get started.
