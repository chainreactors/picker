 The [**SAP Community Member Interview Series**](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/sap-community-member-interview/) addresses strategic topics, such as emerging    technologies, learning, and other topics. It provides insights from SAP Community participants    who are making a difference with their contributions (e.g., blogs, Q&A, sessions, etc.).    This series provides insights into their interests and motivations which can inspire all of us. |

Time is our most valuable asset.

Prioritizing the time to contribute to a community represents an opportunity to grow.

By sharing knowledge, community contributors often reflect on the value of giving back, broadening their global network of people and ideas, and developing new skills.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/MustafaCircleProfile.png)Whether solving one’s own challenges, technology requirements, or anticipated outcomes or helping a community member solve their issues, taking a small amount of time to provide answers, blog, and participate in the community is very rewarding.

For mbensan, a leading SAP Community contributor, senior SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) architect, and start-up SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) entrepreneur, he has seen first-hand the value of contributing his time to the SAP Community. From his participation in the [SAP Customer Engagement Initiatives](https://www.sap.com/about/customer-involvement/influence-adopt.html?sort=latest_desc) (CEIs) he has provided valuable feedback to help shape future product direction.

It was a pleasure to catch up with Mustafa during his European travels before returning to his home town of Sydney, Australia.

**Mynyna Chau (MC):** **Hi Mustafa!** **You have challenged the community and world to “Ask you anything about innovating on the** **SAP BTP” From your journey working with market leaders in transportation, financial services, manufacturing, environmental, and electronics, what sparked your passion for SAP BTP?**

**Mustafa Bensan (MB):** Hi Mynyna! I enjoy staying on the cutting edge of trends and technologies that relate to solving business problems.

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Mustafa1.png)**This interest was especially important in my previous role leading the SAP Centre of Excellence Architecture Team at Transport for NSW (New South Wales, Australia), where I needed to keep abreast of the SAP BTP strategy to provide subject matter expertise and guidance. Seeing the evolution of SAP BTP and its potential really inspires me to continue to dig deeper.

Participation in the SAP Customer Engagement Initiatives (CEIs) for SAP HANA Cloud, SAP Work Zone, SAP Launchpad Service, and SAP BTP Account Management has further encouraged my curiosity.

**MC:** **How did you initially get involved in the SAP Community?**

**MB:** Back in 2014, I was doing a lot of work with the analytics product SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio, which later became SAP Lumira. Initially, I started responding to related questions in the SAP Community. In some cases, I had encountered similar issues; in other cases, I took it as a challenge to come up with a solution. The year after, I became more active by publishing a Design Studio Innovation Series of blogs to share my experiences and topics of interest.

Around that time, I was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by SAP Mentor tammy.powlas3, who suggested that I submit a speaking proposal for SAP TechEd in Las Vegas – which I did and was thrilled to be accepted. I was invited back the next year too! I enjoyed attending SAP TechEd as a delegate in the past, so it was great to experience the speaker aspect of the SAP Community.

**MC:** **You are recognized as a leading participant in the Community including as a presenter at SAP TechEd and Mastering SAP Australia, a blogger, answering questions as an “Avid Solver,” and providing feedback on SAP Work Zone, SAP Launchpad, and SAP BTP. Given your busy schedule, what motivates you to find the time to contribute?**

**MB:** A wise mentor once told me, “*It’s not about having the time, it’s about how you prioritize your time*.” Contributing is a great way to learn and engage with members of the community. I really enjoy doing both, so it’s important to me to prioritize ...
