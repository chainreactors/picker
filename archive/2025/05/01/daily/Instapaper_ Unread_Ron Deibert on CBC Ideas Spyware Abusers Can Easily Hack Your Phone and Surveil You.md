# Ron Deibert on CBC Ideas Spyware Abusers Can Easily Hack Your Phone and Surveil You

By [Alyson Bruce](https://citizenlab.ca/author/alyson/ "Posts by Alyson Bruce")

April 24, 2025

In an interview for CBC Ideas, Citizen Lab founder Ron Deibert talks with host Nahlah Ayed about mercenary spyware, sharing that “the latest versions can be implanted on anyone’s device anywhere in the world and as we speak, there is literally no defence against it.”

They also discuss his new book, *Chasing Shadows*, in which he recounts investigations conducted by the Citizen Lab, and reveals the dark underworld of digital espionage and subversion.
