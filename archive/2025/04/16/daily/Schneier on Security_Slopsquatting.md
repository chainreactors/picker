## Slopsquatting

As AI coding assistants invent nonexistent software libraries to download and use, enterprising attackers [create and upload](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/12/ai_code_suggestions_sabotage_supply_chain/) libraries with those names—laced with malware, of course.

I think this is related to the problem described here: <https://m.xkcd.com/2347/>

@ wiredog,

> “I think this is related to the problem…”

In a way…

Think of “Slopsquatting” as a “begining of Artificial life” problem.

And of “Log4J” as an indicator to an “End of hunan life” problem.

The simple fact is it’s not just “burnout” claiming “Lone Open Source” developers, quite a few are now are lets say in the “retirement zone” of being well over 60.

Life expectancy in the US is dropping, some are claiming 61 is where it’s happening. Whilst in West Europe it’s increasing with 82 being claimed where I live…

But the point is as was seen with some quite famous projects lone developers can become nolonger able to develop.

And that gives an opening for attackers when subscriptions to servers etc lapse. What term they might call it could be “EOLsquatting” because in one form or another it will happen to every project sone day.

“Slopsquatting.” Perfect name.

Sort of similarly related, in that groups are exploiting community moderation.

Organized teams are editing public references used to train AI language models.

You cannot make this s\*\*\* up.

Some parts of the IT industry are on a fast track to peak stupidity. In endless efforts to produce code just a bit cheaper, they lose it all. It is high time for liability, including personal liability, as engineers have in other fields when they step outside of sound practices.
