Over the past two-and-a-half years while I’ve served as Chief Financial Officer at SentinelOne, one thing has become glaringly apparent; the increasing role that Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) now play in staunching the [rise](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/watchtower-trends-and-top-cybersecurity-takeaways-from-2022/) in cybersecurity threats.

As technological infrastructures grow, increasing numbers and severity of attacks have put organizations across every industry at severe risk. A CFO’s main responsibility is to maximize their organization’s value, and increased risk threatens that value. Even one successful attack on a business can negatively impact revenues, expenses, and cash flows.

In close partnership with other C-level executives, CFOs can help safeguard their business from a financial point of view by investing in the right processes and technologies. In this post, we’ll explore how a vested interest in understanding and assessing security technology helps CFOs maximize their company’s value while contending with advancing cyber threats.

## The True Cost of Endpoint Data Breaches

[Hybrid](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/security-implications-of-a-hybrid-workforce/) workspaces and soaring numbers of endpoint devices have become prime targets for cybercriminals. Used to gain access to sensitive information and disrupt business operations, risks on the endpoint surface directly affect an organization’s finances. IBM’s [Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ) found the following:

* The cost of data breaches stood at an averaged total of $4.35 million.
* The cost of an average ransomware attack, not including the cost of the ransom, came to $4.54 million.
* Companies that had robust incident response (IR) teams and plans saved an average of $2.66 million.

The financial loss stemming from a successful cyberattack goes beyond the immediate costs – [ransom payments](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransoms-without-ransomware-data-corruption-and-other-new-tactics-in-cyber-extortion/), extortion fees, damage to IT infrastructure – and extends into long-term ramifications too. Fallout from even one cyber attack can [cost](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/what-is-the-true-cost-of-a-ransomware-attack-6-factors-to-consider/) an organization months of legal fees, penalties for those in highly regulated fields, operational downtime, and a long-lasting damage of brand and reputation. Organizations that handle personally identifiable information (PII) must face drastically higher costs with affected customers filing lawsuits of their own. While media outlets focus on loss of customer data, the loss of intellectual property (IP) can also devastate a company’s projected growth.

## A CFO’s Role in Cybersecurity & Endpoint Understanding

Finance departments oversee all levels of data reporting and CFOs are in tune with where sensitive information is stored, what safeguards are in place, and who has access to it. This makes the CFO a critical player in the effort to strengthen a company’s cybersecurity posture. With endpoints at the heart of every organization, CFOs can help [ensure](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/dealing-with-cyberattacks-a-survival-guide-for-c-levels-it-owners/) that the right security is in place by implementing [endpoint security](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/5-traits-of-a-great-endpoint-security-system/) such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) solutions.

By working closely with an organization’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and technical teams, CFOs can accurately assess the risks associated with their organization’s endpoint devices and determine the appropriate investment level in endpoint security. This may include setting a budget for endpoint security solutions, security staffing, and regularly reviewing the organization’s endpoint security posture to ensure it remains effective in protecting against emerging threats.

Cybersecurity systems not only ensure businesses are protected from fluctuating risks in the threat landscape, but also benefit the organizational growth in the following ways:

* Securing current valuation: Organizations that are unprotected and unprepared will be most vulnerable to the exponential cost of an attack. Robust endpoint security solutions ensure organizations [keep their risks low](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ciso-wins-reducing-risk-across-endpoint-identity-and-cloud-surfaces/) and can obtain cyber insurance at reasonable rates, which requires businesses to show effective security measures.
* Establishing long-term sustainability: Building up a strong cyber resilience means continuing the success and growth of an organization. Protected organizations uphold a positive reputation within their communities and are seen as fiscally responsible, making them the ideal choice for prospective clients and partners.
* Improving overall risk management: C-level executives are focused on business critical items affecting the organization. When cybersecurity receives buy-in from the top of the company, cyber policies and procedures are more likely to be followed and improved for ongoing risk mitigation and management.

## Understanding Endpoint Security Attack Vectors

The more a CFO understands the attack vectors associated with endpoints, the better they can allocate resources to reduce risk. CFOs can unite IT staff, operations, security, and legal teams to make sure that their organization’s endpoint devices are properly secured and compliant with relevant regulations.

### Securing Endpoint Users

Increasingly, the endpoint has become the forefront of information security and the true perimeter of the enterprise. Users now have more control over their endpoints than ever. Even if they can’t install their own programs, remote work allows users to choose which tools they want added to the cloud and where in the world they connect to work from. This freedom of choice means that a user’s endpoint has transformed into the most exposed target for malicious actors looking to target the enterprise.

As such, protecting endpoints at the user level is crucial to maintaining security across an organization. To protect against human errors, misconfigurations, or malicious [insider threats](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/surviving-the-storm-defending-against-cloud-misconfigurations-vulnerabilities-and-insider-threats/), CFOs can collaborate with the CISO to conduct regular cybersecurity awareness training and instill the notion that endpoint protection is not an obstacle to work processes, but instead, a vital element of it.

### Securing IoT Devices

Internet of Things (IoT) devices are a common attack vector in endpoint security, but organizations continue to adopt their use as a means to streamline workflows and communications. Without an endpoint detection solution in place, IoT devices may become blind spots where opportunistic attackers make their entry point. A solution such as EDR or XDR provides continuous monitoring, identifying and mitigating risks introduced by unmonitored IoT devices. By providing visibility into sec...
