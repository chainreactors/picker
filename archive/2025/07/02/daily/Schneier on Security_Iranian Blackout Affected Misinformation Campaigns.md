## Iranian Blackout Affected Misinformation Campaigns

Dozens of accounts on X that promoted Scottish independence [went dark](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/news/politics/iranian-pro-scottish-independence-accounts-35450209) during an internet blackout in Iran.

Well, that’s one way to identify fake accounts and misinformation campaigns.

<https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk> does not read like a neutral source

@ Bruce,

Hmm

A sparse and effectively singluar event used as confirmation of an unsafe political hypothesis is not exactly proof of anything especially when you know more about the political parties involved.

Independence in Scotland has been a thorn in not just Scottish politicians sides but that of English politicians as well, for a very very long time.

The fact that there is a Scottish Parliament and First Minister is proof of just how much of a thorn, and for how long it has been there.

Thus politicians in Scotland and England will claim any falsehood if they can use it to deflect reality.

Put simply sufficient Scots want out of the Union before the English Parliament bleeds Scotland dry of all it’s natural resources.

The English Parliament is desperate because due to repeated incumbents being fiscally irresponsible to certain vested interests the UK and especially England is bankrupt in all but name.

Robbing Peter to pay off Paul has never been a wise policy as it almost always ends up with a level of disagreement that can not be stopped. Worse others see it as a way to “steal by proxy” something a lot of third world nations have been forced into by the likes of the IMF, World Bank etc. Worse in Europe the EU pulled the same tactics thought up by WWII German Economists on Southern Europe which is why much of the EU is now in the dreadful state it is in.

The fact that the US State Dept has been actively trying to sabotage the EU for more than thirty years and probably more than half a century has not exactly gone unnoticed and I think comments by the Current US President and his appointees has made that abundantly clear.

I can not say if Iran has been behind one or two campaigns for Scottish independence, but I can say they they probably had minimal or no effect.

But further even if true, we can in fairly good probability lay the driver behind them at other nations doors and with way more credible reasons.

As I and others pointed out “last time around” a political appointee as National Security Advisor Mr John Bolton did just about everything he could to start a war with either Iran or China, something that is still clearly written in history.

Every thing John Bolton and others at State have done is to try and foment war with either Iran or China. Now China has progressed it’s military capability to a point that it’s questionable if the US could reach anything even as good as a pyrrhic draw, that just leaves Iran and the Middle East on the table…

The problem is that as the rest of the world has seen with “Putin’s Promises” to Assad and Syria all Middle Eastern nations will get “hung out to dry” by what are nolonger World Super Powers…

And Trump has kind of shot himself in the foot with NATO so it’s unlikely European Nations will do an “Article 5” supportive action of the US unless they see a very real threat to them.

But some are going to ask “Why” the US is going after Iran that actually offers them no threat and untill recently did not.

Well in part it’s China… China gas an energy crisis and is kept afloat by Middle East Oil. The view of some is “cut off the supply, kneecap China”.

It’s really not a wise viewpoint, as it makes alternative energy supply options something that China will have seriously considered for quite some time as well as how to deal with it.

The Chinese tend to think long term, the US bot even short term as recent tariff events have demonstrated.

Now just about every one will know that US politicians can not in any way be trusted. The “Chips Act” being a case in point…

Nobody in their right mind is going to build anything in the US that can get grabbed under the war act etc, unless they consider it “throw away”…

The material comes from Clemson University, South Carolina, via the UK Defence Journal. Would those be neutral sources? If not why not?

So, somebody found a false flag… yawn.

@Untitled

thanks for the links, The Editor’s Note at the bottom of the defencejournal article puts the whole story in perspective. And the Clemson paper is nearly a year old. It took an illegal act by a neighbour for this to meke MSM.

@ Untitled, ALL,

With regards,

> “Would those be neutral sources? If not why not?”

It’s not a question of if they are neutral, it’s a question of if they are right or wrong and importantly if they had sufficient information to investigate or not.

I’m thinking they did not have sufficient information.

Consider that the Iranian political military[1] that gets the biggest slice of the budget.

They would be the least likely to be effected by power outages…

Thus I would look at others routing IP traffic through Iran as part of a false flag operation.

To stay “under the radar” they would be using ordinary civilian service and swapping it about in various ways.

Thus if IP networking gets hit by power outage the least likely to get hit would be the IRGC the most likely the civilian networks.

Thus if I had to come up with ...
