~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Canon PIXMA TR4550 is an entry-level 4-in-1 printer equipped with
Wi-Fi connectivity.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Ready to adapt to your smart home office environment, this efficient
4-In-One printer requires minimal space but gives maximum support to
your projects. Whether scanning a document, copying an ID, faxing an
invoice or printing posters, PIXMA TR4550 has the functionality to keep
up with your business needs. Equipped with smart Wi-Fi connectivity to
optimise management of functions and features, this front-loading
4-In-One printer is the compact solution that saves space, streamlines
ink usage and brings productivity to the forefront."

The unprotected storage of credentials and insufficient data removal
during a factory reset allows sensitive data to be read out afterward.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The Canon PIXMA TR4550 stores sensitive data, such as the SSID and the
Wi-Fi pre-shared key (PSK), unencrypted in its persistent storage
(EEPROM).

Resetting the product to factory settings (via 'Setup', 'Device
settings', 'Reset setting' and 'All data') does not securely delete this
sensitive information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS could successfully perform a proof-of-concept attack via the
following steps:

* Configure and establish a Wi-Fi connection.
* Reset all data (Setup, Device settings, Reset setting, All data).
* Disassemble the printer and locate the EEPROM on the PCB.
* Create an EEPROM memory dump.
* Search and locate the configured SSID and PSK in the memory dump.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

Canon PSIRT published its security advisory "Vulnerability
Mitigation/Remediation for Inkjet Printers (Home and Office/Large
Format)" (CP2023-003)[3] describing how sensitive information should be
deleted concerning the affected printers[5].
