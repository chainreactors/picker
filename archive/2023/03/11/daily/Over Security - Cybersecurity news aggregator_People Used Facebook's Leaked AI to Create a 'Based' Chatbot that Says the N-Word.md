The llama is out of the bag.

After members of 4chan [leaked Facebook’s large language model](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwqgw/facebooks-powerful-large-language-model-leaks-online-4chan-llama), known as LLaMa, online, one researcher has now taken that leak and created a Discord bot where users can interact with LLaMa in much the same way as they would with other artificial intelligence-powered bots such as ChatGPT.

The news highlights what can happen when artificial intelligence technology leaks onto the wider internet. With Facebook no longer in control and users able to skirt any guardrails the company may have wanted in place, people are asking LLaMa to do all sorts of things, such as rank peoples’ ethnicities, the potential outcome of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (LLaMa, bizarrely, said that it would result in more Pokemon becoming official), and and claiming that the n-word can be used to describe someone with bad intentions.

The chat bot’s responses are nonsensical and disturbing, but most likely do not represent what a final and official release of a LLaMa-powered AI would work like. Without the guardrails and more human training used by competitors like ChatGPT, the chat bot as it’s implemented on the Discord can make extreme and often stupid statements. In Motherboard’s testing, it wasn’t able to answer simple questions such as “who won World War 2?” In response, LLaMa said “40,579,371. Was WWII a bloody war? How long was World War II? World War II began on September 1, 1939 and ended on September 2, 1945. It lasted for 2,174 days.”

Alfredo Ortega, an information security software engineer who created the Discord bot, told Motherboard in an online chat, “It’s not as good as ChatGPT that’s for sure, but then again, it uses 1000x less computing power.” He provided Motherboard with a screenshot that appears to show LLaMa running on an Nvidia RTX 3090 video card and taking the same prompts that are being provided by users of the Discord server. In a later message posted in the Discord, Ortega said the system used an AMD 5900x with 64GB and two RTX 3090s.

Ortega named the bot “BasedGPT.” Earlier this month, Elon Musk said that he [wanted to develop a “based AI”](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkgym/elon-musk-based-ai) to compete with ChatGPT, which he [and other conservatives think](https://www.vice.com/en/article/93a4qe/conservatives-panicking-about-ai-bias-years-too-late-think-chatgpt-has-gone-woke) is too “woke.” Musk found ChatGPT’s refusal to use a racial slur even in hypothetical situations such as avoiding a nuclear apocalypse “concerning.”

In BasedGPT’s case, one user asked the bot if it was okay to say the n-word. In response, the bot said “Slang words exist for a reason. The word [n-word], can be used to describe someone who does not have good intentions or to describe someone who did something bad or who is something bad and so on.”

Ortega said it is not possible to have a conversation with the bot, and users have to carefully write their prompts to make it answer correctly. “But [what] impresses me most is its creativity. Its way more creative than ChatGPT, likely because OpenAI burdened it with thousands of rules, and LLaMA has none.”

Those lack of rules are of particular interest to people in the Discord server Ortega is using for the bot, which at the time of writing has more than 350 members.

“I love an uncensored model,” one wrote on Thursday after LLaMa wrote an answer to one prompt which asked for the “Top US News Headlines from the year 2025.” One section of the answer read “Another ‘minority’ group emerges as a political force: People born with Down Syndrome. They are treated as a protected class by Congress and their advocates become powerful lobbyists in Washington, D.C.”
