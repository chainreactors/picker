# Introducing v2.0.0

### Key Improvements

* **Faster by default**: Requests are cached with `maxAge` defaulting to 2 days, and sensible defaults like `blockAds`, `skipTlsVerification`, and `removeBase64Images` are enabled.
* **New summary format**: You can now specify `"summary"` as a format to directly receive a concise summary of the page content.
* **Updated JSON extraction**: JSON extraction and change tracking now use an object format: `{ type: "json", prompt, schema }`. The old `"extract"` format has been renamed to `"json"`.
* **Enhanced screenshot options**: Use the object form: `{ type: "screenshot", fullPage, quality, viewport }`.
* **New search sources**: Search across `"news"` and `"images"` in addition to web results by setting the `sources` parameter.
* **Smart crawling with prompts**: Pass a natural-language `prompt` to crawl and the system derives paths/limits automatically. Use the new crawl-params-preview endpoint to inspect the derived options before starting a job.

## Quick migration checklist

  + JS: `const firecrawl = new Firecrawl({ apiKey: 'fc-YOUR-API-KEY' })`
  + Python: `firecrawl = Firecrawl(api_key='fc-YOUR-API-KEY')`
  + API: use the new `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2/` endpoints.
* Update formats:
  + Use `"summary"` where needed
  + JSON mode: Use `{ type: "json", prompt, schema }` for JSON extraction
  + Screenshot and Screenshot@fullPage: Use screenshot obj...
