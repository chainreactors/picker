**Objective**

Singapore law permits corporates and legal entities to change their reporting and local currency to USD instead of SGD. It has been a popular exercise, which is in practice by several corporates as they keep USD as their primary reporting currency in Singapore.

When these corporates/ legal entities want to implement S/4HANA Public Cloud they expect to continue to follow their practice of keeping their primarily currency as USD in SAP also.

It is already predefined in the S/4HANA Cloud system and is the national currency of the company code.

Many consultants don't know what are the reports available in functional currency.

This is personal view. This blog has been written based on my personal view and understanding. SAP provides this function however couple of reports are a challenge to get from SAP and we will tackle those reports in this blog.

**What Currencies Are Available in S/4HANA Cloud:**

1. **Local Currency:** official/business currency of the country. E.g., Singapore = SGD, India = INR and Germany = EUR etc. It is always **defined company code and country combination** in the system.

2. **Global Currency:** currency which is a corporate (group of companies) currency, and **one currency is valid for the entire system**.

3. **Additional currency or 3rd Currency:** As of now S/4HANA System allows just **one additional currency type (currency) per company code** in the system to keep. It is not like S/4HANA OP where we can, I guess, up to 8 currencies additionally. So, you would be able to choose one additional currency as per your requirement.

You can access this blog to understand how 3rd currency is defined: [**How to Define Additional Currency in S/4HANA Cloud**](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/06/freely-defined-currency-or-additional-currency-functional-currency-in-s-4hana-public-cloud/#:~:text=Option%20to%20assign%203rd%20Currency,Currency%20also%20selected%20as%20ZA.)

4. **Functional Currency:** Functional currency is also available in S/4HANA Cloud, but it is not an additional currency type. Functional currency needs to be assigned to one of the existing currency types e.g., Functional Currency is assigned with Currency Type ‘10’ or ‘30’ or any custom currency type e.g., ‘Z0’. In case of Singapore it shall be custom currency type with USD currency.

You can access this blog to understand how functional currency is defined: [**How to Define Functional Currency in S/4HANA Cloud**](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/06/freely-defined-currency-or-additional-currency-functional-currency-in-s-4hana-public-cloud/#:~:text=Option%20to%20assign%203rd%20Currency,Currency%20also%20selected%20as%20ZA.)

**Solution to this Issue**

* Define Additional Currency with USD: You can define additional currency type with USD for Singapore company codes. You would be able to keep different currencies per company code as your additional currency or 3rd currency. Please refer above mentioned blogs for this.

* Select Additional Currency Type as your Functional currency: You need to select this additional currency type as your functional currency in your Singapore company code(s). please refer the above mentioned blogs for this as well.

Functional currency is the solution to many business reporting requirements. however, SAP system does not generate all the reports in the functional currency and hence this solution has issues. We now understand this solution has some limitations, how can we overcome them?

**There are multiple reports which have an option of additional/ 3rd currency in the report but no option of functional currency...
