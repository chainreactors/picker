## Remote Vulnerabilities in Automobiles

This group has found [a ton](https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry/) of remote vulnerabilities in all sorts of automobiles.

It’s enough to make you want to buy a car that is *not* Internet-connected. Unfortunately, that seems to be impossible.

Before everyone in here races to cancel their order of a new Rolls-Royce they offer a bespoke “design your own car” service where you can direct design of a new car from the ground up if you have the money. So design a car with no internet. Problem solved!

As for future millionaires “kit cars” are a thing. For the lazy there’s actually a rather spiffy “Royal” Double Six for sale. It’s a copy of the 1931-1935 Daimler Double Six. Only a snip at £50K. The British movie star Anna Neagle had an original Daimler Double Six. Dear God I have always drooled after those. I personally like it more than the contemporaneous Bentley 4.5 litre the fictional James Bond drove.

For those with a pocket full of dust and buttons (i.e. moi) there’s another solution. You can buy a Stanley hammer for £12.

@echo, All

re: *bespoke & kit cars*

In the USA, there are loads and loads of regulations about how a car is supposed to work and items it must have. Seat belts and Air Bags are commonly understood to be in modern cars sold in USA. There are federal and state agencies that oversee this aspect.

Kit cars and bespoke cars must also comply with these rules.

Many aspects of modern cars, tractors and Big Rigs is found in the firmware computer chips that run many subsystems: brakes are a big one. As many have discovered that when one of these chips fail, it’s a big cost to replace the chip and/or circuit board.

You might be able to bespoke a “no entertainment” HUD, many cars from 5-10 years ago had minimal information on the HUD/UI. They still have integrated circuit systems for calibrating speed, cruise control, tire pressure and the bad news ENGINE CHECK light.

Many of these systems currently get updates done at service time; many also do Over The Air updates. You might never use or sub to OnStar, but it’s operating 24×7 anyway. All you gotta do is press the Red Button and Bob’s Your Uncle.

A pair of wire cutters to the antenna cable is usually a pretty good way to disable Internet connectivity.

But when a car is made mostly of nails, by the time you’ve hit all of them there won’t be much left to drive

@ Chelloveck

I think you may find that there aren’t any antenna cables. The antennae are built into the circuit board. Now, you can still go after them with razor blades, but do be careful, lest you break something important…

Oh, and that ‘something important’ may very well much depend upon an occasional ‘phoning home’.

If you can access UI, it may be possible to disable the wifi connection, unless the manufacturer has locked it.

That would be less violent then snipping physical parts.

<https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Elvis>

> Elvis was a villain in the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd. He was a car that went rogue and started a killing spree.
>
> […]
>
> Elvis was originally a robotic car owned by Dave and Davina Paton and when Dave was working on his car, he accidently dropped his spanner onto the car’s responsibility circuit. While Dave was riding in Elvis, the car started to speed up and Dave frantically ordered Elvis to slow down but Elvis refused so Dave attempted to shut him off but Elvis proceeds to strangle him and then uses the ejector chair on him, mortally wounding him. Elvis then goes on a rampage, running over numerous people.

Better lay off the DIY tinkering. Yikes!

It’s amazing one team could find such a scope of web vulns across the automobile industry.

In Mercedes’ case, the researchers were originally looking to gain privileges by exploiting the SSO system.

In their searches, they happened upon a website where vehicle repair shops could create accounts. The publicly available site wrote to the same LDAP database used for employees.

So they created an account and then used these credentials to sign on to a discovered Mercedes Github account.

There they found internal documentation and source code, including for the Mercedes Me Connect app that allows customers to remotely connect to their vehicles.

They could also use their credentials to sign on to a Mercedes Slack-like app where they could join any channel, including security channels, and even pose as an employee to ask questions.

Thank goodness these vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed.

**100K car 63 seconds and gone.**

On of the problems with all these internal electronics systems in cars, is they make then oh so much easier to steal…

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-64151619>

These are increasingly “highly organised” and very much “stolen to order” the chance of getting the vehicle back intact is fairly close to zero.

Whilst the Police do not say it, out right, they know that all these electronics b...
