## Sourceware 25 Roadmap

Posted on August 7, 2023, 15:34.

[Sourceware](https://sourceware.org/) has been running for almost 25 years, providing a worry-free, developer friendly home for Free Software core toolchain and developer tool communities. And we would like to keep providing that for the next 25 years.

That is why in the last couple of years we have started to diversify our hardware partners, setup new services using containers and isolated VMs, investigated secure supply chain issues, added redundant mirrors, created a non-profit home, collected funds, invested in open communication, open office hours and introduced community oversight by a [Sourceware Project Leadership Committee](https://sourceware.org/mission.html#plc) with the help from the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

Please [participate](https://sourceware.org/mission.html#organization) and let us know what more we (and you!) can do to make Sourceware and all hosted projects a success for the next 25 years.

Full history and roadmap for the next 25 on sourceware.org: [Sourceware 25 Roadmap](https://sourceware.org/sourceware-25-roadmap.html).
