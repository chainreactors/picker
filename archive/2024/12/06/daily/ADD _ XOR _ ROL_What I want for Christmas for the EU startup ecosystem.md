### What I want for Christmas for the EU startup ecosystem

Hey all,

I have written about the various drags on the European tech industry [in the past](https://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2023/12/a-list-of-factors-that-acted-as-drag-on.html?m=1), and recently been involved in discussions on both X and BlueSky about what Europe needs.

In this post, I will not make a wishlist of what concrete policy reforms I want, but rather start "product centric" -- e.g. what "user experience" would I want as a founder? Once it is clear what experience you want as a founder, it becomes easier to reverse-engineer what policy changes will be needed.

What would Europe need to make starting a company smoother, easier, and better?

Let's jointly imagine a bit what the world could look like.

Imagine a website where the following tasks can be performed:

1. Incorporation of a limited liability company with shares. The website offers a number of standardized company bylaws that cover the basics, and allows the incorporation of a limited liability company on-line (after identity verification etc.).
2. Management of simple early-stage funding rounds on-line: Standardized SAFE-like instruments, or even a standardized Series A agreement, and the ability to sign these instruments on-line, and verify receipt of funds.
3. Management of the cap table (at least up to and including the Series A).
4. Ability to employ anyone in the Eurozone, and run their payroll, social security contributions, and employer-side healthcare payments. Possibly integrated with online payment.
5. Ability to grant employee shares and manage the share grants integrated with the above, with the share grants taxed in a reasonable way (e.g. only tax them on liquidity event, accept the shares themselves as tax while they are illiquid, or something similar to the US where you can have a lightweight 409a valuation to assign a value to the shares).
6. Integration with a basic accounting workflow that can be managed either personally or by an external accountant, with the ability to file simplified basic taxes provided overall revenue is below a certain threshold.
7. Ways of dealing with all the other paperwork involved in running a company on-line.

This is a strange mixture of Carta, Rippling, Docusign, Cloud Atlas, a Notary, and Intuit -- but it would make the process of starting and running a company much less daunting and costly.

Ideally, I could sign up to the site, verify my identity, incorporate a basic company with standardized bylaws, raise seed funding, employ people, run their payroll, and file basic taxes and paperwork.

In the above dream, what am I missing?

My suspicion is that building and running such a website would actually be not difficult (if the political will in Europe existed), and would have a measurable impact on company formation and GDP. If we want economic growth like the US, Europe needs to become a place where building and growing a business is easier and has less friction than in the US.

So assuming the gaps that I am missing are filled in, the next step is asking: What policy reforms are necessary to reach this ideal?
