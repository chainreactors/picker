As is traditional, a few photos of the year‚Äôs first purple-and-yellow garden citizens; portents of approaching spring that
are much appreciated while the days are still short and wet and grey.

The first half of February is on the early side, but not as early as last year when we saw them in January.

I had a quarrel
with our cat, who observed me lying down outside to get an angle on these guys and wanted, of course, to frolic in the foliage
right where I was looking.

One picture is with my aging Pixel 4, the others with a ‚Äúreal‚Äù camera. Since my daughter has a Film project and
has absconded with my
favorite modern lenses, these are through an at-least-50-year-old Pentax 50mm F1.4; good for portraits of
flowers and people both.

That failing Pixel is annoying me; its battery is hurting and USB-C socket becoming less reliable. I loathe that USB-C form
factor more and more every passing year.
Since nobody but Asus
is making a good *small* Android and they‚Äôre not offering it in Canada, it looks like a Pixel 7 is in my future. I like
things that still work fine fifty years later, but that‚Äôs not the world we live in.

That world is generally pretty fucked up what with climate and Covid and war and burgeoning fascism. One of these years has
to turn out nice, right?

But anyhow, the flowers are coming up. Their slender stems punch effortlessly through last year‚Äôs dead leaves; I think
there‚Äôs a lesson for us in that.

Nice photo's as always! On tech- I think it is past time that innovation started focusing on longevity not features.

Took my first crocus picture yesterday. With a Pixel 2 that's holding on, though I also think a Pixel 7 is in my future, sooner than I want it. I'll see if I can get it to Mastodon without too much pain.

For the love of god, why can't they make a sturdy USB-C port that doesn't weaken with age.

A small android makes me think of the film Silent Running; the actors inside the robots were people with dwarfism.

No Crocii here yet i think, forecast for -8¬∞C tonight so a little cold yet.

If the lens doesn‚Äôt have fungal growth in it, 50-year-old glass should be just fine!
