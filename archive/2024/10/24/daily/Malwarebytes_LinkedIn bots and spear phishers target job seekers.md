# LinkedIn bots and spear phishers target job seekers

Posted: October 23, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Microsoft’s social network for professionals, LinkedIn, is an important platform for job recruiters and seekers alike. It’s also a place where criminals go to find new potential victims.

Like other social media platforms, LinkedIn is no stranger to bots attracted to special keywords and hashtags. Think “I was laid off”, “I’m #opentowork” and similar phrases that can wake up a swarm of bots hungry to scam someone new.

Bots are problematic as they not only create a poor user experience but also present real security risks. Perhaps even more insidious are customized [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts, where fraudulent LinkedIn accounts directly reach out to their victim via the premium InMail feature. In this case, it’s all about harvesting [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from targets of interest.

In this article, we review recent observations and provide tips for job seekers and users of the platform in general.

## Hungry bots

Online bots are so common that they transcend every possible industry: advertising, music and concerts, social media, games, and more. There are even companies whose entire business model is to disrupt and contain bots. The impact of bots depends on which point of view you are taking, as it can range from simple nuisance, to opinion swaying, costly fraud, and a lot more in between.

We recently observed fake LinkedIn accounts that prey on those just laid off. Within minutes of a post, dozens of accounts start replying with links or requests to be added as a connection.

The use of certain hashtags was already known to attract bots, and the *#opentowork* one is no different. Ironically, even a recruiter was previously swamped with similar messages and questioned whether they might have to refrain from ever having to use the hashtag again:

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/image_9344be.png?w=1024)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/image_9344be.png)

The battle between HR and the bots was featured in a Brian Krebs [article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/10/glut-of-fake-linkedin-profiles-pits-hr-against-the-bots/) from a couple of years ago. While the accounts we saw in the most recent campaign were not labeled as recruiters directly, they often pointed to other profiles that were. In the majority of cases, scammers used the name of real people and their pictures to create new accounts.

It appears their primary goal may be to gain connections by pretending to help a job seeker. This may increase the supposed authenticity of their profile and make it harder to shut them down.

LinkedIn did take action sometime after we witnessed the original [spam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spam) wave. Many of the accounts indeed disappeared and comments were removed. It’s unclear whether this was a result of user reports, LinkedIn’s own algorithms, or a combination of both.

Fine tuning anti-fraud algorithms requires constant calibrat...
