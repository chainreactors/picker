In the contemporary digital landscape, vulnerability management teams and analysts are overwhelmed by countless alerts, data streams, and patch recommendations. The sheer volume of information is daunting and frequently misleading. Ideally, the systems generating these alerts should streamline and prioritize the information. While AI systems and products are not yet mature enough to effectively filter out the noise, the solution still lies with humans—particularly, the experts who can accurately identify what’s critical and advise where to concentrate limited resources.  That’s where Exodus Intelligence comes in. Exodus focuses on investigating the vulnerabilities that matter, helping teams to reduce efforts on unnecessary alerting while focusing attention on critical and immediate areas of concern.

**EXPERTISE IN (UN)EXPLOITABILITY**

 The threat landscape is diverse, ranging from payloads and malware to exploits and vulnerabilities. At Exodus, we target the root of the issue—the vulnerabilities. However, not just any vulnerability catches our attention. We dedicate our expertise to uncovering, analyzing, and documenting the most critical vulnerabilities within realistic, enterprise-level products that are genuinely exploitable. This emphasis on exploitability is intentional and pivotal. The intelligence we offer guides our customers towards becoming UN-EXPLOITABLE.

**UNRIVALED TALENT POOL**

Exodus has fostered a culture over more than a decade that attracts and nurtures white hat hackers. We employ some of the world’s most advanced reverse engineers to conduct research for our customers, providing them with actionable intelligence and leading-edge insights to harden their network. Our relentless efforts are geared towards staying at the forefront of leading techniques and skills essential to outpace the world’s most advanced adversaries. Understanding and defending against a hacker necessitates a hacker’s mindset and skill set, which is precisely what we employ and offer.

 **RESPECTED INDUSTRY STANDING**

 Our team has won pwn2own competitions, authored books, and trained the most advanced teams worldwide. Our expertise and research have been relied upon by the United States and allied nations’ agencies for years, establishing a global reputation for us as one of the most advanced, mature, and reputable teams in this field.

**PRECISE DETECTION**

 Exodus researchers dedicate weeks or even months to delve deep into the code to discover unknown vulnerabilities and analyze known (patched) vulnerability root causes. Our researchers develop an in-depth understanding of every vulnerability we report, often surpassing the knowledge of the developers themselves. The mitigation and detection guidance we provide ensures the accurate detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities, eliminating false positives. We don’t merely attempt to catch the exploit; we actually do.

**EXCEPTIONAL VALUE**

 We have a dedicated team of over 30 researchers from across the globe, focusing solely on vulnerability research. In many companies, professionals and security engineers tasked with managing vulnerabilities and threats often have to deal with tasks outside their core competency. Now, imagine leveraging the expertise and output of 30 researchers dedicated to vulnerability research, all for the price of ONE cybersecurity engineer. Need we say more?…
