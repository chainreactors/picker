## China Hacked Japan’s Military Networks

The NSA discovered the intrusion in 2020—we don’t know how—and alerted the Japanese. The *Washington Post* has the [story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/08/07/china-japan-hack-pentagon/):

> The hackers had deep, persistent access and appeared to be after anything they could get their hands on—plans, capabilities, assessments of military shortcomings, according to three former senior U.S. officials, who were among a dozen current and former U.S. and Japanese officials interviewed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.
>
> […]
>
> The 2020 penetration was so disturbing that Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, and Matthew Pottinger, who was White House deputy national security adviser at the time, raced to Tokyo. They briefed the defense minister, who was so concerned that he arranged for them to alert the prime minister himself.
>
> Beijing, they told the Japanese officials, had breached Tokyo’s defense networks, making it one of the most damaging hacks in that country’s modern history.

When I read this coverage initially, a week ago, I had the same question I have now: presumably when the US and Japan discovered this penetration three years ago, they took action to use it to their advantage as much as possible, i.e. by making wrong or misleading information available through those same channels.

What, if anything, can we reason about that kind of strategy, given that it is both obvious and not mentioned in Ellen Nakashima’s original article, which does not appear to have had any followups?

Does the fact that this was kept under wraps since 2020 and is now public (through a coordinated leak? “three former senior U.S. officials.”) suggest anything? Does it suggest anything different that other intergovernmental hacking incidents have been publicized on far shorter timeframes?

Big FUD as coming up a new budget formulation cycle. Japan, like every nation, has an air gapped defense network for anything of import ala JWICS equiv and I have serious doubts that got hacked, at least in reference to this story.

Always question “the sky is falling” anytime during budget season.

I just want to note that Ellen Nakashima mentioned a book in her article that looks interesting.

I’m guessing it’s “Special Duty: A History of the Japanese Intelligence Community.”

I’m not 100% certain this is the right book though, as the reference was to a Richard Samuels’ history that was “published last year.” The book above was published in 2019. Perhaps she started the article earlier and set it aside? The editorial reviews look intriguing.

Presumably the Americans knew about this because they, too, had hacked the Japanese.

I find the idea of a Japanese-American general like Paul Nakasone (who shares a surname with a former Japanese Prime Minister, no less) briefing the Japanese quite amusing.

I expect it is easier to get wind of this kind of thing from within the attacking organization.

@ Peter,

> an air gapped defense network for anything of import … and I have serious doubts that got hacked

Why, and what would “hacked” even mean in this context? We’ve seen that a tiny USB flash drive or a series of discs is all one needs for an insider to walk out with “all the data”. Is that a hack? Whether the Chinese government is directly “on” the network hardly matters if they’ve got moles who are. I’m sure they can pay quite well, and offer asylum in China for anyone who can make it there (or just to an embassy; sure, countries will fuck with the diplomatic flights of Bolivia, but China would never stand for that).

Unless the air gaps are exceptionally strict, someone who gets clever malware onto an air-gapped network could even have data flowing “across” the gaps automatically. Realistically, military people will want to be e-mailing and phoning each other even for things of moderate import. While the plans to invade China won’t be e-mailed, they’re not gonna have people fly from base to base for all lesser communication.

@ Bruce, ALL,

It would apear Japan is having an embarrassing moment re Cyber-Security…

Apparently 20+ Government and Fukushima related sites have had attacks from hactavists, upset about the release of radioactive waste water into the environment,
