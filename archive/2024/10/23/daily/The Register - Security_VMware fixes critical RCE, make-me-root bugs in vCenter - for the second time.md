VMware has pushed a second patch for a critical, heap-overflow bug in the vCenter Server that could allow a remote attacker to fully compromise vulnerable systems after the first software update, issued last month, didn't work.

Plus, in the same security update, VMware fixed (again) a make-me-root flaw in vCenter that's pretty nasty, too. Both bugs were [originally patched](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/17/vmware_vcenter_patch/) on September 17. But, as VMware owner Broadcom [noted](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/24968) on Monday, the fixes "did not completely address" either CVE.

The first critical flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-38812, affects vCenter 7.0.3, 8.0.2, and 8.0.3, plus running any version of vSphere or VMware Cloud Foundation prior to the versions listed above.
