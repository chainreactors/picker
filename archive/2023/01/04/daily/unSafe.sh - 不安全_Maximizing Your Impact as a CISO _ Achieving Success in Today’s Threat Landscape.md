Cybersecurity continues to transform, leading to an evolution of what makes a successful [Chief Information Security Officer](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/category/for-ciso-cio/) ([CISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_security_officer)). Once, the role focused on championing the implementation of digital security strategies. In today’s threat landscape, though, successful CISOs have added to their focus the mantle of [risk manager](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ciso-wins-reducing-risk-across-endpoint-identity-and-cloud-surfaces/) and communicator. CISOs that can identify risks and share them effectively and in an actionable way can better direct their organization to a more resilient cybersecurity posture.

A CISO’s capabilities directly affect the short and long-term security of their organization. To find success in this role, CISOs in the current cyber climate must find a balance between five main areas:

* Risk management
* Strategic communication
* Leadership through open communication
* Continuous learning
* Security expertise

## How CISOs Protect Against Modern Cyber Threats

A successful CISO is a critical element of any organization’s leadership team. In today’s digital landscape, where cyber threats are constantly evolving and data breaches can have disastrous consequences, a strong and effective CISO is essential for protecting an organization’s information and assets. With the increasing prevalence and sophistication of cyberattacks, having a dedicated and skilled CISO is essential for ensuring that an organization’s sensitive data and systems are secure.

CISOs are not only instrumental in implementing and managing the organization’s cybersecurity [strategy](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ciso-wins-a-5-phase-ramp-up-strategy-for-success-on-a-new-job/) but also ensure that the organization’s employees are aware of cybersecurity best practices and protocols and are trained to identify and mitigate potential threats.

Acting as a link between employees and senior leadership and stakeholders, CISOs are responsible for communicating effectively with both groups about the organization’s cybersecurity posture. This includes providing regular updates on the effectiveness of security measures and any potential risks and vulnerabilities that may need to be addressed.

## Adaptability Is Key | Why the Role of CISOs Has Changed

The role of a CISO has changed significantly in response to the evolving cyber threat landscape. In the past, CISOs focused primarily on the technical aspects of security, such as implementing and managing security technologies and protocols. However, the increasing prevalence and sophistication of cyber attacks have created a need for a broader and more strategic approach to cybersecurity.

Today, CISOs are responsible for developing and implementing the organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy, which includes anticipating and preparing for potential cyber threats. This involves conducting regular security assessments and implementing appropriate security measures, as well as staying up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in the cybersecurity field.

In addition, the role of a CISO now involves more collaboration and coordination with other departments and external partners. Cyber threats often cross organizational boundaries, and effective cybersecurity requires a coordinated response from all relevant parties.

## Breaking Down the Steps to Success for CISOs

Organizations require multi-layered security strategies to combat advanced cyber threats. Bringing together all the pieces requires a CISO who deeply understands what their organization needs from a business point of view and can translate that into actionable security policies and processes.

Success for CISOs means synchronizing traditional, technical implementation with modern security analytics and continuous improvement.

### 1. Risk Management: Planning for Security Challenges

Through regular risk assessments, CISOs can identify and assess potential risks to the organization’s assets, such as data, systems, and networks. This includes analyzing the likelihood of a risk occurring and its potential impact on the organization.

Based on the results of the risk assessment, CISOs should focus on developing a risk management strategy to address the identified risks. This may involve implementing controls to prevent or mitigate risks, transferring risk through insurance or other means, or accepting certain risks as part of doing business.

A large part of the risk management strategy will cover how the organization will implement controls to prevent or mitigate identified risks. This may include technical measures such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, as well as non-technical measures such as employee training as well as defining and implementing security policies and procedures.

A strong risk management strategy will also include regular monitoring of the effectiveness of the security controls in place and review of the strategy as a whole to ensure it is still relevant and effective.

### 2. Strategic Communication: Bringing the Vision to All Teams

Successful CISOs exhibit stellar communication skills and prioritize sharing the organization’s cyber strategy to build trust. CISOs are also masters of knowing their audience and are able to determine who needs to be informed about the organization’s cyber risk management strategy and the measures in place to protect the organization’s assets. This may include employees, customers, partners, and regulatory bodies.

Once the players are in place, CISOs will focus on developing a communication plan and determine the best ways to reach the identified stakeholders using language that is easy to understand. Effective communication provides clear and concise information about the organization’s risk management strategy and the measures in place to protect against cyber threats.

Transparency is an important factor here. Successful CISOs are open and honest about the organization’s cyber risks and the measures being taken to manage them, and they will make themselves available to answer questions and address concerns from stakeholders. This helps to build trust across the organization and demonstrates a commitment to protecting the organization’s assets.

### 3. Leadership: Making the Most of Resources

Effective utilization separates the experienced CISOs from the others. Technical and IT teams will look to their CISO to implement cost-effective controls. Understanding the cost and benefits of different controls and having the ability to choose those that provide the most value for the organization is vital. This may involve finding cost-effective solutions that offer similar levels of protection as more expensive options.
