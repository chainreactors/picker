# Twitter and two-factor authentication: What’s changing?

Posted: February 21, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Twitter is making some dramatic shake ups to its currently available security settings. From March 19, users of Twitter [won’t be able to use SMS-based two-factor authentication](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2023/an-update-on-two-factor-authentication-using-sms-on-twitter) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa)) unless they have a subscription to the paid Twitter Blue service.

If you use text-based 2FA, the important thing here is not to worry.

You may be under the impression that Twitter is removing your 2FA ability altogether, but this isn’t the case. There *are* alternatives, and they’re quite a bit more robust than the SMS approach. In fact, they’re referenced by Twitter repeatedly in the documentation regarding the removal of the text service for free Twitter users.

If you’re not sure what they are, or how they work, fear not. We’re going to walk you through the alternatives.

## Changing your security approach on a deadline

If you log into Twitter at the moment, you’ll eventually be treated to a popup message which says the following:

> Only Twitter Blue subscribers can use the text message two factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) method. It’ll just take a few minutes to remove it. You can still use the authentication app and security key methods. To avoid losing access to Twitter, remove text message two-factor authentication by Mar 19, 2023.

This move is being blamed on fraudulent [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot) behaviour in relation to the Twitter platform. From the above linked Twitter blog post:

> While historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used – and abused – by bad actors. So starting today, we will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers. The availability of text message 2FA for Twitter Blue may vary by country and carrier.

It’s not great that an additional security measure is being removed from users and placed behind a subscription. Some form of 2FA is better than nothing, and uptake for *any* type of 2FA is painfully low on major platforms. Even Twitter itself struggles, with just [2.6% of active accounts](https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/account-security.html#2021-jul-dec) making use of at least one 2FA method. Out of those, 74.4% are using SMS 2FA so this removal plan could have a big impact on already tiny sign up numbers.

As Twitter is so mobile-centric and likely already has your mobile number, SMS 2FA is for many people a natural fit for the platform. It may well be that people stripped of their SMS 2FA may not bother to implement 2FA all over again with an app or hardware key. That would leave those accounts much less secure.

With this in mind, let’s take a look at what’s on the other two forms of 2FA that Twitter offers.

## Twitter and 2FA: What can you use?

### Authenticator apps

Apps are viewed as being more secure than text-based 2FA, but are still very convenient.

Authenticator apps work by continually generating a numerical code that you enter on the site after you’ve logged in with your username and password. If the code expires before you enter it, the app generates another one and you use that instead. The app will never ...
