## Android Improves Its Security

Android phones will [soon reboot themselves](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/android-phones-will-soon-reboot-themselves-after-sitting-unused-for-3-days/) after sitting idle for three days. iPhones have had this feature for a while; it’s nice to see Google add it to their phones.

@ ALL,

> “Android phones will soon reboot themselves after sitting idle for three days.”

I guess “sitting idle” is a matter of view point…

The story begins much as it did for Apples iOS back in 2006 or earlier when Apple and Google decided to not just take over the “mobile phone” OS market, but as we now know turning users into product and a captive source of income via the “Walked Gardens” that were supposed to give users security.

We know that both Apple and Google failed of the security aspect as quite a few predicted.

The simple fact is the “network” side of a mobile phone is very definately not under a users control but the “Network Supplier via the SIM.

As time moved on other networking was added to mobile phones so now as a general minimum you also have 8n addition to the SIM Radio Interface,

1, WiFi

As a rule of thumb all of these are subservient to the SIM interface to the Network Service Provider.

For such a system to be “secure” requires the “Network Service Provider”(NSP) to “not exert authority”…

Put simply the NSP almost never relinquishes prime control.

Thus you have to consider what

“Sitting Idle”

Really means and I’ve yet to see notes to that effect.

So I would not say such a system is “guaranteed to work” especially with UK and Auz crypto legislation.

If you read the UK “Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000″(RIPA-2000) and “snoopers charter” “Investigatory Powers Act 2016″(IPA-2016) update, you will not find any “valid defence” for an equipment provider or equipment user for such “resets” or as in the case of Signal and similar apps disappearing/self deleting files etc.

That is such things are “unlawfull” and can constitute “tampering with evidence”.

So I suspect it won’t ve long before the UK Home Office comes knocking at Googles door much as it did with Apple just a short time back.

But it has another aspect…

E2EE being “backdoored” is now becoming a “lost battle” and “See What You See”(SWYS) device “client side” “plaintext UI” scanning is being pushed as the new solution.

For SWYS to work then there has to be not just “activity” on the mobile device, it needs to “talk to the mothership”…

This would be very far from “Sitting Idle”…

So do not in any way consider this a “user safety feature” that will be either effective or be alowed to stay in place without a “Master Override”.

Law Enforcement have seen the power of such breaches of user security with the likes of EncroChat. Sufficient in the case of the UK for the NCA to perform “unlawful activities” and the woman who signed off on it to get a fairly high up “Honours Award” rather than dismissal and jail.

Okay, finally! I’ve been wondering when Android would add this. It’s one of those small features that actually makes a big difference—nice to see it showing up now.

I used a custom Android ROM, so my phone reboots itself several times a day if the nightly build is unstable!

Sweet!

Now to find out why my phone likes to reboot itself randomly overnight for (seemingly) no reason.

Hmm. Why reboot, couldn’t they just encrypt all memory not needed for the lock screen and tie the key to security chip approval? Probably hard to achieve, since apps are not designed to be paused indefinitely?

Could someone remind me exactly how this is good?

What if I have my phone locked and in the state that I want it in? The last thing I want is for the phone itself to be able to accept software “upgrades” and then autonomously restart.

My phone and tablet already do too much stuff without my permission. Having it able to “reset” *itself* just brings it that much closer to being unavailable when I want it.

I guess this means that android phones will no longer be usable as emergency phones, at least without disabling updates and turning off this feature. The last thing you want to do in an emergency is enter a passcode before it will boot far enough to make an emergency call.

@Sami Liedes, @anon

If the data on the device is at rest and encrypted it is much more difficult to recover useful information and read the databases and logs stored on the device. This does require that a secure enough pin is used to prevent it being easily broken. A 4 digit pin will not be enough to prevent forensic recovery. An alphanumeric pin with more characters is needed.

The phone has to restart in order for memory to be cleared and data at rest to be in an encrypted state. The idea of phones rebooting is so that data forensics cannot then recover residual data from memory. There are other tricks and exploits used to access data over a custom USB connection, such as those used by devices made by Cellbrite, to initiate data access, break the pin and then dump details from databases stored on the phone.

In order for you to access data it has to be unencrypted and then loaded into memory. The various techniques that data forensics exploit, can bypass security features by gaining data access via the USB port. This can allow various options, depend...
