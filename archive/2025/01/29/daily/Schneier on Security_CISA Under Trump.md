## CISA Under Trump

Jen Easterly is out as the Director of CISA. Read her final [interview](https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jen-easterly-cisa-cybersecurity/):

> There’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I’m really proud of where we are, but there’s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue.

If Project 2025 is a guide, the agency will be [gutted](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/a-little-known-federal-agency-helps-secure-elections-trump-wants-to-gut-it/) under Trump:

> “Project 2025’s recommendations—essentially because this one thing caused anger—is to just strip the agency of all of its support altogether,” he said. “And CISA’s functions go so far beyond its role in the information space in a way that would do real harm to election officials and leave them less prepared to tackle future challenges.”
>
> In the DHS chapter of Project 2025, Cucinelli suggests gutting CISA almost entirely, moving its core responsibilities on critical infrastructure to the Department of Transportation. It’s a suggestion that Adav Noti, the executive director of the nonpartisan voting rights advocacy organization Campaign Legal Center, [previously described](https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/unmasking-the-anti-democracy-agenda-of-project-2025/) to Democracy Docket as “absolutely bonkers.”
>
> “It’s located at Homeland Security because the whole premise of the Department of Homeland Security is that it’s supposed to be the central resource for the protection of the nation,” Noti said. “And that the important functions shouldn’t be living out in siloed agencies.”

For me, CISA stopped working a while ago – since they are not maintaining their CVE database anymore.

CISA brought it on themselves when they decided to get into the censorship business.

@clive it’s what we voters wanted. Three times in a row. Europeans want their version of Trump already.

This brings to mind an exchange between two characters in a UK tv show (ahem … “programme”) called “Yes, Prime Minster”. Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard Woolley are talking about the government’s defense policy:

Sir Humphrey Appleby – Bernard, what is the purpose of our defense policy?

Bernard Woolley – To defend Britain?

HA – No, Bernard. It is to make people believe Britain is defended.

BW – From the Russians?

HA – Not the Russians, the British! The Russians know it’s not. For all our simple, ignorant people shuffling in and out of houses, busses, factories and the Cabinet Room, the aim of the defense policy is to make them feel secure.

BW – But if there’s a better way…

HA – Bernard, we have a magic wand. It is called “Trident”. Nobody understands anything about it except that it will cost fifteen billion pounds which means it must be wonderful … magic! All we have to do is write a cheque and then we can all relax. But, if people in government start talking about it, d’you know what will happen?

BW – No.

HA – In the end, they’ll start thinking about it. They will come to realize the problems, the flaws in the reasoning. The nation will get worried. Agitation, questions, criticism, change.

BW – Change?!

HA – Change.

This is a receipt for “a total disaster” to use the words of Mr Trump.

He does not understand that a WW hybrid war is ongoing.

If we assume that the next president will quickly reverse this decision, the US will pay the price for more than a decade.

I thought this was very bad news at first, but then I thought about how the free market will eventually correct for the problems. I would rather have individual corporations pick where the budget goes then mandates by the USG. And I know they don’t have magic overarching power but eventually lawsuits will be filed based on their guidelines, so they have indirect impact. End them!

Neither do we Clive, neither do we.

@Drew The free market never corrected IT security problems: less budget for security -> more profit.
When actual data is stolen, the company writes a press statement about the criminal energy that the super evil criminal attackers invested and that additional layers of antivirus snake oil will be applied.
And no customer ever left an unsecure provider (see okta, cisco, solarwinds, ivanti, fortinet, sophos, microsoft, …)

@John Freeze, Drew

Actually no it’s “less profit”.

The Free Market Mantra of neo-cons and their minions boils down to,
