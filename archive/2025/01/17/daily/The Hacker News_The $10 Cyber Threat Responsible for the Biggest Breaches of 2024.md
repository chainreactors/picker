You can tell the story of the current state of stolen credential-based attacks in three numbers:

* Stolen credentials were the **#1 attacker action** in 2023/24, and the breach vector for **80% of web app attacks**. (Source: Verizon).
* Cybersecurity budgets grew again in 2024, with organizations now spending almost **$1,100 per user** (Source: Forrester).
* Stolen credentials on criminal forums cost **as little as $10** (Source: Verizon).

Something doesn't add up. So, what's going on?

In this article, we'll cover:

* What's contributing to the huge rise in account compromises linked to stolen creds and why existing approaches aren't working.
* The world of murky intelligence on stolen credentials, and how to cut through the noise to find the true positives.
* Recommendations for security teams to stop attackers from using stolen creds to achieve account takeover.

## Stolen credential-based attacks are on the rise

There's clear evidence that identity attacks are now the #1 cyber threat facing organizations. The attacks on Snowflake customers in 2024 collectively constituted the biggest cyber security event of the year in terms of the number of organizations and individuals affected (at least, if you exclude CrowdStrike causing a worldwide outage in July) — certainly, it was the largest perpetrated by a criminal group against commercial enterprises. It has been touted by some news outlets as "one of the biggest breaches ever."

Around 165 organizations using Snowflake (a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform) were targeted using stolen credentials harvested from infostealer infections dating as far back as 2020. These affected accounts also lacked MFA, enabling attackers to log in with a single compromised factor.

The impact was massive. In all, 9 victims have been named publicly following the breach, impacting hundreds of millions of people's sensitive data. At least one victim paid an undisclosed ransom fee.

But this wasn't a one-off. [These attacks were happening constantly throughout 2024.](https://pushsecurity.com/blog/2024-identity-breaches/?utm_campaign=5759841-FY25Q1_Hacker-News-Organic-Article&utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored-content&utm_content=organic+article)

* The huge Change Healthcare breach, which culminated in 100 million customers being impacted and a $22 million ransom demand, started with stolen Citrix credentials.
* Disney's Confluence servers and Slack instance were hacked, resulting in huge amounts of commercially sensitive data and IT infrastructure details being leaked, as well as messages from 10,000 Slack channels.
* Microsoft suffered a significant breach of their Office 365 environment, with sensitive emails leaked after a "test" OAuth application was compromised using stolen creds.
* Finastra, Schneider Electric, Nidec, Foundation, ADT, HealthEquity, Park'N Fly, Roku, LA County Health Services, and many more all suffered data breaches of varying severity as a result of stolen creds.

Researchers are getting in on the action too. In October, Microsoft's ServiceNow tenant was hacked using stolen credentials acquired online, accessing thousands of support ticket descriptions and attachments, and 250k+ employee emails.

### Stolen credentials are still a problem? Really?

Key to many of the attacks targeting workforce identities and online accounts is the use of stolen credentials. And unfortunately, an increased focus on MFA adoption hasn't quite solved the problem.

* MFA gaps remain rife. [Research from Push Security](https://pushsecurity.com/blog/how-many-vulnerable-identities-do-you-have/?utm_campaign=5759841-FY25Q1_Hacker-News-Organic-Article&utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored-content&utm_content=organic%20article) shows that where a password is the sole login method for an account, these accounts lack MFA in 4 out of 5 cases.
* The number of breached credentials continues to grow at an alarming rate due to the prevalence of infostealer compromises. And data breaches tend to beget more data breaches as account information is leaked, creating a vicious cycle.
* The shift to third-party apps and services for most major business operations, leading to more accounts, more credentials, and more valuable business data in the cloud — all low-hanging targets for attackers.

So, there are more targets for attackers, more credentials to use against them, and MFA (in particular phishing-resistant MFA) is nowhere near as present as we'd hope. Look at the breaches we mentioned earlier — many of the victims are huge companies, with vast security budgets. If they can't achieve complete coverage, then how can anyone be expected to?

### The rise of infostealers

The rise of infostealer malware has had a significant impact on the increase in credential-based attacks.

While infostealer malware isn't exactly new, it's a growing concern for many security organizations. Commercial Malware-as-a-Service offerings on the criminal underground are being continuously updated to evade detection controls, and the more sophisticated criminal and nation state-backed threat groups are proficient in creating custom malware. It's a cat-and-mouse game, and the sheer number of compromised credentials tracing back to infostealer infections is a testament to their success.

Once stolen, credential data such as usernames, passwords, and session cookies makes its way to criminal forums on both the clearweb and the darkweb. Popular infostealers even have their own dedicated Telegr...
