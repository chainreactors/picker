Privileged Access Management (PAM) has emerged as a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity strategies, shifting from a technical necessity to a critical pillar in leadership agendas. With the PAM market projected to reach $42.96 billion by 2037 (according to Research Nester), organizations invest heavily in PAM solutions.

Why is PAM climbing the ranks of leadership priorities? While Gartner highlights key reasons such as enhanced security, regulatory compliance readiness, and insurance requirements, the impact of PAM extends across multiple strategic areas. PAM can help organizations enhance their overall operational efficiency and tackle many challenges they face today.

To explore more about PAM's transformative impact on businesses, read *[The Cyber Guardian: PAM's Role in Shaping Leadership Agendas for 2025](https://www.syteca.com/en/resources/white-papers/the-cyber-guardian-pams-role-in-shaping-leadership-agendas-for-2025)* by a renowned cybersecurity expert and former Gartner lead analyst Jonathan Care.

## What cybersecurity challenges may organizations face in 2025?

The cybersecurity landscape is predicted to be highly dynamic in 2025, marked by evolving attack techniques, new vulnerabilities, and an expanding attack surface. The most acute trends include:

### Insider threats

Organizations often focus on external threats, while overlooking risks from within. Insider threats are one of the most underestimated yet impactful cybersecurity risks. Insider risks may manifest in several forms:

* malicious actors may intentionally harm your organization
* negligent employees might carelessly exfiltrate your sensitive data
* external attackers can compromise your employees' credentials to gain unauthorized access to your systems.

The scope of insider threats becomes even clearer when checking the recent statistics. According to Verizon's 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report, 31% of all data breaches over the past decade have involved stolen credentials. In the last year alone, 68% of all breaches included a human element, with people being involved either via error, privilege misuse, use of stolen credentials, or social engineering.

### Third-party vulnerabilities

Reliance on third-party vendors, contractors, and suppliers introduces significant security risks. Threats stemming from inadequate vendor security, software supply chain attacks, and subcontractor vulnerabilities continue to grow more prominent.

High-profile incidents, such as the [Change Healthcare data breach,](https://www.hipaajournal.com/change-healthcare-responding-to-cyberattack/) in which 190 million records were compromised due to weak third-party access controls, underscore the need for robust PAM solutions.

### Sophisticated cyberattacks

With the evolution of AI and ML, cyberattacks are becoming increasingly targeted and sophisticated. AI enables malicious actors to create more convincing phishing schemes, whereas ML helps them make brute-force attacks more efficient.

Advanced persistent threats represent a particularly insidious class of cyberattacks. These prolonged, targeted attacks are often performed by nation-states or organized crime groups aiming to steal sensitive information or disrupt operations.

The 2024 [Salt Typhoon cyber espionage attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Typhoon) on the U.S. telecommunications networks is a prime example. It highlights the persistent threat posed by state-sponsored cyber actors and highlights vulnerabilities within critical communication infrastructures that need urgent attention and remediation.

### Hybrid environments

As organizations continue to adopt hybrid work models, managing privileged access across dispersed teams, multiple locations and numerous devices becomes increasingly complex. Hybrid environments make it harder to monitor and enforce consistent access controls.

Employees and contractors may also access corporate systems from unsecured devices and networks, creating gaps in security policies and increasing the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access.

In recent years, many companies tend to switch between on-premises and cloud environments. While offering scalability and efficiency, hybrid environments are more susceptible to misconfigurations, providing more entry points for cybercriminals to exploit.

### Compliance pressures

Regulatory compliance remains one of the major challenges for organizations in 2025, as governments and industry bodies continue to introduce stricter data protection and cybersecurity regulations.

Depending on the industry or region, organizations may be subjected to the GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, DORA, NIS2, and others. These cybersecurity standards, laws, and regulations mandate robust access controls, data protection measures, incident response capabilities, and thorough auditing activities.
