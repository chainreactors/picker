# **The Industry’s First AI-Driven SecOps Platform to Span Proactive and Reactive Security**

Three years ago, we anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which converges best-in-class SecOps capabilities in a single platform driven by unified data, AI and automation. It consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete.

Leading organizations have embraced XSIAM and transformed their security operations, achieving unrivaled improvements in security outcomes: a 98% reduction in MTTR with 75% less manual work. Not surprisingly, in just two years since its introduction, Cortex XSIAM crossed $1 billion in cumulative bookings, showcasing the unprecedented demand for its transformational capabilities.

Earlier this year, we introduced [**Cortex Cloud**](/blog/2025/02/announcing-innovations-cortex-cloud/), our breakthrough in unifying cloud posture with SOC operations. Built on the power of AI, automation and data, it connects code to runtime to detection and response, redefining how organizations secure their cloud environments. As the threat landscape evolves, so do we – advancing Cortex XSIAM to keep SecOps teams one step ahead of today’s fast-moving, AI-driven threats.

**XSIAM 3.0 – The AI-Driven SecOps Platform for Reactive and Proactive Security**

As businesses move faster with AI, attackers are doing the same. Today, AI is enabling threat actors to move 100x faster, exploit vulnerabilities more easily and launch attacks faster than traditional defenses can respond. To regain the advantage, SecOps must be both proactive and reactive, closing gaps before they can be exploited and responding at machine speed.

**We’re proud to introduce Cortex XSIAM 3.0** – the next leap in our innovation journey. With XSIAM 3.0, we’re expanding beyond real-time response to deliver proactive defense. We are disrupting legacy approaches to vulnerability management and email security with industry-leading AI and automation:

* **Cortex Exposure Management** – Cuts vulnerability noise by up to 99% with AI-driven prioritization and automated remediation spanning the entire enterprise.
* **Cortex Advanced Email Security** – Stop [sophisticated email-based attacks](/blog/security-operations/cortex-email-security-module-defending-against-evolving-email-threats/) missed by other solutions with advanced AI and automation.

![XSIAM – easily extend the platform with advanced capabilities: ITDR, TIP, ASM, MDR](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/word-image-337783-1-1.png)

Cortex XSIAM 3.0 delivers exactly what SecOps needs: real-time defense, proactive protection and unmatched operational efficiency, all in one unified platform.

## **Introducing New Code to Cloud to SOC Command Center**

At the heart of XSIAM 3.0 is the new Cloud & SOC Command Center – a single UI that gives security teams unified visibility across all environments (Enterprise and Cloud), enabling them to act faster with greater context. The new Command Center enables teams to identify posture risks and runtime threats across their entire environment, on-premises and in the cloud, with a comprehensive breakdown of assets by class, provider and region:

* **See Every Asset** – Understand your entire asset inventory and its security posture.
* **Pinpoint Critical Risks** – Quickly identify high-risk assets and uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Active Attacks** – Get real-time visibility into assets under attack.
* **Connect Risks to Active Threats** – Bridge Cloud Security and SOC teams for faster, more effective incident response.

The new Cortex Command Center showcases the true potential of security teams operating on a shared platform, using the same data, language and priorities. Unified data fuels AI, automation and faster, more coordinated responses in one platform with one Command Center, delivering complete protection from Code to Cloud to SOC.

## **Disrupting Vulnerability Management with Cortex Exposure Management**

Legacy vulnerability management (VM) solutions have not kept pace with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Legacy VM vendors have largely focused only on identifying vulnerabilities, neglecting the essential aspect of their proactive, automated remediation. This approach resulted in enterprises grappling with vast backlogs of vulnerabilities, siloed tooling and data across cloud, network, apps, endpoint and attack surface. It led to inefficient remediation processes.

### Introducing Exposure Management

Cortex Exposure Management leverages the unified data and industry-leading AI, as well as automation of the XSIAM platform to transform traditional vulnerability management, and ultimately, stop breaches before they start.

[</blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/New-Exposure-Management-WEB.mp4>](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/New-Exposure-Management-WEB.mp4?_=2)

When speaking with customers, two major challenges consistently arise – the increasing backlog of vulnerabilities and the slow pace of remediation. Cortex Exposure Management addresses these issues head-on with three innovations:

* **Full Outside-In and Inside-Out Visibility Into Exposures –** Uncover risks with a unified solution spanning native network, endpoint and cloud scanners, extended with integration from any third-party source.
* **Cut Alert Noise by 99% Based on Actual Risk, Not Compliance –** Use AI to prioritize high-risk, exploitable vulnerabilities with no compensating controls, eliminating false alarms.
* **Close the Loop with Industry-Leading Automation to Prevent Future Attacks –** Shift-right by seamlessly creating new compensating controls in native network, cloud and endpoint solutions. Automate remediation across first and third-party tools with playbook automation, drastically reducing the reliance on human intervention.

With the addition of Exposure Management to Cortex XSIAM, we are redefining what’s possible in vulnerability management. By addressing the core deficiencies of traditional VM solutions with the power of unified data, AI and automation, enterprises are empowered to not just manage their vulnerabilities, but to preempt the most advanced attacks before they happen.

## **Stop AI-Powered Email-Based Attacks in Their Tracks with Cortex Advanced Email Security**

According to the [Unit 42 Incident Response Report](/engage/unit42-2025-global-incident-response-report), email ranked as the top initial access vector in 2024, 2022 and 2021, with business email compromise accounting for 76% of all phishing cases. The recent advancements in generative AI have made email attacks even more scalable, convincing and accessible to threat actors.

Legacy email security controls are ill-equipped to combat the rise of AI-powered phishing, which evades detection by signature-based systems ...
