Data retention practices can vary between companies based on compliance requirements, location, and types of data. Best practice dictates an organization should only retain data for only as long as it is useful, or to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements. Defining what is needed for an organization will ensure compliance with relevant legal statues and regulations, help maintain accurate records, and ensure no unnecessary storage space is being allotted.

Data retention policies should include:

* What data needs to be retained
* The format the data is kept in
* Length of retention
* Whether the data is subject to deletion or being archived
* Who will dispose of it and how
* Exceptions processes
* What to do in breach of policy

## **Legal and Compliance**

There are no mandatory data retention laws that span across the Unites States. One (1) of the chief reasons for this, is the value of privacy. Restrictions ultimately depend on the type of data that is being handled and the areas of operation. Common types of restricted data include:

* Personal Data/Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Protected Health Information (PHI)
* Financial data

Legal and regulatory requirements for these types of data will differ depending on where, how, and in what volume business is being conducted. For example, the State of California usually comes with more stringent laws concerning privacy requirements that are outlined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Some common compliance standards to refer to are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR - EU), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). These are just few examples of the common laws, standards, and regulations that organizations can be held to when dealing with the common types of restricted data. Non-compliance within any of these areas could mean monthly penalties, data breaches, legal action, damage to reputation, and more.

Another factor to consider when determining data management is whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act applies to a large range of companies operating in the U.S. Companies required to be compliant with SOX are:

* Public U.S. companies
* Foreign public companies operating in the U.S.
* Wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries
* Private companies preparing an initial public offering
* Accounting firms working for SOX-compliant companies

SOX compliance rules have specifically outlined how long your data retention periods must be. In 2002, SOX was modified in response to widespread corporate fraud to include a seven (7) year data retention requirement.

Data retention periods will also vary depending on the type of industry you are in. Companies operating in the health industry are typically required to retain HIPAA related documents for a minimum of six (6) years from when the document was created. This does not fully encompass medical records that vary under state law. Financial institutions falling under Basel II Capital Accord retention req...
