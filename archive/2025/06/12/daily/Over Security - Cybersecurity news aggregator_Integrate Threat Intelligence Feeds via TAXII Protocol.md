Integrate Threat Intelligence Feeds via STIX/TAXII

ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=taxii_protocol&utm_term=110625&utm_content=linktofeeds) (TI Feeds) provide security teams with exclusive intel on threats targeting [15,000 companies worldwide](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/). With TAXII protocol, you can safely and easily reinforce your company’s proactive detection with TI Feeds.

## **Why Use TAXII for TI Feeds?**

TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) allows for swift and comfortable delivery of threat intelligence feeds. It’s a popular standard acknowledged for its security and usability.

TI Feeds are available for integration via STIX/TAXII. With this combo, you’ll achieve:

* **Seamless Compatibility with Security Systems:** Ensures effortless integration with [SIEM, EDR/XDR, NGFW, and TIP solutions](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-feeds-integration/).

* **Secure and Standardized Data Exchange:** Provides a secure framework for transferring threat intelligence.

* **Customizable Data Delivery:** Allows you to tailor the data you receive, whether it’s all available IOCs or specific types like [IPs, URLs, or domains](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/inside-cyber-threat-intelligence-feeds/).

## **How ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds Strengthen Businesses’ Proactive Security**

TI Feeds empower your SOC with actionable intelligence to proactively monitor and prevent threats, mitigating breach risks and associated costs.

With ANY.RUN, MSSP companies get to stand out among competitors by enriching their infrastructure with data on real threats targeting companies across industries.

Integrate TI Feeds into your system for an easy access to all of their perks:

* **Detect Threats Early:** Access high-quality indicators from threat investigations across 15,000 organizations worldwide to proactively identify and prevent threats from compromising your systems.

* **Expand Threat Coverage:** Get [unique IOCs from Memory Dumps, Suricata IDS](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-in-ti-feeds/), and internal threat categorization systems allowing you to catch the most evasive malware.

* **Minimize False Positives:** The feeds are pre-processed to ensure indicators are reliable and false positive rate is near-zero.

* **Accelerate Response through Automation:** Automatically block malicious IPs, flag related logs, or trigger playbooks based on TI Feeds’ data to reduce manual workload and enable faster reactions.

* **Gain Better Attack Visibility:** Our indicators of compromise come with extensive metadata, as well as links to related sandbox sessions for further analysis.

* **Simplify Setup:** In addition to TAXII protocol support, we offer API and [SDK](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/sdk-integration/) to deliver ANY.RUN’s feeds in a structured, easy-to-use format—STIX/TAXII or [MISP](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/misp-integration/).

## **TI Feeds & STIX/TAXII: How It Works**

Integration through STIX/TAXII is available for all users with paid plans. You can easily setup TI Feeds as a STIX/TAXII endpoint in their system, be that SIEM, TIP, EDR/XDR, NGFW, or other Security Operations solutions.

Upon connection to ANY.RUN’s STIX/TAXII server, your system automatically receives fresh threat intelligence. [Check out detailed documentation](https://intelligence.any.run/ANYRUN_TI_Feeds_TAXII_Documentation_V3.pdf).
