Digital Manufacturing for insights (DMCi) aims to provide an easy to consume and intuitive self-service manufacturing analytics platform that supports our customers’ expectation to analyse manufacturing data, having real-time visibility and transparency into the shop floor to fuel business decisions toward better efficiency in their operation and improved quality**.**

Focus of SAP Digital Manufacturing for insights is the operational manufacturing data to derive Industrial Insights. Aggregations beyond the plant level and enrichment of data with additional data sources such as finance information from SAP S/4HANA can be realised leveraging Data Warehouse applications such as SAP Data Warehouse Cloud which is able to establish a live data access to the operational manufacturing data in SAP Digital Manufacturing for insights.

# The Manufacturing Data Layer as foundation for Industrial Insights

With the new Manufacturing Data Layer, data from Digital Manufacturing for execution is available in a single store in order to allow plant data analysis and comparison. It is taking care of transforming & contextualisation of process and historians data for analytical usage to allow customers to easily build analytical reports to draw useful information.

This harmonised data are stored into well-defined schema definitions called *Manufacturing Data Objects (MDOs)* comprised of Master Data, Transactional Data & Precalculated Data that enables business users to design and perform several queries and create reports out of their manufacturing execution systems using embedded analytics powered by SAP Analytics Cloud.

In the future it will evolve towards an Open Platform that allows full read access to all information stored via read APIs and going forward also write APIs to send data from multiple data source into the predefined MDOs.

## Live Monitoring

Live Monitoring currently offered through the *Live Monitor* focusing on near real-time analytics providing a time horizon of the last 2 days, offering **Monitor & Act** capabilities by focusing on exception, alerts, deviations.

To extend the scope of Live Monitoring capabilities we plan to deliver further [POD Plugins](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DIGITAL_MANUFACTURING_CLOUD/97c9e9b9fac74be2a023638cd1700b46/0956332e026348088f4f96c6178d5600.html) enabling customers and partner to build Live Monitoring apps such as *Andon Boards* providing information about the operating status of production lines or individual resource leveraging the Digital Manufacturing Cloud [POD Designer](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DIGITAL_MANUFACTURING_CLOUD/97c9e9b9fac74be2a023638cd1700b46/dabb127945bb4b1b9492883b6bceac4d.html) to provide full flexibility.

## Operational Analytics

The Operational Analytics is providing a self service environment to build manufacturing KPIs and dashboards leveraging the powerful SAP Analytics Cloud technology natively embedded in Digital Manufacturing to fuel a seamless user experience. Going forward we will provide sample content which customers and partners can copy and modify to ease the start into this new era of analytics. Typical analysis and calculations that can be done easily: planned vs. actual quantities, planned vs. actual times, lead times, quality (yield vs scrap) and many more to **Analyse & Improve** the production processes.

## Advanced Analytics

The area of Advanced Analytics includes KPIs and analytics capabilities that are based on advanced logic such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness calculations. This calculations are provided within the application and can be consumed in the live monitoring as well as the operational analytics going forward. Goal of this capability is to **Predict & Optimize** performance, quality, availability.

# What to expect

As mentioned throughout this blog the available capabilities are just the beginning. Throughout the upcoming quarters we will successively provide additional MDOs as well as new features and capabilities. The most convenient way to stay informed about these changes is to follow the Innovations published on the [SAP Roadmap Explorer](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E919ED099B00CC).
