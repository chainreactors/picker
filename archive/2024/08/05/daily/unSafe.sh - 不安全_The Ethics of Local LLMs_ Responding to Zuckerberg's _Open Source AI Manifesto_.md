## The "Open Source AI Manifesto"

Mark Zuckerberg has been [hated by Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/facebook.html?ref=hackernoon.com) for decades, and he is the only person who appears on both the cover image of the video essays: [How the Internet was Stolen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLLxpAZzy0s&ref=hackernoon.com) and [How AI was Stolen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQTXv5jm6s4&ref=hackernoon.com) by Then & Now.

However, things have changed recently after his adoption of the Fediverse and [open-sourcing of Llama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ_NRIKbRKc&ref=hackernoon.com) continuously.

In [Zuckerberg's latest "Open Source AI Manifesto"](https://hackernoon.com/why-open-source-ai-is-good-for-developers-meta-and-the-world?ref=hackernoon.com), he stated 5 needs of open source:

> * We need to train, fine-tune, and distill our own models.
> * We need to control our own destiny and not get locked into a closed vendor.
> * We need to protect our data.
> * We need a model that is efficient and affordable to run.
> * We want to invest in the ecosystem that’s going to be the standard for the long term.

That describes the needs of tech individuals and small businesses accurately.

The reason I call it "Manifesto" is because the impression of reading this article connects back to [the GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html?ref=hackernoon.com) strongly.

Thanks to the GNU project that made us free/libre OSes; thanks to the LLaMA development team that made us true open AIs.

## Egoism-Altruism Dialectic

In [The Theory of Moral Sentiments](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/moral/part01/part1a.htm?ref=hackernoon.com), Adam Smith wrote:

> How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.

This selfish altruism or ethical egoism idea has been carried on by many Austrian schools and behavioral economists and eventually became a key principle of [neoliberalism ideology](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/14/the-fatal-flaw-of-neoliberalism-its-bad-economics?ref=hackernoon.com).

However, it is more complex in the case of Zuckerberg and his Meta.

In his statement, Zuckerberg is clearly aware of what is the benefits of embracing open-source—profitable yet moral.

As we all know, in Silicon Valley, nobody really cares about "the greater good" nor really wants to "make the world a better place." They are just responsible to their stakeholders.

But what about a win-win situation?

That's exactly what they are selling to the public to believe (feel).

The dialectical structure remains the same as the egoism-altruism dialectic—A self-interested businessman pursuing profit but pretending to be moral.

The important thing is: Will this result in a win-win situation for the public good?

The answer is that it depends, and most likely no. These too-big-to-fail companies are reactionary at their core.

Achieving the greater good is hard, and it is naive to believe that it is the byproduct of the [big] Other's selfishness. Unless [we, the 99%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_99%25?ref=hackernoon.com), are involved in this dialectic movement as a proactive agent. Otherwise, our society will be destroyed by [climate crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-6la_I-xkQ&ref=hackernoon.com) before having the chance of running into "Post-Human Dystopia."

## No Degrowth No Acceleration

As I mentioned before in [my speech, the dangers of technology](https://techshinobi.org/posts/aisecph/?ref=hackernoon.com#arendt-and-heidegger), big techs will never shrink their data centers for sustainability without changing the underlying political-economic order, unless the next economic cycle/depression comes again.

> Our estimate of OpenAI’s $4 billion in inference costs comes from a person with knowledge of the cluster of servers OpenAI rents from Microsoft. That cluster has the equivalent of 350,000 Nvidia A100 chips, this person said. About 290,000 of those chips, or more than 80% of the cluster, were powering ChartGPT, this person said.

— [Amir Efrati and Aaron Holmes](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year?ref=hackernoon.com)

> Marking a major investment in Meta’s AI future, we are announcing two 24k GPU clusters. We use this cluster design for Llama 3 training. This announcement is one step in our ambitious infrastructure roadmap. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.

— [Building Meta’s GenAI Infrastructure](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/?ref=hackernoon.com)

Zuckerberg will keep expanding their AI clusters to match up with OpenAI/MS, Google, and so on. Open-Source is nothing more than a competitive strategy to Meta after all.

Noam Chomsky and Kohei Saito's advocates for degrowth are very appealing, but we should never solely count on that. Just like a Virtual Machine cannot surpass the limitations of its underlying physical machine. Green politics cannot even sustain itself when it is running above the neoliberal economy.

Now, the condition is clear, but what is to be done? Clearly, neither Degrowth nor Accelerationism are helpful in the Anthropocene era. But what about Slavoj Žižek's "Moderate Conservatism?"

## SaaSS or Cloud Fiefs?

> On the internet, proprietary software isn’t the only way to lose your freedom. Service as a Software Substitute, or SaaSS, is another way to let someone else have power over your computing. SaaSS means using a service implemented by someone else as a substitute for running your copy of a program. The term is ours; articles and ads won’t use it, and they won’t tell you whether a service is SaaSS. Instead they will probably use the vague and distracting term “cloud,” which lumps SaaSS together with various other practices, some abusive and some OK.
>
> One of the many meanings of “cloud computing” is storing your data in online services. In most scenarios, that is foolish because it exposes you to surveillance. Another meaning (which overlaps that but is not the same thing) is Service
> as a Software Substitute, which denies you control over your computing. You should never use SaaSS.

— Richard Stallman, [Who Does That Server Really Serve?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html?ref=hackernoon.com)

RMS wrote this essay long ago, but recently Yanis Varoufakis took this loss of freedom notion a step further in today's context.

> It took mind-bending scientific breakthroughs, fantastical-sounding neural networks and imagination-defying AI programs to accomplish what? To turn workers toiling in warehouses, driving cabs and delivering food into cloud proles. To create a world where markets are increasingly replaced by cloud fiefs. To force businesses into the role of vassals. And to turn all of us into cloud serfs, glued to our smartphones and tablets, eagerly producing the cloud capital that keeps our new overlords on cloud nine.
