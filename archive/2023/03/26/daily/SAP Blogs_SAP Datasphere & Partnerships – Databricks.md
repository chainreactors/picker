Together with [SAP Datashpere](https://news.sap.com/2023/03/sap-datasphere-power-of-business-data/), SAP launched new partnerships to complete the picture of analytical data management and the idea of a Business Data Fabric.

I already gave an impression of the new partners in my blog "[SAP Datasphere – Q&A and Partnerships](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/12/sap-datasphere-qa-and-partnerships/)".

As I want to focus here on Databricks I repeat what I have written:

> ***Databricks***

> *Databricks was founded by the creators of Apache Spark and they build a complete ecosystem around, delivering the [Data Lakehouse](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/05/data-architecture-with-sap-data-lake/) based on a multi-cloud strategy similar to SAP. In simple terms a Data Lakehouse can be understood as bring together modern file formats ([Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) (Databricks), [Apache ORC](https://orc.apache.org/), [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)) with open table formats ([Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) (Databricks), [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/)) with a powerful, distributed query engine to process data ([Photon](https://www.databricks.com/product/photon) for Databricks).*

> *The advantage of a Data Lakehouse is to have all kind of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) in one tier and serve all your data roles like data engineer, data analyst, data scientists, BI modeler and so on, from this tier.*

> *Databricks coined the term “Data Lakehouse” and is the one top partner in this area, even if others provide Data Lakehouse technologies, too.*

An interesting technical perspective about the interplay of SAP Datasphere and Databricks can be found the blog "[Unified Analytics with SAP Datasphere & Databricks Lakehouse Platform- Data Federation Scenarios](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/10/unified-analytics-with-sap-datasphere-databricks-lakehouse-platform-data-federation-scenarios/)" by vivek.rr.

I recently came into some discussions about what Databricks mean for SAP Data Warehouse experts and especially for SAP Datasphere. Will Databricks now become the new SAP Data Warehouse approach? Doesn't Databricks do the same as SAP Datasphere? Should I learn more about Databricks and upskill?

So here are my thoughts about these question.

## **Know the data architecture patterns**

First we have to differentiate between the architecture patterns we see here.

SAP Datasphere was formerly the SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, available since end of 2019. So basically it is still a Cloud-based [Data Warehouse](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/02/data-architecture-with-sap-sap-data-warehouse/) based on SAP HANA Cloud technology incl. Data Lake, Machine Learning and a Data and Business Layer supporting the Data Warehouse use case and different kind of user groups.

SAP Datasphere is now evolving to a Business Data Fabric. [Data Fabric](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/02/data-architecture-with-sap-sap-data-warehouse/) is an approach to unifiy the access and management of all data within a company (in the best case) and make it more available. So Data Fabric can be seen as an approach for data democratization and breaking up data silos. SAP delivered new capabilities like (Data) Catalog, Replication Task and forecasted new semantic capabilities. See [here](https://news.sap.com/2023/03/sap-datasphere-business-data-fabric/) for the new capabilities.

On the other side, Databricks delivers an Data Lakeouse approach, an evolution of combined Data Lake/Data Warehouse approaches enabled within an single technical tier. I once already analyzed SAP's approach in my blog "[Data Architecture with SAP – Data Lake](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/05/data-architecture-with-sap-data-lake/)" and came to the conclusion, SAP is not there at the moment but have a own useful approach within the SAP HANA Cloud Data Lake offering.

## **What Data Lakehouse means**

In general there is a lot of movement in the cloud data management mar...
