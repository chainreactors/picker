### piADina – Italian Recipe for Internal Penetration Testing

What you will read now is not a write-up, a to-do list of steps to follow or a standard to convey to those who are reading. It is simply a narrative.

Like all good stories they should be told at the appropriate place and time, around a fire, over a cool drink or together under the stars.
We cannot do this, however, and so we decided to take you with us in to eat a much-loved **piadina**, **a typical Italian** dish that we share.

Some of you may not know it, and we take you to discover its recipe as if we were eating it together with this story in the pine forest.

## Ingredients

The story begins with a few simple ingredients:

* two attackers
* 5 days of activity to conduct an internal penetration test
* a VPN and a VDI on the internal network.

On the surface, common features like so many others, but because of the developments and challenges faced as well as to share we felt it was appropriate to tell about this activity.
Just as the basic ingredients flour, water, oil and salt make up a favolo dough we also need to clarify some distinctions we care about before proceeding to create the same favorable mix.

First, **a major difference: penetration testing (PT) and red teaming (RT)**. There are different philosophies and in itself merits discussion but we would like to reiterate that this was not a RT activity:

* *The purpose of **pen testing** is not just to test your environment’s vulnerabilities, in different areas: network, mobile, web with their standard – ie OWASP. The goal is to identify the largest number of vulnerabilities and confirm their impact.*
* ***Red team** is a comprehensive security assessment where ethical hackers simulate real-world attackers’ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) on all aspects of an organization, including its people, processes, and technology infrastructure. Unlike traditional vulnerability scanning or penetration testing, which focuses on specific vulnerabilities, Red Teaming takes a holistic yet objective-based approach, providing organizations with a more accurate assessment of their security posture. The Red Team comprises highly skilled security professionals who take on the role of attackers to assess the effectiveness of an organization’s defensive measures.*

*In the real world, red teams exist to measure your posture AND your detection skills, while a penetration test only measures your posture.*

In addition, it is important to understand the scope of the test. In this case, an Active Directory environment offered as Cloud-As-a-Service is considered. Therefore, it is to be considered that the test principal is an entity, but the target is different since it is externally managed and protected. It is no mystery that it is Microsoft or AWS that offers this service, consequently the test was performed against an environment managed and hardened by other provider.

Last but not least, that as the salt gives flavour to the recipe, on the other side there was in addition there was a SOC. Not expressly to our research but because they were correctly informed of the test eager to prove that they detected us.

The activity was on a single, large domain. So no trust, forest and so on.

## Impasto

After presenting the ingredients we need to understand how they should be mixed and how to create the right mixture. Each recipe has its own techniques and tricks so that what is right in one case is wrong in the other.
We similarly had to deal with some unforeseen situations that led us to revise our methodology specifically for this activity.
First, the V...
