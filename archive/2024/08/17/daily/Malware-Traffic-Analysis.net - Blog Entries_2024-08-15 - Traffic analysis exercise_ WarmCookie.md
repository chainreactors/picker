A Windows host was infected, and it seems to be from [WarmCookie](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.warmcookie) malware.

## SCENARIO

LAN segment details:

* LAN segment range:  10.8.15[.]0/24 (10.8.15[.]0 through 10.8.15[.]255)
* Domain:  lafontainebleu[.]org

* AD environment name:  LAFONTAINBLEU
* LAN segment gateway:  10.8.15[.]1
* LAN segment broadcast address:  10.8.15[.]255

## TASK

* Write an incident report based on malicious network activity from the pcap and from the alerts.

* The incident report should contains 3 sections:

> * **Victim Details**: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
> * **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the activity.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
