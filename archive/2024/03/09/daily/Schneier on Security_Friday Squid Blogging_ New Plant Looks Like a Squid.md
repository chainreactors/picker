## Friday Squid Blogging: New Plant Looks Like a Squid

Newly discovered plant [looks like a squid](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2419483-squid-like-plant-that-lives-mostly-underground-is-new-to-science/). And it’s super weird:

> The plant, which grows to 3 centimetres tall and 2 centimetres wide, emerges to the surface for as little as a week each year. It belongs to a group of plants known as fairy lanterns and has been given the scientific name *Relictithismia kimotsukiensis*.
>
> Unlike most other plants, fairy lanterns don’t produce the green pigment chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Instead, they get their energy from fungi.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Happy International Women’s Day!!!!!!!! (Or which in some of the more regressive circles is known as “When Is International Men’s Day”. And, yup. This happens every year. Like, guys, you’ve already got the other 364 days.)

> Initially, everyone on the organising committee for the COP29 global climate summit was male. In response, the She Changes Climate campaign group stated that “climate change affects the whole world, not half of it”. A backlash followed and women have since been included to enhance representation within the committee.
>
> A gender-balanced committee is not only a matter of justice and representation, but it also represents a strategic choice. Addressing the complex global challenge of climate change requires diverse perspectives and experiences. Female leaders can bring different qualities to the table.

The article discussing women in climate leadership specifically mentions how involving women in governance improves decision making and security. The second article highlights how organsiations can sometimes resist this and you have to make a stand.

> Student Pilot Danners the school’s only female student. She’s sent out on a sortie to learn how to handle the jet at dangerous low heights and make it to a target on time. She is given a target that she’ll have to fly over exactly on time, with only a five-second margin of error. To make it there she’ll be flying at 500mph just 250ft from the ground – a height that is littered with hazards Danners will have to work hard to avoid.

Women can participate in physical activities like Formula 1 and flying fast jets for the military. According to a comment: “Lella was way faster than her results let on. She kept telling the March team something was wrong with her car but they didn’t listen. Then after they sacked her and brought in Ronnie Peterson, he said the exact same thing was wrong with his car. They fixed it and he was instantly quicker.” The Red Bull situation highlights what happens when women and women’s rights are not respected and why International Women’s Day is needed. Spoiler: Danners hit the target two seconds ahead which was within the +/- five second window. She qualified and went on to be deployed.

> Every year on 8 March, we mark International Women’s Day: celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women, and raising awareness of the barriers and discrimination they still face around the world.
>
> Today, we would like to highlight and celebrate the work we are doing as part of the Out of the Margins project, aimed at supporting lesbian, bi and trans women (LBT+ communities) globally.

Esther Ghey mother of Brianna Ghey who was a young transgender girl murdered in a horrible hate crime is an active campaigner for mindfulness. She set up a charity in her daughter’s memory and continues to campaign for online safety. The politicians and media who put bullets in the gun continue to walk free.

All women including LBT+ women serve in the UK military and work for MI5 and GCHQ. The nation is more safe because they serve.

I thought I’d end on a light note. The first video humorously describes what security can look like from a woman’s point of view. The second video points out humorously and clearly how a government can abuse its power and the state security apparatus in ways which can co-opt or harm women directly or indirectly.
