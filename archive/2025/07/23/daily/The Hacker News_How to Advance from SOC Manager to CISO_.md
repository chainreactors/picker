Making the move from managing a security operations center (SOC) to being a chief information security officer (CISO) is a significant career leap. Not only do you need a solid foundation of tech knowledge but also leadership skills and business smarts.

This article will guide you through the practical steps and skills you'll need to nab an executive cybersecurity job and make the promotion from SOC manager to CISO a reality.

## Is the CISO role right for you?

It's always a good idea to think about how you could move up and grow in your career. Aspiring to be a CISO can be a great career move.

Additionally, certain operational tasks in cybersecurity, especially in a SOC, are becoming increasingly automated, making it vital to develop strategic and leadership skills to stay ahead. Having ambitious goals helps you, as a SOC analyst or lead, stay relevant and valuable in what is a constantly changing field.

However, the role of CISO is significantly different from other roles in cybersecurity and comes with its own set of challenges. So, while it is a good option, it's not the only path and might not suit everyone's strengths and career goals. It's my hope that this article will lay out what being a CISO is all about so you can determine if it's the path you want to take.

## Key skills for executive growth

For those looking to take on executive and leadership roles like CISO, it's essential to develop skills beyond the scope of your typical IT role.

Having a comprehensive IT background is a significant advantage, especially when it comes to security vulnerabilities and how to respond to incidents. But you can't focus solely on technical expertise at the expense of vital leadership, communication, and strategic thinking skills needed for the position of CISO.

Remember: You'll have to relay complex security matters to stakeholders outside IT, and do so in a way that they can easily understand the issues at stake.

Let's break down areas you'll need for the role of executive.

### Strategic thinking

Strategic thinking demands a firm grip on the organization's core operations, particularly how it generates revenue and its key value streams. This perspective allows security professionals to align their efforts with business objectives, rather than operating in isolation.

### Business acumen

This is related to strategic thinking but emphasizes knowledge of risk management and finance. Security leaders must factor in financial impacts to justify security investments and manage risks effectively.

Balancing security measures with user experience and system availability is another critical aspect. If security policies are too strict, productivity can suffer; if they're too permissive, the company can be exposed to threats. Decisions must consider the impact of security actions on the broader business environment.

### Communication

Effective communication is vital for translating technical details into language senior stakeholders can grasp and act upon. This means avoiding jargon and abbreviations to convey information in a simplistic manner that resonates with multiple stakeholders, including executives who may not have a deep technical background.

Communicating the impact of security initiatives in clear, concise language ensures decisions are well-informed and support company goals.

### Service management

You will have to ensure technical services meet business requirements, particularly in managing service delivery, implementing change, and resolving issues. All of this is essential for a secure and efficient IT infrastructure.

Knowledge of risk management as mentioned above, is fundamental in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks. It helps align security strategies with business goals, facilitating informed decisions and resource allocation.

### Compliance

Being aware of compliance requirements, involving adherence to regulatory and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, NIS2, PCI DSS), is critical for ensuring legal and ethical operations. Understanding these mandates helps in implementing appropriate security controls and policies.

Exposure to legal aspects, such as data privacy laws and intellectual property rights, broadens the perspective necessary for the CISO role and interactions with both external and internal bodies such as the [GRC](https://radiantsecurity.ai/blog/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-breaking-through-the-security-and-compliance-gridlock/) within your organization. Here, formal education, including a degree in computer science or cybersecurity, combined with continuous learning via industry courses and certifications, strengthens your expertise; it also prepares you for leadership responsibilities and demonstrates your readiness to take on the challenges that come with the job.

## Practical advice for career transition

To successfully transition and advance your cybersecurity career, you'll need to take concrete strategic steps toward a CISO role.

### Gaining visibility, building influence, and getting promoted

To advance your cybersecurity career, make your value known. Share your contributions and accomplishments, both within your team and also with other departments and leadership.

When presenting data, make it actionable by showing how the information drives improvements and supports business goals via tactical metrics and simple language. Also, actively look for opportunities to contribute to broader initiatives and offer solutions to challenges that extend beyond your current role a...
