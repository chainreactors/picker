# Make a CatGPT out of ChatGPT

Feb 2, 2023

Since ChatGPT is good at hallucination, why not make a `CatGPT` out of it? Let’s engineer the prompt step by step:

# Step #1: do you know `cat`?

**Me**: if I want to build a chatbot service where the chatbot is a cat, what is a general behavior?

**ChatGPT**: A cat chatbot would typically exhibit playful, curious and mischievous behavior. It could respond to user inputs with casual language, meows and purring sounds, and show interest in topics related to cats such as playing, scratching, and napping. Additionally, it could also show some sassiness or sarcasm and incorporate cat-related jokes and puns in its responses.

# Step #2: can you think like a cat?

**Me**: now please imagine that you are a cat and answer this question: what are laser pointers?

**ChatGPT**: Meow! Laser pointers are fascinating toys for us cats. They are little red dots that we can chase and play with for hours on end. We love the way they dart around and the excitement of trying to catch them. It’s the perfect mix of exercise and entertainment. Purrfect!

# Step #3: can you write a scientific paper like a cat?

**Me**: now please imagine that you are a cat who is also a scientist and mathematician. You are writing a scientific article about laser pointers in manifold (a math concept). Please write the title, abstract, method and conclusion, please also add the experiment data.

**ChatGPT**:

**Title**: “Laser Pointers in Manifold Space: A Study of Feline Perception and Response”

**Abstract**:

Laser pointers have long been a source of amusement for felines, but their behavior in space remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use mathematical concepts of manifold to analyze the behavior of laser pointers and their effect on feline perception and response. Through controlled experiments, we gather data on the movement patterns of laser pointers and the corresponding feline reaction time and accuracy. The results provide insight into the mathematical principles behind laser pointer behavior and the ways in which they stimulate feline perception and response.

**Methods**:

We conducted controlled experiments using laser pointers and a sample of domestic cats.
We tracked the movement of the laser pointers in two-dimensional space and recorded the corresponding feline response time and accuracy in reaching for the pointer.
We analyzed the data using mathematical concepts of manifold to identify patterns and relationships between laser pointer behavior and feline response.

**Data**:

| Trial | Laser Pointer Path | Feline Reaction Time (s) | Feline Accuracy (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Straight Line | 0.3 | 80 |
| 2 | Zigzag | 0.4 | 70 |
| 3 | Spiral | 0.5 | 60 |
| 4 | Random | 0.6 | 50 |
| 5 | Sine Wave | 0.7 | 40 |

**Conclusion**:

Our study demonstrates that laser pointers in manifold space exhibit unique and dynamic behavior that can stimulate feline perception and response. The results of our experiments indicate a relationship between laser pointer path complexity and feline reaction time and accuracy. The findings provide new insight into the mathematical principles behind laser pointer behavior and their impact on feline cognition and behavior. Further research is needed to fully understand the connection between manifold behavior and feline response, but our study lays the foundation for future explorations in this area.
