# Highlights

Here's a glimpse at what happened in Tails in September and October.

## Analyzing results of usability tests

We analyzed the results of the usability tests we did in São Paulo:

* [first-time use](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20221012.181235.a673efeb.en.html)
* [Tor Connection](https://lists.autistici.org/message/20221012.140611.7e58f067.en.html)

Then we prioritized the issues identified there and planned to fix
a bunch of them in the next few months.

## New features

Our developers brought 3 major new features to beta quality:

* New Persistent Storage, completely redesigned and vastly more usable

  ![](../test_5.8-beta1/features.png)
* Wayland and better Unsafe Browser, for better security in depth and
  usability
* QR code scanning for Tor bridges

  ![](../test_5.8-beta1/qr_code.png)

We will only release these features officially in Tails 5.8 (December 2022),
but you can [try them already in Tails 5.8~beta1](../test_5.8-beta1/)!

## Donation campaign

We launched our end-of-year donation campaign.

Donations from passionate people like you are our most valuable source of
funding because they guarantee our independence. We are a very small nonprofit
and our yearly budget is ridiculously small compared to the value of Tails.

[Donate now](../../donate/index.en.html) to fight surveillance and censorship!

# Releases

[Tails 5.5 was released on October 17](../version_5.5/), including:

* Update *Thunderbird* to [102.3.0](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/102.3.0/releasenotes/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 is a major update with [many changes to the navigation,
  folder icons, and address
  book](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/thunderbird-102-released-a-serious-upgrade-to-your-communication/).

  *Thunderbird* 102 also includes important usability improvements to the
  OpenPGP feature. When composing an email, you can now see whether it will be
  encrypted or not. If encryption is impossible, a key assistant helps you
  solve key issues.

* Always ask to configure a screen locking password when pressing Ctrl+L and no
  administration password was set. ([#19090](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues/19090))

[Tails 5.6 was released on October 25](../version_5.6/).
