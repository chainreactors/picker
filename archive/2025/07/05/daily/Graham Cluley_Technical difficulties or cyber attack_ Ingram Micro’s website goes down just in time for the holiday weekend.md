There‚Äôs no official word on what the problem is, but [Ingram Micro‚Äôs website](https://www.ingrammicro.com "LInk to Ingram Micro") has been down since Thursday morning. They claim to be ‚Äúcurrently experiencing technical difficulties‚Ä¶‚Äù

Are you thinking what I‚Äôm thinking? I really hope I‚Äôm wrong, but it‚Äôs not at all unusual for a cyber attack to be timed to coincide with a long holiday weekend in the United States‚Ä¶

Ingram Micro might not be talking, but there‚Äôs plenty of speculation and bandying about of the term ‚Äúransomware‚Äù [over on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lqyayw/ingram_micro_down/ "Link to Reddit thread").
