That massive GitHub supply chain attack that spilled secrets from countless projects? It traces back to a stolen token from a SpotBugs workflow - exposed way back in November, months earlier than previously suspected.

After "piecing together the stages" of the [tj-actions/changed-files compromise](https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/17/supply_chain_attack_github/), Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat hunters concluded attackers used a leaked Personal Access Token (PAT) from SpotBugs to shift over to reviewdog, and ultimately tamper with the popular tj-actions/changed-files GitHub Action to quietly stash developers' secrets in log files.

"The attackers obtained initial access by taking advantage of the GitHub Actions workflow of SpotBugs, a popular open-source tool for static analysis of bugs in code," Omer Gil, Aviad Hahami, Asi Greenholts, and Yaron Avital [said](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/github-actions-supply-chain-attack/#update-4-2-25e) in an April update to their analysis from last month.
