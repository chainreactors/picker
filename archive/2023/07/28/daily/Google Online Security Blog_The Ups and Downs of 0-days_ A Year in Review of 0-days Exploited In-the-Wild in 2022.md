This is Google’s fourth annual year-in-review of 0-days exploited in-the-wild [[2021](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/04/the-more-you-know-more-you-know-you.html), [2020](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/02/deja-vu-lnerability.html), [2019](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/07/detection-deficit-year-in-review-of-0.html)] and builds off of the [mid-year](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html) 2022 review. The goal of this report is not to detail each [individual exploit](https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/rca.html), but instead to analyze the exploits from the year as a whole, looking for trends, gaps, lessons learned, and successes.

# Executive Summary

41 in-the-wild 0-days were detected and disclosed in 2022, the second-most ever recorded since we [began tracking in mid-2014](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0), but down from the 69 detected in 2021.  Although a 40% drop might seem like a clear-cut win for improving security, the reality is more complicated. Some of our key takeaways from 2022 include:

N-days function like 0-days on Android due to long patching times. Across the Android ecosystem there were multiple cases where patches were not available to users for a significant time. Attackers didn’t need 0-day exploits and instead were able to use n-days that functioned as 0-days.

0-click exploits and new browser mitigations drive down browser 0-days. Many attackers have been moving towards 0-click rather than 1-click exploits. 0-clicks usually target components other than the browser. In addition, all major browsers also implemented new defenses that make exploiting a vulnerability more difficult and could have influenced attackers moving to other attack surfaces.

Over 40% of the 0-days discovered were variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. 17 out of the 41 in-the-wild 0-days from 2022 are variants of previously reported vulnerabilities. This continues the unpleasant trend that we’ve discussed previously in both the [2020 Year in Review](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/02/deja-vu-lnerability.html) report and the [mid-way through 2022](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/06/2022-0-day-in-wild-exploitationso-far.html) report. More than 20% are variants of previous in-the-wild 0-days from 2021 and 2020.

Bug collisions are high. 2022 brought more frequent reports of attackers using the same vulnerabilities as each other, as well as security researchers reporting vulnerabilities that were later discovered to be used by attackers. When an in-the-wild 0-day targeting a popular consumer platform is found and fixed, it's increasingly likely to be breaking another attacker's exploit as well.

Based on our analysis of 2022 0-days we hope to see the continued focus in the following areas across the industry:

1. More comprehensive and timely patching to address the use of variants and n-days as 0-days.
2. More platforms following browsers’ lead in releasing broader mitigations to make whole classes of vulnerabilities less exploitable.
3. Continued growth of transparency and collaboration between vendors and security defenders to share technical details and work together to detect exploit chains that cross multiple products.

# By the Numbers

For the 41 vulnerabilities detected and disclosed in 2022, no single find accounted for a large percentage of all the detected 0-days. We saw them spread relatively evenly across the year: 20 in the first half and 21 in the second half. The combination of these two data points, suggests more frequent and regular detections. We also saw the number of organizations credited with in-the-wild 0-day discoveries stay high. Across the 69 detected 0-days from 2021 there were 20 organizations credited. In 2022 across the 41 in-the-wild 0-days there were 18 organizations credited. It’s promising to see the number of organizations working on 0-day detection staying high because we need as many people working on this problem as possible.

2022 included the detection and disclosure of 41 in-the-wild 0-days, down from the 69 in 2021. While a significant drop from 2021, 2022 is still solidly in second place. All of the 0-days that we’re using for our analysis are tracked in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=1662223764).

# Limits of Number of 0-days as a Security Metric

The number of 0-days detected and disclosed in-the-wild can’t tell us much about the state of security. Instead we use it as one indicator of many. For 2022, we believe that a combination of security improvements and regressions influenced the approximately 40% drop in the number of detected and disclosed 0-days from 2021 to 2022 and the continued higher than average number of 0-days that we saw in 2022.

Both positive and negative changes can influence the number of in-the-wild 0-days to both rise and fall. We therefore can’t use this number alone to signify whether or not we’re progressing in the fight to keep users safe. Instead we use the number to analyze what factors could have contributed to it and then review whether or not those factors are areas of success or places that need to be addressed.

Example factors that would cause the number of detected and disclosed in-the-wild 0-days to rise:

|  |
| --- |
| Security Improvements - Attackers require more 0-days to maintain the same capability |
| * Discovering and fixing 0-days more quickly * More entities publicly disclosing when a 0-day is known to be in-the-wild * Adding security boundaries to platforms |
| Security Regressions - 0-days are easier to find and exploit |
| * Variant analysis is not performed on reported vulnerabilities * Exploit techniques are not mitigated * More exploitable vulnerabilities are added to code than fixed |

Example factors that would cause the number of detected and disclosed in-the-wild 0-days to decline:

|  |
| --- |
| Security Improvements - 0-days take more time, money, and expertise to develop for use |
| * Fewer exploitable 0-day vulnerabilities exist * Each new 0-day requires the creation of a new exploitation technique * New vulnerabilities require researching new attack surfaces |
| Security Regressions - Attackers need fewer 0-days to maintain the same capability |
| * Slower to detect in-the-wild 0-days so a bug has a longer lifetime * Extended time until users are able to install a patch * Less sophisticated attack methods: phishing, malware, n-day exploits are sufficient |

Brainstorming the different factors that could lead to this number rising and declining allows us to understand what’s happening behind the numbers and draw conclusions from there. Two key factors con...
