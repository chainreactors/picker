It’s up to designers to use the right tools and techniques to strike an optimal balance between security and functionality.

Neglecting user security puts users at risk financially, professionally and even sometimes physically. When it comes to user experience, we can safely say that it has become very important to think about user security when designing digital products.

As UX designers, we must recognize that the real goal of security is to minimize the relative amount of unauthorized use across a system. Let’s learn why user security is a crucial aspect of user experience design.

For some time, there has been growing tension between security and design. Security aims to make systems hard to access for unauthorized users, whereas usability design seeks to create systems that are easy for users to use and would require no special access procedures with.

This has been an ongoing conversation and sometimes, it doesn't seem possible for design and security to co-exist. It is important to note that security isn’t a trend or promotional tactic — instead, it’s a crucial aspect of user experience and interface design.

## **Busting security myths**

There have been a number of existing myths that have been passed around in the conversation of design and security, which we’ll now dive into.

There's a common belief that people don't care about security. This is not entirely true. People do care, but typically, they look at security from a long-term perspective.

In other words, everyone wants their [personal data](https://blog.avast.com/protect-your-personal-data-online?_ga=2.243165956.726012695.1668154229-267172476.1668154229) and property to be safe (that’s why they install expensive door locks and security cameras!). However, running into a sudden security notification is something different, and sometimes, it can come across as more of a nuisance than a warning. This is often because at the particular moment when a person is opening a particular app or website, they’re doing it for a reason. In most cases, they’re just trying to accomplish a task as quickly and easily as possible.

When users run into pop-up notifications telling them about a security issue that hinders them from reaching their goal, that hindrance becomes a roadblock between the user and the task at hand.

This is an issue, since people don’t care about roadblocks — they look for ways around them and can almost always find them. When security is something that obstructs the process, people will find a workaround.

Jared Spool said it best when he [summarized](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1050452179360854017) a key principle of security:

We can conclude that building security walls in front of people who are simply trying to do their job doesn’t work, but fortunately, other approaches do.

## Does security require shutting everything down?

There’s UX security that doesn’t shut down or lock anything. It keeps users safe and stays invisible to them. The evolution of CAPTCHA is the perfect illustration of how it is possible. There’s also Google’s “I’m not a robot” checkbox that makes you literally do nothing but tap a checkbox to prove that you’re human.

[Two-factor authentication](https://www.avast.com/c-how-does-two-factor-authentication-work) has also become a common protective measure. This form of authentication adds an extra layer of security to the username and password standard. Users should be presented with subtle security checks that they can always decipher.

As UX designers, we can design interfaces that are simple and secure without compromising the quality of either. When you’re starting with building a product that would require sensitive user data, it is important to start thinking about security early on in the design process.

## Work together with stakeholders and your security team on user security early

Ensure that your UX design team, your security team, and other relevant stakeholders are actually working together, ideally in the [user research process](https://www.uxtweak.com/ux-research/process/) or at least during the initial product design phase. This will help ensure that the whole team is focused on designing a secure and usable digital product. There are relevant laws that designers need to be aware of when designing digital products for users with security in mind.

[HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) is a privacy rule that was created to safeguard data and information stored in medical records, and it’s an important rule that must be adhered to when designing digital products in the medical space. [PCI DSS](https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/#1) is also another important privacy standard in the fintech space which ensures that any company that accepts, processes, stores or transmits credit card information, does so in a secure environment. Both HIPAA and PCI DSS are prime examples of laws that help enhance user security.

On a relatively new design team, some UX designers may not know about these existing laws, so it's important to have all relevant stakeholders on a team before carrying out or designing any big project.

## UX design tips for increasing user data security

### 1. Explore encryption

[Encryption](https://www.avast.com/c-encryption?_ga=2.243165956.726012695.1668154229-267172476.1668154229) is a method of converting sensitive information into a code that appears to be random. It’s an important design consideration in digital products with communication features. It is usually found in apps where calls, texts, videos, images, and documents are frequently exchanged. For example, [Telegram](https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data) utilizes end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the users involved in a conversation can see the data being exchanged.

This means that no one, including staff at the company, data criminals, or even the federal government can see the content of messages or data exchanged.

**When users know that their information is protected by such measures, they’re much more willing to extend trust.**

### 2. Use a transparency-first approach

There is no clear intention of [ethical data collection](https://blog.uxtweak.com/user-research-ethics/) on an app or website without transparency and honesty about the process used. Apps and websites need to clearly inform users about the specific data that’s being collected and why it’s needed.

It’s important to do more than provide a basic link to a privacy policy. Most users [won’t take the time to read it](https://blog.avast.com/privacy-policies-are-hard-to-read?_ga=2.205622165.726012695.1668154229-267172476.1668154229) in full. Those who do, may become confused and frustrated by the complex legal terms.

One of the key responsibilities as a designer is to provide an easy-to-access, easy-to-understand overview of a [site’s privacy policy](https://blog.avast.com/consumer-data-privacy-avast?_ga=2.205622165.726012695.1668154229-267172476.1668154229). Offering users this overview empowers them to make informed decisions about the data collection they consent to. This will build trust between them and a product.

### 3. Enhance safe user privacy and data options

It’s important to note that digital products are made for users, not the other way around. Users’ interactions with products should never come with the...
