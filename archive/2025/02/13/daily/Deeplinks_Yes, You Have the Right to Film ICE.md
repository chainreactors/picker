Across the United States, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has already begun increasing enforcement operations, including [highly publicized raids](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/are-cities-ice-raids-are-taking-place-rcna189390?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us). As immigrant communities, families, allies, and activists think about what can be done to shift policy and protect people, one thing is certain: similar to [filming the police](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/you-have-first-amendment-right-record-police) as they operate, you have the right to film ICE, as long as you are not obstructing official duties.

Filming ICE agents making an arrest or amassing in your town helps promote transparency and accountability for a system that often relies on intimidation and secrecy and obscures [abuse](https://www.pogo.org/investigations/dhss-secret-reports-on-ice-detention) and [law-breaking](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/this-deceptive-ice-tactic-violates-the-fourth-amendment).

While it is crucial for people to help aid in transparency and accountability, there are considerations and precautions you should take. For an in-depth guide by organizations on the frontlines of informing people who wish to record ICE’s interactions with the public, review these handy resources from the hard-working folks at [WITNESS](https://library.witness.org/product-category/immigrant-justice/) and [NYCLU](https://www.nyclu.org/resourc...
