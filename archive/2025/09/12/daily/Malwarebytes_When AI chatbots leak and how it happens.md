# When AI chatbots leak and how it happens

Posted: September 11, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In a recent [article on Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/security/ai-chatbots-vyro-data-leak) there were two clear signs of how fast the world of AI chatbots is growing. A company I had never even heard of had over 150 million app downloads across its portfolio, and it also had an exposed unprotected Elasticsearch instance.

This needs a bit of an explanation. I had never heard of Vyro AI, a company that probably still doesn’t ring many bells, but its app ImagineArt has over 10 million downloads on Google Play. Vyro AI also markets Chatly, which has over 100,000 downloads, and Chatbotx, a web-based chatbot with about 50,000 monthly visits.

An Elasticsearch instance is a database server running a tool used to quickly store and search lots of data. If it’s unsecured because it lacks passwords, authentication, or network restrictions, it is unprotected against unauthorized visitors. This means it’s freely accessible to access by anyone with internet access that happens to find it. And without any protection like a password or a firewall, anyone who finds the database online can read, copy, change, or even delete all its data.

The researcher that found the database says it covered both production and development environments and stored about 2–7 days’ worth of logs, including 116GB of user logs in real time from the company’s three popular apps.

The information that was accessible included:

* AI prompts that users typed into the apps. AI prompts are the questions and instructions that users submit to the AI.
* Bearer authentication tokens, which function similarly to cookies so the user does not have to log in before every session, and allows the user to view their history and enter prompts. An attacker could even hijack an account using these tokens.
* User agents which are strings of text sent with requests to a server to identify the application, its version, and the device’s operating system. For native mobile apps, developers might include a custom user agent string within the HTTP headers of their requests. This allows developers to identify specific app users, and tailor content and experiences for different app versions or platforms.

The researcher found that the database was first indexed by IoT search engines in mid-February. IoT search engines actively find and list devices or servers that anyone can access on the internet. They help users discover vulnerable devices (such as cameras, printers, and smart home gadgets) and also locate open databases.

This means that attackers have had a chance to “stumble” over this open database for months. And with the information there they could have taken over user accounts, accessed chat histories and generated images, and made fraudulent AI credit purchases.

## How does this happen all the time?

Generative AI has found a place in many homes and even more companies, which means there is a lot of money to be made.

But the companies delivering these AI chatbots feel they can only be relevant when they push out new products. So, their engineering efforts are put there where they can control the cash flow. Security and privacy concerns are secondary at best.

Just looking at the last few months, we have reported about:
