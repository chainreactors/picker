One of the common requirements when we are implementing SAP Ariba Commerce Automation or Digital Supplier Network, is to send attachments inside the purchase order to Ariba Business Network, but this functionality is already included implementing the next Include in the User Exit EXIT\_SAPLEINM\_002:
> ```
>  INCLUDE ARBCIG_ORDER_REQUEST_002 IF FOUND.
> ```

But...what happens when you want to send the PDF of the purchase order, and this PDF is generated in a SAPScript form, that is executed inside the output type message:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/print1.jpg)

Message Output

This Output type is configured in NACE transaction where you enter the form name of the SAPScript that will be triggered:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/print2.jpg)

NACE Output Type

The complication of this functionality is that this printout of the purchase order, is triggered when the output message is already processed and the purchase order is already approved, but when you are sending the purchase order to Ariba Business Network, this steps are not finished yet, so you must implement a logic to print the PDF of the purchase order, executing manually the SAPScript in real time when the PO is sent to Business Network.

We can do that implementing the BADI ARBCIG\_BADI\_ATTACHMENT\_UTIL where we process the attachments of the PO.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/print3.jpg)

BADI ARBCIG\_BADI\_ATTACHMENT\_UTIL

We only need the method PRE\_ATTACHMENT\_PROCESS:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/08/print4.jpg)

METHOD PRE\_ATTACHMENT\_PROCESS

Inside this method, we will implement the next logic:

1. Search in NAST table with the PO ID if exists the message you are configured in NACE transaction for the purchase order you are approving.

2. Read the data of the PO from MF ME\_READ\_PO\_FOR\_PRINTING.

3. Execute the MF ECP\_PRINT\_PO with the form ID.

4. Read the OTF data of the form with MF READ\_OTF\_FROM\_MEMORY.

5. Convert OTF data to PDF with MF CONVERT\_OTF.

6. Encrypt the PDF from Hexadecimal to Base64 with MF SCMS\_BASE64\_ENCODE\_STR.

7. Complete the E1ARBCIG\_ATTACH\_HDR\_DET segment with header data of attachment.

8. Complete the E1ARBCIG\_ATTACH\_CONTENT\_DET segment with the content of Base64 string.

All this steps are detailed in the next code:
