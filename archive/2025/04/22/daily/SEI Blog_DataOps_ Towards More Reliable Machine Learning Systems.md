As organizations increasingly rely on machine learning (ML) systems for mission-critical tasks, they face significant challenges in managing the raw material of these systems: data. Data scientists and engineers grapple with ensuring data quality, maintaining consistency across different versions, tracking changes over time, and coordinating work across teams. These challenges are amplified in defense contexts, where decisions based on ML models can have significant consequences and where strict regulatory requirements demand complete traceability and reproducibility. DataOps emerged as a response to these challenges, providing a systematic approach to data management that enables organizations to build and maintain reliable, trustworthy ML systems.

In our [previous post](https://doi.org/10.58012/zkgg-en08), we introduced our series on machine learning operations (MLOps) testing & evaluation (T&E) and outlined the three key domains we'll be exploring: [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps), [ModelOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModelOps), and [EdgeOps](https://www.capgemini.com/insights/expert-perspectives/edgeops-the-future-of-edge-computing/). In this post, we're diving into DataOps, an area that focuses on the management and optimization of data throughout its lifecycle. DataOps is a critical component that forms the foundation of any successful ML system.

## Understanding DataOps

At its core, DataOps encompasses the management and orchestration of data throughout the ML lifecycle. Think of it as the infrastructure that ensures your data is not just available, but reliable, traceable, and ready for use in training and validation. In the defense context, where decisions based on ML models can have significant consequences, the importance of robust DataOps cannot be overstated.

## Version Control: The Backbone of Data Management

One of the fundamental aspects of DataOps is [data version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). Just as software developers use version control for code, data scientists need to track changes in their datasets over time. This isn't just about keeping different versions of data—it's about ensuring reproducibility and auditability of the entire ML process.

Version control in the context of data management presents unique challenges that go beyond traditional software version control. When multiple teams work on the same dataset, conflicts can arise that need careful resolution. For instance, two teams might make different annotations to the same data points or apply different preprocessing steps. A robust version control system needs to handle these scenarios gracefully while maintaining data integrity.

Metadata, in the form of version-specific documentation and change records, plays a crucial role in version control. These records include detailed information about what changes were made to datasets, why those changes were made, who made them, and when they occurred. This contextual information becomes invaluable when tracking down issues or when regulatory compliance requires a complete audit trail of data modifications. Rather than just tracking the data itself, these records capture the human decisions and processes that shaped the data throughout its lifecycle.

## Data Exploration and Processing: The Path to Quality

The journey from raw data to model-ready datasets involves careful preparation and processing. This critical initial phase begins with understanding the characteristics of your data through exploratory analysis. Modern visualization techniques and statistical tools help data scientists uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and understand the underlying structure of their data. For example, in developing a predictive maintenance system for military vehicles, exploration might reveal inconsistent sensor reading frequencies across vehicle types or variations in maintenance log terminology between bases. It’s important that these types of problems are addressed before model development begins.

The import and export capabilities implemented within your DataOps infrastructure—typically through data processing tools, ETL (extract, transform, load) pipelines, and specialized software frameworks—serve as the gateway for data flow. These technical components need to handle various data formats while ensuring data integrity throughout the process. This includes proper serialization and deserialization of data, handling different encodings, and maintaining consistency across different systems.

Data integration presents its own set of challenges. In real-world applications, data rarely comes from a single, clean source. Instead, organizations often need to combine data from multiple sources, each with its own format, schema, and quality issues. Effective data integration involves not just merging these sources but doing so in a way that maintains data lineage and ensures accuracy.

The preprocessing phase transforms raw data into a format suitable for ML models. This involves multiple steps, each requiring careful consideration. *Data cleaning* handles missing values and outliers, ensuring the quality of your dataset. *Transformation* processes might include normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical variables, or creating derived features. The key is to implement these steps in a way that's both reproducible and documented. This will be important not just for traceability, but also in case the data corpus needs to be altered or updated and the training process iterated.
