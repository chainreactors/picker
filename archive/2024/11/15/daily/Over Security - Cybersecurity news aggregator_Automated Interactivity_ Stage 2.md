Automated Interactivity: Stage 2

Last year, we introduced [Automated Interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity/) — a feature that simulates user behavior inside the [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=automated_interactivity_stage_two&utm_term=141124&utm_content=linktolanding) to automatically force cyber attack execution.

The first stage of Automated Interactivity focused on basic user interactions like clicking buttons and completing CAPTCHA challenges. This allowed many analysts to simplify their investigations and streamline the sandbox use via API.

Today, we are excited to announce the release of the next stage of Automated Interactivity — the Smart Content Analysis mechanism that takes its threat detection capabilities to a new level, delivering better and more in-depth examination of the most complex attacks.

Here’s what you need to know about this exciting upgrade.

## What is Smart Content Analysis

Smart content analysis is a mechanism that enables Automated Interactivity to execute malware and phishing attacks by identifying and detonating their key components at each stage of the kill chain.

It works in three steps:

* **Content Identification:** It scans uploaded samples for notable content, such as URLs and email attachments.

* **Content Extraction:** It extracts the content that needs to be detonated to force the attack to move forward like URLs from QR codes and phishing links that were rewritten by security tools.

* **Simulated User Interactions:** It then simulates user interactions with the extracted content, for instance, by opening URLs in a browser and launching malware payloads inside archives.

## How Smart Content Analysis Adapts to New Threats

Unlike traditional automated solutions that are limited by pre-programmed algorithms, ANY.RUN’s Smart Content Analysis is built to continuously evolve with the current threat landscape.

Our team of threat analysts update it with new attack scenarios as soon as they are detected. This ensures nearly instant adaptability to the latest threats and techniques.

## Why Use It

The upgraded version of Automated Interactivity is an excellent addition to your security workflow, as it:

* Improves threat detection for sandbox sessions launched via API

* Helps security specialists with analysis by automating complex tasks, providing them with valuable insights and reducing the learning curve

* Automates repetitive tasks, reducing the manual effort required for threat analysis and allowing analysts to focus on more strategic activities

* Speeds up analysis by quickly identifying and analyzing threats, enabling faster response and remediation

## Types of Content It Can Detonate

Smart Content Analysis can automatically identify and detonate different types of content when moving along the kill chain, including:

* **URLs inside QR codes:** It can automatically extract and open URLs embedded within QR codes, a common tactic for phishing attempts or malware distribution.

* **Modified Links:** Security solutions and spam filters can often rewrite malicious URLs to prevent them from reaching users. This can prevent automated sandboxes from forcing the attack execution beyond the safe link. Smart Content Analysis easily removes the security layer and detonates the original malicious URL.

* **Multi-Stage Redirects:** Many cyber attacks employ complex chains of redirects to obfuscate their final destination. Smart Content Analysis quickly locates the hidden page by bypassing the redirect ones.

* **Email Attachments:** Email attachments are a popular method for attackers to deliver malware. Smart Content Analysis can automatically process and detonate these attachments, as well as their contents.

* **Payloads within Archives:** Mo...
