# DDoS DNS attacks are old-school, unsophisticated … and they’re back

## So why would you handle them on your own?

Sponsored Feature Ransomware may currently be the biggest bogeyman for cybersecurity pros, law enforcement, and governments, but it shouldn't divert us from more traditional, but still very disruptive threats.

Take distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, for example. Hacktivist groups were notorious for flooding their targets with traffic in the noughties, slowing down websites or forcing them offline altogether. And it might be easy to fool ourselves into thinking that DDoS is no longer a threat, thanks to improved mitigation techniques and angry young hacktivists pouring their energies into other forms of protest.

But this would be complacent in the extreme. Cloudflare research showed a "massive spike" in application layer [DDoS attacks in Q1 2022](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-attack-trends-for-2022-q1/), while network layer attacks also jumped substantially. In the fourth quarter, "despite a year long decline", total [DDoS traffic was still up 79 percent year on year, Cloudflare reported](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-2022-q4/). And application layer attacks were up a similar amount in the same period.
