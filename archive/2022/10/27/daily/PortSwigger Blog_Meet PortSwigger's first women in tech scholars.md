PortSwigger recently launched a [scholarship scheme](https://portswigger.net/careers/women-in-tech-scholarship-scheme), specifically directed at creating opportunities for young women to kick-start their tech career. Our scholarships offer paid work opportunities, tailored personal development programmes, generous financial support, and the potential for a permanent position after graduation.

We spoke with Charlotte and Lucy, the first two female graduates to partake in the scheme, to find out about their experiences so far.

## How was your experience applying for our scholarship scheme?

#### Charlotte

"It was very easy to apply, and the company is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions.

#### Lucy

It felt like I applied to and interviewed for a lot of things over year 13, and part of what made me hope that I'd progress in the PortSwigger scholarship scheme was that I enjoyed the process so much more. It felt welcoming and engaging, instead of off-putting like everything else.

## What made you choose a career in tech?

#### Lucy

I love logic and how creative tech can be within that. It has always interested and excited me, so I decided I wanted to work in tech.

#### Charlotte

The extracurricular activities at my school really enhanced my love of computer science. I spent a lot of time at code club with friends and realised that I loved the problem solving elements of code development.

## When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?

#### Charlotte

I went through a few different phases. I've wanted to be a dancer, an archaeologist, and even a firefighter. I decided I was set on technology as a career path aged around 13.

#### Lucy

For years I wanted to be an author. A big part of me still wants to be.

## What attracted you most to PortSwigger?

#### Lucy

The attitude of everyone at PortSwigger just made it seem like a lovely place to work, and I really liked the idea of experiencing working using an agile approach.

#### Charlotte

PortSwigger has a very friendly and open culture, which is very appealing to me. I was also really drawn to the support that's offered as part of the scholarship scheme.

## What would your superhero power be and why?

#### Charlotte

Definitely super speed! I could get work done a lot faster and save a lot of time on travel.

#### Lucy

I'd like to be able to shape shift into animals because there is at least one animal that has adapted to survive in pretty much every environment so I could adapt to every situation.

## Want to find out more?

To find out more about [PortSwigger's scholarship and internship schemes](https://portswigger.net/careers/women-in-tech-scholarship-scheme), and apply to be involved, visit our website. Applications are being accepted between 28 October '24, and 17 March '25, from women in year 13.
