[![Dynamic Malware Analysis](data:image/png;base64... "Dynamic Malware Analysis")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWgGAFHAjwAt9V6lkePfbupH_jKGmB9ls6rbwn5rZRueC0dOZdJB0n9j0AmUay7Jv33ck5TjCkMMiVGd-ku7Gusmg24UVjcg3aVXSpjxsbmXOQtQWbo2fj7CnAjlQABeiLLJgh5YdzFnaHWiJboj-eGCIx6bx117cXuDe1jaOWqRoBZC-UiRNeUKZflMo/s1800/tools.png)

Dynamic malware analysis is a key part of any threat investigation. It involves executing a sample of a malicious program in the isolated environment of a malware sandbox to monitor its behavior and gather actionable indicators. Effective analysis must be fast, in-depth, and precise. These five tools will help you achieve it with ease.

## 1. Interactivity

Having the ability to interact with the malware and the system in real-time is a great advantage when it comes to dynamic analysis. This way, you can not only observe its execution but also see how it responds to your inputs and triggers specific behaviors.

Plus, it saves time by allowing you to download samples hosted on file-sharing websites or open those packed inside an archive, which is a common way to deliver payloads to victims.

| The initial phishing email containing the malicious pdf and password for the archive |

Check out this [sandbox session](https://app.any.run/tasks/f58b4c9a-9819-4612-a411-627d08cc4709?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5-must-have-tools&utm_content=tasks1&utm_term=021024) in the [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5-must-have-tools&utm_content=landing&utm_term=021024) that shows how interactivity is used for analyzing the entire chain of attack, starting from a phishing email that contains a PDF attachment. The link inside the .pdf leads to a file-sharing website where a password-protected .zip is hosted.

The sandbox allows us not only to download the archive but also to enter the password (which can be found in the email) and extract its contents to run the malicious payload.

| You can manually enter a password to open protected archives in ANY.RUN |

After launching the executable file found inside the archive, the sandbox instantly detects that the system has been infected with AsyncRAT, a popular malware family used by attackers to remotely control victims' machines and steal sensitive data.

| ANY.RUN provides a conclusive verdict on every sample |

It adds corresponding tags to the interface and generates a report on the threat.

Analyze files and URLs in a private, real-time environment of the ANY.RUN sandbox.

## 2. Extraction of IOCs

Collecting relevant indicators of compromise (IOCs) is one of the main objectives of dynamic analysis. Detonating malware in a live environment forces it to expose its C2 server addresses, encryption keys, and other settings that ensure its functionality and communication with the attackers.

Although such data is often protected and obfuscated by malware developers, some sandbox solutions are equipped with advanced IOC collecting capabilities, making it easy to identify the malicious infrastructure.

| As part of each analysis session in ANY.RUN, you get a comprehensive IOC report |

In ANY.RUN, you can quickly gather a variety of indicators, including file hashes, malicious URLs, C2 connections, DNS requests, and more.
