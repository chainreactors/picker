In episode 60 of The AI Fix, we learn why Grok might be Elon Musk‚Äôs bid for digital immortality, how Meta is building a Manhattan-sized data centre called Prometheus, how AI is helping create carbon-sucking concrete, and are bewildered that 2000 people ‚Äúwork‚Äù at the Candy Crush company.

Plus Graham takes a look at Elon‚Äôs latest creations: a giggling anime girlfriend desperate for your attention, and a cute cartoon red panda who wants to bomb a synagogue and moon the rabbi.

Meanwhile Mark learns which AI is most likely to blackmail, lie, and ‚Äì when the mood takes it ‚Äì commit murder to avoid being switched off.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
