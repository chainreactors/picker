We have seen HTTP request smuggling attacks by modifying the Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding header. These methods exploit the execution of the headers on the client-side and server side. However, thereâ€™s also another way of performing this attack by using hop-to-hop headers. In this blog, we will discuss this technique in complete detail.

This requires intermediate proxy servers between the client and the main server. We will also briefly discuss server-side cache poisoning using the techniques mentioned above. This way of exploiting the server-side cache was found by Francesco Mariani and Jacopo Tediosi in a private bug bounty program of Akamai CDN.
