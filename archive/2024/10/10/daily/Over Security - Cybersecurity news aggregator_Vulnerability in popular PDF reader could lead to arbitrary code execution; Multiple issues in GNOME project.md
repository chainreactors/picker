# Vulnerability in popular PDF reader could lead to arbitrary code execution; Multiple issues in GNOME project

[Vulnerability Roundup](/category/vulnerability-roundup/)

Cisco Talos’ Vulnerability Research team recently disclosed six new security vulnerabilities across a range of software, including one in a popular PDF reader that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

Foxit PDF Reader, one of the most popular alternatives to Adobe Acrobat, contains a memory corruption vulnerability that could allow an adversary to execute code on the targeted machine.

Talos also discovered three vulnerabilities in Veertu’s Anka Build, a suite of software designed to test macOS or iOS applications in CI/CD environments.

For Snort coverage that can detect the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, download the latest rule sets from [Snort.org](https://snort.org/), and our latest Vulnerability Advisories are always posted on [Talos Intelligence’s website](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports).

# Use-after-free vulnerability in Foxit PDF Reader

*Discovered by KPC.*

A use-after-free vulnerability in Foxit PDF Reader could lead to memory corruption and eventually arbitrary code execution on the targeted machine.

[TALOS-2024-1967](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-1967) (CVE-2024-28888) can be triggered if an adversary tricks a user into opening a specially crafted PDF that contains malicious JavaScript. Exploitation could also occur if the targeted user visits an attacker-controlled website with the Foxit PDF Reader browser extension enabled.

# Multiple vulnerabilities in GNOME project library could lead to code execution

Two vulnerabilities in the G Structured File Library (libgsf) could lead to arbitrary code execution.

This GNOME project supports an abstraction layer around different structure file formats such as .tar and .zip.

[TALOS-2024-2068](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2068) (CVE-2024-36474) is an integer overflow vulnerability that could allow an out-of-bounds index to be used when reading and writing to an array. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an adversary exploited it appropriately.

[TALOS-2024-2069](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2069) (CVE-2024-42415) works similarly, but in this case, it arises when the software processes the sector allocation table.

An adversary could exploit both these vulnerabilities by tricking the targeted user into opening a malicious, specially crafted file.

# Three vulnerabilities in Veertu Anka Build

*Discovered by KPC.*

Veertu’s Anka Build software contains three vulnerabilities, two of which are directory traversal issues.

Anka Build is a suite of software designed to test macOS and iOS applications in CI/CD environments. The suite is a centralized dashboard for managing nodes, VM instances, templates, tags and logs.

This software contains two directory traversal vulnerabilities — [TALOS-2024-2059](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2059) (CVE-2024-41163) and [TALOS-2024-2061](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2061) (CVE-2024-41922) — that could lead to the disclosure of arbitrary files. An adversary could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending the target a specially crafted HTTP request.

Another vulnerability, [TALOS-2024-2060](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2024-2060) (CVE-2024-39755), is a privilege escalation issue that could allow a low-privileged user to force the software to update, potentially raising their access to that of a root user.
