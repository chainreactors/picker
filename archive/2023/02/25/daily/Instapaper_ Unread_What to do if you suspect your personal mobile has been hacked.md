# What to do if you suspect your personal mobile has been hacked

Have you given much thought to how secure your smartphone is? There are plenty of resources to help you with responding to a suspected compromised desktop PC or laptop. But what happens if you think your mobile has been breached? How would you know? What do you do?

In this blog, we’ll look at how you can minimise the impact of your personal mobile being compromised. Better still, we’ll cover ways to try and prevent it from happening in the first place. (For work devices, we recommend following your employer’s guidance.) We’ll follow NIST’s four-step [approach](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final) to security: identify; protect; detect and respond; and recover.

### What’s app? Check and protect what you value most

**Identify** the important apps or files on your mobile phone. (Do this before it’s been compromised.) What are the ‘crown jewels’ that, if you lost them, would cause major distress and impact you financially or personally? Write them down in a list. Once you’ve done so, think about the risk and impact to you if they were compromised. What would happen if you couldn’t access your emails, mobile phone wallet, or documents?

Your next steps are to mitigate the risks you’ve just noted. Think about making changes to how you use your mobile and its apps. This brings us to the next step, **protect**.

Keeping your phone’s software up to date reduces the risk of compromise.

* Enable automatic operating system (OS) updates so our phone always has the latest version
* Set the screen lock to a short period of time e.g., 3 minutes
* Disable notifications from appearing on your locked screen
* Only install apps from trusted sources like Apple App store or Google Play
* Install antivirus (AV), bought from a reputable provider (free AVs are available too)
* Use the VPN functionality of your AV app, or if the phone maker provides it
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) when available for apps like email, banking, social media, etc

Other measures you can take to reduce the impact of an incident include backing up files or photos. There are cloud services that provide this service for a minimal monthly fee. They’re easy to set up and work seamlessly with little impact to your mobile phone’s performance. To save space in your cloud backups, print photos that give you joy and delete ones that don’t.

*Connection trouble: review wireless networks your phone remembers*

Review the history list of Wi-Fi access points that your phone has connected to in the past. Remove obsolete and public networks. Disable the ‘connect to Wi-Fi automatically’ fe...
