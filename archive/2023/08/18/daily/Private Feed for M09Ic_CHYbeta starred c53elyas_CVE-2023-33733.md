# CODE INJECTION VULNERABILITY IN REPORTLAB PYTHON LIBRARY

**tl;dr** This write-up details how an RCE in Reportlab - was found and exploited. Due to the prevalence of Reportlab in HTML to PDF processing, this vulnerability may be reachable in many applications that process PDF files, making this an important one to patch and look out for.

# What is Reportlab
