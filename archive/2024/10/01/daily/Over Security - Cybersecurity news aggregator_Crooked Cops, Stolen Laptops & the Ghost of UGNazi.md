# Crooked Cops, Stolen Laptops & the Ghost of UGNazi

A California man accused of failing to pay taxes on tens of millions of dollars allegedly earned from cybercrime also paid local police officers hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him extort, intimidate and silence rivals and former business partners, the government alleges. KrebsOnSecurity has learned that many of the man’s alleged targets were members of **UGNazi**, a hacker group behind multiple high-profile breaches and cyberattacks back in 2012.

A federal [complaint](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.942083/gov.uscourts.cacd.942083.1.0.pdf) (PDF) filed last week said the **Federal Bureau of Investigation** (FBI) has been investigating Los Angeles resident **Adam Iza**. Also known as “**Assad Faiq”** and “**The Godfather**,” Iza is the founder of a cryptocurrency investment platform called **Zort** that advertised the ability to make smart trades based on artificial intelligence technology.

But the feds say investors in Zort soon lost their shorts, after Iza and his girlfriend began spending those investments on Lamborghinis, expensive jewelry, vacations, a $28 million home in Bel Air, even cosmetic surgery to extend the length of his legs.

The complaint states the FBI started looking at Iza after receiving multiple reports that he had on his payroll several active deputies with the **Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department** (LASD). Iza’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The complaint cites a letter from an attorney for a victim referenced only as “**E.Z.**,” who was seeking help related to an extortion and robbery allegedly committed by Iza. The government says that in March 2022, three men showed up at E.Z.’s home, and tried to steal his laptop in an effort to gain access to E.Z. cryptocurrency holdings online. A police report referenced in the complaint says three intruders were scared off when E.Z. fired several handgun rounds in the direction of his assailants.

The FBI later obtained a copy of a search warrant executed by LASD deputies in January 2022 for GPS location information on a phone belonging to E.Z., which shows an LASD deputy unlawfully added E.Z.’s mobile number to a list of those associated with an unrelated firearms investigation.

“Damn my guy actually filed the warrant,” Iza allegedly texted someone after the location warrant was entered. “That’s some serious shit to do for someone….risking a 24 years career. I pay him 280k a month for complete resources. They’re active-duty.”

The FBI alleges LASD officers had on several previous occasions tried to kidnap and extort E.Z. at Iza’s behest. The complaint references a November 2021 incident wherein Iza and E.Z. were in a car together when Iza asked to stop and get snacks at a convenience store. While they were still standing next to the car, a van with several armed LASD deputies showed up and tried to force E.Z. to hand over his phone. E.Z. escaped unharmed, and alerted 911.

E.Z. appears to be short for **Enzo Zelocchi**, a self-described “[actor](https://www.instagram.com/enzozelocchi/)” who was featured in [an ABC News story](https://abc7.com/home-invasion-west-los-angeles-beverly-grove-armed-suspects/11692751/) about a home invasion in Los Angeles around that same time as the March 2022 home invasion, in which Zelocchi is quoted as saying at least two men tried to rob him at gunpoint (we’ll revisit Zelocchi’s acting credits in a moment).

The criminal complaint makes frequent references to a co-conspirator of Iza (“CC-1”) — his girlfriend at the time — who allegedly helped Iza run his businesses and spend the millions plunked down by Zort investors. We know what E.Z. stands for because Iza’s girlfriend then was a woman named **Iris Au**, and in November 2022 she [sued Zelocchi for allegedly stealing Iza’s laptop.](https://www.tmz.com/2022/11/13/actor-enzo-zelocchi-sued-extortion-stolen-laptop-bitcoin-wallet-password/)

The complaint says Iza also harassed a man identified only as **T.W**., and refers to T.W. as one of two Americans currently incarcerated in the Philippines for murder. In December 2018, a then 21-year-old **Troy Woody Jr.** was arrested in Manila after he was spotted dumping the body of his dead girlfriend **Tomi Masters** into a local river.

Woody is accused of murdering Masters with the help of his best friend and roommate at the time: **Mir Islam**, a.k.a. “**JoshTheGod**,” referred to in the Iza complaint as “M.I.” Islam and Woody were both core members of UGNazi, a hacker collective that sprang up in 2012 and claimed credit for hacking and attacking a number of high-profile websites.

In June 2016, Islam [was sentenced to a year in prison](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/07/serial-swatter-stalker-and-doxer-mir-islam-gets-just-1-year-in-jail/) for an impressive array of crimes, including stalking people online and posting their personal data on the Internet. Islam also pleaded guilty to reporting dozens of phony bomb threats and fake hostage situations at the homes of celebrities and public officials (Islam participated in [a swatting attack against this author in 2013](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/the-world-has-no-room-for-cowards/)).

Troy Woody Jr. (left) and Mir Islam, are currently in prison in the Philippines for murder.

In December 2022, Troy Woody Jr. sued Iza, Zelocchi and Zort, [alleging](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/woodyvzort.pdf) (PDF) Iza and Zelocchi were involved in a 2018 home invasion at his residence, wherein Woody claimed his assailants stole laptops and phones containing *more than $200 million in cryptocurrencies*.

Woody’s complaint states that Masters also was present during his 2018 home invasion, as was another core UGNazi member: **Eric “CosmoTheGod” Taylor**. CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers set up the Web site [exposed[dot]su](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/credit-reports-sold-for-cheap-in-the-underweb/), which published the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information of public figures, including the former **First Lady Michelle Obama**, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed.

Exposed was built with the help of identity information obtained and/or stolen from ssndob dot ru.

In 2017, Taylor was [sentenced to three years probation](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/men-who-sent-swat-team-heroin-to-my-home-sentenced/) for participating in multiple swatting attacks, including the [one against my home in 2013](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/the-world-has-no-room-for-cowards/).

The complaint against Iza says the FBI interviewed Woody in Manila where he is currently incarcerated, and learned that I...
