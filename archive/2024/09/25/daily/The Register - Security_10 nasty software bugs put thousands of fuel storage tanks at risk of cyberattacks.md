Tens of thousands of fuel storage tanks in critical infrastructure facilities remain vulnerable to zero-day attacks due to buggy Automatic Tank Gauge systems from multiple vendors, say infosec researchers.

Automatic Tank Gauges (ATGs) are used to monitor fuel levels in storage tanks and ensure that the tanks don't leak. The ten CVEs [disclosed today](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/09/24/cisa-releases-eight-industrial-control-systems-advisories) were found in products from several different vendors: Dover Fueling Solutions (DFS), OPW Fuel Management Systems (owned by DFS), Franklin Fueling Systems, and OMNTEC.

Seven are rated critical, and all of them allow for full administrator privileges of the device application, according to Bitsight, which [found](https://www.bitsight.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-discovered-automated-tank-gauge-systems) the flaws and reported them to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) six months ago. Three of the buggy products still don't have a fix.
