# A new home for Tor user documentation

Privacy technology is only as powerful as people's ability to use it. Every day, millions of people rely on Tor to protect their privacy and freedom online. But until now, finding answers to their questions meant navigating between different websites: one for the Tor Browser Manual, another for the Support portal. This fragmented experience made it harder to navigate and maintain.

That's why we've been working to simplify how people find help using Tor.

### One home for all user documentation

Today, we're launching the new [Support portal](https://support.torproject.org). Everything now lives under one roof. You can now find all user-facing documentation in one place: clearer, better organized, and easier to read on both desktop and mobile. After this migration, tb-manual.torproject.org will redirect automatically to the new portal.

Our goal is simple: to make sure Tor users everywhere can easily find the information they need, without jumping between different websites.

And don't worry, documentation for other parts of the Tor ecosystem remains available where it belongs:

* Tails documentation remains available at [Tails website](https://tails.net).
* Guides for [relay operators](https://community.torproject.org/relay/), [digital security trainers](https://community.torproject.org/training/), [translators](https://community.torproject.org/localization/), and [user researchers](https://community.torproject.org/user-research/) continue to live on the [Community portal](https://community.torproject.org).

### Help us translate the new Support portal

We are a global community, and it's crucial that our tools and portals are available in every language. Volunteers from all around the world help us with this translation work. Because we've restructured and updated much of the content, the new portal needs fresh translations.

At the moment the Support portal is available in these languages:
Spanish, Farsi, German, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Japanese, Arabic, and Simplified Chinese.

If you'd like to help make Tor documentation available in your language, please contribute through our project in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tor/new-support-portal/). If you're new to translating Tor, follow our [Becoming a Tor translator](https://community.torproject.org/localization/becoming-tor-translator/) guide to get started.

### A community effort

This new portal is the result of collaboration across multiple Tor teams - UX, Community, Sysadmin and the work of [Sutty](https://sutty.coop.ar/). Based on Torâs designs for the new support site, Sutty built a reusable component library. This modular approach has made the system easier to maintain, extend, and adapt to future needs. This lays a strong foundation for new, future websites.

> > *"This collaboration-with Tor and through working with a static site generator similar to Jekyll, which we specialize in-has also helped us refine our own tooling. In addition, working and contributing to Tor, an organization that has long inspired a vision of a more private internet, represents a proud milestone for us as a worker-owned coop."*

We believe that privacy should be accessible to everyone. And the more people who use privacy tools, the stronger privacy becomes for all of us. Every improvement to our documentation helps more people understand, use, and trust Tor. We hope this new Support portal makes it easier for users everywhere to find the answers they need - and to feel part of a global community working for privacy and freedom online.
