With the words *"We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests."* [OpenAI published his LLM](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and made it available for everyone. This was just 7 months ago!

In April 2023 christian.klein2 stated:
> “We are in advanced stages to apply **generative AI** across our portfolio, and we are working as an early release partner of **OpenAI** and together with other vendors. We are planning to announce new disruptive **AI** use cases.”
>
> Christian Klein – CEO, **SAP SE**, 21 April 2023"

I recognized this topic working at SAP and within the SAP Community. I checked the 10 most liked blogs within the first half year of 2023 including ChatGPT, OpenAI or LLMs. Surprisingly only 4 from 10 (12) are from SAP here:

***Fig 1: Top 10 ChatGPT or LLM blogs from first half of 2023***

As we already heard about possible solutions including this technology, let's explore what is the interesting point for the authors going in such a direction.

Before giving an overview of the blogs, let's start with a understanding of the relevant concepts. I got this definitions by asking ChatGPT:

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/07/LLM2-2.jpg)

***Fig 2: Definitions in the context of ChatGPT***

What are the top 10 blogs about:

1. In **"[ChatGPT Integration with SAP S/4HANA](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/07/chatgpt-integration-with-sap-s-4hana/)"** author sudip.ghosh4 goes beyond ABAP. He integrated S/4HANA with Azure Logic App to build a very service oriented way to communicate with S/4HANA via mail using information extraction. While he shows how easy it could be to create value with ChatGPT, on the other side a lot of concerns about security and GDPR are discussed. And reading the comments I learned about the [SAP AI Playground](https://ai-playground.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/index.html) ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@ACD7EA91588099437A7ECEEAAE5D5B40/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

2. In **"[ChatGPT for SAP developments – threat or an opportunity?](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/15/chatgpt-for-sap-developments-threat-or-an-opportunity/)"** author m-skrzyniarz discussed what ChatGPT is and how SAP developers are affected. He shows by example how to work with ChatGPT as a developer. while the output is not perfect, the speed of generating results was very impressiv. So one insight is "The sooner you start using ChatGPT, the better it’ll be for you."

3. In the series of 3 blogs about **"[A ChatGPT-like chat app built with modern SAP technologies (CAP, SAPUI5)](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/22/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-1-2/)**", author mike\_za shows his passion in developing by explain the high level concepts of building a chat app with modern SAP technologies and ChatGPT, showing demos and giving access to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/p36-io/cap-ui5-gpt-chat). While giving a comprehensive explanation about how ChatGPT and the OpenAI API works he higlights that there are also a lot of potential beyond chat applications. Harrr! He goes deeper into the development with SAP CAP and SAP UI5 in [part 2](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/24/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-2-3/) and [part 3](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/27/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-3-3/).

4. In **"[Using OpenAI Models in SAP Build Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/02/using-openai-models-in-sap-build-apps/)"** author kirill\_l shows on the other side using ChatGPT from a no code application. An approach enabling custom intelligent applications for a broad range of users. Clear and easy to follow and to try on your own.

5. In **"[Chatp GPT, help me refactor my class](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/chatp-gpt-help-me-refactor-my-class/)"** autor enno.wulff is getting very specific about how ChatGPT can help developers in refactoring code. He described his experience with code generation showing strenghts and weaknesses similar to the 2nd blog but dived deeper in a journey. Similarly he was very impressed how helpful AI could be as a assisting tool.

6. In **"[Harnessing the Power of ChatGPT and SAP HANA Cloud for Next-level Data Analytics](https://blo...
