## Mary Queen of Scots Letters Decrypted

[This](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64569883) [is](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64568222) [a](https://www.courthousenews.com/codebreakers-crack-secret-contents-of-letters-from-mary-queen-of-scots/) neat piece of historical research.

> The team of computer scientist George Lasry, pianist Norbert Biermann and astrophysicist Satoshi Tomokiyo—all keen cryptographers—initially thought the batch of encoded documents related to Italy, because that was how they were filed at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.
>
> However, they quickly realised the letters were in French. Many verb and adjectival forms being feminine, regular mention of captivity, and recurring names—such as Walsingham—all put them on the trail of Mary. Sir Francis Walsingham was Queen Elizabeth’s spymaster.
>
> The code was a simple replacement system in which symbols stand either for letters, or for common words and names. But it would still have taken centuries to crunch all the possibilities, so the team used an algorithm that homed in on likely solutions.

@ Bruce,

Whilst they might well be “Mary Queen” of Scots’s –rightfull heir to the throne– letters the provinence has not yet been proven.

That said they are fairly hundrum letters of often little more than an administrative nature, suggesting she had reason to think Wallsingham was intercepting her mail. But the number and range of names mentioned within suggests it’s very unlikely they are fakes, unless drawn up by a real expert in the field..

@Clive, All

re:  *Historical diplomatic correspondence provenance*

Eons ago, I read a historical account of diplomatic correspondence at the time of the American Civil War (1860s). It was translated and the account followed the reporting to one of the Courts of Europe about the activities, catastrophes and victories of the US War.

Being that it was a more scholarly work of non-fiction, I never questioned the authenticity of the reports as there were facsimiles of the documents, along with the translations printed in the book.

Forward about 40 years, and I read there are all sorts of academic, historical and cultural challenges to that particular period of US History and books written about that period. There were many claims that such books were (fill in the blank) inaccurate.

I don’t know for certain if the book I read at the time, was part of the tranche of suspect works. I would like to think it was not. It did make me more cynical about non-fiction and historical reports. Not just that they might have gotten a particular translation incorrect, or missed an important reference but that such works are used to deceptively mislead readers about historical events. Beyond the normally expected “The Victor writes the History”, but intended to do greater damage and inflict view points that maybe harmful, bigoted, intolerant and of dubious value.

Governments are more than capable of getting academics to write such works. The excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution (mostly now repudiated) are shocking enough. To envision that the same behavior from the US Government to influence in academia, was even more shocking to me.

That *is* really fun research!

A note to self: 1) plotting is risky, especially against reigning monarchs, even if it’s your cousin 2) spymasters are going to spy; also they may recruit moles in places like the French embassy.

God bless Mary, Queen of Scots. It would be tough to ascend to the throne at six days of age.

It’s wild that the incriminating message that really threw Mary on the wrong side of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth, was encrypted by an even less complex cipher than the one unravelled in this excellent research.

(The Babington Plot message only used a monoalphabetic substitution cipher with a small nomenclature.)

The cipher used to encrypt these recently discovered messages – a homophonic cipher with a nomenclature – is really fun to examine. You can see the complete reconstruction of the Mary-Castelnau cipher in Figures 13 and 14 of the paper. It has 219 distinct graphical symbols.

It’s fascinating how the researchers break the ciphertext down with a computer algorithm and contextual analysis. Looking at the key now, the cipher doesn’t seem absolutely preposterously complex, but it’s really fun and clever.

Solving those kinds of mysteries could be addictive!

@Ted, All

A few tidbits or bread crumbs…

Mary of Scotland, was Queen of France before she was Queen of Scotland.

Henry II of France was married to Catherine de’ Medici, and it was their son, The Dauphin Francis II of France that married Mary of Scotland. When Mary of Scotland married Francis II of France, he became King consort of Scotland.

After he died, Catherine de’ Medici remained as Regent and Mary returned to Scotland.

There is a beautiful place in the Loire Valley: Château de Chenonceau where Mary and many other powerful people of their time lived. Mary’s Scots guards carved their names on the chapel wall there.

If you ever have a chance to visit this Chateau, inside the walls, much of modern Europe was laid down, the rooms where Mary lived, the plans of Catherine de’ Medici, and the schemes of many nations evolved. The wars between Catholics and Protestants fomented and spread across Europe and England and remain as scars on many societies.

So much beauty, generated so much hatred.
