# OdinLdr

[![Draugr](/NtDallas/OdinLdr/raw/main/img/odin.png)](/NtDallas/OdinLdr/blob/main/img/odin.png)

Cobaltstrike UDRL for beacon and post-ex tools.

Use NtApi call with synthetic stackframe to confuse EDR based on stackframe detection.

# Beacon

Use BeaconUserData structure to give memory information to beacon and allocate memory for BOF & Sleepmask.

This UDRL allocate memory region in RW for beacon, copy virtual beacon and patch IAT/reloc then correct memory protection is set for each section.

All virtual beacon section is set to TRUE for MASK\_TRUE in ALLOCATED\_MEMORY structure (BeaconUserData).

Somes post-ex tools of cobaltstrike (powerpick, execute-assembly, mimikatz, ...) is reflective dll and need custom reflective loader to be more opsec.

The loader is same to beacon at the exception to the rdata section is in RW and not read only.
