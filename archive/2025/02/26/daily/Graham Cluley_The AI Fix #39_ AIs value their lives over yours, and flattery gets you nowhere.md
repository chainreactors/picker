In episode 39 of the AI Fix, our hosts watch a drone and a robot dog shoot fireworks at each other, xAI launches Grok 3, Mark explains that AIs can design genomes now, a robot starts a punch up, Zuck becomes a mind reader, an AI cracks a ten-year science question in two days, and an anatomically accurate synthetic human recreates a terrifying scene from The Long Good Friday.

Graham learns that it always pays to be polite before running over 15 people with a train, and Mark discovers why AIs value some lives more than others, particularly their own.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
