According to W3Techs, [43.2% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) on the internet use WordPress. And of all websites that use a CMS (Content Management System) more than half ([64%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress)) leverage WordPress to power their blog or website. Unfortunately, since WordPress has such a large market share it has also become a prime target for attackers.

You might be wondering whether WordPress is safe to use. And the short answer is **yes** — WordPress core is safe to use, but only if you maintain it to the latest version and employ some additional protections on the [admin login page](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/10/how-to-secure-the-wordpress-login-page.html).

With every plugin or theme that you add to the environment, you introduce more risk to your environment. So, there are a number of important steps you’ll want to take to ensure that your WordPress website is safe from threats and known vulnerabilities.

In this post, I’ll be breaking down the WordPress ecosystem along with some security best practices to help you understand whether WordPress is safe and how to protect your site from attacks.

## What is WordPress?

WordPress is one of the simplest and most popular ways to create a blog or website. Licensed under GPLv2 and written in PHP, WordPress is an open-source content management system. That means literally anyone can use or modify WordPress for free.

Since WordPress has made building websites and blogs a simple code-less experience, it is widely used and has gained massive popularity over the years. It allows website owners to easily manage and update content, images, and website designs without needing to know much at all about programming. Furthermore, its extensive plugin and theme library makes it easy to add new design options and functionality to any WordPress website.

Some examples of sites built with WordPress include:

* **E-commerce** —E-commerce websites or online stores allow visitors to purchase goods and services online. They use online payment systems to facilitate transactions, which are often installed in the form of a WordPress plugin.
* **Blogs** — Blogs share topical information or knowledge and typically display most recently published content first. Blogs can be used to rank for specific keywords or terms and might be devoted to sharing photos, reviews, tutorials, recipes. There are a wide range of different WordPress plugins and themes that can help you create the perfect blog space.
* **Portfolios** — A portfolio site can be used to showcase your creative designs, web designs, photographs, and other assets.
* **Businesses** — Business websites provide general information about a company or service. WordPress makes it easy for small businesses to launch their online presence and create a platform for potential customers to contact, obtain quotes, find social media or marketing campaigns, and obtain general information.
* **Forums** — WordPress makes it easy for site owners to create forum platforms where users can ask questions, share experiences, and offer advice.

These are only a small handful of examples of sites you can build with WordPress.

## Is WordPress core secure?

In short, **yes** — WordPress core is secure, but *only* if you maintain it to the latest version.

WordPress is an open source software that’s maintained by a world-class team of security experts. Since the code base is publicly accessible, anyone can review and analyze it. Whenever a bug or security issue is reported by the open-source community, it is [updated](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/) to patch the issue.

But at the time of writing, only [60% of WordPress sites are using the latest version](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) of WordPress. That means the other **40%** of outdated sites are at risk of hackers targeting known vulnerabilities.

And while minor updates can be automatically update...
