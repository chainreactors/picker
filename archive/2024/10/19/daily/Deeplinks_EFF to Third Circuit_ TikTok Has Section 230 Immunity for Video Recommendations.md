*UPDATE: On October 23, 2024, the Third Circuit denied TikTok's petition for rehearing en banc.*

*EFF legal intern* *Nick Delehanty was the principal author of this post.*

EFF filed an [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/document/2024-10-07-anderson-v-tiktok-3d-cir-amicus-brief) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in support of TikTok’s request that the full court reconsider the case *[Anderson v. TikTok](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12456011132100148839)* after a three-judge panel ruled that Section 230 immunity doesn’t apply to TikTok’s recommendations of users’ videos. We argued that the panel was incorrect on the law, and this case has wide-ranging implications for the internet as we know it today. EFF was joined on the brief with Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), Public Knowledge, Reason Foundation, and Wikimedia Foundation.

At issue is the panel’s misapplication of First Amendment precedent. The First Amendment [protects the editorial decisions](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/platforms-have-first-amendment-right-curate-speech-weve-long-argued-supreme-1) of publishers about whether and how to display content, such as the videos TikTok displays to users through its recommendation algorithm.
