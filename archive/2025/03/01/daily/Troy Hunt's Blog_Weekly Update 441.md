# Weekly Update 441

28 February 2025

Processing data breaches (especially big ones), can be *extremely* laborious. And, of course, everyone commenting on them is an expert, so there's a heap of opinions out there. And so it was with the latest stealer logs, a corpus of data that took the better part of a month to process. And then I made things confusing in various ways which led to both Disqus comment and ticket hell. But hey, it's finally out and now it's back to normal breach processing for the foreseeable future ðŸ™‚
