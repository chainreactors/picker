EFF, along with the ACLU and the ACLU of Mississippi, filed an amicus brief on Thursday asking a federal appellate court to continue to block Mississippi’s HB 1126—a bill that imposes age verification mandates on social media services across the internet.

Our [friend-of-the-court brief](https://www.eff.org/document/netchoice-llc-v-lynn-fitch-eff-amicus-fifth-circuit), filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, argues that HB 1126 is “an extraordinary censorship law that violates all internet users’ First Amendment rights to speak and to access protected speech” online.

HB 1126 forces social media sites to verify the age of every user and requires minors to get explicit parental consent before accessing online spaces. It also pressures them to monitor and censor content  on broad, vaguely defined topics—many of which involve constitutionally protected speech. These sweeping provisions create significant barriers to the free and open internet and “force adults and minors alike to sacrifice anonymity, privacy, and security to engage in protected online expression.” A federal district court [already prevented](https://www.eff.org/ko/deeplinks/2024/06/mississippi-cant-wall-everyones-social-media-access-protect-children) HB 1126 from going into effect, ruling that it likely violated the First Amendment.
