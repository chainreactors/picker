I found if you click on the setup file again the program will come up and show as registered. Very unusual way to start the program.

Yes, I had same problem. I registered before actually inputting gmail and google password. I am wary about the whole thing since there are 20 ups and yet only people comment, with no solution to the stated problem. I've never ever had a problem with anything from GOTD in over 15 years of using, so everything is probably all good. Still, I think I am going to look for any change on laptop after I ran the program and delete. I might be too paranoid, but...

I got stuck on step 3 as On the âSigning in to Googleâ panel, choose App passwords, there is no option to choose App passwords. Disappointing as this would have come in handy.

I've run SETUP.EXE and registered, but once I close the app - WHERE IS IT?
No icon on desktop, nothing in "Installed Apps", searching for GmailExtractor finds no .exe or anything (just the downloaded files and links to them).

CONFUSED!
