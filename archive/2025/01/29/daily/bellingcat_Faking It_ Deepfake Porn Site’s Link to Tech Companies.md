*Warning: This article discusses non-consensual sexually explicit content from the start.*

The graphic images claim to show Patrizia Schlosser, an investigative reporter from Germany. She’s depicted naked and in chains.

“At first I was shocked and ashamed – even though I know the pictures aren’t real,” said Schlosser, who believes that she may have been targeted because of her reporting on sexualised violence against women.

“But then I thought: no, I shouldn’t just keep quiet, I should fight back.”

Schlosser decided to [track down the man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=e2_Nvgmz8vI) who posted the doctored photos of her to a deepfake pornographic website. “At first I had the same impulse as many other victims: it’s not worth it, you’re powerless,” she said.

“But it turns out that we are not.”

*Journalist Patrizia Schlosser spoke to Bellingcat about discovering more than 30 pornographic images of herself on the website MrDeepFakes. The non-consensual photos, in an album titled “sluty funk wh\*\*e”, were removed earlier this month.*

Schlosser, like a growing number of women, is a victim of non-consensual deepfake technology, which uses artificial intelligence to create sexually explicit images and videos. Actresses, musicians and politicians have been targeted.

But it’s not only celebrities whose images have been used without their consent – it is now possible to create hardcore pornography featuring the facial likeness of anyone with just a single photo. Many non-public figures have been impacted, including in the [UK](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/child-abuse-deepfake-images-schools-w37xgx298), the [US](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-high-school-laws.html) and [South Korea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdlpj9zn9go).

The most notorious marketplace in the deepfake porn economy is MrDeepFakes, a website that hosts tens of thousands of videos and images, has close to 650,000 members, and receives millions of visits a month.

According to an analysis by our publishing partner STRG\_F, the explicit content posted to MrDeepFakes has been viewed almost two billion times. The album claiming to show Schlosser – which included photos with men and animals – was online for almost two years.

The MrDeepFakes website contains no information about who is behind the operation, and its administrators appear to have gone to great lengths to keep their identities secret. Since its inception, the site’s hosting providers have bounced around the globe.

Its financial operations also point to a calculated effort to obscure ownership. Premium memberships can be bought with cryptocurrency via a system that uses a new address for each transaction, making it virtually impossible to track the beneficial owners. Transactions through PayPal, intermittently available on the site, link to numerous accounts under unverifiable names.

While it has not yet been possible to uncover who is behind MrDeepfakes, the website reveals some clues about two independent apps that have been prominently advertised on the site. One leads back to a Chinese fintech firm that conducts business globally and is traded on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The other is owned by a Maltese company led by the co-founder of a major Australian pet-sitting platform.

## Deepswap

Deepswap AI is permanently linked on the top bar of the MrDeepFakes website. It is a tool that allows users to create lifelike deepfake photos and videos for US$9.99 per month. Pop-up ads for the app on MrDeepFakes have included images and videos captioned with “Deepfake anyone you want” and “Make AI porn in a sec”. The app’s website says it is “redefining the face swap industry” and a series of five star reviews – attributed to users with the same name but different profile pictures – praise the app for its ease of use.

*The Deepswap app is prominently featured on the MrDeepFakes website.*

The website contains no obvious information about the people or businesses behind it. However, its privacy policy says the app is maintained in Hong Kong. A Google search for mentions of “Hong Kong” on the site returns a company information page along with contact details. The company, called Deep Creation Limited, is based in a high-rise building in central Hong Kong.

Deepswap’s website linked to apps on both the Google Play and Apple stores. DeepSwap PRO was advertised on the Google Play Store until last week, where it had been downloaded more than 10,000 times. In response to questions from Bellingcat, a Google spokesman said the app was “suspended and no longer available”. The app’s developer was listed as an entity called Meta Way.

The Deepswap app is no longer available on the Apple Store. The app currently linked to the Apple Store from Deepswap’s website is described as an AI-powered “personal outfit gallery”.
