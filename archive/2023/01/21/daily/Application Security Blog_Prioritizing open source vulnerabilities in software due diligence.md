A vulnerability is a software bug that hackers can exploit to attack an application. Ideally, software is written so as to proactively thwart the efforts of bad actors, but that is often not the case. With the heightened sensitivity to cybersecurity in general, and in merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in particular, understanding how vulnerable software assets are is an important component of software due diligence.

## Zero vulnerabilities: A pipe dream

That said, in modern software applications, there will never be a state of “zero vulnerabilities.” When evaluating the software quality of a potential acquisition target’s software, this is a very important point to remember. However, this is not a recommendation to ignore vulnerabilities or an excuse for vulnerable applications. Rather, it is meant to underscore the importance of arming yourself with the information needed to effectively understand which vulnerabilities present the biggest threats and how to prioritize remediation.

Vulnerabilities do not all present equal risk. Some might be exploited remotely, and some might have no proven exploit at all. Some vulnerabilities might be found in code called directly by an application, while others exist in a library that never makes it to production. Some might have easy, one-click fixes, while others require dozens of development hours to patch. The ability to confidently understand the particulars of a vulnerability is the key to understanding how it impacts an application, its users, and the data it handles.

## Obtaining the “so what?” of vulnerability reports

While I might have made the process sound simple, there is nothing simple about it. It can be difficult to understand all the aspects of a vulnerability, and most organizations don’t have the in-house expertise or resources to do so. This...
