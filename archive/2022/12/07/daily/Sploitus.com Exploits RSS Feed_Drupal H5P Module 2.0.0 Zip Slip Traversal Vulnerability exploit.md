------------------------------------------------------------------
Drupal H5P Module <= 2.0.0 (isValidPackage) Zip Slip Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

https://www.drupal.org/project/h5p

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.0.0-alpha2 and prior versions.
Version 7.x-1.50 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located within the H5PValidator::isValidPackage()
method. This implements the following check in order to skip any file or
folder starting with a dot or underscore within the uploaded h5p
archive:

891.  $fileName = $zip->statIndex($i)['name'];
892.
893.  if (preg_match('/(^[\._]|\/[\._])/', $fileName) !== 0) {
894.    continue; // Skip any file or folder starting with a . or _
894.  }

This regex check should be enough to prevent path traversal attacks
through zipped filenames (Zip Slip attacks), because it checks for the
string “/.” within the filename, thus preventing directory traversal
attacks. However, the vulnerability exists if Drupal is running on a
Windows server, because in this case the attacker can provide a
malicious h5p archive containing a filename with path traversal
sequences like “..\..\..”, which would bypass the above regex check.
This can be exploited to write (or overwrite) semi-arbitrary files in
the file system via directory traversal sequences, potentially leading
to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other kind of attacks.

[-] Solution:

No official solution is currently available.
