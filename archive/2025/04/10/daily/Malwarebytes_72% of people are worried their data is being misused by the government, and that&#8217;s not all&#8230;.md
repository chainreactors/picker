# 72% of people are worried their data is being misused by the government, and that’s not all…

Posted: April 9, 2025

Bad vibes are big news in privacy right now, with the public feeling isolated in securing their [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from companies, governments, [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) models, and scammers.

That’s the latest from Malwarebytes research conducted this month, which revealed that the vast majority of people are concerned about wrongful data access from nearly every corner of their lives. For example, 89% of people “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that they are “concerned about my personal data being used inappropriately by corporations,” and another 72% agreed or strongly agreed that they are “concerned about my personal data being accessed and used inappropriately by the government.”

The anxieties are easy to trace.

In just the first three months of 2025, the UK government asked Apple for access to encrypted [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) storage for users across the *globe*, the US government [exposed active Social Security Numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/personal-data-revealed-in-released-jfk-files) in releasing files related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, and the announced bankruptcy of genetic testing company 23andMe prompted many customers to [delete their data](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/23andme-bankruptcy-how-to-delete-your-data-and-stay-safe-from-the-2023-breach).

Against this backdrop, many users are taking privacy into their own hands. More than 40% of people have stopped using either TikTok, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter), and 26% stopped using a fertility or period tracking app. A robust 75% said they “opt out of data collection, as possible,” and 23% have gone a step further, using a [data removal service](https://www.malwarebytes.com/personal-data-remover) to help clean up any personal information that is easily found online.

These findings come from a pulse survey that Malwarebytes conducted of its newsletter readers in March via the Alchemer Survey Platform.

Broadly, Malwarebytes found that:

* 89% of people are “concerned about my data being used by AI tools without my consent.”
* 70% of people “feel resigned that my personal data is already out there, and I can’t get it back.”
* 77% of people said that “many online transactions today, from purchases to downloads to creating new accounts, feel like ploys to take my data.”
* While 87% of people “support national laws regulating how companies can collect, store, share, or use our personal data,” 60% feel that “we will never have simple, meaningful ways to protect our data.”
* To protect their personal information and that of their family, at least 40% of people have stopped using Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter).
* 26% of people stopped using a fertility app or period tracking app.

## **Institutional distrust**

The public believe that the biggest threats to their privacy right now are AI models, companies, governments, and, well, pretty much every single interaction they have with the internet at large.

Aside from the 89% of people concerned about their data being “accessed and used ina...
