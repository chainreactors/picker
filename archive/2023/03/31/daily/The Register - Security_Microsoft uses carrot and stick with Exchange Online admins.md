## If you need extra time to dump RPS, OK, but email from unsupported Exchange servers is blocked till they’re up to date

Some Exchange Online users who have the RPS feature turned off by Microsoft can now have it re-enabled – at least until September when the tool is retired.

Microsoft is moving all of its Exchange Online tenants from the legacy – and increasingly insecure – Remote PowerShell Protocol to the PowerShell v3 module. The [first step](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/08/microsoft_powershell_security/) comes April 1, when Redmond begins blocking RPS connections for tenants created on or after April Fool's Day.

In June, Microsoft will begin disabling it for all Exchange Online customers. The RPS Module will be retired September 1 and all tenants will be turned off by October 1. However, for enterprises, the changeover is more than simply flipping a switch, so Microsoft is giving users a way to buy more time.
