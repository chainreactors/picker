# Macs targeted by infostealers in new era of cyberthreats

Posted: February 19, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

The latest, major threats to Mac computers can steal passwords and credit card details with delicate precision, targeting victims across the internet based on their device, location, and operating system.

These are the dangers of “infostealers,” which have long plagued Windows devices but, in the past two years, have become a serious threat for Mac owners. And in 2024, one malicious program in particular is responsible for the lion’s share of infostealer activity—racking up 70% of known infostealer detections on Mac.

These findings come from the [2025 State of Malware report](https://www.threatdown.com/dl-state-of-malware-2025/). While many of the threats detailed in the report target companies and businesses, this latest wave of infostealers makes no distinction between Mac computers in an office and Mac computers at home. Unlike [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware), which is deployed against large businesses that cybercriminals hope can pay hefty ransoms, infostealers can deliver illicit gains no matter the target.

With the right cybersecurity practices, everyday Mac users can stay safe from these emerging threats.

## **The threat of infostealers**

“Infostealers” are a type of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that do exactly as they say—they steal information from people’s devices. But the variety of information that these pieces of malware can steal makes them particularly dangerous.

With stolen credit card details, hackers can attempt fraudulent purchases online. With stolen passwords, the impact is even broader; hackers could wire funds from a breached online banking account into their own, or masquerade as someone on social media to ask friends and family for money. Some infostealers don’t even require an additional step—they can take [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) directly from a victim’s online accounts.

But there is another threat to infostealers that comes from their recent history. They are wildly adaptable.

In 2016, Malwarebytes first discovered an infostealer called [TrickBot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trickbot) that, when implanted on a person’s device, would steal online banking credentials. But over time, the developers behind TrickBot began adding alarming new features, including the capabilities to steal Outlook credentials, disable Windows Defender, and even to download and deliver additional, separate malware onto infected devices.

By 2018, TrickBot was the [largest threat to businesses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2018/11/trickbot-takes-top-business-threat).

Now, in 2025, another infostealer is raising red flags all across cyberspace, and this time, it isn’t interested in Windows devices.

## **The next Mac malware**

Malware is “malicious software,” and just like legitimate software, malware has to be developed for specific operating systems. That means that, for instance, ransomware that works on a Windows laptop doesn’t automatically work on a Mac laptop, and likewise, a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) app developed for [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) devices doesn’t work on iPhones.

For years, then, a great deal of malware activity has focused on Windows devices. The common cybercriminal calculus was that, if there were more Win...
