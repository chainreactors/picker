Cyber threats and attacks like ransomware continue to increase in volume and complexity with the endpoint typically being the most sought after and valued target. With the rapid expansion and adoption of AI, it is more critical than ever to ensure the endpoint is adequately secured by a platform capable of not just keeping pace, but staying ahead of an ever-evolving threat landscape.

SentinelOne's steadfast commitment to delivering AI-powered cybersecurity enables global customers and partners to achieve resiliency and reduce risk with real-time, autonomous protection across the entire enterprise — all from a single agent and console with a robust, rigorously tested platform that keeps the customer in control.

Cybersecurity today isn't just about detection—it's about operational continuity under pressure. For example, endpoint solutions must account for encrypted traffic inspection, policy enforcement during identity compromise, and fast containment across distributed environments. These capabilities are especially critical in industries like healthcare or finance, where seconds can mean regulatory penalties or breached patient records.

Gartner recently named SentinelOne a Leader in the [2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/gartnermq/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=paid-display&utm_campaign=amer-us-endpoint&utm_content=organic-article-7-31-2025) for the fifth consecutive year. This recognition builds on the Singularity Platform's momentum in innovation as the first solution with an AI analyst and the first unified platform delivering EDR, CNAPP, Hyperautomation, and SIEM to be FedRAMP High (the highest level of U.S. federal cloud security authorization) Authorized.

SentinelOne provides protection for organizations of all sizes—from small businesses to global governments and enterprises—meeting their unique needs in the face of an increasingly complex cyber landscape. The Singularity Platform secures organizations across any device, any OS, and any cloud, providing industry-leading signal-to-noise so SOC teams can focus on responding as quickly as possible. With advanced XDR, AI SIEM, and CNAPP capabilities, a lightweight agent, and responsible architecture, SentinelOne offers a solution designed for both security and operational resiliency.

Organizations using [Singularity Endpoint and Purple AI detect threats 63% faster, reduce MTTR by 55%](https://www.sentinelone.com/lp/mitre/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=paid-display&utm_campaign=amer-us-endpoint&utm_content=organic-article-7-31-2025), and lower the likelihood of a security incident by 60%. Customers have reported a 338% ROI over three years, maximizing the value of their security investments while strengthening their endpoint security.

For example, a healthcare provider using SentinelOne reported cutting incident response time by over 50% during a phishing-induced ransomware outbreak, thanks to automated rollback and unified visibility across cloud workloads and endpoints.

Many teams searching for EDR or XDR platforms are trying to answer: "Will this reduce alert fatigue?" or "Can it integrate with my SIEM or SOAR stack without more overhead?" This is where automation must go beyond buzzwords—reducing manual triage, stitching disconnected signals, and working with existing tools instead of replacing them.

SentinelOne has set the standard in modern endpoint protection since entering the market more than a decade ago, disrupting both traditional antivirus and early next-gen AV approaches.

Unlike signature-based protection and cloud-dependent defenses, the platform pioneered the use of static and behavioral AI and machine learning to detect even novel techniques, solve for both online and air-gapped environments, and automate response. These innovations differentiate SentinelOne from traditional AV and even next-gen EDR solutions, offering deeper automation and on-device intelligence compared to competitors that rely heavily on cloud lookups or manual workflows.

This innovation, architecture, and design philosophy continues to evolve through Purple AI, advanced behavioral detection models, automated remediation and rollback, XDR capabilities, and more. The security platform now offers solutions spanning Identity, Cloud, AI SIEM, Hyperautomation, expert-managed detection and response, and a range of threat services.

Accelerating the SOC and staying ahead of attacks in the age of AI requires platforms that harness innovation in AI and automation to radically improve detection, triage, and response. SentinelOne's platform has long embedded AI and automation as a foundational element. The company continues to develop accessible, compliant AI and automation to transform the SOC.
