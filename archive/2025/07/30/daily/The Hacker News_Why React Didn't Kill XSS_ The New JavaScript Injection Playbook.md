**React conquered XSS? Think again. That's the reality facing JavaScript developers in 2025, where attackers have quietly evolved their injection techniques to exploit everything from prototype pollution to AI-generated code, bypassing the very frameworks designed to keep applications secure.**

**[Full 47-page guide](https://www.reflectiz.com/learning-hub/javascript-injection-playbook/) with framework-specific defenses (PDF, free).**

JavaScript conquered the web, but with that victory came new battlefields. While developers embraced React, Vue, and Angular, attackers evolved their tactics, exploiting AI prompt injection, supply chain compromises, and prototype pollution in ways traditional security measures can't catch.

## **A Wake-up Call: The Polyfill.io Attack**

In June 2024, a single JavaScript injection attack compromised over 100,000 websites in the biggest JavaScript injection attack of the year. The [Polyfill.io supply chain attack](https://www.reflectiz.com/blog/polyfill/), where a Chinese company acquired a trusted JavaScript library and weaponized it to inject malicious code, affected major platforms including Hulu, Mercedes-Benz, and WarnerBros. This wasn't an isolated incident targeting vulnerable forms or outdated systems. This was a sophisticated injection that turned websites' own security tools against them, proving that traditional JavaScript defenses have become dangerously obsolete.

## **The Threat Landscape Has Changed**

Gone are the days when a simple innerHTML sanitization could keep your app secure. Today's attackers are leveraging:

* **Supply chain compromises** targeting your favorite npm packages
* **Prototype pollution attacks** that can hijack your entire object model
* **AI-driven prompt injections** that trick LLMs into generating malicious code
* **DOM-based XSS in single-page applications** that bypass server-side protections

The numbers tell the story: 22,254 CVEs were reported by mid-2024, a [30% jump](https://www.indusface.com/blog/key-cybersecurity-statistics/) from 2023 and 56% increase from 2022. With 98% of websites using JavaScript client-side and 67.9% of developers relying on it as their primary language, the attack surface has never been larger.

## **What Makes This Different**

Most security guides still focus on decade-old attack patterns. This comprehensive analysis breaks down modern threats with a **defense-in-depth approach** that prioritizes protections by impact:

## **The Framework Reality Check**

Even modern frameworks aren't bulletproof:

**This React code looks safe but isn't ‚Äì**

// üö® Vulnerable: unsanitized input

**Better approach with proper sanitization -**

// ‚úÖ Secure: React component with DOMPurify

**Why it matters:**

dangerouslySetInnerHTML bypasses React's built-in XSS protection by directly injecting HTML into the DOM. When user content contains malicious scripts, they execute immediately in the victim's browser, potentially:

* Stealing authentication cookies and session tokens
* Performing actions on behalf of the user
* Redirecting to malicious sites
* Keylogging sensitive information

DOMPurify sanitizes HTML by parsing the content and removing any potentially malicious elements while preserving safe formatting tags like <b>, <i>, <p>, etc.

## **The Banking Sector Under Siege**

The financial industry has become prime target for sophisticated JavaScript injection attacks. In March 2023, IBM uncovered a [malware campaign](https://www.reflectiz.com/blog/malware-campaign-banks/) that targeted over 40 banks across the Americas, Europe, and Japan, compromising more than 50,000 individual user sessions. The attack leveraged advanced JavaScript web injections that detect specific page structures used by banking platforms, then dynamically inject malicious scripts to steal user credentials and one-time password tokens.

What made this campaign particularly dangerous was its adaptive behavior, the malware constantly communicated with command-and-control servers, adjusting its tactics in real-time based on page states and security detection attempts. Using sophisticated [obfuscation techniques](https://www.reflectiz.com/blog/javascript-obfuscation/), the malware could patch functions to remove traces of its presence and avoid execution when security products were detected, proving that traditional JavaScript defenses are no match for modern, dynamically evolving threats.
