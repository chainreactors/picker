# DoppelPaymer ransomware group disrupted

Posted: March 7, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Europol has [announced](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/germany-and-ukraine-hit-two-high-value-ransomware-targets) it has arrested two suspected core members of the DoppelPaymer ransomware group.

On 28 February, the German Regional Police and the Ukrainian National Police, with support from Europol, the Dutch Police, and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), apprehended the two suspects and seized computer equipment.

DoppelPaymer is a ransomware group that has been [linked to Russia](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/07/ransomwares-russia-problem), [EvilCorp group](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm845), and [Emotet](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet). DoppelPaymer’s include healthcare, emergency services, and education, and have been around since 2019.

According to the Europol statement, DoppelPaymer relied on [Emotet](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet) to infiltrate target networks. Emotet is a modular type of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that can be used to drop other malware on infected systems. At Malwarebytes we’ve also seen usage of the modified [Dridex malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-dridex) 2.0, for both initial access and lateral movement.

Last year, DoppelPaymer claimed responsibility for a high-profile [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) on [Kia Motors America](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kia-motors-america-suffers-ransomware-attack-20-million-ransom/). It’s also responsible for a [costly attack on the St. Lucie County sheriffs department](https://eu.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/st-lucie-county/2020/01/29/sheriff-ken-mascara-said-cyber-attack-new-wave-terrorism/4607260002/), the Dutch [Institute for Scientific Research (NWO)](https://www.security.nl/posting/700447/Ransomwaregroep%2Bclaimt%2Baanval%2Bop%2Bnetwerk%2Bopenbaar%2Bministerie%2BIllinois), and the [Illinois Attorney General’s office](https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2021_04/20210413.html). Other victims attacked by DoppelPaymer in the past include [Compal](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/laptop-maker-compal-hit-by-ransomware-17-million-demanded/ "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/laptop-maker-compal-hit-by-ransomware-17-million-demanded/"), [PEMEX (Petróleos Mexicanos)](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/ "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/"), the [City of Torrance](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-los-angeles-county-city-leaks-files/ "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-los-angeles-county-city-leaks-files/") in California, [Newcastle University](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-newcastle-university-leaks-data/ "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doppelpaymer-ransomware-hits-newcastle-university-leaks-data/"), [Hall County in Georgia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/georgia-county-voter-information-leaked-by-ransomware-gang/ "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/new...
