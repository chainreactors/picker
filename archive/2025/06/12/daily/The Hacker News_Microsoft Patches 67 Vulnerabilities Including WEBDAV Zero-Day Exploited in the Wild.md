[![WEBDAV Zero-Day Exploited in the Wild](data:image/png;base64... "WEBDAV Zero-Day Exploited in the Wild")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZphGZjm2gD8J_JpNxpcHECUhTPb4NQeQ5bNtzE9SGXTSnpTvoo56DQ-mXptqLFpKhe8Rbj_YYVAeNByL5sSUJ4U5zG4zUqj6kP-AD5sUF_9f5UOklgEobawCYwjvQ7v6Wjfw31Qqsh8WYzSqM4vvz519kCNA168fI0QZR1MrGC_eMekthNljlkutvsDzB/s790-rw-e365/windows-update-1.jpg)

Microsoft has released patches to fix [67 security flaws](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2025-Jun), including one zero-day bug in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) that it said has come under active exploitation in the wild.

Of the 67 vulnerabilities, 11 are rated Critical and 56 are rated Important in severity. This includes 26 remote code execution flaws, 17 information disclosure flaws, and 14 privilege escalation flaws.

The patches are in addition to [13 shortcomings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security) addressed by the company in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of last month's [Patch Tuesday update](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/microsoft-fixes-78-flaws-5-zero-days.html).

The vulnerability that has been weaponized in real-world attacks concerns a remote code execution in WebDAV ([CVE-2025-33053](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-33053), CVSS score: 8.8) that can be triggered by deceiving users into clicking on a specially crafted URL.

The tech giant credited Check Point researchers Alexandra Gofman and David Driker for discovering and reporting the bug. It's worth mentioning that CVE-2025-33053 is the first zero-day vulnerability to be disclosed in the WebDAV standard.

In a separate report, the cybersecurity company attributed the abuse of CVE-2025-33053 to a [threat actor](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0038/) known as [Stealth Falcon](https://thehackernews.com/2023/09/deadglyph-new-advanced-backdoor-with.html) (aka FruityArmor), which has a history of leveraging Windows zero-days in its attacks. In September 2023, the hacking group was observed using a backdoor dubbed Deadglyph as part of an espionage campaign aimed at entities in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

While Stealth Falcon operations have been identified as likely tied to the United Arab Emirates by the Citizen Lab in the past, Eli Smadja, research group manager at Check Point Research, told The Hacker News they are "unable to confirm any country affiliations" given their focus on the groups and their tactics.

"The activity appears to be highly targeted, affecting specific victims rather than being widespread," Smadja said of the latest campaign.

The [threat sequence](https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/stealth-falcon-zero-day/), in a nutshell, involves the use of an internet shortcut ([URL](https://inquest.net/blog/shortcut-to-malice-url-files/)) file that exploits CVE-2025-33053 to execute malware from an actor-controlled WebDAV server. Check Point said CVE-2025-33053 allows for remote code execution through manipulation of the working directory.

In the attack chain observed against an unnamed defense company in Turkey, the threat actor is said to have employed CVE-2025-33053 to deliver Horus Agent, a custom implant built for the [Mythic](https://securelist.com/agent-for-mythic-c2-with-beacon-object-files/115259/) command-and-control (C2) framework. It's believed that the malicious payload used to initiate the attack, a URL shortcut file, was sent as an archived attachment in a phishing email.

The URL file is used to launch iediagcmd.exe, a legitimate diagnostics utility for Internet Explorer, leveraging it to launch another payload called Horus Loader, which is responsible for serving a decoy PDF document and executing Horus Agent.

"Written in C++, the implant shows no significant overlap with known C-based Mythic agents, aside from commonalities in the generic logic related to Mythic C2 communications," Check Point said. "While the loader makes sure to implement some measures to protect the payload, the threat actors placed additional precautions within the backdoor itself."

This includes the use of techniques like string encryption and control flow flattening to complicate analysis efforts. The backdoor then connects to a remote server to fetch tasks that allow it to collect system information, enumerate files and folders, download files from the server, inject shellcode into running processes, and exit the program.

| CVE-2025-33053 infection chain |

Horus Agent is assessed to be an evolution of the customized Apollo implant, an open-source .NET agent for Mythic framework, that was previously put to use by Stealth Falcon between 2022 and 2023.

"Horus is a more advanced version of the threat groups' custom Apollo implant, rewritten in C++, improved, and refactored," Check Point said.

"Similar to the Horus version, the Apollo version introduces extensive victim fingerprinting capabilities while limiting the number of supported commands. This allows the threat actors to focus on stealthy identification of the infected machine and next stage payload delivery, while also keeping the implant size significantly smaller (only 120Kb) than the full agent."

The company said it also observed the threat actor leveraging several previously undocumented tools such as the following -
