## Arguing Against CALEA

At a Congressional [hearing](https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/salt-typhoon-securing-americas-telecommunications-from-state-sponsored-cyber-attacks/) earlier this week, Matt Blaze [made the point](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Blaze-Written-Testimony.pdf) that CALEA, the 1994 law that forces telecoms to make phone calls wiretappable, is outdated in today’s threat environment and should be rethought:

> In other words, while the legally-mandated CALEA capability requirements have changed little over the last three decades, the infrastructure that must implement and protect it has changed radically. This has greatly expanded the “attack surface” that must be defended to prevent unauthorized wiretaps, especially at scale. The job of the illegal eavesdropper has gotten significantly easier, with many more options and opportunities for them to exploit. Compromising our telecommunications infrastructure is now little different from performing any other kind of computer intrusion or data breach, a well-known and endemic cybersecurity problem. To put it bluntly, something like Salt Typhoon was inevitable, and will likely happen again unless significant changes are made.

This is the access that the Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon [used](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/07/the-30-year-old-internet-backdoor-law-that-came-back-to-bite/) to spy on Americans:

> [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b) first reported Friday that a Chinese government hacking group dubbed Salt Typhoon broke into three of the largest U.S. internet providers, including AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink), and Verizon, to access systems they use for facilitating customer data to law enforcement and governments. The hacks reportedly may have resulted in the “vast collection of internet traffic”; from the telecom and internet giants. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/politics/chinese-hackers-us-telecoms/) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/10/06/salt-typhoon-china-espionage-telecom/) also confirmed the intrusions and that the U.S. government’s investigation is in its early stages.

@ Brian, Bruce, ALL,

As noted above,

> “.GOV ain’t about to give up…”

No it’s not be it .gov.us .gov.uk .gov.eu and all the others.

If we assume –and it’s a very big assumption– that we have nixed backdoors in crypto so that full E2EE becomes acceptable if not the norm, a question arises, and that is

“Where will they take the war next?”

My viewpoint suggests to me that they will “backdoor the User Interface” next.

That is because that is where the “plaintext” of message information rather than meta-data is. But it is beyond the “security endpoint” but by necessity needs to be able to reach back to and through the “communications endpoint” and out into the “general / publicly accessable network”.

We’ve already seen this nonsense attempted by Apple with what was claimed was CSAM image scanning technology.

The problem is the method at the low level was way way to generic and would work for any type of scanning just as well if not more effectively than for CSAM images.

The fact is that “CSAM images” was just an excuse[1] to,

“Get the hooks in to every Apple product user.”

It does not matter what Tim Cook or other Apple seniors think the fact is either they lied, collaborated or were played by “ulterior motives”.

The fact this faux-CSAM got contested, and the high level user scanning of “See What You See”(SWYS) / user device scanning has been removed for now[2]. Does not mean the low level parts of the system nor the hooks to use them were removed.

Think for a moment what that actually means above and beyond confirming peoples suspicions[2] and what the known “future path” will achieve[3].

It was exactly this “low level system and hooks” situation that allowed the “alleged” Chinese Communist Party associated hackers to run rampant through the CALE Act interfaces.

Worse they were not the first the NSA and CIA were known to not just have used the low level CALE system and interface during the “Greek Olympics”. The Greek Government has named one US operative for the murder made to look like suicide of a Greek Vodafone Engineer to cover up how the NSA / CIA had done it through the CALE low level system and hooks.

Much as Lockdown was an excuse to put the low level processes of BLE or WiFi “beaconing” into the two major mobile / smart device OS’s produced by Alphabet/Google and Apple. Now they are there they represent a significant security vulnerability even though comparatively they have a very low bandwidth to communicate.

Why?

Because all they have to do is return the user device electronic serial number and a “flag” that could be the equivalent of one bit of information. The other “tracking systems” already in place will give “general movement / usage patterns” thus setting up a targeted higher bandwidth BLE / WiFi base becomes an almost trivial task.

As all these low level systems and hooks remain in the OS’s still a question has to be asked,

“What is the excuse for these backdoor communications systems?”

Thus “What is the real reason they have not been removed?”

My viewpoint is that this has already been thought out (after all if I can think it out… so can several of the many thousands that work for the Intel Services like the FiveEyes).

The next step will be “See What You See”(SWYS) scanning based on “On device AI” something Microsoft is “busy ramming in Win 11” and “busy ramming Win 11 on all users” (now might be a good time to find an OS with good security no AI and capable of running fully energy gapped).

But for it to work the user device must have “connectivity to the mothership” some how. Which is possibly yet another reason Microsoft is trying to force “always on line” on people.

So logically you need to “cut the umbilical cord” to publicly accessable or external communications[4].

But is this mitigation by “ener...
