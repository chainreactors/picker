# Dropbox Sign customer data accessed in breach

Posted: May 2, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Dropbox is [reporting](https://sign.dropbox.com/blog/a-recent-security-incident-involving-dropbox-sign) a recent “security incident” in which an attacker gained unauthorized access to the Dropbox Sign (formerly HelloSign) production environment. During this access, the attacker had access to Dropbox Sign customer information.

Dropbox Sign is a platform that allows customers to digitally sign, edit, and track documents. The accessed customer information includes email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and hashed passwords, in addition to general account settings and certain [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication. The access is limited to Dropbox Sign customers and does not affect users of other Dropbox services because the environments are largely separate.

> “We believe that this incident was isolated to Dropbox Sign infrastructure and did not impact any other Dropbox products.”

Even if you never created a Dropbox Sign account but received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign, your email addresses and names were exposed. In a [government (K-8) filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000146762324000024/dbx-20240429.htm) about the incident, Dropbox says it found no evidence of unauthorized access to the contents of customers’ accounts (i.e. their documents or agreements), or their payment information.

The attacker compromised a back-end service account that acted as an automated system configuration tool for the Dropbox Sign environment. The attacker used the privileges of the service account for the production environment to gain access to the customer database.

To limit the aftermath of the incident, Dropbox’s security team reset users’ passwords, logged users out of any devices they had connected to Dropbox Sign, and is coordinating the rotation of all API keys and OAuth tokens.

For customers with API access to Dropbox Sign, the company said new API keys will need to be generated and warned that certain functionality will be restricted while they deal with the breach.

Dropbox says it has reported this event to data protection regulators and law enforcement.

## Recommendations

Dropbox expired affected passwords and logged users out of any devices they had connected to Dropbox Sign for further protection. The next time these users log in to their Sign account, they’ll be sent an email to reset the password. Dropbox recommends users do this as soon as possible.

If you’re an API customer, to ensure the security of your account, you’ll need to rotate your API key by generating a new one, configuring it with your application, and deleting your current one. [Here](https://developers.hellosign.com/api/reference/authentication/#generate-new-api-key) is how you can easily create a new key.

API customers should be aware that names and email addresses for those who received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign, even if they never created an account, were exposed. So, this may impact their customers.

Customers who use an authenticator app for multi-factor authentication should [reset](https://faq.hellosign.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025164091-Two-Factor-Authentication-Google-Authenticator) it. Please delete yo...
