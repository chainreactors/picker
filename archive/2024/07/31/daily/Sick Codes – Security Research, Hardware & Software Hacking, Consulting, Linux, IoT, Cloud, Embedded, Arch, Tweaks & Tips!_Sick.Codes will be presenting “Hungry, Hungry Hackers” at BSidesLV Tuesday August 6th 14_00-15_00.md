If you’re in Vegas for [BlackHat](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blackhat-europes/) & DEFCON, come swing by [Security BSides Las Vegas](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bsides-las-vegas/) on Tuesday 6th August 2024 as I’ll be giving a Talk + Q&A with [Casey Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyjohnellis/) about the current state of Cybersecurity in Food & Agriculture, risks, mitigations, what is being done about it, who is winning, and what to do from here on out.

[Joshua Corman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcorman/), who is organizing the I AM THE CALVARY track at BSides has invited me to give a presentation called “Hungry, Hungry Hackers” as part of the continuing cyber threat against agricultural and related industry.

Since doing the “John Deere Jailbreak” talk 2 years ago now, many changes have occurred in the agricultural industry and I will be presenting some very interesting news about Food & Ag. You can also ask questions of myself, and [Casey Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyjohnellis/).

Talk Link:<https://www.bsideslv.org/talks#3TXBVD>

When: Tuesday August 6th 14:00-15:00 (2pm-3pm)

Where: BSides LV (Tuscany Suites and Casino in Las Vegas, NV)
COPA Lounge (Ground Casino Floor)

Talk: Hungry, Hungry Hackers

Track: I Am The Cavalry, 14:00 Tuesday

Talk Bio: [Sick Codes has dazzled Hacker Summer Camp and the world for the last few years. His last several years of research and engagement with the food supply and it’s vulnerable equipment extends beyond tractors. He will share some of what he has found, how others can get involved, and some of the increasing risks and stakes for the food we put on our table. Casey J. Ellis will add his perspective concerning vulnerabilities of the delicate food supply chain.]
