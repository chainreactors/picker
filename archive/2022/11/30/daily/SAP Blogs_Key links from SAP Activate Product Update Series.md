Yesterday morning US time lisa.kouch , daniel.ciecko , jagmohansingh.chawla , anurag.nayak, and ravikanth.malipeddu3 delivered session about SAP Activate, Test Automation Tool, and SAP Cloud ALM as part of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition: Product Update Series for H2 2022.

If you are interested in more Product Update Series sessions that are running until December 7th, you can register here - <https://url.sap/s30l7t>.

The purpose of this blog post is to share with you the **links and resources** that were posted in the chat during the session. Large number of participants asked for the extract and posting on SAP Activate community is the fastest way to share this info with you while the recording and slide deck is being prepared for sharing.
