# EU cyber agency confirms ransomware attack causing airport disruptions

The [airport disruptions](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/21/hundreds-of-flights-delayed-at-heathrow-and-other-airports-after-apparent-cyberattack/) across Europe that began over the weekend were caused by a ransomware attack, according to the European Union’s cybersecurity agency ENISA on Monday.

“ENISA is aware of the ongoing disruption of airports’ operations, which were caused by third-party ransomware incident. At this moment, ENISA cannot share further information regarding the cyberattack,” the agency said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.

The ransomware attack targeted Collins Aerospace, a company that provides among other things check-in systems to several airports, including Berlin, Brussels, and London’s Heathrow. The company said it was working with affected airports to restore services, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/eu-agency-says-third-party-ransomware-behind-airport-disruptions-2025-09-22/), which first reported ENISA’s statement.

On Saturday, [The Guardian reported](http://theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/20/heathrow-airport-delays-cyber-attack-berlin-brussels-cancelled-delays) that Collins Aerospace said that the software targeted was the company’s passenger processing system called MUSE, which “allows multiple airlines to share check-in desks and boarding gate positions at an airport rather than having their own dedicated infrastructure,” [according to Collins Aerospace’s official website](http://collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/industries/airports/passenger-processing-solutions/agent-assisted-check-in).

Collins Aerospace, which is owned by defense contractor RTX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At this point, it’s unclear who is behind the cyberattack.

The cyberattack has caused disruptions with check-in processes, flight delays, and cancellation since Friday night.
