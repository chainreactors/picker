Threat actors are rapidly weaponizing [Hexstrike-AI](https://cybersecuritynews.com/hexstrike-ai/), a recently released AI-powered offensive security framework, to scan for and exploit zero-day CVEs in under ten minutes.

Originally marketed as an offensive security framework for red teams, Hexstrike-AI’s architecture has already been repurposed by malicious operators within hours of its public release.

```
Key Takeaways
1. Hexstrike-AI automates zero-day exploits in under 10 minutes.
2. It links LLMs to 150+ tools for resilient workflows.
3. Rapidly weaponized against Citrix CVEs, driving urgent AI-driven defenses.
```

## **Hexstrike-AI Automates Exploits in Minutes**

Checkpoint’s recent analysis shows how artificial intelligence (AI) can manage and simplify complex attacks by coordinating many specialized agents. This AI-driven system helps automate multi-step attacks more efficiently.

With [Hexstrike-AI](https://cybersecuritynews.com/hexstrike-ai/), that theory has become operational. The framework stands on a FastMCP server core, binding [large-language models](https://cybersecuritynews.com/top-10-vulnerabilities-for-large-language-models/) (Claude, GPT, Copilot) to over 150 security tools via MCP decorators.

AI agents can invoke standardized functions such as nmap\_scan(target, options) and execute\_exploit(cve\_id, payload) without human micromanagement.

Dark-web chatter confirmed that threat actors are testing Webshell deployments against the freshly disclosed [Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway](https://cybersecuritynews.com/citrix-netscaler-adc-and-gateway-vulnerabilities/)CVEs CVE-2025-7775, CVE-2025-7776, and CVE-2025-8424 within hours of disclosure.

Hexstrike-AI’s MCP orchestration layer interprets high-level commands, such as “exploit NetScaler,” into sequenced technical workflows.

Each stage of reconnaissance, memory-handling exploitation, persistence via webshell, and exfiltration is handled by specialized MCP agents, ensuring retry logic and automated resilience.

CheckPoint [observed that](https://blog.checkpoint.com/executive-insights/hexstrike-ai-when-llms-meet-zero-day-exploitation/), to the underground posts, operators achieved unauthenticated remote code execution on vulnerable appliances and dropped web shells in under ten minutes.

The architecture of Hexstrike-AI implements:

**Abstraction Layer:** Translates vague operator intent into precise function calls.

**MCP Agents:** Autonomous servers bridging LLMs with tools, orchestrating everything from nmap\_scan and hydra\_brute to custom NetScaler exploit modules.

**Automation & Resilience:** Built-in retry loops and failure recovery ensure chained operations proceed without human intervention.

**Intent-to-Execution Translation:** The execute\_command API dynamically constructs and executes workflows based on intent strings.

This model mirrors academic projections of AI orchestration driving next-gen cyberattacks—now crystallized in Hexstrike-AI’s code.

Citrix’s August 26 advisories revealed three critical NetScaler vulnerabilities. Traditionally, exploiting such memory and access-control flaws demanded expert reverse engineering and exploit writing.

Hexstrike-AI collapses that barrier, enabling parallelized scanning of thousands of IPs and dynamic adaptation of exploit parameters until success.

The time-to-exploit for CVE-2025-7775 has already been reduced from weeks to minutes, with webshell-equipped appliances appearing on underground markets.

## **Mitigations**

Organizations must quicken patching cycles and implement adaptive, AI-driven detection systems.

Static signatures alone will not suffice against rapidly orchestrated attacks. Monitoring dark-web intelligence for early signals, enforcing segmentation and least-privilege models, and integrating autonomous response playbooks are critical.

Defenders must keep up with the growth of AI-powered of...
