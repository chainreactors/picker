# Announcing new board members

We are excited to announce the result of our open call for board members - three new members are joining the Tor Projectâs Board of Directors: **Esra'a Al Shafei**, **Sarah Gran** and **Christian Kaufman**! Each new member comes to Tor with a different set of expertise that will help the organization and our community. At the end of this post, you can read each of their bios.

Please join us in welcoming Esraâa, Sarah, and Christian to the board!

Esra'a Al Shafei is a Bahraini human rights activist and founder and director of Majal.org, a network of digital platforms that amplify under-reported and marginalized voices in the Middle East and North Africa.

"Torâs privacy technologies have been critical resources for my human rights advocacy work. It is an honor to have this opportunity to support an organization and community that made my work and the work of many other activists possible."

Sarah is on the Board of Directors for the Tor Project. She is also VP of the Brand & Donor Development team at ISRG, the nonprofit behind Let's Encrypt, Prossimo, and Divvi Up.

"I'm a longtime fan of the Tor Project and its efforts to provide people with privacy and anonymity while using the Internet and I'm honored to join its Board of Directors."

Christian Kaufmann has over 20 years of experience in theÂ internet environment as an architect, manager and board member in variousÂ roles.

"We find ourselves in a surveillance state, where many private companies collect as much data as they can get. I see the Tor networks as the privacy and anonymity layer of the Internet that so many of us rely on, and I am proud to be an active part of it."

And as a reminder, the other six members of the Tor Projectâs Board are: Kendra Albert, Desigan Chinniah, Gabriella Coleman, Alissa Cooper, Nighat Dad and Julius Mittenzwei.
