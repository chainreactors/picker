What‚Äôs worse?

Being hit by ransomware attack that sees criminals steal information about your staff and passengers‚Ä¶

or‚Ä¶

Being hit by ransomware attack that sees criminals steal information about your staff and passengers, AND then have the gang tell the world that your firm‚Äôs IT infrastructure is so chaotic, poorly-secured, and downright irritating that it refuses to repeat the attack.

That‚Äôs the humiliating slap in the face given by the Daixin Team ransomware gang to AirAsia which lost the personal data of five million passengers and all employees earlier this month.

![Passenger data](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/passenger-data.jpeg)

As *DataBreaches.net* [reports](https://www.databreaches.net/airasia-victim-of-ransomware-attack-passenger-and-employee-data-acquired/ "Link to DataBreaches.net article"), the incompetence of AirAsia may actually have spared the airline from further attacks:

> ‚ÄúThe chaotic organization of the network, the absence of any standards, caused the irritation of the group and a complete unwillingness to repeat the attack,‚Äù the spokesperson for Daixin Team said. ‚ÄúThe group refused to pick through the garbage for a long time. As our pentester said, ‚ÄòLet the newcomers sort this trash, they have a lot of time.‚Äô‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúThe internal network was configured without any rules and as a result worked very poorly. It seemed that every new system administrator ‚Äòbuilt his shed next to the old building.‚Äô At the same time, the network protection was very, very weak.‚Äù

Ouch.

AirAsia declined to comment on the *DataBreaches.net* report. Frankly you can‚Äôt blame them for ducking that one.
