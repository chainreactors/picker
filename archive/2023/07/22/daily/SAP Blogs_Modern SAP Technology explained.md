**Updated**: 15.12.2023: Added Joule and SAP Build Code

SAP terminology confuses people. That's a fact. I am not sure if there is another company out there that offers software services and solutions that hide under so many different names and acronyms. This article intends to clarify, once and for all, the meanings of common names that you’d see during your SAP journey. I tried to make it S/4HANA- and new tech- focused so some of the outdated concepts might not be included.

Please note that this article would be pointless if I was to just copy & paste service descriptions from the SAP documentation and therefore, I tried to summarise each one of them in maximum of 2 sentences. If you require more detailed information on any of the offerings, you’ll need to google it ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

I’m also planning to make this a living document so feel free to add comments on things that are missing or incorrect - I’ll surely address them.

Have fun, fellow SAP professionals!

P.S. If you are to remember just 2 things from this write-up, please let the correct spelling of S/4HANA and the difference between HANA and S/4HANA be them!
