# The freedom to browse with privacy

Oftentimes we share stories about journalists, activists, whistleblowers, and people in authoritarian governments using Tor to speak truth to power without risking their lives. These are meaningful examples of the importance of Torâbut itâs important to remember that **everyone**, everywhere has the right to speak, browse and search with freedom and with privacy. Thatâs why today, weâre sharing a story from Signh\*, an anonymous user who submitted their story to [our call for Tor stories](https://blog.torproject.org/support-tor-project-share-your-story/). People like Signh, who don't consider themselves tech-savvy, also deserve the right to browse freely.

# Who you support by supporting Tor: Signh, UK

Singh is a woman living in the UK who values her privacy and controls her online identity with Tor Browser. She's not a tech expert, but she understands the importance of protecting her personal data in today's digital world.

When Singh goes online, she mostly spends her time on social sites, and often gets caught doom scrolling about specific social and political issues that impact her life. Her activity leaves a trail of information that can be collected and used by her Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the websites she visits. Singh doesn't want companies knowing what she does online or where she's located, because she doesn't want that data being used to manipulate the content she's served.

That's where Tor Browser comes in. By using Tor Browser and its encryption and anonymity features, Singh can browse the web with confidence, knowing that her online activity is hidden from prying eyes. Her ISP can't see the websites she's visiting, and the websites she visits can't see her IP address. Tor Browser even protects her from fingerprinting techniques and cookies deployed by advertising technologies.

> "I do not face any direct threats or risks regarding my use of the internet, and solely use Tor to avoid mass surveillance of my browsing history. Although my physical well being is not threatened by the mass surveillance I mentally feel much more at ease knowing that my browsing history is protected by using Tor."

With Tor, Singh has the power to decide who gets access to her browsing activity and IP address. She's not just a consumer; she's an active participant in her online experience.

Singh is one of millions of users who choose Tor Browser for her online privacy needs and believes in the right to browse with freedom.
