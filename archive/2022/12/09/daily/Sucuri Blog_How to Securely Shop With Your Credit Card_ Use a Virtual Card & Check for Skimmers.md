The convenience and ease of online transactions has drawn a tremendous number of users to online ecommerce storefronts. And during the pandemic, many consumers switched to online purchases in favor of shopping at regular brick and mortar shops — leading to further reliance on credit or debit card transactions over cash to complete purchases. However, purchasing with a card does come with some risks: primarily, consumer fraud and stolen personal information.

In today’s article, I’ll be exploring ways to help mitigate the risk of using a credit or debit card to make purchases online and in regular brick-and-mortar shops.

## Is it safer to use cash over credit cards?

This really depends on the situation. In general, cash is safer than credit cards because it eliminates the risk of [credit card skimming](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/12/the-anatomy-of-website-malware-part-2-credit-card-stealers.html) or fraudulent purchases.

However, cash isn’t without its downsides. If you lose your cash, it can be extremely difficult or impossible to recover. On the other hand, a lost credit card can easily be reported to the credit card company and a new one reissued.

Additionally, credit cards offer additional protections like fraud protection which is not available for cash transactions. And the majority of web stores will require payment via credit card or some other electronic method, which may exclude users who only operate on a cash basis.

## Is shopping online dangerous?

In general, shopping online isn’t entirely dangerous if you take a few simple precautions.

For example, always ensure that the website is secure before you enter your credit card information or personal data on the page. That means checking to make sure a website uses [SSL to encrypt data in transit](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/08/how-ssl-works-with-a-website-firewall.html), verifying trust seals, or even [scanning a website for malware](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/), skimmers, or blocklisting prior to use.

And if you do need to make a shopper account to complete the transaction, always ensure you use [strong and unique passwords](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/how-to-make-strong-password.html) for your account. That can help mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to your purchase history and personal details.

Checking a website for skimmers isn’t always as easy as scanning a website remotely for malware, however. Many skimmers live on the server level, which aren’t going to be easily detected by a remote scan.

So, let’s dive in to some other options you can leverage to make card transactions more secure — both online, and offline.

## Use a virtual credit card

Virtual credit cards are disposable digital cards with temporary numbers which you can use while shopping. At a basic level, they’re a credit card number that works for your account but isn’t the same as the one printed on your physical card. They’re designed to mask the number of your actual credit card, protecting your real account number from falling into the hands of bad actors.

You can make a single-use (or burner) card that can only be used once. In fact, you can even make one that has $100 limit so you can be sure you only pay for what you ordered. By limiting the amount that can be charged on a virtual card, there’s no way a vendor (or scammer) can charge you more than the agreed upon price.

There are a few vendors who offer these virtual credit cards — including privacy.com, Revolut,...
