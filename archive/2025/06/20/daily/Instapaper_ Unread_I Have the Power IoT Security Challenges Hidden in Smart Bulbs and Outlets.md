# I Have the Power: IoT Security Challenges Hidden in Smart Bulbs and Outlets

![IoT security challenges evil lightbulb image](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iot-security-challenges-evil-lightbulb-image-e1750264258507.png)

That quote from LMG Security’s Penetration Testing Team Manager Tom Pohl drew laughter and wide-eyed stares at BSides Des Moines 2025, but the implications were anything but funny. His talk tackled a growing and often overlooked issue: IoT security challenges. From WiFi-controlled outlets to Bluetooth-enabled light bulbs, Tom walked the audience through how insecure devices can quietly turn from tools into threats.

Welcome to the world of IoT, where devices are always connected—and often poorly protected.

## **When Curiosity Meets IoT Risk: The $20 Smart Outlet**

It all began with a Woot.com deal: a 4-pack of Meross smart outlets for just $20. While the brand wasn’t a household name, Tom suspected something was amiss.

“Sure enough, I found an open S3 bucket with customer data in it. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”

That early discovery highlights a common IoT security challenge: vendors rushing to market with cloud-connected devices and minimal backend protections. Rather than discard the devices, Tom launched a multi-year journey into the security (or lack thereof) behind these smart gadgets.

## **Bricking the Outlet: Debug Mode and Firmware Flaws**

After accessing the outlet’s local web interface, Tom enabled an undocumented debug feature—only to watch the device become unresponsive and unusable.

“It was just a red LED of death. No factory reset could bring it back.”

Disassembling the outlet revealed a tiny RISC-based chip with no standard debugging ports. Without specialized probes, Tom couldn’t continue. But these tools just arrived, so “To be continued…” But this highlights another IoT security challenge: proprietary or obscure hardware that makes responsible analysis (or even recovery) difficult.

## **From Smart Bulbs to Evil Tools: Real-World IoT Security Challenges**

With the smart outlet shelved, Tom shifted focus to a Vont-brand smart light bulb, based on the widely used ESP32 chip. This device proved far more hackable after a bit of soldering, firmware dumping, and creative tooling.

“There’s nothing more rewarding than rebooting a light bulb and seeing your custom SSID pop up: ‘TinyBitEvilLight.’”

By reprogramming the bulb, Tom transformed it into a weaponized tool capable of:

* **Capturing PMKID** and **wireless handshakes** for cracking WiFi passwords.
* Launching **deauthentication attacks**.
* Creating **evil twin networks** that mimic legitimate WiFi for credential theft.
* Staying stealthy—even while appearing to be powered off.

These examples illustrate how IoT security challenges can extend beyond traditional IT assets into physical environments. A smart bulb shouldn’t be able to knock users off WiFi—or steal their login credentials—but here we are.
