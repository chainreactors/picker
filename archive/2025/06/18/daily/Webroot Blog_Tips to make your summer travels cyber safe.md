Ready, set, pack! Summer travel season is here and that means family road trips, beach vacations, international adventures and more. While summertime is prime time for getaways, did you know it’s also prime time for online fraud? Scammers are targeting the travel industry, putting millions of travelers at increased risk. Research shows that the travel and tourism sector [ranked third](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/99675-travel-and-tourism-sector-ranked-third-in-cyberattack-incidents?utm_source=chatgpt.com) in cyberattacks, with nearly [31%](https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/report-31-hospitality-organizations-have-had-data-breach) of hospitality organizations experiencing a data breach and a record [340 million people](https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/mitigating-the-risk-of-cybercrime-while-traveling-abroad/) affected by cybercrimes. According to Mastercard, travel-related fraud in 2024 increased by [18%](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economic-consulting/insights/travel-trends-2025-purpose-driven-journeys?campaign_id=701UH00000WDjWPYA1&channel=pr) during the summer peak season and 28% in the winter peak season.

## Why travelers are prime targets

Being in an unfamiliar environment can put your personal information at risk if you’re relying on public Wi-Fi networks, using shared devices, and carrying valuable personal and business data on mobile devices. Let’s be honest, when you go into “vacation mode” and start relaxing, it’s only natural that you might also start letting your guard down. Even the best trips can have stressful moments, and when you miss a flight or get lost in a new destination, it’s easy to become less vigilant about protecting your cybersecurity. This is especially true when you travel to foreign countries. In fact, [90% of international travelers](https://allaboutcookies.org/international-travelers-internet-safety-survey) admit to risky tech practices while abroad. Fewer than 1 in 3 travelers (31%) protect their data with a virtual private network [(VPN)](https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/why-you-need-a-vpn-and-how-to-choose-the-right-one) when traveling internationally.

## What to know before you go

Believe it or not, the risks to your data security start long before your vacation begins. As soon as you start booking your trip, the cybercriminals start circling. Fraud rates in sectors associated with the early stages of trip planning increased more than [12%](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economic-consulting/insights/travel-trends-2025-purpose-driven-journeys?campaign_id=701UH00000WDjWPYA1&channel=pr) between 2023 and 2024. At a time when inflation and economic pressures are on the rise, people are looking for deep discounts, and scammers are seizing the opportunity to steal your private data and your money.

* **Fake travel websites and rental listings**: When you find a killer price on a luxury cruise, a European tour or an oceanfront Airbnb, take another look before you book! Scammers use [phony offers](https://www.pcmag.com/articles/is-your-vacation-rental-a-scam-look-for-these-3-red-flags), manipulated destination photos, and fake confirmation links to lure victims into “purchasing” great travel deals. Always double check and confirm you’re dealing with a legitimate website or listing before you hand over any credit card information.

* **Phishing scams:** [Phishing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams) scams that target travel-related platforms are on the rise. Cybercriminals pose as legitimate organizations and use fake emails, text messages and phone calls to lure you into giving up financial information. These messages often ask you to click on links that embed malicious software onto your device and steal your sensitive data. In 2024, the travel website booking.com reported a [500%-900% increase](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8003dd8jzeo) in travel-related phishing scams. This rise was attributed to the large number of scams using AI, making it easier for criminals to mimic trusted sources. If you get a suspicious message, call the company or go to their website and log in directly before clicking on any links.

* **Loyalty fraud:** [Loyalty fraud](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/consumer-engagement-loyalty-consulting/insights/fighting-loyalty-fraud-essential), also known as points fraud, happens when scammers steal points or personal information from a loyalty program. The travel industry is especially vulnerable to this type of attack because so many travel-related companies, including travel agents, cruise lines, airlines and hotels, offer points programs for frequent travelers. Thieves often access loyalty accounts with credentials stolen in a data breach. Be sure to create strong passwords for your accounts and check your balances regularly.

## Pre-trip security

Before you hit the road, help protect your digital data and devices with a few simple security practices.

* **Alert your financial institutions:** Only about half of travelers [(52%)](https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/mitigating-the-risk-of-cybercrime-while-traveling-abroad/) alert their financial institutions before traveling abroad, but it’s a powerful way to fight cybercrime. When banks and credit card companies know your travel plans, it’s much easier for them to flag any suspicious transactions.
* **Turn off your Bluetooth:**  Bluetooth technology automatically creates wireless connections and can give cybercriminals the ability to see what apps and websites you’...
