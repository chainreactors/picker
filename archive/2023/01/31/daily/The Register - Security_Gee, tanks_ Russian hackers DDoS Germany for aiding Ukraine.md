in brief Russian hackers have proved yet again how quickly cyber attacks can be used to respond to global events with a series of DDoS attacks on German infrastructure and government websites in response to the country's plan to send tanks to Ukraine.

The efforts, according to Germany's cyber security agency, the BSI, were [largely in vain](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-hacktivists-briefly-knock-german-websites-offline-2023-01-25/). "Currently, some websites are not accessible. There are currently no indications of direct effects on the respective services and, according to the BSI's assessment, these are not to be expected," the BSI declared.

Germany announced the transfer of 14 Leopard 2 A6 tanks to Ukraine on Wednesday, jointly with the US saying it would send 31 M1 Abrams tanks to the besieged nation. Germany [reportedly](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-german-tanks-435da2221bf452a8aae9d2e58d23acae) refused to send tanks without the US making a similar offer, in hopes that might head off a Russian response.
