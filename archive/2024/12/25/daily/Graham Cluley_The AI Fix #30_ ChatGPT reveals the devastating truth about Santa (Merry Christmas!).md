In episode 30 of The AI Fix, AIs are caught lying to avoid being turned off, Apple‚Äôs AI flubs a headline, ChatGPT is available to people who haven‚Äôt left the 1970s, our hosts regret to inform you that an AI artist now has a personality, and ant-like robots join forces to lob each other over things.

Graham discovers that Google Gemini is checking its homework by asking unskilled humans to simply take a punt at the right answer, and Mark uses an AI to reveal the devastating truth about Santa.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
