"Hackers Share Tactics and Infrastructure")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZw_leLiz_e5E-aYWMRutQNwCpVXQIvUc0naEL5aklsKHCfluypeCYq123F1m2eox0eKEvomcVU5svnv-6KhrLotN5te63gvi3us6gh5IIsU4wI7NVJdRrrlG14x4Gh8-B5vr50DrESWhiS4Xl0XJZ1PQoEYXzbzMBCdgGuyOfexNrFgMdT1-YFEW5KNca/s790-rw-e365/hackers.jpg)

Cybersecurity researchers have flagged the tactical similarities between the threat actors behind the **RomCom RAT** and a cluster that has been observed delivering a loader dubbed **TransferLoader**.

Enterprise security firm Proofpoint is tracking the activity associated with TransferLoader to a group dubbed **UNK\_GreenSec** and the RomCom RAT actors under the moniker **TA829**. The latter is also known by the names CIGAR, Nebulous Mantis, Storm-0978, Tropical Scorpius, UAC-0180, UAT-5647, UNC2596, and Void Rabisu.

The company said it discovered UNK\_GreenSec as part of its investigation into TA829, describing it as using an "unusual amount of similar infrastructure, delivery tactics, landing pages, and email lure themes."

TA829 is something of an unusual hacking group in the threat landscape given its ability to conduct both espionage as well as financially motivated attacks. The Russia-aligned hybrid group has also been linked to the [zero-day exploitation of security flaws](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/romcom-exploits-zero-day-firefox-and.html) in Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Windows to deliver RomCom RAT in attacks aimed at global targets.

Earlier this year, PRODAFT [detailed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/nebulous-mantis-targets-nato-linked.html) the threat actors' use of bulletproof hosting providers, living-off-the-land (LOTL) tactics, and encrypted command-and-control (C2) communications to sidestep detection.

TransferLoader, on the other hand, was [first documented](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/ransomware-gangs-use-skitnet-malware.html) by Zscaler ThreatLabz in connection with a February 2025 campaign that delivered the [Morpheus ransomware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/experts-find-shared-codebase-linking.html) against an unnamed American law firm.

Proofpoint noted that campaigns undertaken by both TA829 and UNK\_GreenSec rely on REM Proxy services that are deployed on compromised MikroTik routers for their upstream infrastructure. That said, the exact method used to breach these devices is not known.

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

"REM Proxy devices are likely rented to users to relay traffic," the Proofpoint threat research team [said](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/10-things-i-hate-about-attribution-romcom-vs-transferloader). "In observed campaigns, both TA829 and UNK\_GreenSec use the service to relay traffic to new accounts at freemail providers to then send to targets. REM Proxy services have also been used by TA829 to initiate similar campaigns via compromised email accounts."

Given that the format of the sender addresses are similar -- e.g., ximajazehox333@gmail.com and hannahsilva1978@ukr.net -- it's believed that the threat actors are likely using some sort of an email builder utility that facilitates the en masse creation and sending of phishing emails via REM Proxy nodes.

The messages act as a conduit to deliver a link, which is either directly embedded in the body or within a PDF attachment. Clicking on the link initiates a series of redirections via Rebrandly that ultimately take the victim to a fake Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive page, while filtering out machines that have been flagged as sandboxes or deemed not of interest to the attackers.

It's at this stage that the attack chains splinter into two, as the adversary infrastructure to which the targets are redirected is different, ultimately paving the way for TransferLoader in the case of UNK\_GreenSec and a malware strain called SlipScreen in the case of TA829.

"TA829 and UNK\_GreenSec have both deployed Putty's PLINK utility to set up SSH tunnels, and both used IPFS services to host those utilities in follow-on activity," Proofpoint noted.

SlipScreen is a first-stage loader that's designed to decrypt and load shellcode directly into memory and initiate communications with a remote server, but only after a Windows Registry check to ensure the targeted computer has at least 55 recent documents based on the "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs" key.

"We assess that 55 is an arbitrary number chosen by the actor, and is a best guess at determining if a host is 'real' or if it is a sandbox," Greg Lesnewich, senior threat researcher at Proofpoint, told The Hacker News. "Previous versions of the loader have checked that at least [100 recent documents](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/snipbot-romcom-malware-variant/) were logged in the Registry; it is unclear why that change was made."

The infection sequence is then used to deploy a [downloader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/russian-romcom-attacks-target-ukrainian.html) named MeltingClaw (aka [DAMASCENED PEACOCK](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/malware-analysis-reports/damascened-peacock/ncsc-mar-damascened-peacock.pdf)) or RustyClaw, which is then used to drop backdoors like ShadyHammock or DustyHammock, with the former being used to launch SingleCamper (aka SnipBot), an updated version of RomCom RAT.
