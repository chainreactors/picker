[Certification](/blog/certification)
[burp](/blog/burp)

We launched the [Burp Suite Certified Practitioner (BSCP) certification](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/how-to-prepare) at the end of 2021 due to growing demand from [Burp Suite Professional](/burp/pro) customers. Spanning everything from classic vulnerability classes to cutting-edge discoveries – including some from [PortSwigger Research](https://portswigger.net/research) themselves – the BSCP provides a realistic, black-box environment to test and hone both old and new skills.

The team at [Packetlabs](https://www.packetlabs.net/) - a Canada-based company - exclusively use [Burp Suite Professional](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro) for their web application [penetration testing](/solutions/penetration-testing). We recently spoke with Denis Kucinic, VP of Operations at Packetlabs, to find out how he's incorporated the BSCP into his organization.

## Finding highly skilled testers

As an organization that prides itself on its advanced testing capabilities, Packetlabs places high priority on finding the best talent. They provide [pentesting](/solutions/penetration-testing) services, or ethical hacking as it's also known, and follow what Denis calls "the hedgehog model".

"*You just do one thing, and you do it really well, rather than doing multiple things and not doing any of them well.*"

Packetlabs is a growing organization, and as such has recently had to place more focus on hiring. Denis talks about struggling to know what someone is capable of in a 45-minute interview, running test challenges, and not wanting to pigeonhole people into just the vulnerabilities the challenge dealt with. He's also trying to strike the balance between whether a candidate can explain something versus actually being able to put it into action.

**Emma S (PortSwigger):** So Denis, could you talk us through some of the challenges you have experienced in finding top level talent to be able to provide the service that you do at Packetlabs?

**Denis K (Packetlabs Ltd):** I'd say 70% of our work is web, so whether it's compliance, red teaming, or straight up testing, how do we decide who really knows their stuff? We implemented an extensive training program. It started out with the [Web Application Hacker's Handbook](https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-application-hackers-handbook) - we would say, go through that. We have our own testing methodology, which is aligned with what each tester has to go through on a web app.

Then PortSwigger launched the [Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security), and we noticed that the testers who went through it had a really good time. They'd be learning a lot of different attacks, and how to move around on a web app - they were understanding the different types of attacks and what they saw on the scanner.

"*How do you rule out something that's a false positive? How? You keep going until you figure out if it actually is or not. And that's always a challenge.*"

## Incorporating the Burp Suite certification

After seeing the positive impact the Web Security Academy had on his testers, Denis and the team implemented a ranking system. Focusing on infrastructure and core web testing, they were able to get a comprehensive measure of a testers' capabilities simply by seeing their progress through the topics, learning materials, and labs.

**Emma S (PortSwigger):** And then we went and launched the BSCP …

**Denis K (Packetlabs):** That's right, and we were so excited - we added it to our hiring checklist straight away. For anyone new that came in, we said, okay, here's the salary that we bring you in on without the BSCP; Here's the salary if you get it.

"*For every new hire now, we say get Burp Suite certified because we just find the value in it really shows in those testers that got it. You can just tell the difference from the ones that started on day one that didn't have the Burp Suite cert.*"

**Emma S (PortSwigger):** Can you share any thoughts about your experience of the BSCP?

**Denis K (Packetlabs):** It's like an emotional rollercoaster because it's high pressure. You have a certain amount of hours - similar to the OSCP, but it's even more pressure - which is really lifelike because sometimes you do have environments where you only have a couple of hours left and you have to go in there. You have to use [Burp Scanner](/burp/vulnerability-scanner), see what shows up, and then you have to validate it. You have x amount of hours to do it. I like the urgency of it and the difficulty of it. I think...
