Last week, a federal judge [rejected](https://www.eff.org/document/afge-v-opm-opinion-and-order-motion-dismiss) the government’s motion to dismiss our Privacy Act [lawsuit](https://www.eff.org/cases/american-federation-government-employees-v-us-office-personnel-management) against the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE). OPM is disclosing to DOGE agents the highly sensitive personal information of tens of millions of federal employees, retirees, and job applicants. This disclosure violates the federal [Privacy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act_of_1974), a watershed law that tightly limits how the federal government can use our personal information.

We represent two unions of federal employees: the [AFGE](https://www.afge.org/) and the [AALJ](https://aalj.org/). Our co-counsel are [Lex Lumina LLP](https://www.lex-lumina.com/), [State Democracy Defenders Fund](https://statedemocracydefenders.org/fund/), and [The Chandra Law Firm LLC](https://www.chandralaw.com/).

We’ve already explained why the new ruling is [a big deal](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/judge-rejects-governments-attempt-dismiss-eff-lawsuit-...
