## Mailbox Insecurity

It turns out that all cluster mailboxes in the Denver area have the same master key. So if someone [robs a](https://www.denver7.com/news/investigations/thieves-target-cluster-mailboxes-in-denvers-green-valley-ranch-north-neighborhood) [postal carrier](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/information-in-denver-postal-carrier-robbery-could-carry-150k-reward/ar-AA1tw3sJ), they can open any mailbox.

I get that a single master key makes the whole system easier, but it’s very fragile security.

Back when they took mail theft seriously, this might have worked. In the mid 90s, we had a problem with the mailboxes at work being broken into. They sent two men with guns from the US Postal Inspector who investigated and also placed a new cluster box free of charge.

When I had checks stolen last year that I had actually mailed from inside the post office, they did nothing other than letting me fill out a report online.

It was later in the news that a gang has been stealing bulk sacks of mail from the loading docks.

This sort of thing used to be treated like bank robbery, and now you just get victim-shamed because “Why did pay with a check?”

Some systems are much more fragile when deterrence is no longer part of the strategy.

In the meantime, here in France, and I suspect other countries, all the mailboxes are master keyed (there’s even a master to open a whole wall of mail boxes).

The rationale is that it’s not forbidden to open a mailbox or even check its contents, but it’s criminal to even slightly tamper with a person’s mail.

Not that it helps a lot, mind you, when your mail is stolen, which tends to happen a whole lot around Xmas

You don’t even have to rob them. If you can get a few minutes alone with your own mailbox, you can take appart the lock, measure the pins, and then go file your own master. Mastered keys have two upper pins in each location, the master is always the higher cut. And of course once one person knows the numbers, that info is easily shared.

If you have ever managed your own physical security, you ought to know you can tell by the number of krys on your keychain how many unique keys you have…unless you keep multiple keychains.

Besides that, locks cam be picked. They really just slow thieves down more than they keep them out.

Human “guard labor” can do things that locks cannot do.

@ Bruce, ALL,

This “One Key rules them all” as a master key is useful in buildings with multiple floors and manpower hierarchy for cleaning, security, maintenance, and management.

As such it’s been around for oh a century or more. Thus locks with one or master keys is in some way the default by the lock industry (something I had familiarity with in the 1980’s).

Now take a block of flats or similar with “post boxes” in the foyer. The posty comes in the first front door and puts stuff in the boxes. However all to often a letter/package won’t go in the slot. And as the posty often won’t actually have access beyond the next set of doors to where the Reception desk is, the posty can not just leave it.

So from an employers perspective a posty is more “productive” if they can just open the mail box and shove the letter/packet in…

Which brings us to,

> “… but it’s very fragile security.”

Ask the $64,000 of,

“Who cares?”

And the answer in the US and similar is,

“Only where there is lawful liability that might get acted upon”

Obviously the posty neither cares or has liability if they follow the rules. The same with the posties immediate manager.

And so it goes up the hierarchy.

But also consider what comes in the oppisit direction,

“The ever present drive for cost saving and increased productivity”

As is the neo-con capitalist way…

If all the keys are the same that reduces not just direct cost but indirect costs as well in oh so many ways.

Thus the way “security” is dealt with is to stamp the keys so they will not get copied by “Diligent and honest” locksmiths. And each and every posty has to sign a piece of paper saying “they’ve read the official rule book”.

Of course as I’ve mentioned before, this “security policy” is broken because it did not cover somebody who is not even a teenager getting “needle files” and cut / impression their own master keys for all sorts of locks. For my sins it’s what I did back in the 60’s and into the 80’s first for fun then as a side line in Pirate Radio with “Fire Brigade” or “FB” keys and Otis and other “Lift Keys” for tower blocks.

As I’ve also noted you just have to photograph a key, you don’t have to get your hands on it. Which is why it was so funny when the DHS released a photo of their master keys for getting into peoples luggage.

Of course today with 3D Printers you can make a plastic key from photo to in your hand in just a few minutes.

More fun the plastic used in 3D printing can be used like a “lost wax process” where you use a low temperature melting solid as the plug in a green-sand or similar liquid metal casting system.

People do such casting at home to make very finely detailed parts for model trains and also the likes of “War Craft” and similar figures.

So the ability to make or cast a key is fairly ubiquitous, not that those who set up these dumb security systems will admit that.

After all as Upton Sinclair noted a century or so ago,

**“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”**

Firefighter keys and telephony access systems are similarly insecure. Many commercial buildings, apartments, and the like to have a lock-box containing keys to the building which are then “protected” by a key that the fire department has. Some states have even legislated the exac...
