The experts at security firm Bitdefender have released a universal decryptor for victims of the MegaCortex family of ransomware.

MegaCortex, which was first spotted in early 2019, was posing such a threat to businesses by the end of that year that the FBI [issued a warning](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-issues-alert-for-lockergoga-and-megacortex-ransomware/ "Link to Bleeping Computer article") that the ransomware was exploiting security weaknesses, stolen passwords, and phishing attacks to establish a foothold within networks.

MegaCortex‚Äôs creators appear to be fans of *The Matrix*. Not only is it seemingly named after MetaCortex ‚Äì the software company that Keanu Reeve‚Äôs character worked for at the start of the film ‚Äì but the ransom note also references quotes from the movie.

If your business was infected though, you probably wouldn‚Äôt be in the mood for chowing down on some popcorn. MegaCortex would have encrypted your files, and could have exfiltrated information from your network, and disabled your users‚Äô access rights.

It‚Äôs estimated that MegaCortex is responsible for some 1800 ransomware infections, mostly targeting businesses.

But now there‚Äôs a fix that can unlock those encrypted files, and it doesn‚Äôt involve paying a ransom to cybercriminal extortionists.

The security researchers at Bitdefender, in co-operation with Europol, the NoMoreRansom project, and law enforcement agencies in Zurich, have released a [free MegaCortex decryption tool](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/bitdefender-partnership-with-law-enforcement-yields-megacortex-decryptor/).

By the way, if you have been hit by ransomware it is always worth checking in with the [NoMoreRansom](https://www.nomoreransom.org/ "Link to NoMoreRansom") project.

NoMoreRansom has what is probably the most definitive [public list of ransomware decryption tools](https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html "Link to ransomware decryption tools") available.

It should go without saying that you should always back up your important data (even if encrypted) before running any decryption tool.
