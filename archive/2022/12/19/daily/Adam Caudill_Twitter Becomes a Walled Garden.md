Today is a red letter day in the history of Twitter, though not in a good way. Twitter has a long reputation of free speech, providing a platform for all that wanted it, easily connecting to the powerful, building communities, and organising against tyranny. This didn’t come without controversy of course; in the effort to keep the platform safe, more and more moderation was implemented - sometimes the got it right, sometimes they got it wrong. While they worked to protect users, there was still a focus on providing as much freedom as possible.

> We are the free-speech wing of the free-speech party. - *Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter*

In a new policy, coming in on a Saturday and during the final game of the World Cup, Twitter has [announced](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy) a raft on new restrictions on linking to other social media platforms - a seismic shift in their approach to regulating users’ speech. The list of platforms include:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Mastodon
* Truth Social
* Tribel
* Post
* Nostr
* third-party link services such as linktr.ee and lnk.bio

Linking to any of these services, promoting these services, asking users to follow you on another service, or posting something that looks like a link are all banned under this new policy. Want to show off your photos on Instagram? That’s a suspension. Switched to another platform? That’s a suspension. Like many recently, I’ve moved to Mastodon - it’s likely that my Twitter account will be suspended for linking to my [Mastodon profile](https://infosec.exchange/%40adamcaudill).

> Specifically, we will remove accounts created solely for the purpose of promoting other social platforms and content that contains links or usernames for the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post.
>

Twitter is becoming a walled garden, locking users in to avoid the reality that they aren’t the only social media platform around; a fact they seem to be trying not to admit. In fact, the policy starts with a remarkably obnoxious and pretentious line:

> Twitter is where the public conversation is happening, and where people from all over the globe come to promote their businesses, art, ideas, and more. - *Twitter Policy Announcement*

The fear of losing users, in addition to [losing advertisers](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk), is clearly making Twitter’s current leadership rethink some long-held positions.

> The acid test for any two competing socioeconomic systems is which side needs to build a wall to keep people from escaping? That’s the bad one!
>
> — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) [June 6, 2022](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1533616384747442176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Helpfully, Twitter’s (current) owner has made his opinion clear on what it means when companies build walls. If you’re still using Twitter, now may be the time to stop - I’d suggest Mastodon, which is currently a far more reasonable alternative.

  In early December, about a month ago, I had the to perform one of the hardest tasks I’ve ever faced as a leader, letting my team know that a colleague had passed away. She was a friend to us all, and the glue that held the team together; telling them that she was gone was, without question, the hardest thing I’ve had to do in a work setting.
  What made this so hard was not just what I was telling them, but my own feelings for her as a friend, and the opportunity I had missed.

  A friend of mine recently asked for my thoughts on leading people who have more experience or expertise in a topic than they do; this is an important question and one that I felt deserved more thought and exploration. Leading people can be difficult, but when leading people that know more than you do about a given topic, it’s a different challenge. This was particularly well-timed, as I’ve found myself in just that situation, as I’ve just hired a specialist in incident response.

  For the second year I am publishing a year-in-review – something I had generally avoided in the past, as the tone of these posts is typically just cynicism and negativity. Looking back at 2015, it wasn’t all positive (what year is?), but there was certainly some good, and there are great things to look forward to.
  In a season filled with empty marketing pitches, worthless predictions, and pointless projections – it’s important to look at the good and avoid the cynicism overload that is all too common.

  Sometime in the 1990’s I used a 2400-baud modem and connected to the internet for the first time; I found a new world, a better world. A world where ideas and intellect set people apart, not skin color, or political affiliation, of even the pseudo-scandal of the day (which is probably just a disguise for ignorance and intolerance).
  It was a time of invention, in a world where everything was new and the potential was unlimited.

  Last Friday, Brandon Wilson and I gave a talk on BadUSB at DerbyCon – I wrote some about it yesterday. Yesterday, Wired published an article on the talk, kicking off several others – only the authors of the Wired and Threatpost articles contacted us for input.
  There has been some questions raised as to the responsibility of releasing the code – so I want to take a few minutes to talk about what we released, why, and what the risks actually are.
