# Tor user support now available in Farsi

Providing user support to people in regions where Tor access is restricted is a priority for the Tor Project. As part of this commitment, we're expanding the languages in which users can receive help - and today, we're announcing the addition of Farsi user support.

Farsi-speaking users can now contact us directly for help with accessing the Tor network. Whether you're trying to download Tor Browser, bypass online censorship, or need assistance navigating Tor connectivity issues, our support team is available to help.

Tor user support is available via Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, and email, from Monday through Thursday, from 19:30 â 01:30 Iran time (same day to next day). Support is provided via text only; voice and video are not supported.

## Helping users to bypass online censorship

If you live in a country or region where Tor is blocked, Tor support channels are one of the most effective ways to get help from our team. We can guide you through the steps to access Tor safely and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

For the quickest replies, we recommend reaching out in English, Farsi, Russian, Spanish, or Portuguese. You're welcome to write to us in any language, but please note that messages received in less common languages may have longer response times as we work through translation.

## Stay safe, use official Tor channels

To ensure that you receive the best and safest support from us, we encourage you to verify that you're connecting with us through our [official Tor Project channels](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/support/). You can find the full list of legitimate links, email-addresses and numbers on our official support page, in the help section of Tor Browser, or simply by typing 'about:manual#support' in the URL Bar. Please always take a moment to double-check before sharing any sensitive information.
