During this event, we supported our partner United VARs, the leading alliance of SAP solution providers for the mid-market, in an exclusive Hack2Build to implement SAP S/4HANA Extensions leveraging AI.

This Hack2Build was conducted virtually and for the last 3 days of Hack2Build week there was an opportunity to meet in person at the Barcelona Digital Hub for a physical experience and finish the Demo Jam prototype.

Together with our excellent colleagues from the SAP BTP Solution Architects and the SAP AI product team -who all offered an outstanding support from all over the world- we were able to run this Hack2Build and deliver an innovative and inspiring experience for eight of the United VARs partners.

## The United VARs Partners

United VARs is a global alliance of SAP implementation partners and solution providers for the mid-market. With over 70 members in 100 countries, the alliance serves all types of SAP rollouts and integrations across the world. The organization provides businesses with local expertise ‘on the ground’ charged at local rates. All United VARs members work together as one team to provide a more personalized service than other global systems integrators are able to, and one that is better suited to mid-market budgets.

The participating United VARs partner were coming from all over the world, spanning from China to Canada, and they were implementing and showcasing a great variety of use cases applying SAP AI Business Services and AI Core in connection with the SAP Business Technology Platform.

United VARs Participating Partners

Four of the partners - Illumiti, Seidor, Blue-Zone and 2BM - met in Barcelona at the "Barcelona Digital Hub" over the last 3 days to finalize their demo and prepare for the hybrid Demo Jam on September 29th.

## Demo Jam

This Demo Jam was a hybrid event since half of the presentations were presented virtually, the other half were presented on site in Barcelona in the Digital Hub.

SAP Chief Partner Officer Karl Fahrbach opened the Demo Jam with his welcome note and each of the partners presented their exciting demo to the audience, online and on-site. Based on the partners' feedback, gathered via Mentimeter right before presenting their demo, they felt curious, excited and "stronger than one," which was the right mindset to start the demo jam.

How the Participants felt before the Hack2Build

Because every participating partner is a winner, our demo judges panel consisting of senior SAP executives, had to make a difficult decision to crown the winners.

After a hard but fair jury discussion based on defined criteria, partner 2BM from Denmark was declared as winner followed by Illumiti from Canada and Netizen from Thailand as 1st and 2nd runner-ups:

The 3 winners of the Hack2Build

Karl Fahrbach announced the winners and presented the prizes and certificates to the top three. All three partners will receive a free ICC certification for the completed solution and the winner 2BM will also receive SAP-sponsored GTM support.

## Team 2BM from Denmark …

… was very excited to take home the first place! Especially in such a tough race against many skilled colleagues from the UVAR SAP partner ecosystem.

The Maintenance Data Quality solution build by the 2BM team uses supervised learning to grade the quality of Plant Maintenance data. Data quality is a key focus of companies taking their maintenance digital. It is a challenge 2BM Software has come across often during implementations of their market leading mobile app solution “[2BM Mobile Work Order](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000012851_live_v1/2BM%20Mobile%20Work%20Order).” (see image below). Quality can be hard to quantify, but by embedding AI in their 2BM Maintenance Data Quality solution they are able to give organizations real time and historic insights and give live recommendations to the front-line workers.

2BM Mobile Work Order

During this Hack2Build week the 2BM team, consisting of Martin Conradsen, Priya Annamareddy, Dragos Sirbu and Olav Rask, has built an OData service for extracting maintenance notifications, designed a machine learning model to evaluate the quality of data and dev...
