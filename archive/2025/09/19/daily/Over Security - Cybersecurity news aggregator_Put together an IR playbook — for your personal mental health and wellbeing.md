[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

This is gonna be a tough read. I’m sorry. Believe it or not, it’s even tougher for me to write. I want to talk about what it costs to be in the cybersecurity profession. Not money or time, but potentially your health, both mentally and physically. I want to move the curtain aside and show you an inside look at what happens to people when the pressure is high and the desire to succeed is not only essential, but sometimes [even life and death](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/baby-died-due-ransomware-attack-hospital-suit-claims-rcna2465).

So, story time.

Seven years ago, Cisco Talos disclosed a novel and new threat campaign: [VPN Filter.](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter/) VPN Filter was a small office/home office (SOHO) device botnet that had many new things we’d never seen before in SOHO devices: infection persistence past device reboot, modularity, victimology, and perhaps most importantly, the (later) attribution to the Russian threat actor APT44 (aka Sandworm). The platform also featured a kill switch, a module designed to cover the tracks and or destroy a device infected with VPN Filter. This could be executed en masse, if they desired. This was a methodical, clever and well-structured campaign to attack unpatched and/or vulnerable devices all over the world for state cyber operations. As I look back at that time, it was (and still is) a marvel of tradecraft and offensive cyber operations.

Put yourself in our position at Talos. We’ve just discovered a massive campaign by a notorious threat actor. We all know what this is, who this is, and what the consequences could be — and the threat actor had a massive head start on us. We absolutely couldn’t screw this up. If we tipped our hand via our research, the threat actor might get spooked and just burn the whole thing down with the kill switch. The stakes were very high.

We spent months reversing and analyzing the malware, the victimology, infrastructure, and understanding the scale and scope of what VPN Filter did and potentially could do. The more we peeled things back, the more ominous the implications and the harder we worked.

As the weeks turned into months, the hours we worked grew longer and longer, and the stress began to take its toll on all of us. The raw enormity of the tasks of analyzing and responding to VPN Filter and the stress of being stealthy begin to extract a price from us personally. Attitudes grew sour, relationships frayed, and some were rent asunder completely. For me, personally, it was a very dark time and would cost me dearly – I would exit people management into an individual contributor role that I still inhabit to this day.

In the end, the threat actor forced us to into action. We had always theorized a “break glass” moment when the threat actor might hit the gas pedal and we would have to alert the world. One day we saw a massive spike in infections in Ukraine, and we disclosed to the world VPN Filter. We still had so many unanswered questions but had no choice when we saw the spike. In a way, it was a mercy. We had long since hit our limit and were just all collectively cooked and demoralized. I know I was, and it deeply affected my relationships and career, the reverberations of which I still feel to this day.

I’m often asked by new or potential security practitioners, “Joe, what’s a cool hacker story?!” I have plenty of those, and VPN Filter is certainly one of them. But rarely does anyone want to hear the worst days of our lives. The tales of burnout and stress. Of the long hours and constant work. There is *always* a breach happening somewhere, your company is *always* under attack, there is *always* a story of a someone getting hacked and sometimes people are even hurt or killed. This cadence takes a toll – from events like VPN Filter, to being in a SOC – it’s all the same. No matter where you work, we are here to keep our customers, constituents, and communities safe from some real assholes out there. It is about fighting the good fight, and the fight never stops.

So, what can we do about it? How can you avoid being me in the middle of VPN Filter?

1. **Learn and enforce boundaries.** You must make space and time for you and firmly enforce that space and time. If that means disabling after hours comms, then do so, and do so guilt free. You must look after yourself.
2. **Peer support.** Whether it's a therapist, a colleague, or a Slack/Discord/Bsides where you can share and vent with others in the same boat as you, you must reduce the sense of isolation this career space can give you. Others are looking for the same thing and happy to listen and share. Celebrate your wins with people who are eager to reciprocate.
3. **Unplugged self-care.** This is tough, and I’m not great at it. Exercise, paint, work in your garden and do something unrelated to your job. Put down the hell rectangle that is your phone and unplug from the news and social media.
4. **Mandatory decompression/vacation.** After an incident, be it VPN Filter or a breach, leaders: *look after your people.* Recognize burnout and push your directs into some enforced downtime so they can recover. At a minimum, rotate them into a less stressful role so they can take a break. It’s your responsibility to care for those who work hard for you.

Responding after the event is just as important as responding to the event itself. Every breach, VPN Filter-like event, or emergency is an opportunity to reflect on the cost to your health and ...
