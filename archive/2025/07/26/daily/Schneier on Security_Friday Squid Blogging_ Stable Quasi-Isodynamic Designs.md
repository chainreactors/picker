## Friday Squid Blogging: Stable Quasi-Isodynamic Designs

Yet another SQUID acronym: ‚Äú[Stable Quasi-Isodynamic Design](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/5457187/SQulD_Stellarator).‚Äù It‚Äôs a [stellarator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator) for a fusion nuclear power plant.

@ Bruce,

When you lookup ‚Äústellarator‚Äù on Wikipedia you get,

> *‚ÄúIt is one of many types of magnetic confinement fusion devices. The name ‚Äústellarator‚Äù refers to stars because fusion mostly occurs in stars such as the Sun.‚Äù*

There is a little bit of irony there‚Ä¶ Because ‚Äústars‚Äù achieve and maintain the conditions for ‚Äúfusion‚Äù not by ‚Äúmagnetic confinement‚Äù but by the constriction effects of ‚Äúgravity‚Äù.

The fun thing to note is that ‚Äúmagnetic confinement‚Äù has never achieved sustainable fusion.

Some think it never will because it is not stable. That is magnetic confinement is an external force that ‚Äúpushes in‚Äù. Rather than gravity which is effectively an internal force that ‚Äúpulls in‚Äù which is stable.

I suspect none of us reading this today will be around when sustainable stable fusion goes into commercial production of electricity or other way to efficiently transmit energy to the home etc.

So up there in the Unobtainium stakes along with AGI, Quantum Computing, World Peace and day trips to Mars üòâ

@Clive

When you lookup ‚Äústellarator‚Äù on Wikipedia you see ‚Äì

pictures of star-shaped objects, surely difficult to contain magnetic fields within. And further irony, they should have known back then, that such magnetic containment as exists in the sun is unstable and leaks frequently, hurling blobs of solar material at us, causing pretty lights in the sky and comms and nav blackouts ‚Ä¶

Heh. Humans cannot even safely handle fission tech.

@ Bruce, ALL,

**Another attack on RAM secrets.**

I suspect some remember the tales of times distant past when DRAM would get frozen with something quite cold. Such that the contents of memory could be read out.

Some called it a ‚ÄúCold Boot‚Äù attack and the solution used was to store secrets in SRAM in the chip thus making it nearly impossible to get at.

Or so many thought‚Ä¶ Welcome to a new attack ‚ÄúVolt Boot‚Äù that exploits design failings in ‚ÄúSystem on a Chip‚Äù(SoC) devices power busses. Or as the Communications of the ACM article,

<https://cacm.acm.org/research-highlights/sram-has-no-chill-exploiting-power-domain-separation-to-steal-on-chip-secrets/>

Puts it,

> *‚ÄúA Volt Boot attack leverages a vulnerability of on-chip volatile memories due to the physical separation common to modern system-on-chip power distribution networks.‚Äù*

So another fun hardware exploit and it‚Äôs not even Xmas.

Put simply SRAM ‚Äúbeing static‚Äù retains what is written to it as long as power is maintained to it in various ways.

As the article indicates ‚Äúembedded systems‚Äù are vulnerable. This includes most Internet of Things‚Äù(IoT) and network infrastructure and edge devices.

However it will probably work against some ‚ÄúSmart Devices‚Äù such as Pads and Mobiles.

In the distant past I gave methods of protecting ‚Äúroot of trust‚Äù KeyMat by using evolving ‚Äúdata shadows‚Äù that should still work today.

@ pattimichelle,

With regards,

> ‚ÄúHeh. Humans cannot even safely handle fission tech.‚Äù

The way we currently do it is kind of,

1, Start a nuclear bomb
2, Get the heat in to a pressure cooker bomb
3, Vent off pressure into turbines
4, Hope that the turbines and generators they drive wont lock up or fly apart under changeable rotational forces.

What could possibly go wrong, with that?

That has not already happened one place or another‚Ä¶

Oh and why such power stations are only useful for,

‚ÄúConstant base load that is resistive‚Äù

Which is so 20th century‚Ä¶

The problem being in our drive to being not wasteful this century our loads have become highly reactive and very variable.

Which can sort of be averaged out and power factor corrected if all the loads act as though they are independent within about five times the averaging time.

Even back last century that was not true, with very few entertainment channels on TV and radio and a National Sporting Event the load would go up and down like an express elevator. But it was possible for the skilled technicians in the National Grid to predictively act as part of the control loop and spin up and spin down for peak loads. Such as at half time when everyone put the kettle on‚Ä¶

The recent Iberian Peninsula Peninsular ‚Äúblack out‚Äù that took Spain, Portugal and quite a few other parts of Western Europe ‚Äúoff the European grid‚Äù is still a bit of a mystery‚Ä¶

Back last century the national grids got fast damping from ‚Äúinertial load‚Äù from the ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù rotational mass in the generators and turbines acting like a ‚Äúfly wheel‚Äù.

Highly efficient Green power sources such as Solar has no moving parts so no mechanical storage for fast damping.

Thus you need less efficient wind or wave systems that do have mechanical storage, or you need something else.

Wind is very far from predictable enough to give grid sized fly wheel damping. And whilst wave is more predictable it has a cyclic pattern that does not match the human power require...
