**2022 has been a tumultuous year in terms of geopolitics and global economics.** Alongside the continued evolution of cyber threats, in particular ransomware, these changes have the potential to significantly alter the UK cyber security landscape. For 2023, JUMPSEC predicts that:

### 1. The number of organisations with cyber insurance will shrink, and insurers will fail to pay out on ransomware-related cyber attacks.

In a [key bulletin published in August 2022](https://assets.lloyds.com/media/35926dc8-c885-497b-aed8-6d2f87c1415d/Y5381%20Market%20Bulletin%20-%20Cyber-attack%20exclusions.pdf), Tony Chaudhry, the Underwriting Director of Lloyds, addressed the risk posed by cyber security threats to the insurance industry, stating that “losses have the potential to greatly exceed what the insurance market is able to absorb”.

In response to the rising tide of cyber security incidents, particularly ransomware attacks (as we explored in our recent [Ransomware Trends Report](https://www.jumpsec.com/uk-ransomware-trends-2022/)), cyber insurance providers are now seeking ways to reduce their exposure. This has led to insurance providers raising their premiums, more tightly controlling which costs and impacts are covered by insurance, and generally making insurance harder to acquire by mandating a growing list of prerequisite cyber security controls.

Insurers have also begun to adjust their policies in light of recent disputes, with Lloyds of London stating that it will [stop covering losses from certain nation-state cyber attacks](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/24/lloyds_cybersecurity_insurance/) and those that happen during wars, declared or not, beginning April 1, 2023. Given the proliferation of ransomware attacks of reported Russian origin (as noted in the [recent NCSC Annual Review](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NCSC-Annual-Review-2022.pdf)) and the inherent complexity of attribution in cyber attacks, this could result in the vast proportion of attacks being categorised as ‘nation state’ perpetrated – and therefore outside the scope of many insurance policies.

2022 has seen two pivotal cyber insurance cases: [Merck & Co](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/mercks-1-4-billion-insurance-win-splits-cyber-from-act-of-war) and the [recently resolved Mondelez vs Zurich Insurance dispute](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/02/mondelez_zurich_notpetya_settlement/). Both disputes trace back to the 2017 NotPetya malware attack, which was attributed to Russia’s military intelligence agency and deployed as part of the conflict with Ukraine, with both cases based on the classification of the attack as an ‘act of war’. The former resulted in a $1.4b win for Merck, whilst the Mondelez case was settled behind closed doors – potentially suggesting a less favourable outcome which fell short of Mondelez’s demands.

There is also evidence that insurers have [less appetite to support companies in highly targeted Critical National Infrastructure](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/11/companies-are-finding-it-harder-to-get-cyber-insurance-.html) sectors due to their increased exposure – pa...
