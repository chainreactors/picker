Dear SAP Community members and Technology enthusiasts In Bengaluru ,

Finally , We are bringing [SAP Tech Night](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/bengaluru-blog-posts/announcing-sap-tech-night-bengaluru-25th-nov-2022/ba-p/125799) to India ![:grinning_face:](/html/@90BD21862C1C5CB009555A9B63D570C2/emoticons/1f600.png ":grinning_face:")
