# Sports Streaming Site Streameast Plans to Appeal U.S. Domain Name Seizures

Earlier this month, U.S. law enforcement seized several domain names belonging to popular sports streaming site Streameast. However, instead of shutting down operations, the site is fighting back. After launching new backup domains, the site's operators inform TorrentFreak that they plan to challenge the seizure warrant in court.

The site is particularly popular in the United States, where even the largest sports icons, including LeBron James, have [reportedly used](http://sports streaming) it to stream content.

The appeal of free sports content is understandable, as legal options can cost hundreds of dollars per month. This can lead to legal complications such as those that became apparent earlier this month, when Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) [seized several Streameast domains](https://torrentfreak.com/feds-seize-domain-names-of-sports-streaming-site-streameast-240819/).

“It is unlawful to reproduce or distribute copyrighted material including sporting events, television shows, movies, music, software, or games without authorization. Individuals who do so risk criminal prosecution under Title 18,” the banner explained.

The seizure warrant effectively targeted five domain names, including Streameast’s main home; thestreameast.to. There was no mention of an associated indictment and no further comments from law enforcement that we know of. That remains the case today.

## Streameast Plans to Appeal

What is clear, however, is that these initial domain name seizures didn’t take out Streameast. On the contrary, the site’s operators immediately reassured visitors that they would keep going, and are now considering an appeal against the domain seizure warrant.

Streameast’s operator, ‘quick,’ explains that after extensive efforts, the site finally managed to obtain a copy of the seizure warrant. This raised more questions than it answered.

**The warrant**

The order shown above was sent to the Tonic (.to) registry. Streameast eventually obtained a copy but it did not include any other paperwork. The full docket might contain more information where the allegations are discussed in detail, but Streameast hasn’t seen that.

Based on the paperwork provided, Streameast is planning to appeal the matter in court.

“[The warrant] did not provide any reasons for the shutdown, which is quite intriguing. As a result, we have doubts about the legitimacy of this decision, and we will be filing an appeal in the coming days,” ‘quick’ tells TorrentFreak.

## No Advance Warning

Streameast wasn’t informed about the legal action beforehand. This is not unusual as domain seizures are intended to come as a surprise, so the operators of these sites can’t take precautionary measures.

The popular sports streaming site further informs TorrentFreak that it has never received direct legal threats from copyright holders either; only DMCA notices, which are standard practice for these types of sites.

“We’ve never received any legal threats in the past. However, we constantly receive DMCA requests, which have led us to change hosting providers several times. This is normal given the nature of the business.

“However, before the shutdown requests, we did not receive any official requests,” Streameast’s ‘quick’ notes.

While it may seem unusual for a ‘pirate site’ to challenge the U.S. government on this matter, Streameast is not the first sports streaming site to appeal a domain seizure. Rojadirecta did the same, twelve years ago, and the U.S. authorities eventually [returned the seized domains](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-returns-seized-domains-to-streaming-links-site-after-18-months-120830/).

Times have changed, however, and U.S. law enforcement may have upgraded its procedures to prevent the same from happening again. In addition, the Protecting Lawful Streaming Act ([PLSA](https://torrentfreak.com/new-u-s-streaming-piracy-bill-focuses-on-commercial-services-201211/)) [effectively criminalized](https://torrentfreak.com/us-passes-spending-bill-with-case-act-and-felony-streaming-proposal-201222/) unauthorized streaming services when it became law late 2020.

## New Mirror Domains

Despite the looming threat of criminal charges, Streameast remains devoted to keeping the site online. Following the domain seizures, it established several new mirrors, which are shared through the official Streameast Mirror List.

The sports streaming portal previously said that once access to sports streaming is affordable to everyone, it will shut down. While the site doesn’t have a concrete figure in mind, it believes that current prices are too high.

“While we can somewhat understand the need to pay in today’s world, it’s clear that the current prices are unrealistic. If a sports fan wants to watch all sporting events, including UFC and boxing PPVs, the monthly cost is almost $1500,” Streameast’s ‘quick’ says.

Streameast’s motivation to keep the site online stems from its loyalty to the audience, the operator says. While it clearly makes money from ads, the site cares about its users and stresses that it’s not “in it for the money”.

## Pirate Streaming Gangs

Sports rightsholders will likely paint a different picture, accusing Streameast of being a criminal operation that generates revenue off the backs of companies that invest in live sports.

Interestingly, Streameast doesn’t deny that there are criminal gangs active in the pirate sports streaming business, but they view themselves differently. Instead, the site points a finger at competitors and copycat sites, some of which abuse the Streameast brand.

Many of these ‘fake’ Streameast domains are still operational today, as they weren’t part of the seizure warrant.

“It’s perplexing that while the real Streameast domain names are being seized, the sites created by gangs who set up fake Streameast sites are still operational. These gangs replicate every major streaming site, employing spam tactics to rank high on Google, and they have no ethical values.”

According to Streameast’s operator, many sports streaming sites lost their innocence years ago. Some have reverted to dangerous malware-linked ads, while ‘Asian spam gangs’ are launching copycats left and right, trying to outrank official sites in Google’s search results.

“I wish the USA would choose to deal with these gangs instead of targeting us,” ‘quick’ concludes.
