# Updated WinFE QuickStart Guide

[Brett Shavers](https://winfe.wordpress.com/author/winfe/) / [July 2, 2024](https://winfe.wordpress.com/2024/07/02/updated-winfe-quickstart-guide/)

[![](https://winfe.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cover.jpg?w=480)](https://winfe.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cover.jpg)

Get a **free** copy emailed to you. Plus, get my **Powershell** **script** that does 99% of the building for you (*you have to at least run the script…*).

The Powershell is a simple script that you can probably have ChatGPT make for you or type up in an afternoon, but you can use mine and save the time it takes to get ChatGPT to get it right (or the time to write it yourself).

If you want a **WinFE certification** from one of the long-time OG developers of WinFE and only one of two authorized to teach the Colin Ramsden WinFE build, you will get an incredible one-time offer with the quickstart guide. But that’s only if you want documented training in the reasonable use of a forensically sound bootable operating system (WinFE and otherwise) that bolsters your credibility on the stand. You’ll also get the **PDF of this book** in the training (<https://amzn.to/3zt7upP>)

Get the updated guide (**free**) and Powershell script (**free**) and one-time certification course offer (**$45**) here: **<https://t.co/OAp4oF29w6>**

***Offer expires soon..****like so soon that you should hurry if you want to take advantage of it quick!*
