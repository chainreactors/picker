# Fake DocuSign email hides tricky phishing attempt

Posted: June 27, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

On my daily rounds, I encountered a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempt that used a not completely unusual, yet clever delivery method. What began as a seemingly routine DocuSign notification turned into a multi-layered deception involving Webflow, a shady redirect, and a legitimate Google login page.

Webflow is a visual website builder that allows designers and developers to create custom, responsive websites. It’s a no-code solution that allows users to visually design, build, and launch websites directly in the browser

The attack all starts with an email claiming to be from a known contact, referencing a completed DocuSign document.

![The email asking the receiver to sign an eDocument](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/email_content.jpg)

The email asking the receiver to sign an eDocument

The email passed [SPF, DKIM, and DMARC](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/06/email-spoofing), giving it a false sense of legitimacy. The link to “view the completed document” led to a Webflow preview URL. Designers can use these URLs to prototype websites and showcase their work. At this point, it started to look suspicious but not overtly malicious.

However, preview links are not standard for DocuSign and should always raise eyebrows. A legitimate DocuSign request would point to:

* docusign.com
* docusign.net
* docusign.eu (for European users)

But by going through the legitimate Webflow domain the phishers made sure that their first stage was unlikely to get blocked.

Despite me always advising people not to do that, I clicked through (on a Virtual Machine, not my actual computer).

The Webflow preview displayed a mock DocuSign-style interface with a single button: **“View Document.”**

![The webflow preview page](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/webflow_redacted.jpg)

The webflow preview page

Now it was getting hairy. That button linked to a domain that screamed red flag:
`s‍jw.ywmzoebuntt.es`

The domain looks like a randomized string, a known tactic in phishing infrastructure to evade reputation-based defenses.

Clicking the “View document” button brought me to this fake Captcha which is clearly not designed to stop anyone from proceeding.

![click any 4 images](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/weird_captcha.jpg)

Click any 4 images

Captcha’s are commonly used in phishing schemes to make victims think they’re going through legitimate security verification, but clearly the phishers did not want to overwhelm any potential targets. “Click on any 4 images to prove you’re human” might be the lowest bar ever imagined for a security screening.

After this huge intellectual struggle, I was redirected to Google’s actual login page.

No fake form, no [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) download, just Google. That’s what makes this kind of attack easy to miss and even easier to underestimate.

What likely happened is this: the malicious link briefly displayed a cloaked page for fingerprinting. It harvested browser metadata like [IP address](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address), [user agent](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/08/explained-user-agent), language, screen resolution, and then forwarded me to G...
