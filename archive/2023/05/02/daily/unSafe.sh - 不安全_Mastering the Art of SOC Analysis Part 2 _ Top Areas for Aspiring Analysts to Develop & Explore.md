As cybersecurity threats increase in sophistication and frequency, the demand for skilled Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts continues to rise. In tandem with defensive strategies and advanced security software, SOC analysts fill a critical role in keeping enterprises safe from attacks.

They are responsible for identifying and mitigating oncoming threats, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring the overall security of an organization’s digital assets. Demand for skilled SOC analysts climbs so aspiring defenders need to ensure they have the technical knowledge, analytical skills, and critical thinking abilities required for the job.

This is part two of a three-part blog post series covering the top tips and skills that aspiring analysts will need to master as they begin their journey toward success in the SOC analysis field. In this second post, learn about the top four topics significant to building an understanding of security platforms and tools needed in SOC analysis. Read [Part One](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/mastering-the-art-of-soc-analysis-part-1/) of the blog series here.

## 1. Know Your Cloud

Understanding how cloud computing works and its security risks are becoming increasingly important. Learn cloud concepts and best practices for Incident Response.

In today’s digital world, businesses of all sizes rely heavily on technology to operate efficiently. Effective SOC analysts strive for a deep understanding of the latest technologies and tools used in cybersecurity. One area that is becoming increasingly important is cloud computing.

[Cloud computing](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-computing/) refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of hosting software applications and data on local servers or personal devices, users can access these resources remotely over the internet. Cloud computing services can include infrastructure as a service ([IaaS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-security-understanding-the-difference-between-iaas-and-paas/)), platform as a service ([PaaS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-security-understanding-the-difference-between-iaas-and-paas/)), and software as a service ([SaaS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-storage-to-saas-cybersecurity-the-why/)). Essential cloud concepts for SOC analysts include cloud service models, deployment models, security controls, compliance frameworks, and incident response.

There are many benefits to using cloud computing, such as cost savings, scalability, and flexibility. However, [potential risks](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/demystifying-the-top-5-myths-about-cloud-computing-security/) also need to be considered, such as data security and compliance. As a SOC analyst, it is important to understand cloud computing basics to monitor and respond to security incidents effectively.

Cloud computing has fundamentally changed how IT infrastructure is designed, implemented, and secured. With the adoption of cloud services, traditional security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems are no longer sufficient to protect against [modern cyber threats](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-ransomware-understanding-and-combating-this-evolving-threat/). SOC analysts must now be able to monitor and analyze data from cloud environments and traditional on-premises systems.

One challenge in cloud computing is the [shared responsibility model](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-the-cloud-shared-responsibility-model-a-comprehensive-guide/). Cloud providers are responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for securing their own data and applications. This means that SOC analysts should understand the cloud provider’s and the customer’s [security controls](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-extended-berkeley-packet-filter-ebpf/) to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

## 2. Know Your Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is the backbone of most organizations’ identity and access management systems. A good SOC analyst will thoroughly understand AD concepts like domains, users, groups, and permissions.

[Active Directory (AD)](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/active-directory-security/) is a centralized database that stores information about users, groups, computers, and other resources. It’s the backbone of most organizations’ identity and access management systems and is critical in securing access to sensitive data. Active Directory naturally presents an [attractive target](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/samaccountname-spoofing-kdc-bamboozing/) for attackers.

To effectively [monitor and secure AD](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/staying-secure-in-the-cloud-an-angelneers-interview-with-ely-kahn/), SOC analysts must understand its key concepts, including domains, users, groups, and permissions. Domains are logical groupings of computers and other resources managed as a single unit. Users are individual accounts that are granted access to resources within the domain. Groups are collections of users or computers that are assigned common permissions, and permissions define what actions users can perform on specific resources.

SOC analysts must be able to effectively monitor and manage AD to identify and respond to security incidents. They should thoroughly understand [AD security best practices](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/active-directory-security/), such as implementing strong password policies, restricting administrative access, and regularly auditing AD activity.

They should also be familiar with [AD security tools](https://www.sentinelone.com/resources/choosing-an-active-directory-visibility-solution/), such as Microsoft’s Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console, which allows them to manage users, groups, and other AD objects. Another tool, Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS), is used to manage domain controllers and replication. SOC analysts use AD to perform the following functions:

* Centralized Identity and Access Management – Active Directory is Microsoft’s centralized identity and access management tool, which enables system administrators to manage user accounts and access resources across an entire organization. This is critical for SOC analysts because they must quickly identify who has access to what resources to investigate security incidents properly.
* Log Analysis – AD logs can provide valuable insights into the behavior of users and systems within an organization. SOC analysts need to be able to analyze these logs to detect anomalies and identify potential security threats.
* Group Policy – Active Directory Group Policy allows system administrators to enforce security policies across an organization’s IT infrastructure. This is crucial for SOC analysts because they must quickly identify any security policy violations that could lead to a [security incident](https://www.sentinelone.com/resources/active-directory-security-checklist/).
