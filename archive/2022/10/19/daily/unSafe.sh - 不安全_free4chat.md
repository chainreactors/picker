  + Compatibility
    - Make Safari(WebKit) compatibility better
* **Room**
  + Text chat, can sent text or emoji
    - Persist text messages to browser localStorage
  + Can send arbitrary data by WebRTC datachannel üö©
  + Room permission setting, like public/private type setting
    - private room can't been seen on room discovery, and it needs password to enter. The password is [End-to-End Encryption](https://blog.excalidraw.com/end-to-end-encryption/), server only need check the answer which given by the client like the `PoW` in blockchain.
    - Public rooms discovery, like hot room list or filter rooms by type/tag
* **User**
  + User real-time collaboration, like whiteboard, you draw I guess, etc.
    - Use [CRDT](https://crdt.tech/) to impelement real-time collaboration
      * <https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks>
      * <https://github.com/derekkraan/delta_crdt_ex>
    - Whiteboard
      * <https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw>

      * [ESL Game - Not only practicing English speaking](https://esl.bmpi.dev/)
      * [Gartic.io - Draw, Guess, WIN](https://gartic.io/)

## Architecture

* **Tech Stack**
  + Use Elixir/Phoenix to rewrite the backend code
  + Use Recat/Next.js to rewrite the frontend code
* **Infra**
  + ~~Use docker to deploy to PaaS platform like [Railway](https://railway.app/) or [Fly](https://fly.io/)~~
  + Use GitHub Actions + AWS Lightsail to deploy backend server
  + Backend service cluster, auto scaling, load balancing, etc.
    - Backend service use Elixir libcluster to build cluster
    - Frontend app use the client load balance strategy
    - [TURN cluster scale](https://github.com/membraneframework/membrane_ice_plugin/issues/20)
      * Fix by start turn before the libcluster, still wait the upstream library to fix it normally
  + Security enhancement, like coturn TLS setup, end-to-end encryption, etc.
    - TURN enable TLS
  + Privacy enhancement.
  + IPV6 support.
