# TorrentGalaxy Has a Rough Start Under New Owners (Update)

Popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy is suffering downtime again today. While the site no longer spooks its visitors with cryptic messages, the repeated issues are somewhat unusual. TorrentGalaxy reportedly changed owners, which could partly explain the recent troubles. This is another chapter in the unusual history of the site, which originated in the 1337x chatbox after ExtraTorrent shut down.

TorrentGalaxy has had its fair share of issues over the past few months.

***Update December 9**: The [troubles continue for TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxys-troubles-silence-popular-upload-bots-241210/). After a few days with technical issues, the site is currently unreachable. Perhaps more updates or maintenance? No further information is known but the site’s owners have not informed the staff.*

In June, many users feared that the site had thrown in the towel, displaying only a cryptic message that read [“4ever?”](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-goes-offline-with-mysterious-message-to-users-upd-240614/) to visitors. This came as a surprise, even to the site’s top staffers, who had no clue what was going on.

The site eventually returned as if nothing ever happened and resumed its operations. The purpose of the downtime was never clarified and most people forgot about it until the site [went offline again in September](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-spooks-users-with-more-downtime-240901/) with another cryptic message.

With the rumor mill in full swing, claims from ‘moderators’ about the site’s demise started to circulate. However, those turned out to be unfounded as the site made yet another comeback [after a few days](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-is-back-online-uploads-resume-240904/).

Meanwhile, users began noticing occasional technical issues with the site, including periods of downtime such as today. Visitors to the site currently see the following message: (site’s back on October 18)

“Site is temporarily unavailable due to automated maintenance or some mook spilling coffee in the wrong places.”

TorrentGalaxy Down

These recurring issues are unusual for TorrentGalaxy which never suffered from long stints of downtime in previous years. So, why is this happening now?

## ‘New Owners’

After speaking to several sources, we can now offer some broader context. Apparently, the site has changed owners recently. The initial ‘maintenance’ was presumably part of this handover and could also play a role in other recent issues.

TorrentFreak spoke to one of the TorrentGalaxy’s original founders, who confirmed the change of ownership. We tried to get in touch with the new operators to hear their side of the story, but they haven’t replied.

Takeovers of pirate sites are not uncommon, but given TorrentGalaxy’s community-driven history, this is a noteworthy event.

Finding out more details about the takeover appears impossible, however. The co-founder we spoke to claims not to have been involved in selling the site and the person who was in charge of the sale can’t be reached.

## How it All Began

While we don’t know where the site is heading under its new owners, the co-founder did provide some more background on how TorrentGalaxy got started. That, by itself, is a story worth sharing.

The co-founder prefers to remain anonymous, so here we refer to them using the fictitious nickname “Genesis”. For the record, what follows is the account of one person and should be interpreted as such.

The origin story takes us back to late 2017, when [ExtraTorrent had just shut down](https://torrentfreak.com/extratorrent-shuts-down-for-good-170517/). At the time, Genesis came up with the idea to start a new torrent site. A developer was approached to code it from scratch, but the end result wasn’t satisfactory, so that initial project stranded.

During this time, many former ExtraTorrent members stayed connected, often using the chatbox of another popular torrent site, 1337x. When Genesis shared their plans for a new torrent site there, “Cameron” (another pseudonym), also a former ExtraTorrent user, offered assistance.

Both founders brought something essential to the table. Cameron had plenty of coding experience and took care of all the technical aspects. Meanwhile, Genesis helped out with the finances until the site could sustain itself though advertisements.

Within months, an idea born in a chatbox became TorrentGalaxy, which quickly built a thriving community. In just a few years, ‘TGx’ grew into one of the largest torrent sites, serving millions of visitors each month.

It was already [public knowledge](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-torrents-and-streaming-181104/) that former ExtraTorrent members founded the site, but this backstory adds some more color. What began as a simple chatbox conversation, triggered a transformation worthy of ‘[notorious pirate site status](https://torrentfreak.com/worlds-most-notorious-pirate-sites-listed-in-new-ustr-report-240131/)‘, and the associated legal pressure that comes with it.

The reason for the site’s sale remains unknown. We understand that Genesis and Cameron are no longer in contact. Perhaps they prefer to leave the past behind, regardless of TorrentGalaxy’s future.
