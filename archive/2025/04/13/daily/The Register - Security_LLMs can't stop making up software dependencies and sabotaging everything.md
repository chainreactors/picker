## Hallucinated package names fuel 'slopsquatting'

The rise of LLM-powered code generation tools is reshaping how developers write software - and introducing new risks to the software supply chain in the process.

These AI coding assistants, like large language models in general, have a habit of hallucinating. They suggest code that incorporates software packages that don't exist.

As we noted [in March](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/28/ai_bots_hallucinate_software_packages/) and [September](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/30/ai_code_helpers_invent_packages/) last year, security and academic researchers have found that AI code assistants invent package names. In a recent study, researchers found that about 5.2 percent of package suggestions from commercial models didn't exist, compared to 21.7 percent from open source or openly available models.
