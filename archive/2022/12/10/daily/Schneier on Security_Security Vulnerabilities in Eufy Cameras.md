## Security Vulnerabilities in Eufy Cameras

Eufy cameras claim to be local only, but [upload](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/more-eufy-camera-flaws-found-including-remote-unencrypted-feed-viewing/) [data](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23486753/anker-eufy-security-camera-cloud-private-encryption-authentication-storage) to the cloud. The company is basically lying to reporters, despite being shown evidence to the contrary. The company’s behavior is so egregious that ReviewGeek is [no longer](https://www.reviewgeek.com/138235/why-review-geek-cant-recommend-wyze-or-eufy-cameras-anymore/) recommending them.

This will be interesting to watch. If Eufy can ignore security researchers and the press without there being any repercussions in the market, others will follow suit. And we will lose public shaming as an incentive to improve security.

[Update](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/30/23486753/anker-eufy-security-camera-cloud-private-encryption-authentication-storage):

> After further testing, we’re not seeing the VLC streams begin based solely on the camera detecting motion. We’re not sure if that’s a change since yesterday or something I got wrong in our initial report. It does appear that Eufy is making changes—it appears to have removed access to the method we were using to get the address of our streams, although an address we already obtained is still working.

I think the general population is burning out on worrying about security. Mind numbing mandatory training at work, the plethora of insecure products that everyone has been convinced they ‘need’. I suspect many people just don’t care anymore.

@ Brucr, ALL,

> “And we will lose public shaming as an incentive to improve security.”

We already have, it’s just that we don’t want to belive it.

The first indicators were some years ago with the step up in what many indicated was needless security.

Well it was not needless as both Ed Snowden, Julian Assange and many others some known to us others not have shown.

The US and other Western governments are abusing security to cover up things that oversight, ethics, morals and an inate sence of both decency and shame should have adiquately prevented.

Instead we now have an active state of lying to oversight under oath being not just legal but abused beyond most decent peoples comprehension and an active abuse of legislation against joutnalists and whistleblowers as policy to keep the lid on much that is not just imoral, illegal, or deeply shamefull, it actively causes innocent citizens to be attacked, killed, mained or harmed, because of the kickback of such deeply shamefull brhaviours.

Corporations directors and senior managment actively see themselves as above Government. Thus any behaviour governments carry out that directors and managment consider “usefull” will be adopted.

The fact that government legislators and regulators do not take propperly punitive action against the directors and managers just “green lights” them to further deeply shamefull behaviours.

The recent quite justifiable conviction of a corporate security chief for doing what he knew to be unlawful, is frankly “to little to late”.

The only real result is the C-Suits will become more opaque, they will keep things “out of record” in fairly easy ways that under current rules will prevent further such convictions, bit not the activities.

As with all such human perspective issues of “good or bad” it is a “movable feast” or pendulum that swings either way bassed on the defensive argument you can make, that actually has nothing to do with good/baf right/wrong but everything to do with,

“‘Might is right’ and ‘We’re the good guys’ thinking.”

Not only have we opened a veritable Pandoras Box of issues, we did it by letting the genie out of the bottle.

Where we go from here, almost certainly not be decided by you, me, and the other voting citizens, but by lobyists with a free hand on off shore funds we have no conception of.

But hey,

“That’s the free market way”

From their point of view you and your lifestyle is entirely due to them, so their view will br,

“How dare you question or complaine”

That company doesn’t stand behind its other products. When that product breaks, the only consolation, if you could call it that, is that they will send you a discount coupon to buy another one, at the same price that you can get on Amazon.

What I don’t understand: If you want the cloud to store your data that is expensive – which sounds logical: the cloud provider has to buy all those SSDs.

@ Gunter Königsmann, Brenden Walker,

Re : A picture paints a thousand words.

> “Are my Fotos really worth all that money to someone else?”

I guess that depends on two unknowns

1, Who you realy are.
2, Who the customer might be.

But most if not all the home security cameras appear to work on the fact that “access to images has value”.

The two worst offenders were,

1, Amazon Ring for giving access to “street images” to law enforcment.
2, Palantir for acquiring access via their systems to law enforcment.

You might or might not know that Palantir’s aims is to make all Law Enforcment detectives either redundant or hopelessly hooked on their systems. They aquire data where ever they can…

For instance they did a backroom deal to get all the health records of UK Citizen’s into their databases, why is not known. But it’s been said they had connections with Cambridge Analytica that was alledged to have significantly manipulated US voting and been involved with supply of illegal money from Russia to atleast two U...
