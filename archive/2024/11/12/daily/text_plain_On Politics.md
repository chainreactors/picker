# On Politics

I do not come from an especially political family. One parent has not voted in decades, and the other votes regularly, but is not an enthusiast and values harmony over potentially-divisive political discussions. Politically, I am left of center– the middle child in both age and political leanings: one brother to the left of me, and one brother to the right.

As a kid, my parents thought Republicans were the good guys. Bill Clinton’s depravity didn’t help matters at all. In high school, I had one Political Science teacher who challenged my default *“I’m a Republican, I guess*” posture. I skipped voting for Al Gore when I turned 18 as I didn’t care enough to bother in deep blue Maryland. As a college freshman, I studied early American history and read many of the letters and musings of America’s founders, gaining a much broader understanding of the amazing story behind the founding of this nation, the risks the founders faced, and the compromises that linger to this day. Thus was birthed my interest in [politics](https://textslashplain.com/tag/politics/).

Our Revolutionary Founders (Jefferson in particular), concluded that the only way for a government to be responsive to its citizenry was to have it be periodically overthrown. Rather than suffer the losses and uncertainty of violent overthrow, the notion of **regular, peaceful overthrow of the government** was seen as the best approach. We call these peaceful revolutions *elections*.

> “I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and Constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.”

I watched The West Wing and thought it was brilliant. John Kerry visited Microsoft, gave a nice speech, and I read his book and voted for him in 2004. In 2008, I eagerly voted for Obama, although I greatly respected John McCain until his disastrous choice of running mate. I voted for Obama again in 2012 although I believe, gaffes aside, the country would be just fine under Romney. I watched The Newsroom, and I still believe that [its opening scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WxdaU9AsnU) is the best and most important five minutes of television ever made. In 2016, I voted for Hillary, despairing that Trump was even a *contender* for the nation’s highest office. In 2020, I supported Buttigieg and Warren in the primaries, holding my nose to vote for Biden in the general (*I think Biden is an admirable patriot and his reward for a lifetime of public service should be a pleasant retirement, not working into his 80s.*)

I was furious that Biden announced that he’d run again in 2024, and that both parties had failed to prepare the next generation of leaders to take over. For durable improvements, **Systems > Individuals.**

On the first day of early voting, I voted for Harris, and thought she’d be a fine President for all Americans.

### On The Issues

**Guns** are now the [leading cause of death](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/guns-remain-leading-cause-of-death-for-children-and-teens) for American children. This is an insane travesty, and it’s a stain on our nation that so little has been done about it. More locally, Texas has *significantly loosened* its gun laws over the last twelve years, with predictably tragic results.

My thoughts on civilian ownership of firearms could fill a book. It’s not a simple issue, but the status quo is barbaric and unacceptable.

**Climate Change**: Austin just notched its hottest October in history. Atop Kilimanjaro in 2023, I saw the [sad state of the depleted glaciers](https://textslashplain.com/2023/09/02/kilimanjaro-to-summit/#:~:text=depressingly%20vanishing%20glaciers), and I worry that there may be nothing left when I summit again on New Years’ Eve just before the calendar ticks over to 2026. I can’t help but believe that technology is going to bail us out ([yet again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb#:~:text=The%20book%20has%20been%20criticized,book%2C%20but%20not%20world%20famines.)) and we’ll avoid the worst projections. But we are playing with fire, and we risk activating tipping points we don’t even know about. As with most things, the poor and powerless are going to pay most of the price.

**Taxes**: It’s common for those on the left to scream “*Tax the rich! Make them pay their fair share!*” [This clip from West Wing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nzeJrXFttg) is a great and important one– we *should* tax the rich more (Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, to their credit, both agree). *I’m particularly fond of someone’s joking proposal that we should require the super-wealthy pay higher taxes, and in return get naming rights for infrastructure– $10M for a Post Office, $5M for a Bridge, etc.* All the same, it’s also important to recognize that even if we taxed the rich at a rate of 100%, we would not be able to balance the budget for long.

Still, I’ve come around to the notion that the existence of billionaires is a policy failure, and there are absolutely insane loopholes in the tax code (e.g. [the IRA one](https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank), “step-up basis” on inheritances) that should go away.

I’m infuriated that so many on the right should be voting for higher taxes, but don’t because “*the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires*.” **The rich see you as suckers.**

Hard choices must be made, and our system is such that politicians are punished for making them.

The **Spending** side represents the other side of hard choices; as a society, we must choose how to allocate our limited resources. There are many *worthy* causes, but we cannot afford them all. Prioritization matters.

*For example, the United States is set to spend a trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000!) on modernization of our nuclear arsenal, and I don’t think we talk nearly enough about whether that’s the best way to protect Americans against the true threats of the 21st century.*

Unintended consequences abound: The US has the most expensive educational system and most expensive healthcare system in the world, and that’s not just because of greed– it’s partly because of some well-meaning policy choices we’ve made have had some awful and [unforeseen consequences](https://wapo.st/4iDVWC9). **We should not be afraid to change things, but we must also refine those changes** as we observe their outcomes.

However, it’s almost as great a mistake to think of the United States’ budget as that of a family– money simply works very differently when you control the supply, interest rates, and other key aspects of the worldwide financial system.

When considering an expenditure, we should ask “*Is it an **investment**, neutral, or worsening some larger problem? Is the money going to a fellow citizen, an ally, or an enemy?*” I’d love to see the $800B a year we spend on the military-industrial complex pivoted to the *futu...
