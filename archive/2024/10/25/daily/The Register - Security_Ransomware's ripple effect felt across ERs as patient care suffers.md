Ransomware infected 389 US healthcare organizations this fiscal year, putting patients' lives at risk and costing facilities up to $900,000 a day in downtime alone, according to Microsoft.

In a report published Tuesday, Redmond [recounts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/emerging-threats/US-healthcare-at-risk-strengthening-resiliency-against-ransomware-attacks#modal-dialog) the surging costs – both in terms of patient care and dollars, with the average admitted payment now up to $4.4 million – to hospitals hit by a ransomware attack as well as those nearby.

Keep in mind, these monetary figures are averages. UnitedHealth [spent $776 million](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/14/ransomware_insurance_ban/) to date on network restoration and $1.4 billion on increased medical care expenditures as a result of the Change Healthcare ransomware attack in February.
