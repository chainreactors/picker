## AI and the SEC Whistleblower Program

Tax farming is the practice of licensing tax collection to private contractors. Used heavily in ancient Rome, it’s largely [fallen out of practice](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/abs/perils-of-privatization/ED0CC74ECD0C79B068BB3CE233932B04) because of the obvious [conflict of interest](https://academic.oup.com/book/11909/chapter-abstract/161083634) between the state and the contractor. Because tax farmers are primarily interested in short-term revenue, they have no problem abusing taxpayers and making things worse for them in the long term. Today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaged in a modern-day version of tax farming. And the potential for abuse will grow when the farmers start using artificial intelligence.

In 2009, after Bernie Madoff’s $65 billion Ponzi scheme was exposed, Congress authorized the SEC to award bounties from civil penalties recovered from securities law violators. It worked in a [big way](https://www.sec.gov/files/fy23-annual-report.pdf). In 2012, when the program started, the agency received more than 3,000 tips. By 2020, it had more than doubled, and it more than doubled again by 2023. The SEC now receives more than 50 tips per day, and the program has paid out a staggering $2 billion in bounty awards. According to the agency’s 2023 [financial report](https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/sec-2023-agency-financial-report), the SEC paid out nearly $600 million to whistleblowers last year.

The appeal of the whistleblower program is that it alerts the SEC to violations it may not otherwise uncover, without any additional staff. And since payouts are a percentage of fines collected, it costs the government little to implement.

Unfortunately, the program has resulted in a new industry of private de facto regulatory enforcers. Legal scholar Alexander Platt has [shown](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/yjor40&div=16&id=&page=) how the SEC’s whistleblower program has effectively privatized a huge portion of financial regulatory enforcement. There is a role for publicly sourced information in securities regulatory enforcement, just as there has been in litigation for antitrust and other areas of the law. But the SEC program, and a similar one at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has created a market distortion replete with perverse incentives. Like the tax farmers of history, the interests of the whistleblowers don’t match those of the government.

First, while the blockbuster awards paid out to whistleblowers draw attention to the SEC’s successes, they obscure the fact that its staffing level has slightly [declined](https://bettermarkets.org/analysis/sec-staffing-levels-have-not-kept-pace-with-growth-of-the-markets/) during a period of tremendous market growth. In one [case](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-89), the SEC’s largest ever, it paid $279 million to an individual whistleblower. That single award was nearly one-third of the funding of the SEC’s entire enforcement division last year. Congress gets to pat itself on the back for spinning up a program that pays for itself (by law, the SEC awards 10 to 30 percent of their penalty collections over $1 million to qualifying whistleblowers), when it should be talking about whether or not it’s given the agency enough resources to fulfill its mission to “maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.”

Second, while the [stated](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/whistleblower-program/whistleblower-frequently-asked-questions#faq-1) purpose of the whistleblower program is to incentivize individuals to come forward with information about potential violations of securities law, this hasn’t actually led to increases in [enforcement](https://www.cornerstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SEC-Enforcement-Public-Companies-Subsidiaries-FY2023.pdf) actions. Instead of legitimate whistleblowers bringing the most credible information to the SEC, the agency now seems to be deluged by tips that are not highly actionable.

But the biggest problem is that uncovering corporate malfeasance is now a legitimate business model, resulting in powerful firms and misaligned incentives. A single [law practice](https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/ex-labaton-sucharow-quintet-launch-firm-for-sec-whistleblowers-1334356223) led by former SEC assistant director [Jordan Thomas](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/24/jordan-thomas-army-of-whistle-blowers) captured about 20 percent of all the SEC’s whistleblower awards through 2022, at which point Thomas left to open up a new [firm](https://www.globallegalpost.com/news/ex-labaton-sucharow-quintet-launch-firm-for-sec-whistleblowers-1334356223) focused exclusively on whistleblowers. We can admire Thomas and his team’s impact on making those guilty of white-collar crimes pay, and also question whether hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties should be funneled through the hands of an SEC insider turned for-profit business mogul.

Whistleblower tips can be used as weapons of corporate warfare. SEC whistleblower complaints are not required to come from inside a company, or even to rely on insider information. They can be filed on the basis of public data, as long as the whistleblower brings original analysis. Companies might dig up dirt on their competitors and submit tips to the SEC. Ransomware groups have used the threat of SEC whistleblower tips as a tactic to [pressure](https://wp.nyu.edu/compliance_enforcement/2023/11/29/hackers-turned-whistleblowers-sec-cybersecurity-rules-weaponized-over-ransom-threat/) the companies they’ve infiltrated into paying ransoms.

The rise of whistleblower firms could lead to them taking particular “assignments” for a fee. Can a company hire one of these firms to investigate its competitors? Can an industry lobbying group under scrutiny (perhaps in [cryptocurrencies](https://cooleypubco.com/2023/04/03/house-questions-sec-chair/)) pay firms to look at other industries instead and tie up SEC resources? When a firm finds a potential regulatory violation, do they approach the company at fault and offer to cease their research for a “kill fee”? The lack of transparency and accountability of the program means that the whistleblowing firms can get away with practices like these, which would be wholly unacceptable if perpetrated by the SEC itself.

Whistleblowing firms can also use the information they uncover to guide market investments by [activist short sellers](https://sbi.sydney.edu.au/the-rise-of-the-value-destroyers-activist-short-sellers/). Since 2006, the investigative reporting site [Sharesleuth](https://sharesleuth.com/about-us/) [claims](https://sharesleuth.com/results/) to have tanked dozens of stocks and instigated at least eight SEC cases against companies in pharma, energy, logistics,...
