In episode 63 of The AI Fix, Unitree Robotics looks to Black Mirror episode ‚ÄúMetalhead‚Äù for tips on marketing its new robot dog, ChatGPT is secretly running Sweden, OpenAI introduces its first open weight model since GPT-2, and your private and personal ChatGPT conversations could be all over Google.

Plus, Mark cuts through the GPT-5 hype and asks ‚Äì is it AGI or just a fancy purple background, and Graham looks at ‚Äúdeadbots‚Äù and a disturbing interview between Jim Acosta and an AI version of a teenager killed in a school shooting.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
