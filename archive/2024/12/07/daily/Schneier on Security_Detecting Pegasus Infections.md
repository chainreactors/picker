## Detecting Pegasus Infections

[This tool](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/) seems to do a pretty good job.

> The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify’s infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.

1. a super way to help Peggy adapt to cover its tracks better
2. to the extent Peg can fool this tool, ppl will be misled
3. a good way to identify surveillance conscious or surveillance evadimg people

why arent these features built into operating systems

@ ALL

A couple of related notes.

Firstly it’s not just NSO et al doing this spying on your Mobiles and Smart devices. This story from a couple of days back is about the Russian FSB and their toys from a different box,

<https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/06/badass_russian_techie_outsmarts_fsb/>

Secondly, on a preventative measure, who remembers certain people going on about the evils of “End 2 End Encryption”(E2EE) and how LEO’s had to have ways to stop it?

Yeah well most readers hear could work out the “trouser butt polishers” over at the desk chairs in the FBI DoJ and various other National and State Law Enforcement and Other Agencies were “blowing smoke”…

But these bad ideas tend to linger in the least pleasant of malodorous ways. So imagine my surprise…

Look what has “slipped in” to the latest CISA Hardening Guidence,

“Enhanced Visibility and Hardening Guidance for Communications Infrastructure”

Released on the 4th Dec at,

<https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure>

You will find in there,

> ***Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.***

Yup read that twice the FBI presumably under influence of others now says E2EE is good…

*Re: why arent these features built into operating systems*

The developers use machine learning to analyze the kernel for signs of spyware.

FSB spyware disguised as an app.

@ ResearcherZero,

With regards FSB it looks like we have the same security item but from different reports.

As far as I can tell, the FSB are still acting “More boots than brains” and it’s why we got to hear about just a little more that is going on toward the East of Europe.

From the news it would appear things are going on in the MidEast and the kinetic support “The English Dentist” was getting has like morning mist either evaporated or gone to ground.

Then there is the alleged use of TikTok by several thousand mist like beings or ghosts in Romania but more likely from the same place that “The English Dentist” got his support,

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg6l06ldpqo>

There are clear warnings being given that the Romanian people need to be mindful of this centuries history with Belarus and Ukraine and kinetic and other “supportive action” from the East.

@Clive

As the TLAs cannot protect *Americans that count*™ against foreign interference anymore, they have to tell these Important Americans to protect themselves.

I think we should not assume this advice extends to other Americans.

@ Winter, ALL,

With regards,

> “I think we should not assume this advice extends to other Americans.”

Or others that are not Americans, as it was in effect,

“The truth acknowledged under duress by the FBI, from their usual lies and nonsense since before the 1990’s and Crypto Wars One.”

So maybe we should thank not just the Western Agencies that eventually pushed for the truth, but also in a way the Foreign National Powers(s) that put the pressure on those agencies.

After all you and I as well as several others who read here can and did work out by simple logic that what ever silly name you gave these unwarranted access methods they would as history almost always shows

“Be abused, not just by those that can get legislated access, but also by those who should not get any access at any time.”

But we should also consider just how good or in reality bad is the advice “use E2EE”?
