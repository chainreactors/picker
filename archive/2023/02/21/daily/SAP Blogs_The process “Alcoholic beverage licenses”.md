**Digital Government:** The motivation of this blog is to provide a general description of the best practices implemented by the public administration of the Government of the State of Guanajuato applying various resources and SAP technology for the optimization of processes, this in order to improve the services provided to the citizenship and the state.

**INTRODUCTION**

The department Ministry of Finance, Investment, and Administration by the Government of the State of Guanajuato is the state public administration with the largest SAP implementation in Mexico. The department has been using SAP tools for 25 years, starting with the accounting and budgeting modules. Over the years, GRP functionalities have been enabled to strengthen the operation. Currently, there are financial, logistics, human resources, and collection modules such as SAP PS, FM, CO, GL, AA, AR, AP, TR, HCM, PM, MM, TRM, and SAP subsequently such as SRM and BW. Consolidating in platform the procedure in which more than 219 administrative units operate, thus becoming the transversal IT platform of the Government of the State of Guanajuato, allowing the managing, organizing, and automation of its principal needs.

The Ministry of Finance, Investment, and Administration, through the use of SAP tools, efficiently and responsibly manages the State Treasury through the TRM module. Thereby performing 100% of the collection, which has a taxpayer base of more than 3,000,000 taxpayers. This is carried out through 100 physical offices (collection offices), 26 commercial chains, and more than 1,600 payment points.

In a cross-cutting manner and through SAP's financial and logistics lines of business (through SRM), we work with more than 21,646 suppliers of the Government of Guanajuato, to carry out the state's purchasing procedures. Additionally, the invoice procedure is generated through SAP PI, VIM, and OpenText.

Through the SAP HCM module and its sub-modules, processing by human resources the payroll of 26,038 governmental employees.

Moreover, through the PO solution, the department of finance integrates and connects 149 systems (portals, apps, applications, and services). Of these systems 50 are direct points of contact with the citizens, 80 are portals for the operation of the state government, 10 systems are for administrative procedures of the department, 4 are for investments and auctions, and finally, 5 are for Decentralized Organizations and Districts.

Thus, through the GRP SAP, 20 departments, 53 local state companies, 6 independent agencies, 36 districts, 101 counties, and 2 trusts are administered, all to strengthen public administration and provide transparency to the citizens.

**PROJECT**

The main objective of organizing the process related to alcoholic beverages is to make it easier for citizens to carry out the corresponding procedure. It is allowing them to carry out such procedures from any device, time, and place with state-of-the-art technology. An additional objective is to facilitate the task for the validation team (Pull de Validaciones) of the Tax Administration Service of the State of Guanajuato. The main function of this agency is to improve the quality of services to taxpayers and strengthen the tax cycle, thus increasing local tax collection efficiently, and obtaining information related to the entire process of alcoholic beverage procedures. Subsequently allows for feedback to be provided to taxpayers with information related to their procedures, thus being able to manage, completely and efficiently, the data belonging to the State Alcoholic Beverage Registration of the State of Guanajuato.

Resulting of an Enterprise Service Bus (Cx Messenger) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), bidirectional communication with SAP was implemented to obtain and provide feedback on historical financial information, and information from the State Alcoholic Beverages Registry of the Integrated Tax Administration System of the State of Guanajuato. Which is one of the ECC systems currently used by the Government of Guanajuato.
