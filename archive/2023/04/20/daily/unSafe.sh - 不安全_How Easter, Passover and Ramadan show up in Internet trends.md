The weather usually starts to become sunnier in most of the Northern Hemisphere in April. Springtime is here, and national holidays give people more time off. Between April 7 and 10, 2023, Easter was celebrated in dozens of countries worldwide. One week later, on April 16, it was time for the Orthodox Easter. Did the [Christian holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) have an impact on Internet traffic trends?

Spoiler alert: in several countries, it did. In Italy, Poland, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, the US, Mexico, and Australia, the Easter long weekend, with or without chocolate Easter bunnies or eggs, had one of the days with the least traffic of 2023 so far, more than 100 days into the year.

If we had to pick “winners”, in terms of Easter online impact, we would have an Easter Sunday podium with: **Poland (22% drop in traffic), Italy (18%), France (16%)**.Mexico and Spain have special mentions, given that both were impacted during the “Semana Santa”, Holy Week.

In terms of the Easter Sunday lunch, Italy seems to have no match, given that traffic dropped 38% at around 13:00 local time. Spain took the Good Friday lunch Internet impact prize (28% drop ~13:00).

To do this comparison, we’re using Cloudflare’s worldwide data that could be seen and used in action (live) on [Cloudflare Radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/), given that we help more than 20% of websites on the Internet. Although the charts presented are in UTC, we’re using local time in the text for local clarity.

Next, we are selecting countries where Christianity is prominent, and there are clear Easter “egg” Internet trends. It will become evident that there are Easter days more impactful in some countries than Easter Sunday itself. We also show some Orthodox Easter (where Greece is most impacted), Ramadan and Passover trends. This is a year when several of the religious celebrations occurred around the same time, something that is not common, although it also happened last year. The last time before that was [33 years](https://www.newsweek.com/rare-calendar-alignment-easter-passover-ramadan-2022-converge-1698384) prior.

## Europe: What a difference Easter weekend makes

### Italy: Top five days with the lowest traffic in 2023 (so far)

*#1. Easter Sunday, April 9 (-18%, compared with previous week)*

*Easter related days are in italics*

Easter, known as "Pasqua" in Italian, is a significant religious holiday in Italy. As a predominantly Catholic country with a strong connection to the Vatican and its traditions, Italy has a rich array of traditions and customs. That shows in our Internet traffic trends in 2023, so far.

Easter Sunday, April 9, known as "Pasquetta" in Italy, was clearly the day with lowest Internet traffic, and only January 1 sits in front of other two Easter days, that include Easter Monday, also a national holiday there. Traffic was 18% lower during the "Pasquetta" than on the previous Sunday, a similar percentage of drop on Easter Monday.

Usually, Saturdays are the days with low traffic in the country, and Mondays and Sundays are the days with the most traffic.

What was the time the Easter Sunday effect seemed to have a bigger Internet impact in Italy? Between 13:00 and 15:00 local time, when traffic dropped ~37% compared with the previous week. It was similar on Easter Monday, with a 36% decrease in traffic at ~13:00.
