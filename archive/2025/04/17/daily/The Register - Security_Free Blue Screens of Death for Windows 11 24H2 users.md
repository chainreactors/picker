Keeping with its rich history of updates that break Windows in unexpected ways, Microsoft has warned that two recent patches for Windows 11 24H2 are triggering blue screen crashes.

The software in question, April cumulative update [KB5055523](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-8-2025-kb5055523-os-build-26100-3775-277a9d11-6ebf-410c-99f7-8c61957461eb) and March preview update [KB5053656](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-27-2025-kb5053656-os-build-26100-3624-preview-4c35f1c4-1ae6-41ef-a317-3d8ee2e73975), are causing the freeze-ups on devices running [Windows 11 24H2](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/14/windows_11_24h2_hold/), Microsoft said, and appear after either update is installed and the system is rebooted.

"You might encounter a blue screen exception with error code 0x18B indicating a SECURE\_KERNEL\_ERROR," Microsoft's documentation for both patches reads.
