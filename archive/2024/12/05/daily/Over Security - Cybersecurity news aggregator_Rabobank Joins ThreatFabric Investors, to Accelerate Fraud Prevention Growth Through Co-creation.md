*“We believe in close collaboration with our customers to elevate our products to enterprise-grade standards. I’m thrilled that Rabobank is now more than just a customer. Our journey together began nearly two decades ago with security code reviews on Rabobank’s first online banking product. Today, they are partners. Their invaluable expertise in fraud prevention strengthens our shared mission, and their trust in us reinforces our belief in our purpose.”*

Anton Jan Cozijnsen, Rabobank’s leader in fraud detection, echoed these sentiments:
*“We’ve worked with ThreatFabric closely for years and actively collaborate on their product roadmap. Co-creation is what makes their product suites so effective. We’re excited to extend this partnership and continue driving innovation together.”*
