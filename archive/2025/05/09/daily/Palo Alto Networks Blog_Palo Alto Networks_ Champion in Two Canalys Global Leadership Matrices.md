## Palo Alto Networks Is Recognized for Excellence in the Channel and Cybersecurity Quadrants for 2025

We are honored to announce that we have been named a Champion in not one, but two Canalys Global Leadership matrices for 2025 – the first-ever Canalys Global Channel Leadership Matrix and the Canalys Global Cybersecurity Leadership Matrix. These placements highlight our commitment to supporting partner growth while helping our customers solve their complex cybersecurity challenges with comprehensive, AI-powered cybersecurity solutions.

Canalys, a leading global technology market research firm, specializing in channel-focused IT research, is a trusted source of industry insights. These Canalys Global Leadership matrices are vital benchmarks within the technology industry, assessing vendor performance and strategic positioning. They are highly regarded for their comprehensive methodology, which combines analyst assessments, key performance metrics and crucial partner ecosystem feedback to determine vendor standing.

**Alastair Edwards, Chief Analyst at Canalys, said:**

> Champion status in the Global Cybersecurity and Global Channel Leadership matrices signifies excellence in channel management, robust market performance and ongoing momentum. Based on our assessment, which included analyst expertise and significant partner feedback, Palo Alto Networks demonstrated these qualities, earning Champion recognition in both matrices.

## Partner-Centric Initiatives

At Palo Alto Networks, we are committed to a partner-led go-to-market strategy, constantly listening and evolving to drive growth opportunities and increase our partners' profitability. We recently evolved our [NextWave Partner Program](/partners) to introduce a single program framework for five different partner models while also enhancing pricing and rebate programs. In addition, we have improved the low-touch sales model used by distributors, accelerated marketplace transactions and increased membership significantly in our [CYBERFORCE](/cyberforce) technical program as partners continue to invest in their knowledge and skills for products by Palo Alto Networks.

These initiatives directly support partner success, a key factor in our Channel Leadership ranking. Our approach in hyperscaler marketplaces has also been highly partner-centric, with our partners generating 70 percent of marketplace sales.

### Platformization and Partners as Trusted Advisors

With [over 90% of the projected $281 billion cybersecurity spending in 2025](https://www.canalys.com/insights/cybersecurity-leadership-matrix-2025) expected to involve partners, and with customers requiring increasingly comprehensive, proactive and AI-driven security solutions due to escalating threats, vendors rely on partners for scale and impact. The Canalys matrix highlights vendors who are most effectively engaging and enabling partners.

Our platformization strategy, announced in 2024, played a significant role in our ranking. Platformization helps address the complexity of modern customer environments by providing integrated platforms that eliminate silos, streamline operations and enhance security outcomes, offering better security outcomes than disparate point products.

Our partners are critical to helping customers move toward platformization. They add value throughout the customer lifecycle, from solution development and proposal to resale, distribution, support and managed services. When customers buy cybersecurity solutions, they seek to solve challenges, and partners act as trusted advisors to help them solve their most complex security challenges.

## Partners and Customers Are Integral to This Success

This recognition is not just about Palo Alto Networks; it is a testament to the strength of our ecosystem and the value we deliver to our partners together. The Canalys methodology for both matrices are data-driven, relying heavily on partner ecosystem feedback. This feedback from the partner community focuses on programs, enablement, sales engagement and partner experience metrics so that the rankings reflect the community's real-world experience and sentiment.

Being named a Champion in both matrices recognizes our capabilities and highlights the strength of our partner ecosystem in enabling success for our joint customers. We extend our heartfelt thanks to our partners and customers for their continued collaboration and feedback, which were integral to achieving this recognition.
