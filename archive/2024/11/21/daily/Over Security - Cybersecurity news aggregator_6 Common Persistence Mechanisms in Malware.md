6 Common Persistence Mechanisms in Malware

Persistence mechanisms are techniques used by attackers to keep malware active, even after log-offs, reboots, or restarts. In other words, they’re techniques that make malware tougher to detect and even harder to remove once it’s on a system.

Let’s dive into a few of the common mechanisms attackers use to keep their malware persistent, quietly doing its work in the background.

## What’s Persistence in Cybersecurity?

In cybersecurity, persistence refers to the ability of malware or an attacker to maintain access to a compromised system over time.

A persistence mechanism is a tool or a technique that allows malware or unauthorized users to stay embedded within a system without needing to reinitiate the attack every time the system restarts.

For cyber attackers, persistence can be useful for activities like data theft, surveillance, and further spreading of malware.

These mechanisms can be simple, such as adding files to the system’s startup folder. They also get more complicated, like modifying system registry keys or even embedding code into core system processes

Let’s explore some of the mechanisms, see which of the following are commonly used for malware persistence, and detect them with the help of [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=persistence&utm_term=201124&utm_content=linktolanding).

## 1. Startup Directory Execution

**MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1547.001**

One of the go-to techniques for malware persistence is dropping files in the Startup directory.

When a program is placed in the Startup folder on a Windows system, it automatically runs every time the user logs in.

 It’s a straightforward, built-in function. Windows lets you put programs there for convenience, so your favorite apps or tools can launch without you having to click anything.

Attackers know this and use it to their advantage to develop Windows persistence techniques. They sneak a malicious file into the Startup folder, so each time the computer boots up, their malware launches too, right along with everything else.

Why is this technique effective? Well, most people don’t ever look in their Startup folder, so it’s easy for these files to go unnoticed. Plus, it doesn’t take a lot of effort for malware to blend in here. It just quietly restarts itself with every logon or reboot without raising obvious alarms.

We can observe this persistence mechanism inside the [following sandbox session](https://app.any.run/tasks/1d05d194-7423-49f6-a0ef-0d964abaad0e/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=persistence&utm_term=201124&utm_content=linktoservice). Here, the Snake [Keylogger](https://any.run/malware-trends/keylogger) malware adds malicious files inside the Startup directory of the Windows system.

To see this in the ANY.RUN sandbox, check the **[Process Tree](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/process-tree-analysis/)** on the right side of the screen, where you’ll find the malware’s actions demonstrated.

Click on it to get further details.

In this case, the file is created in the following location *C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup*, which is the Startup folder on a Windows system.

## 2. Registry Autorun Key Modification

**MITRE ATT&CK ID: T1547.001**

Creating files in the Startup directory is a simpler approach. It doesn’t require any changes to the system’s registry or deep permissions, and it’s a method users could technically spot by checking their Startup folder.

On the other hand, Registry Autorun key modification dives a bit deeper. By creating or modifying specific registry keys, malware can make su...
