[Last year](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/low-budget-should-not-mean-high-risk-kids-tablet-came-preloaded-sketchyware), we investigated a Dragon Touch children’s tablet ([KidzPad Y88X 10](https://web.archive.org/web/20220404100853/https%3A//www.amazon.com/dp/B08DNV8SHH/)) and confirmed that it was linked to a string of fully compromised [Android TV Boxes](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/05/android-tv-boxes-sold-amazon-come-pre-loaded-malware) that also had [multiple](https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/badbox-peachpit-and-the-fraudulent-device-in-your-delivery-box) [reports](https://github.com/DesktopECHO/T95-H616-Malware/tree/main) of malware, adware, and a sketchy firmware update channel. Since then, Google has taken the ([now former](https://dragontouch.com/)) tablet distributor off of their list of [Play Protect certified phones and tablets](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/#tab-panel-brands). The burden of catching this type of threat should not be placed on the consumer. Due diligence by manufacturers, distributors, and resellers is the only way to tackle this issue of pre-installed compromised devices making their way into the hands of unknowing customers. But in order to mitigate this issue, regulation and transparency need to be a part of the strategy.

As of October, Dragon Touch is not selling any tablets on their website anymore. However, there is lingering inventory still out there in places like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/DragonTouch/page/772437F4-...
