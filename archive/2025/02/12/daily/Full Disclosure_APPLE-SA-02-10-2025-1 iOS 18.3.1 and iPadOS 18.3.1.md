This update is available through iTunes and Software Update on your
iOS device, and will not appear in your computer's Software Update
application, or in the Apple Downloads site. Make sure you have an
Internet connection and have installed the latest version of iTunes
from https://www.apple.com/itunes/

iTunes and Software Update on the device will automatically check
Apple's update server on its weekly schedule. When an update is
detected, it is downloaded and the option to be installed is
presented to the user when the iOS device is docked. We recommend
applying the update immediately if possible. Selecting
Don't Install will present the option the next time you connect
your iOS device.

The automatic update process may take up to a week depending on
the day that iTunes or the device checks for updates. You may
manually obtain the update via the Check for Updates button
within iTunes, or the Software Update on your device.

To check that the iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad has been updated:

* Navigate to Settings
* Select General
* Select About. The version after applying this update will be
"iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1".

All information is also posted on the Apple Security Releases
web site: https://support.apple.com/100100.
