# Singapore hosts ICS/OT cybersecurity training extravaganza

## Two great SANS events for APAC cyber security professionals to boost their ICS knowledge and skills

Sponsored Post Cybercriminals generally respect no limits or boundaries, but there is evidence to suggest that they are singling out industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) systems such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) platforms in the Asia Pacific region which may represent easier targets for their attention.

A report published by Deloitte in 2020 - [Building cyber security into critical infrastructure: Protecting industrial control systems in Asia Pacific](https://www2.deloitte.com/cn/en/pages/risk/articles/building-cyber-security-into-critical-infrastructure.html) – concluded that critical infrastructure operators in Asia Pacific are being increasingly targeted by cyber espionage and sophisticated attacks which can severely disrupt essential services, including energy and water supplies. Deloitte also found that while organizations in APAC are ramping up their efforts to better secure the IT/OT infrastructure they own and operate, many of the measures in place remain immature and present significant scope for improvement.

APAC cyber security professionals cannot afford to drop their guard for a second, but ICS/OT systems present some unique challenges when it comes to making sure they are safeguarded from unauthorized access, data theft and disruption. Specialist knowledge and training is needed to ensure optimum protection, and what better way to get it than through SANS cyber security training events tailored specifically for the region.
