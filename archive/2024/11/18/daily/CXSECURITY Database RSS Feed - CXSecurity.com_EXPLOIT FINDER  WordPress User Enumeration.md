With this code, you can search Google and isolate the sites that have this security issue and test which ones have the WP JSON/WP/V2/Users API endpoint, which allows you to retrieve user data such as user ID, username, email address, and other user profile information. You can also use the API to update user data, such as changing a user's password or updating their profile information.
