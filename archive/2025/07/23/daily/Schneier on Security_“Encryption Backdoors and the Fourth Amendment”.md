## “Encryption Backdoors and the Fourth Amendment”

Law journal [article](https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/mulr/vol108/iss2/5/) that looks at the [Dual\_EC\_PRNG backdoor](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html) from a US constitutional perspective:

> **Abstract**: The National Security Agency (NSA) reportedly paid and pressured technology companies to trick their customers into using vulnerable encryption products. This Article examines whether any of three theories removed the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that this be reasonable. The first is that a challenge to the encryption backdoor might fail for want of a search or seizure. The Article rejects this both because the Amendment reaches some vulnerabilities apart from the searches and seizures they enable and because the creation of this vulnerability was itself a search or seizure. The second is that the role of the technology companies might have brought this backdoor within the private-search doctrine. The Article criticizes the doctrine­ particularly its origins in Burdeau v. McDowell­and argues that if it ever should apply, it should not here. The last is that the customers might have waived their Fourth Amendment rights under the third-party doctrine. The Article rejects this both because the customers were not on notice of the backdoor and because historical understandings of the Amendment would not have tolerated it. The Article concludes that none of these theories removed the Amendment’s reasonableness requirement.

As an outsider looking in, it seems to me that the idea that the US constitution matters any more is sort of touching!

Stories like this come round often; I read many years ago that Microsoft had given the FBI a back door. Whether it’s true or not I don’t know. However I have never trusted most technology companies. When I do trust a company I still encrypt information saved on secure cloud servers, even if they based in Switzerland or Norway. I trust these companies but government laws may change as they have recently in Germany and Holland.

I am not a constitutional lawyer but surely this also comes under the other privacy amendments, such as the fifth.

It comes back to “don’t talk to law enforcement”.

Anything you admit, no matter how insignificant it appears to you (such as your location), is something that they have to prove that they discovered in a lawful way.

Lawful usually means that firstly *you* were suspected for an articularable (!) reason, and that a judicial warrant was obtained to get the confirmation. In that order.

I had the same “question”. Then someone made me realize.

Consider it this way. Would the Catholic Church, or any Orthodox church decide the bible does not matter anymore?

Without The Constitution, the whole idea if The United States does not make sense anymore.

@ Paul,

With regards,

> *“As an outsider looking in, it seems to me that the idea that the US constitution matters any more is sort of touching!”*

Also as an outsider, I take a more extreme view of what is being done to the Constitution.

Put bluntly,

“There is no profit in the constitution.”

For those “self entitled” who view their views and incomes to be of the first importance.

About half of the US “economic activity” is based on the five or so Silicon Valley Mega Corps like Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and even Apple.

Thus what they say gets “legislator attention” in ways few of us can get our heads around.

If just one of those Corps was to fail then what happened with the Sub-Prime Mortgage will be considered just an economic side note. And as we know Sub-Prime led to a global recession we are still trying to climb out of and failing miserably to do so.

Most of those Mega Corps make their income from surveillance of their users, packaging their personal and private information up and pushing it out into what is laughingly called the “Advertising Market”.

Of course US legislation is going to ensure this continues as much as possible. But there is of course a cut out… To benefit from legislative protection the Mega Corps have to hand the “personal and private” user data across to the Government for no cost…

Bad for the 350million bodies in the US but consider the 8billion in the rest of the world who don’t even get the fig leaf of the shadow of the constitution.

My view point is in effect two fold,

1, Reliably encrypt everything you type that is even remotely personal and private.

Also be circumspect about what you do on line because it will be recorded and analysed.

Remember what was attributed to Cardinal Richelieu,

> *“If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.”*

Well these days it’s rather more than that, in that it’s not what you write or say by which you will be hanged, it’s also where your eyes may wander.

All this “think of the children” nonsense with “age verification” has next to nothing to do with protecting anyone including children. In fact it is the very opposit, it’s being used to extract all sorts of personal and private data for profit.

Honest Services Fraud (18 U.S. Code § 1346) would seem to apply, here. I was a little taken aback to see no men...
