Bridging the Threat Intelligence Gap in Your SOC: A Guide for Security Leaders

As we highlighted in our article on [building threat resilience in enterprises](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/enterprise-cyber-threat-resilience/), one of the key challenges that stand before CISOs is ensuring proactive security. Reacting to incidents is no longer enough; you need to anticipate upcoming threats.

To achieve this, your team needs powerful solutions that meet your criteria and deliver fast results. Explore our step-by-step guide on integrating threat intelligence into your workflow with [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=threat_intel_for_soc&utm_term=130825&utm_content=linktolanding)’s TI Lookup and TI Feeds, solutions trusted by [15,000+ organizations](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-from-organizations/) across diverse industries.

## Find a Source for Intel That Fits Your SOC

Threat intelligence is a crucial component of modern SOC operations. Implementing it increases threat detection rates, speeds up incident response, and strengthens overall defense against emerging threats.

When choosing a threat intel solution, prioritize reliability of data, rich context that comes with indicators, and constant updates that will keep you on top of things.

Being an enterprise-grade service, [**Threat Intelligence Feeds**](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=threat_intel_for_soc&utm_term=130825&utm_content=linktofeeds)meets these standards. It delivers fast, fresh intelligence gained from threat investigations by 15,000 SOC teams. Each indicator, be that IP, domain, or URL, is linked to [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://app.any.run/) analysis of malware, enabling you to observe its impact, activities, and overall context in one click.

Enrich your SIEM, TIP, or XDR system with TI Feeds for:

* **Expanded Coverage**: ANY.RUN’s exclusive IOCs come from Memory Dumps, Suricata IDS, in-browser data, and internal threat categorization systems, increasing the chance of detection of the most evasive threats.

* **Reduced Workload**: The indicators are pre-processed to avoid false positives and ready to be used for malware analysis or incident investigation.

* **Informed Response**: Rich metadata provided for IOCs gives you the context for in-depth threat investigations and faster response.

Broaden your threat coverage with TI Feeds

Steady monitoring and expanded threat coverage provided by solutions like TI Feeds are important for maintaining a robust defense system. The next challenge is finding a way to browse, identify, and enrich indicators quickly.

In other words, you need targeted, fast access to threat intelligence, for both proactive threat hunting and swift incident response. That’s just what [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=threat_intel_for_soc&utm_term=130825&utm_content=linktolookup) provides. For analysts, it’s like a fishing rod with which they can catch exactly what they’re looking for in the sea of extensive data on threats: for example, quick verdicts on suspicious IPs or additional info on malicious indicators.

Equipping your team with TI Lookup means that your SOC will reach:

* **Faster Triage and Data-Fueled Response:** Check any indicator in seconds, identify malicious activity, and enriched it with more inf...
