**SAP® Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain 2211** is about to be to available for use on 29th Oct 2022 for all the Non-Production Tenants and on 12th Nov 2022 for all the Production Tenants. From the Doc Info **'Preliminary What's New 1.0 - September 26, 2022'**for SAP IBP 2211, I gathered some useful administrative and consultant specific features that we are about to get with this upgrade.

#### **1. Maintain Job Users App**

We often get stuck with the Application Job Management when the responsible person is leaving the department or the organization itself. This app is a savior thereby handing over the ownership of any application job to a job user.

#### **2. Sharing Content with Write Access**

While performing the share of the below contents using 'Content Administrator' App for any User/User Group, We can chose to grant the Write Access as well.

* Alert definition

* Alert subscription

* Alerts overview

* Analytics chart

* Analytics story

* Dashboard

* Intelligent visibility profile

* Planner workspace

* Procedure playbook

#### **3. SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel - Sorting Based on Key Figure Values**

Sorting based on Keyfigure Values is an undiscussed need that the Planners wants to have in the Excel Add-In. Now it is going to be a default feature of Excel Addin 2211 and above.

#### **4. SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel - Copy Planning View Settings to Application Jobs**

While getting into Application Jobs section in the Excel Addin, Planning View settings such as Scenarios, Versions, Planning Scope, Time Period, Attributes, Conversions and Filters would be auto-copied in the Application Jobs that we are trying to select. This is to reduce the extra-efforts by the user for updating the Application Job Fields while being on a Planning View.

If this looks too much, we can turn this feature off by selecting the **About --> Settings --> User Settings --> Application Job --> Deselect Copy Planning View Setting Check Box.**

#### **5. SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel - Copy IDs and Technical Details From Tooltip**

Hovering on attributes, key figures, planning levels, and versions in the Planning View setup were already showing the IDs and Technical Details. With the new Addon coming in, we will get a copy icon too that will let us copy them in the Clipboard.

#### **6. Removal of OData Service to Extract Planning View Template Attributes**

We know that the Communication Scenario SAP\_COM\_0143 comes with 2 different ODATA services namely

1) Extract Analytical Data

2) Read Template Filter Data

Out of them, the second option is discontinued. If you are a user of this option, Get in touch with SAP.

#### **7. Permission Filters (Read Access) Are Considered When Managing Master Data in the SAP IBP, add-in for Microsoft Excel**

Permission Filters Read/Write Access is considered only at Keyfigure Level. Now, It is gonna be applied for Master Data too. Really a long waited feature.

There are much more from Functionality side and discussing all of them in one go is not easier. Wait for the webinar for more insights.

Best Regards,

'Riyaz'
