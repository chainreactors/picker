# Data theft forum admins busted after flashing their cash in a life of luxury

Posted: August 13, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Two men without a clear source of income landed [cyberfraud charges](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.672601/gov.uscourts.flsd.672601.1.0.pdf) after being so flash with their ill-gotten cash that it gained the attention of the authorities.

In 2022, Russian national Pavel Kublitskii and Kazakhstan national Alexandr Khodyrev arrived in Florida and requested asylum, which was granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Both provided DHS with the same residence address in Hollywood, Florida.

However, their lavish lifestyle was unusual. For example, Kublitskii opened a Bank of America account with a cash deposit of $50,000 and rented a luxury house, while Khodyrev purchased a 2023 Corvette with approximately $110,000 cash. All while appearing to not have a job.

The investigation indicated that the two men were involved in the activities of the [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/07/explained-dark-web) platform WWH Club and related forums Skynetzone, Opencard, and Center-Club.

WWH Club and the other forums are [Dark Web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web) marketplaces where cybercriminals buy, sell, and trade login credentials, personal identifying information ([PII](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii)), [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), fake identification documents, and financial credentials. The forums even provide training for aspiring cybercriminals.

The FBI was able to determine the [IP addresses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) of the WWH Club site’s administrators after obtaining a search warrant for the US-based [Cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) company Digital Ocean. Based on the information derived from the logs, the FBI agent concluded:

> “In addition to the forum owner and creator, it appears there are several other top administrators who operate the site and receive a portion of the generated revenue. One of those top administrators operates under the usemame “Makein.” The FBI agent provides details which show there is probable cause to believe that Kublitskii and Khodyrev both serve as administrators of WWH and share the Makein username.”

Makein is also the handle of the owner and primary administrator of Skynetzone.

Part of the offered training at WWH was a scheme that recruited and taught users to purchase items with stolen credit card data. An FBI covert online employee registered for an account on WWH and paid approximately $1,000 in [bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin) to attend the WWH training.

While on the forums, the agent saw an post where a user was selling stolen PII of people and businesses in the US. Buyers could choose how many people’s PII they wished to buy and specify the particular US state of residence, gender, age, and the credit score of their desired victims. In exchange for $110, paid in Bitcoin, the WWH seller sent the undercover agent a folder containing 20 files, each of which contained the name, date of birth, Social Security Number ([SSN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web)), state of residency, address, credit score, credit report, and account informa...
