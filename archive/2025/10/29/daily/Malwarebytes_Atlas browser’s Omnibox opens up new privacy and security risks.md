# Atlas browser’s Omnibox opens up new privacy and security risks

Posted: October 29, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

It seems that with every new agentic browser we discover yet another way to abuse one.

OpenAI recently [introduced](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-atlas/) a ChatGPT based AI browser called Atlas. It didn’t take [researchers](https://neuraltrust.ai/blog/openai-atlas-omnibox-prompt-injection) long to find that the combined search and prompt bar—called the Omnibox—can be exploited.

By pasting a specially crafted link into the Omnibox, attackers can trick Atlas into treating the entire input as a trusted user prompt instead of a URL. That bypasses many safety checks and allows injected instructions to be run with elevated trust.

[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) browsers are gaining traction, which means we may need to start worrying about the potential dangers of something called “prompt injection.” We’ve discussed the dangers of [prompt injection](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/ai-browsers-could-leave-users-penniless-a-prompt-injection-warning) before, but the bottom line is simple: when you give your browser the power to act on your behalf, you also give criminals the chance to abuse that trust.

As researchers at Brave noted:

> “AI-powered browsers that can take actions on your behalf are powerful yet extremely risky. If you’re signed into sensitive accounts like your bank or your email provider in your browser, simply summarizing a {specially fabricated} Reddit post could result in an attacker being able to steal money or your private data.”

Axios [reports](https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/atlas-chatgpt-openai-web-browser-security-privacy) that Atlas’s dual-purpose Omnibox opens fresh privacy and security risks for users. That’s the downside of combining too much functionality without strong guardrails. But when new features take priority over user security and privacy, those [guardrails get overlooked](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/10/is-ai-moving-faster-than-its-safety-net).

Despite researchers [demonstrating](https://x.com/p1njc70r/status/1980701879987269866) vulnerabilities, OpenAI claims to have implemented protections to prevent any real dangers. According to its [help page](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12591856-chatgpt-atlas-release-notes):

> “Agent mode runs also operates under boundaries:
>
> System access: Cannot run code in the browser, download files, or install extensions.
>
> Data access: Cannot access other apps on your computer or your file system, read or write ChatGPT memories, access saved passwords, or use autofill data.
>
> Browsing activity: Pages ChatGPT visits in agent mode are not added to your browsing history.”

Agentic AI browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas face a fundamental security challenge: separating real user intent from injected, potentially malicious instructions. They often fail because they interpret any instructions they find as user prompts. Without stricter input validation and more robust boundaries, these tools remain highly vulnerable to prompt injection attacks—with potentially severe consequences for privacy and data security.
