I need everyone to understand something: **This doesn’t matter.**

*Dhole Moments* is not the official outlet of anything that will affect you or your daily life. It carries no financial weight or political power. It doesn’t represent any company, organization, or government agency.

To be a little more blunt: It’s overwhelmingly likely that nothing I write here will ever directly be on the final exam for any course you study. Your academic, career, romantic, and life success will not depend on my musings in any significant way.

Even if one of my blog posts should become popular, it will be (at best) a blip on most people’s radar for a fleeting moment, and then promptly forgotten about, because at the end of the day it doesn’t matter.

The same can be said about its author, of course!

Let me emphasize: That’s not a depressing statement, it’s simply reality.

## I don’t matter.

The world was here for billions of years before me, and it will continue for a heck of a long time after I die.

There are billions of people on Earth and an utterly *unknowable* number of life-supporting planets in our universe. (With any luck, it’s a large number!)

Even among the people alive here and now, I consistently fail to muster any significance or impact on the world. If I had never been born, the world be largely indistinguishable from how it appears today.

#### Profound Disagreement

Sometimes I encounter people that behave as though I do matter (usually not for good reasons).

In some instances, they believe I hold any significant status to the technology or furry communities, and hope to influence matters by changing *my* mind on something.

> Nevermind the furries with hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter and YouTube that go to several big conventions every year, let’s bother some guy with a WordPress blog that talks about cryptography!
>
> How misguided fools make decisions

Some malicious people even seem to think successfully attacking me will somehow hurt furries as a whole. Not so!

If I were so influential or important, I’d have put an end to the endless cycle of furry discourse years ago.

(While I’m at it, I’d also make proper hygiene and deodorant use mandatory for furry conventions, and put a stop to the jerks that use Bluetooth speakers to annoy everyone else. None of those things have happened, so at least you can know I’m utterly powerless here.)

### “Well, nothing matters then, right?”

No, that’s not what I’m getting at.

Like, sure, from a purely objective perspective, you could argue that nothing truly matters. But this sort of nihilism creates a vacuum from which you are free to *decide* what matters to you, since “mattering” isn’t pre-determined before you make that choice.

You may decide that humanity matters to you. You may decide that equality matters to you. You can also decide that sex, money, and popularity are important to you. But it’s your choice to make, and it’s your life to live.

But to be clear, when I say ,”I don’t matter,” I’m not being depressed or a nihilist.

**It’s nothing so extreme.**

I just don’t have the unwarranted self-importance that people sometimes project onto each other online.

## Parasocial relationships are endemic to Furry.

When I wrote, *[Furries Are Losing the Battle Against Scale](https://soatok.blog/2024/05/30/furries-are-losing-the-battle-against-scale/)*, I was tempted to analyze how the growing pains of the furry fandom (as exhibited by the explosive exponential growth of furry convention attendance) would exacerbate the risk of [parasocial relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction).

But let’s be real: The problem has already manifested years ago, and too many furries seem unwilling to confront it before it hurts people.

Here’s two YouTubers talking about extreme examples:

*[The Horrid History of Furry Valley](https://youtu.be/jf7Viqpg1Jo)*

*[The Ongoing Furry CULT of GaroShadowscale](https://youtu.be/99iG3XLKeUw)*

Humans are a social species. It’s natural to want to want to bond with people that like the same things you do. It’s inevitable that people will generally be drawn towards “popular” accounts, due to the sheer orientation of the social graphs that we exist on.

But some people utterly fail to keep things in context.

As I mentioned previously, I occasionally receive communications from someone I don’t know that expect me to wield some imagined, profound influence over others.

This comes in many forms, from “since you [helped stop a bigoted mayor from killing a library over LGBTQ+ books](https://soatok.blog/2022/02/09/that-one-time-furries-saved-a-library/), I need you to push my crowdfund for something wholly unrelated” to “you should write about [topic] because it’s important to [specific community]” to, most recently, over 100 queries about the security of esoteric messaging apps that virtually nobody uses (I wish I was exaggerating).

Individually, these range from harmless to mildly annoying. In aggregate, they’re exhausting because they’re predicated on a false premise that I have some sort of power or influence anywhere, which implies *on some level* that I must matter at all.

**This is demonstrably false.**

My blog regularly discusses cryptography topics, so if that sentiment had any truth to it, you’d expect me to come up in any cryptography papers, ever.

Yet, if you try to search for [“Soatok” on the IACR website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240906075742/https%3A//www.google.com/web/20240906075742/https%3A//www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aiacr.org+%22Soatok%22), you will not find any results.

It’s not *just* that I don’t have any papers written, it’s that nobody has cited anything I’ve written in an IACR paper, either.

Though my blog provides mild entertainment to some cryptographers, it doesn’t actually matter to the cryptography community one bit.

#### “But what about papers published under your legal name?”

There are none, but it’s difficult for anyone to verify without me disclosing my legal name–which is a bit of information that certainly doesn’t matter.

Nobody with half a brain would give a shit if they knew it anyway.

Over the years, I’ve had several people try to dox me, because they project some imagined importance onto me that simply doesn’t exist.

Though I may be biased here, I can’t help but feel like their time and energy would be better spent trying to unmask the people who are actively causing harm to others, rather than an unimportant tech blogger.

After all, ...
