### [A Tour of WebAuthn](/2024/12/23/tourofwebauthn.html) (23 Dec 2024)

I've done a bunch of posts about WebAuthn/passkeys over time. This year I decided to flesh them out a bit into a longer work on understanding and using WebAuthn. If you were at the FIDO conference in Carlsbad this year, you may have received a physical, printed booklet of the result. It took a while to get around to converting to HTML, but the text is now available [online](https://www.imperialviolet.org/tourofwebauthn/tourofwebauthn.html).
