Each year during this season, the Tor Project holds a fundraiser during which we ask for your support. We do this because the Tor Project is a nonprofit organization, powered by donations from our community. Donations make it possible for the Tor Project to build tools powered by peopleânot profit.

Over the next few months, weâll be sharing stories from some of the millions of people youâre helping when you support Tor, the impact we've made this year, details about whatâs coming next to our suite of privacy and censorship circumvention tools, and ways you can help make privacy online easy and accessible.

Now is a great time to give and spread the word about the Tor Project because **[through the end of the year, all donations will be matched](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-yec2024)** by our supporters at [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/). That means when you donate $25, youâre making a $50 impact. Plus, weâve introduced a brand-new item to our list of gifts you can receive in return for making a donation. ð

Below is a short preview of the events weâre hosting for you from now until the end of the year. We hope you will save these dates and choose a way to contribute or spread the word about the Tor Project today!

The virtual live event is part of Tor's contributions to Global Encryption Day.
