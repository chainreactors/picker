# Welcome back to the world of SDRs

[Last month we covered Part One](https://swling.com/blog/2018/09/software-defined-radio-primer-part-1-introduction-to-sdrs-and-sdr-applications/) of our three-part primer on software-defined radios (SDRs). While last month’s [Part One](https://swling.com/blog/2018/09/software-defined-radio-primer-part-1-introduction-to-sdrs-and-sdr-applications/) focused on the nomenclature and components of a functioning SDR system, Part Two will take a look at some affordable SDR station options that will propel you into the world of SDRs for less than $200 US. [We’ll cover Part Three in November](https://swling.com/blog/2018/11/sdr-primer-part-3-from-high-end-sdr-receivers-to-sdr-transceivers/), and we’ll dive a little deeper into the rabbit hole and cover higher-end SDRs and ham radio transceivers with embedded SDRs.

## SDRs are affordable

If there’s one thing I’d like you to take away from this part of our primer, it’s that SDRs are truly affordable. For less than the price of a typical full-featured shortwave portable, you can own an SDR that covers almost *all* of the listening spectrum, and that does so with excellent performance characteristics.

We’re lucky to live in a time of phenomenal radio innovation. When I first jumped into the world of SDRs, the least expensive SDR that covered any of the bands below 20 MHz was about $500. That was only a few years ago, in 2010 or so.

Yet in the past three years, affordable SDRs have become the dominant radio product on the market.  And these modestly-priced products have made the barrier of entry into the SDR world crumble overnight.

Today, even a $100 SDR has more features, more frequency range, and more functionality than a $1000 SDR from just a decade ago.  Times have changed dramatically; indeed, *the pace of innovation in this craft is simply amazing.*

Before we begin looking at some choice sub-$200 SDRs, I’d just like to direct your attention to the first part of our SDR Primer ([click here to read](https://swling.com/blog/2018/09/software-defined-radio-primer-part-1-introduction-to-sdrs-and-sdr-applications/)). Specifically, I’d like you to note one element I discussed in that article:  the vital importance identifying your goals as an SDR owner. In other words, how do you plan to use your SDR? If you’re only seeking an SDR to listen to local ham radio repeaters, track cubesat satellites, or gather ADS-B information from aircraft, a $25 SDR will more than suffice. If you wish to use the SDR as a transceiver panadapter, or you wish to chase weak signal DX on the HF bands, then I’d suggest you invest a bit more.

I’d also like to remind you, as I noted in the previous article, that *this primer will be limited in the SDRs I highlight.* The reason for this is simple:  there now exists a vast ocean of SDRs on the market (just search eBay for “SDR” and you’ll quickly see what I mean) so all models simply can’t be included in this introductory foray. I’ll be focusing here on several SDRs that cover the HF spectrum and above. I’ll also focus on SDRs with which I have personal experience, and which I consider to be “enthusiast” grade among a healthy community of users. Of course, this part of the primer will only include HF-capable receivers that cost a total of $200 or less.

Let’s take a look at what’s on the market in order of price, starting with the most affordable.

## $10-$25: The RTL-SDR dongle

[![](https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/RTL-SDR-RTL2832U-e1471375714199-1.jpg)](https://swling.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/RTL-SDR-RTL2832U-e1471375714199-1.jpg)

No doubt, many of you reading this primer have purchased an RTL-SDR dongle. Over the years, I’ve owned three or four of them and have even purchased them for friends. These dongles originally appeared on the market many years ago as mass-produced DVB-T TV tuner dongles based on the RTL2832U chipset. Very soon, users discovered that with just a little hacking, the dongle was capable of much, *much* more than its original intended purpose.

The dongle resembles a USB memory stick. On one end, you’ll find a standard USB connector.  On the other, you’ll find an antenna port, typically SMA, to which one connects an antenna. Although it goes without saying, here’s a friendly reminder: *make sure you’re choosing an antenna to match the frequency range you’re exploring!*

I’ve seen this older model of RTL-SDR being sold for $9 at Hamvention.

Early RTL-SDR dongles couldn’t cover the HF bands or lower, but many models can now cover a gapless 500 kHz all the way to 1.75 GHz.

So, what can you do with an RTL-SDR dongle?  In short, quite a lot! Here are a few of this simple device’s many applications and uses in our hobby.  It can:

* become a police radio scanner
* monitor aircraft and ATC communications
* track aircraft with ADS-B decoding and read ACARS short messages
* scan trunking radio conversations.
* decode unencrypted digital voice transmissions such as P25/DMR/D-STAR.
* track maritime boat positions like a radar with AIS decoding.
* track and receive weather balloon data
* connect to VHF amateur radio
* decode APRS packets
* receive and decode GPS signals
* utilize its rtl-sdr as a spectrum analyzer
* receive NOAA weather satellite images
* **and so much more––!** This list is not fully comprehensive by any means.  [Check out this list of projects at RTL-SDR.com](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/).

And, of course, you can listen to any signals between 500 kHz up to 1.75 GHz––essentially, most of the radio listening landscape.

Is $25 still a little high for your...
