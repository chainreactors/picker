## Upcoming Speaking Engagements

This is a current list of where and when I am scheduled to speak:

* I’m speaking at [Capricon](https://capricon.org/), a four-day science fiction convention in Chicago. My talk is on “The Coming AI Hackers” and will be held Friday, February 3 at 1:00 PM.

The list is maintained on [this page](https://www.schneier.com/events/).

@modem

I actually knew that story.

I always interpreted the Rise of the Machines as the old fear of the uprising of the slaves and underclasses.

The Robots of Karel Čapek, the Golems of folklore, the Morlocks of Wells, all descendants of the uprising of Spartacus.

Also, the alien invasions in SF are the sublimation of the fear that some other people will do to the Americans (and British), what the Americans and British did to the natives of the lands they conquered.

War and slavery existed before Europeans turned up. I am more minded to trust science and law before anyone regardless of their status. They are, in theory, a benchmark which can protect us from the worst of ourselves. Yes, both can and have been misused but generally we are at a stage where we should and do know better. Mostly.

As much as I dislike the unscrutinised happy clappy kind of narrative (often used by various politicians and on the make “entrepreneurs” I also dislike the, mostly American, tendency towards doomerism is sci-fi. I personally find the majority of US based sci-fi output unreadable and unwatchable for both reasons.

I’m really not that bothered by rogue AI. In fact I feel the current climate change and nuclear blackmail issues in the in-tray are useful learning opportunities. At some point there will come a tipping point: anyone mishandling AI (or similar hot potatoes) is simply going to earn themselves restrictions on practice, a long spell in a jail cell, or if they are really naughty and putting people in danger a unilaterally imposed swift execution.

There’s just so many ways to stop this whole thing before it gets out of hand that don’t even involve an direct law or action it’s not funny. The thing is all that’s rather dull and doesn’t make a good scary story or news bulletin.

If any moustache twirling billionaire evil villain with a private island tries it on they need to recruit without getting caught, source parts without getting caught, get past the environmental policy at the planning department of the local council, explain away their power usage, and so on and so on. There’s a million ways to get away with it on paper but in the real world not really.

> There’s a million ways to get away with it on paper but in the real world not really.

I think that’s an interesting point. So many actions, especially these days, leave a trail.

I’m going back to the decision Bruce linked to a few days ago, about the judge who ruled that a geofence warrant was unconstitutional.

What I’m amazed at is the level of research and detail that are included in her ruling. The process took more than two years and was the first to comprehensively examine the pros and cons of geofence warrants.

I haven’t read the whole decision, but did note that Google is working with various groups to figure out how to apply the laws. From the ruling:

> To ensure privacy protections for Google users, … Google instituted a policy of objecting to any warrant that failed to include de[-]identification and narrowing measures… Seemingly developed as a result of Google’s collaboration with CCIPS, this de-identification and “narrowing protocol … typically includes a three-step process.”

<https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21338805/2022-3-3-opinion.pdf>

Ultimately, the judge thinks the future of geofence warrants should be taken up by lawmakers.

@ echo, ALL,

Re : Size of cause v. Size of effect.

> “If any moustache twirling billionaire evil villain with a private island tries it on they need to recruit without getting caught, source parts without getting caught, get past the environmental policy at the planning department of the local council, explain away their power usage, and so on and so on.”

That is based on the incorect assumption that,

“Big effects require a big cause”

Mostly they do not when you go beyond the purely mechanistic.

The ability to design a self replicating biological agent at home is almost here, it’s already been done in the lab for several years[1]. If nothing else then the last three years should have informed people of just how easily pathogens mutate in the home, then spread in the community and then around the globe.

But further consider the writing of computer malware, it requires little more than research and a computer, and has frequently been done by teenagers working at home on an Xmas / Birthday gift from their parents.

The reality that nobody wants to talk about, is that “Size of cause and Size of effect” are almost entirely independent of each other. What counts the most is the sensitivity of the environment the effect occurs in, along with how easy it is to create the environment.

The more sensitive the environment the less energy is required for each member of the environment to move from one state to another. If the process of a member moving from one state to another releases enough excess energy to cause further members to have changes of state, then it becomes self replicating and a chain reaction can occur.

If it does occur, it almost always follows an exponential rate of change unless subject to a form of moderation that modulates the replication rate.

Which leaves how easy it is to create a sensitive environment, generally it’s easy enough for any fool to do.

One of the reasons people do not wish these to be talked about, is that all human progress sits on the cusp of such changes of state being moderated to within limits.

That is...
