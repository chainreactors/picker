# LostMyPassword – Dual Use Password Recovery and Credential Dumping Tool

August 18, 2025

LostMyPassword v1.00 is a compact Windows utility from NirSoft that automatically reveals stored passwords for various applications and services on a system. While designed as a consumer-friendly recovery tool for users who have forgotten their login details, it has been repurposed for use in penetration testing and offensive operations for some time.

In red team engagements, LostMyPassword provides a quick way to dump locally stored credentials after initial access. Its small footprint, lack of dependencies, and simple execution make it attractive when speed is more important than stealth.

This positions it alongside tools such as [LaZagne](https://www.darknet.org.uk/2015/12/lazagne-password-recovery-tool-windows-linux/) and [Mimikatz](https://www.darknet.org.uk/2015/07/mimikatz-gather-windows-credentials/) in the broader credential-harvesting toolkit, though with a more limited scope and a higher likelihood of antivirus detection.

## Key Features

* Single executable, no installation required
* Recovers lost or stored passwords for supported apps
* Outputs recovered credentials in plain text
* Supports export to text or HTML for later review
* Usable in both legitimate recovery and offensive contexts

## Installation & Usage

LostMyPassword does not require a complex installation. Download the executable from the NirSoft site and run it directly on a Windows host.

On execution, the tool scans for stored credentials and displays them in a table. Results typically include:

* Application or service name
* Username or account identifier
* Recovered password in cleartext

The output can be exported via the File → Save Selected Items option, producing a report in text, CSV, or HTML.

## Dual-Use Context

For defenders and system administrators, LostMyPassword is a practical recovery utility when users forget their login credentials. For offensive operators, it highlights the potential for sensitive data to remain cached locally and underscores the importance of secure credential management practices.

Its visibility in antivirus databases and its limited target scope mean it is not as flexible or stealthy as modern frameworks, such as LaZagne or Mimikatz. However, it remains useful for quickly obtaining credentials in poorly monitored environments.

## Conclusion

LostMyPassword v1.00 is a legacy NirSoft utility that straddles the line between legitimate recovery software and an offensive security tool. For penetration testers and red teamers, it provides a lightweight method for quickly harvesting stored credentials in post-exploitation scenarios. For defenders, it serves as a reminder of how vulnerable cached passwords can be and why detection, monitoring, and credential hygiene remain crucial.
