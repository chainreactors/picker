(Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.)

![](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/content/images/2025/08/Twin-Peaks-1-1.jpg)

Diane,

2:01 p.m., August 21st. I’ve just returned from a remarkable journey through Seattle and the misty roads of the Olympic Peninsula. If you ever find yourself driving beneath those towering Douglas firs or dragged by your partner through the Twilight Museum in Forks, I recommend stopping for a cup of hot, black coffee and a slice of cherry pie at any roadside diner. It’s nothing short of extraordinary.

But as I navigated the Rialto Beach tidepools (at 5:30 a.m., no less) and moss-laden trees of the Hoh Rainforest, I made a classic misstep: I forgot to connect to Wi-Fi the entire trip. By the time I returned, my high-speed data allowance had vanished into the mist, leaving me puzzled and restarting my cell phone for days — a humbling reminder that even seasoned agents can overlook the basics.

Travel is a curious thing, Diane. When you’re on the road, it’s easy to let your guard down, become enchanted by the scenery and forget that digital dangers can lurk behind every public WiFi signal or seemingly harmless USB charging station.

As the summer draws to a close and more people venture out of Twin Peaks for those last-minute adventures, I’ve compiled a list of field-tested precautions for the journey ahead, because even professionals need a reminder sometimes:

1. Update your devices and back up important data before you leave. If a device is lost, stolen or infected with malware, you’ll still have access to your files.
2. Turn off auto-connect features to reduce the risk of connecting to rogue networks or devices.
3. Only take what you need. The fewer devices you take, the fewer you have to keep track of and worry about.
4. Limit the use of location services on your devices and apps unless necessary. This protects your privacy and reduces the risk of targeted attacks while traveling.
5. Steer clear of public computers in hotel lobbies and libraries, especially for accessing sensitive accounts. If you must use them — or if you log in to any streaming services during your stay —  don't forget to log out of your accounts.
6. Public WiFi is convenient, but we know its security can be questionable. Use a VPN or your phone’s hotspot for a more secure connection.
7. Set up device tracking (like Find My iPhone or Find My Device) and know how to remotely wipe your device in case it’s lost or stolen.
8. Take a power bank with you to avoid using USB charging stations, which could result in malware being downloaded to your device.

Diane, the woods are lovely, dark and deep, and so are the digital trails we leave behind. Stay vigilant, stay caffeinated and remember that the best protection is awareness.

## The one big thing

[Static Tundra](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/static-tundra/), a Russian state-backed group, is exploiting end-of-life and unpatched Cisco network devices using a seven-year-old patched vulnerability (CVE-2018-0171) to steal data and maintain long-term hidden access in organizations worldwide. Their tactics include persistent implants and bespoke SNMP tools to exfiltrate data and maintain undetected access, with a focus on entities of strategic interest to the Russian government. [We urge immediate patching](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/static-tundra/) or disabling of at-risk features to prevent compromise.

### Why do I care?

If your organization uses Cisco devices that haven’t been patched or replaced, you could be vulnerable to undetected cyberattacks and data breaches—even if the vulnerability is years old. This risk affects organizations of all sizes and industries, putting sensitive data and business operations in jeopardy.

### So now what?

Immediately review your network infrastructure for unpatched or end-of-life Cisco devices and apply available patches or disable vulnerable features [as recommended](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/static-tundra/). Ongoing security hardening, regular updates and vigilant monitoring are critical to defend against this and similar state-sponsored threats.
