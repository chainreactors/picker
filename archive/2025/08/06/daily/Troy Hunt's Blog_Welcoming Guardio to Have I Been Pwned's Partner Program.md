# Welcoming Guardio to Have I Been Pwned's Partner Program

06 August 2025

I'm often asked if cyber criminals are getting better at impersonating legitimate organisations in order to sneak their phishing attacks through. Yes, they absolutely are, but I also argue that the inverse is true too: legitimate organisations frequently communicate in ways that are indistinguishable from a phishing attack! I can name countless examples of banks, delivery services and even government agencies sending communication that I was *convinced* was a phish, but turned out to be legit. I once had an argument with an agent from our own tax office on precisely that basis. After having shown all the hallmarks of being a scammer, she instead turned out to be making a legitimate inquiry. And if you need more convincing that even I can't tell the difference between a scam and legit comms, look no further than [my own recent failure to spot a phish that successfully extracted my Mailchimp credentials](https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/), including the 2FA code!

I don't mind recognising that I struggle with scams, and frankly, it creates a lot more empathy for the masses out there who don't spend their days thinking about cybersecurity. These are the sorts of folks who use [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) and often land there a bit frazzled, looking for answers after learning they've been breached in some nasty incident. They need a proactive defence against this style of attack that can protect them when the human controls fail, as they recently failed me. That's why today, I'm very happy to announce a new HIBP partner, [Guardio](https://guard.io/hibpad?ref=troyhunt.com)! You'll find them located on each dedicated breach page, and on the home page of [your personal dashboard](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Dashboard?ref=troyhunt.com):

We've now turned the above recommendation on for all US-based visitors and highlighted them for all audiences regardless of locale on [the partners page](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Partners?ref=troyhunt.com). We believe the service they offer makes a meaningful difference to the security posture of our users, and we are happy to include them here to complement the unique services provided by our existing partners. So it's a big welcome to Guardio, and I look forward to sharing more about the work they're doing to protect us all in the future. [Check out what Guardio does on their dedicated HIBP page now](https://guard.io/hibpad?ref=troyhunt.com).
