# Risky Business News Podcast: Why Linux is the dark matter of the internet

09 July 2025

Podcast

Sandfly's CEO Craig Rowland recently joined Tom Uren on the [Risky Business News Podcast](https://risky.biz/RBNEWSSI89/) to discuss the disconnect between how important Linux systems are and how much security attention they get.

The episode addresses a critical question: Why does Linux security get so little attention when Linux runs so much of critical infrastructure?

Understand the many reasons that security teams underinvest in protecting Linux, from staffing challenges to the unique complexities of Linux environments. As Craig puts it, Sandfly gives you visibility where you don't have it today in a very safe and compatible way.
