This is a busy week for the whole Wallarm team as we are sponsoring two big conferences at the very same time.

## API World 2022

Wallarm will be at API World in San Jose starting today. Stop by booth #209 to chat with our #apisecurity experts about everything APIs, and check out a demo of Wallarm WAAP (Web Application and API Protection) and Wallarm Advanced API Security products.

Also, Ivan Novikov, CEO of Wallarm, will be doing a presentation on Thursday (10/27) morning on **“The Evolution of API Security”**. Swing by to learn why most of existing security solutions fall short in the face of rising API-specific threats.

## KubeCon 2022

If you’re attending KubeCon in Detroit, come visit us tomorrow at booth S94 to discover how the Wallarm platform protects websites, microservices, and APIs powered by Kubernetes.

Learn more about protecting your business and users from API-specific threats in multi-cloud and cloud-native environments. Our experts will navigate you through the deployment options leveraging Kubernetes, including Ingress Controller, side-car proxy, or out-of-band-deployment.
