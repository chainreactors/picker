# Apple’s iPhone Spyware Problem Is Getting Worse. Here’s What You Should Know

The iPhone maker has detected spyware attacks against people in more than 150 countries. Knowing if your device is infected can be tricky—but there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself.

In April, Apple sent notifications to iPhone users in 92 countries, [warning](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apple-warns-users-mercenary-spyware-attack-91-countries-including-india-et-2024-04-11/) them they’d been targeted with spyware. “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID,” the notification reads.

Users quickly took to social media sites including X, trying to work out what the notification meant. Many of those [targeted](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) were based in [India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/exclusive-apple-warns-users-of-mercenary-spyware-attack-india-91-other-countries-impacted/articleshow/109210976.cms), but others in Europe also [reported](https://x.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1778712011704049888) receiving Apple’s warning.

Weeks later, little is still known about the latest iPhone attacks. Former smartphone giant Blackberry, now a security firm, has released research indicating they are linked to a Chinese spyware campaign dubbed “[LightSpy](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2024/04/lightspy-returns-renewed-espionage-campaign-targets-southern-asia-possibly-india),” but Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer says this is inaccurate, and researchers at security firm [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/blog/lightspy-malware-variant-targeting-macos) say the variant Blackberry analyzed was a macOS version, not iOS.

April's warnings were not the first time Apple has issued notifications of this kind. The iPhone maker has sent out alerts to people in over 150 countries since 2021 as spyware continues to target high-profile figures across the globe.

Spyware can be weaponized by nation-state adversaries—but this is relatively rare and expensive. Its deployment is typically highly targeted against a very specific group of people, including journalists, political dissidents, government workers, and businesses in certain sectors.

“Such attacks are vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware, as mercenary spyware attackers apply exceptional resources to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices,” Apple [wrote](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174) in an advisory in April. "Mercenary spyware attacks cost millions of dollars and often have a short shelf life, making them much harder to detect and prevent. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by such attacks.”

Plus, Apple says its [Lockdown Mode](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ios-16-lockdown-mode/) feature can successfully protect against attacks. “As we have said before, we are not aware of anyone using Lockdown Mode being successfully attacked with mercenary spyware,” Bauer says. Still, for those who are targeted and caught unaware, spyware is extremely dangerous.

## Zero-Click Attacks

Spyware gives attackers access to the smartphone’s mic and allows them to view everything you write, including messages on encrypted apps such as [WhatsApp](https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-interoperability-messaging/) and [Signal](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-tips-private-messaging-encryption/). They can also track your location, collect passwords, and harvest information from apps.

In the past, spyware was delivered via phishing, requiring the victim to click on a link or download an image. Today, it can be delivered in so-called “[zero-click attacks](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-imessage-zero-click-hacks/)” via an iMessage or WhatsApp image that will automatically plant spyware on your device.

In 2021, researchers at Google’s Project Zero detailed how an iMessage-based zero-click exploit was used to target a Saudi activist. “Short of not using a device, there is no way to prevent exploitation by a zero-click exploit; it's a weapon against which there is no defense,” the researchers [warned](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/12/a-deep-dive-into-nso-zero-click.html).

The spyware infection chain using zero-click exploits via iMessage was demonstrated by security outfit Kaspersky as part of its [Operation Triangulation](https://securelist.com/trng-2023/) research last year.

All that needs to happen is, the victim receives an iMessage with an attachment containing a zero-click exploit. “Without any further interaction, the message triggers a vulnerability, leading to code execution for privilege escalation and providing full control over the infected device,” says Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky's Global Research & Analysis Team.

Once the attacker establishes their presence on the device, he says, the message is automatically deleted.

## Rise of Pegasus

The most prominent and well-known spyware is Pegasus, made by Israeli firm [NSO Group](https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-lobbying-israel-hamas-war/) to target vulnerabilities in iOS and Android software.

Spyware only exists because of vendors such as NSO Group, which [claims](https://www.nsogroup.com/) it sells exploits to governments only to hunt criminals and terrorists. “Any customers, including governments in Europe and North America, agree not to disclose those vulnerabilities,” says Richard Werner, cybersecurity advisor at Trend Micro.

Despite NSO Group’s claims, spyware has continued to target journalists, dissidents, and protesters. Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi’s wife, Hanan Elatr, was allegedly [targeted](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848485/pegasus-spyware-jamal-khashoggi-murder-nso-hanan-elatr-new-analysis) with Pegasus before his death. In 2021, *New York Times* reporter Ben Hubbard learned [his phone had been targeted twice with Pegasus](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/24/insider/hacking-nso-surveillance.html).

Pegasus was silently impla...
