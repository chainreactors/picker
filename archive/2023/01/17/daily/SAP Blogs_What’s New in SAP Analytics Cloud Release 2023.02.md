## **Dashboard & Story Design**

##### **Optimized Story Experience Update**

##### **Flexible Time Dimension in New Model Type**

Flexible Time Dimensions are now supported in the New Model Type Universal Account Models (UAM) and Universal Measure Models (UMM) to ensure feature parity and close gaps in the Optimized Design Experience:

* It provides more flexibility for users to visualize their data using different time dimensions
  (i.e., seasons)

* In the Builder Panel, users can add a time calculation using a Flexible Time Dimension to display data from a previous time interval

* Within Link Dimensions, all time attributes are now exposed, which allows users to link on attributes to enable server-side filtering across model

* Flexible Time Dimensions can be consumed within Calculations, Input Controls, Variance, and more

## **Data Integration**

##### **Live SAP BW – Ability to Calculate the Difference Between Two Time Periods**

The “difference from” calculation is now supported for models based on a live connection to SAP Business Warehouse (SAP BW). The Difference From aggregation shows the difference in the value of an account between a starting date and a target date that is calculated from a specified number of time periods before or after the starting date. For example, you can compare the sales on February 2015, with the sales from the previous 6 months.

This feature enhances story calculations by bringing new functionality and closes existing feature gap between models based on SAP HANA live and SAP BW live data sources.
