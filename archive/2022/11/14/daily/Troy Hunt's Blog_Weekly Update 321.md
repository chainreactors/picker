# Weekly Update 321

13 November 2022

What a week to pick to be in Canberra. Planned well before things got cyber-crazy in Australia, I spent a few days catching up with folks in our capital and talking to the Australia Federal Police for scam awareness week. That it coincided with the dumping of Medibank customer health records made it an especially interesting time to talk with police, politicians and industry leaders. A bit of a bizarre, whirlwind week if I'm honest, but full of very positive encounters even though it coincided with such a demanding time for many of us in this industry down here.
