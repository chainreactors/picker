# chum

`chum` is a binary rewriting tool for 64-bit PE files.

## Disclaimer

This is an old, incomplete project that I have abandoned and **will not** be working on.
It is missing several key features and just has a flawed design. It is fun to mess
around with, but that's about it. Feel free to create pull-requests or whatever though.

## Building

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jonomango/chum.git
cd chum

mkdir build
cd build

# Any variant of Visual Studio is fine.
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
cmake --build .
```

## Example

```
#include "chum.h"

#include <algorithm>
#include <random>

// Insert a NOP before every instruction.
void insert_no...
