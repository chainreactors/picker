# Your copilot for improved cyber protection

## Watch this video to learn how Palo Alto Networks is using GenAI to automate and simplify cybersecurity

Sponsored Post Cyber security is complex right, particularly when you're tyring to monitor and configure multiple tools across a host of different on- and off-premise IT environments?

That's what Palo Alto Networks is committed to offer by using generative AI (GenAI)to build automated copilots across network security, cloud security and security operations which can help human cyber security specialists do things easier, better and faster.

You can watch this [video](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/engage/ai-on-demand?overlay_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paloaltonetworks.com%2Fengage%2Fai-on-demand%2Four-vision-for-autonomous%3Fx%3D0cPGAm%26pflpid%3D20774) to get a better idea of those capabilities. It's about putting knowledge at cyber security teams' fingertips – collating every piece of documentation Palo Alto has ever written on its products and using GenAI to search those repositories to answer any questions they might have, while also providing access to full configuration and security rule sets which can prompt actions to help avoid potential issues with problematic policies.

Step forward Lee Klarich and Mike Jacobsen from Palo Alto Networks to give a series of demos. The first involves the Strata copilot, designed to help administrators interpret data and offer suggested actions to create new network security rules and policies to plug vulnerabilities that may lead to a breach. You'll see how Strata uses a command centre tool to deliver a visual presentation of the assets that need protection for example, and see the most prevalent threats and view the security profiles and rules that have been configured to allow or block.

Next up is a demo of Prisma Cloud copilot which quickly hel...
