# Exploit Title: WordPress Digits Plugin 8.4.6.1 - Authentication Bypass via OTP Bruteforcing
# Google Dork: inurl:/wp-content/plugins/digits/
# Date: 2025-04-30

# Version: < 8.4.6.1
# CVE : CVE-2025-4094

"""
The Digits plugin for WordPress prior to version 8.4.6.1 is vulnerable to OTP brute-force attacks due to missing rate limiting.
An attacker can exploit this to bypass authentication or password reset by iterating over possible OTP values.

This PoC targets the "Forgot Password" flow and automates the attack, which is the same concept that is valid for the registration flow.

CWE-287: Improper Authentication
CVSS v3.1: 9.8 (Critical)
OWASP A2: Broken Authentication

[Instructions]
1. Use a tool like Burp Suite or your browser’s developer tools to intercept the OTP verification request.
2. Copy the exact request parameters
3. Replace the placeholder values in the script with real data from the intercepted request.
4. Run the script to brute-force 4-digit OTPs (0000 to 9999) or you can change it to 6-digit.

[Alternative Method – Burp Suite Pro]

If you have Burp Suite Pro, you can perform the OTP brute-force attack manually:

1. Intercept the OTP request using Burp Proxy.
2. Send the request to Intruder.
3. Mark the `sms_otp` parameter as the payload position.
4. Load a payload list from `000000` to `999999` (for 6-digit OTPs).
5. Start the attack and monitor responses for a different status code, length, or success message.

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.
