I’m not going to post a whole lot today, but I don’t want to miss the week. We’re preparing for a trip and I’m going to miss the next few weeks, but hopefully I’ll have lots of writing to share when we return.

I’ve been working on a project as part of my side hustle, [Room 641A](https://room641a.com/). It’s still too early to discuss specifics, but I anticipate it will take a good chunk of my free time while I work on it. With any luck, it should be a cool service for at least my red team friends, and maybe other security staff. One downside is that I’m anticipating I’ll need quite a bit of storage, and that storage need will probably only grow over time. This makes me less interested in deploying to a cloud service because it’ll be expensive, but I’ve also grown to appreciate the operational benefits of a managed database, managed container orchestration, and managed replicated storage. Trading that all away so that I can manage terabytes of data without breaking the bank.

## Interesting Links

* [Net Cafe - Hackers (1996)](https://archive.org/details/nc101_hackers) - This was an entertaining watch from the mid 90s, if for nothing else than all the things that feel super retro now.
* [NixOS is a good server OS, except when it isn’t](https://sidhion.com/blog/posts/nixos_server_issues/) - As I’ve been quite the fan of NixOS lately, I found this post to be a useful counter-voice. If you care about disk space, NixOS might not be your friend.
* [Certo’s Digital Breakup Assistant](https://www.certosoftware.com/digital-breakup-assistant/) - A cool application that launched recently that gives free tailored advice for securing your devices and accounts after a breakup.

## Upcoming Projects

* A conference that wishes to remain nameless currently has it’s CFP open. I **have submitted to the CFP** and am waiting to hear back after the review process. (Due: N/A)
* I have some merch designs that I’m hoping to get launched in a shop soon. My first samples came in and I didn’t love them, I need to adjust the designs for another print shop and see if I like them better. Not sure when specifically, but I’m excited to share them with you all. Here’s an [example design](https://twitter.com/0xdade/status/1839423806382940274/photo/1). (Due: N/A)
