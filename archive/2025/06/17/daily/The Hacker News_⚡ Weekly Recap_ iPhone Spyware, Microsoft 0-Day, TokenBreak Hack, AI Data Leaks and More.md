Some of the biggest security problems start quietly. No alerts. No warnings. Just small actions that seem normal but aren't. Attackers now know how to stay hidden by blending in, and that makes it hard to tell when something's wrong.

This week's stories aren't just about what was attacked‚Äîbut how easily it happened. If we're only looking for the obvious signs, what are we missing right in front of us?

Here's a look at the tactics and mistakes that show how much can go unnoticed.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Apple Zero-Click Flaw in Messages Exploited to Deliver Paragon Spyware](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/apple-zero-click-flaw-in-messages.html)** ‚Äî Apple disclosed that a security flaw in its Messages app was actively exploited in the wild to target civil society members in sophisticated cyber attacks. The vulnerability, CVE-2025-43200, was addressed by the company in February as part of iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 17.7.5, macOS Sequoia 15.3.1, macOS Sonoma 14.7.4, macOS Ventura 13.7.4, watchOS 11.3.1, and visionOS 2.3.1. The Citizen Lab said it uncovered forensic evidence that the flaw was weaponized to target Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed prominent European journalist and infect them with Paragon's Graphite mercenary spyware.

Sensitive data moves fast in the cloud. If you can't see it, you can't protect it. This guide shows how top teams use DSPM to reduce risk, improve compliance, and boost efficiency‚Äîbacked by real metrics that drive measurable impact.](https://thehackernews.uk/wiz-dspm-value-guide-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Microsoft Fixes WebDAV 0-Day Exploited in Targeted Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/microsoft-patches-67-vulnerabilities.html)** ‚Äî Microsoft addressed a zero-day bug in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) that was exploited by a threat actor known as Stealth Falcon (aka FruityArmor) as part of highly targeted attacks to deliver Horus Agent, a custom implant built for the Mythic command-and-control (C2) framework. Horus Agent is believed to be an evolution of the customized Apollo implant, an open-source .NET agent for Mythic framework, that was previously put to use by Stealth Falcon between 2022 and 2023. "The new Horus Agent appears to be written from scratch," according to Check Point. "In addition to adding custom commands, the threat actors placed additional emphasis on the agent's and its loader's anti-analysis protections and counter-defensive measures. This suggests that they have deep knowledge of both their victims and/or the security solutions in use."
* **[TokenBreak Attack Bypasses AI Moderation With a Single Character Change](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-tokenbreak-attack-bypasses-ai.html)** ‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers disclosed an attack technique called TokenBreak that can be used to bypass a large language model's (LLM) safety and content moderation guardrails with just a single character change. "The TokenBreak attack targets a text classification model's tokenization strategy to induce false negatives, leaving end targets vulnerable to attacks that the implemented protection model was put in place to prevent," HiddenLayer said.
* **[Google Addresses Flaw Leaking Phone Numbers Linked to Accounts](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/researcher-found-flaw-to-discover-phone.html)** ‚Äî Google has fixed a security flaw that could have made it possible to brute-force an account's recovery phone number by taking advantage of a legacy username recovery form and combining it with an exposure path Looker Studio that serves as an unintended oracle by leaking a user's full name. Google has since deprecated the username recovery form.
* **[Rare Werewolf and DarkGaboon Leverage Readymade Tooling to Target Russia](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/rare-werewolf-apt-uses-legitimate.html)** ‚Äî Two threat actors tracked as Rare Werewolf and DarkGaboon have been observed employing legitimate tools, living-off-the-land (LotL) tactics, and off-the-shelf malware to target Russian entities. While adversaries are known to adopt such tactics, the complete abstinence of bespoke malware speaks to the effectiveness of the approach in helping them evade detection triggers and endpoint detection systems. Because these techniques are also commonly used by administrators, distinguishing between malicious and benign activity becomes significantly more challenging for defenders.
* **[Zero-Click AI Flaw Allows Data Exfiltration Without User Interaction](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/zero-click-ai-vulnerability-exposes.html)** ‚Äî The first known zero-click artificial intelligence vulnerability in Microsoft 365 could have allowed attackers to exfiltrate sensitive internal data without any user interaction. The flaw, dubbed EchoLeak, involved what's described as an LLM Scope Violation, referring to scenarios where a large language model (LLM) can be manipulated into leaking information beyond its intended context. In this case, an attacker can craft a malicious email containing specific markdown syntax that could slip past Microsoft's Cross-Prompt Injection Attack (XPIA) defenses, causing the AI assistant to process the malicious payload and exfiltrate data using Microsoft's own trusted domains, including SharePoint and Teams, which are all...
