US Army Special Forces, aka the Green Berets, have been demonstrating their ability to use offensive cyber-security tools in the recent Swift Response 24 military exercises in May, the military has now confirmed.

The elite org, one of whose remits is unconventional warfare, includes Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) units of highly trained, mature soldiers with intensively honed skills. These now include compromising wireless networks, as the military demonstrated with a target building near Skillingaryd in Sweden stormed by members of the 10th Special Forces Group.

"What this allows us to do is target an objective, use the signaling equipment to gain access to any Wi-Fi networks originating at the target, and then monitor activity from that location for a period of time," an identity-protected ODA team member [explained](https://www.army.mil/article/279281/green_berets_use_disruptive_cyber_technology_during_swift_response_2024).
