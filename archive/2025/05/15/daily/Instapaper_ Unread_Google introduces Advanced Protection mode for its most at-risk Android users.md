Google is adding a new security setting to Android to provide an extra layer of resistance against attacks that infect devices, tap calls traveling through insecure carrier networks, and deliver scams through messaging services.

On Tuesday, the company [unveiled](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/advanced-protection-mobile-devices.html) the Advanced Protection mode, most of which will be rolled out in the upcoming release of Android 16. The setting comes as mercenary malware sold by [NSO Group](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/) and a cottage industry of other exploit sellers continues to thrive. These players provide attacks-as-a-service through end-to-end platforms that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on targeted devices, infect them with advanced spyware, and then capture contacts, message histories, locations, and other sensitive information. Over the past decade, phones running fully updated versions of Android and iOS have routinely been hacked through these services.

## A core suite of enhanced security features

Advanced Protection is Google’s latest answer to this type of attack. By flipping a single button in device settings, users can enable a host of protections that can thwart some of the most common techniques used in sophisticated hacks. In some cases, the protections hamper performance and capabilities of the device, so Google is recommending the new mode mainly for journalists, elected officials, and other groups who are most often targeted or have the most to lose when infected.

“With the release of Android 16, users who choose to activate Advanced Protection will gain immediate access to a core suite of enhanced security features,” Google’s product manager for Android Security, Il-Sung Lee, [wrote](https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/advanced-protection-mobile-devices.html). “Additional Advanced Protection features like Intrusion Logging, USB protection, the option to disable auto-reconnect to insecure networks, and integration with Scam Detection for Phone by Google will become available later this year.”

Activating Advanced Protection enables a host of existing and new security features that take a defense-in-depth approach to locking down phones when in high-risk environments, such as border crossings, when targeted by repressive governments, or when connected to older carrier networks that lack modern-day anti-snooping defenses. The features include:

* The inability to connect to 2G networks, which lack encryption protections preventing over-the-air monitoring of voice and text-messaging communications
* No automatic connections to insecure Wi-Fi networks, such as those using [WEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy) or no encryption at all
* The enabling of the Memory Tagging Extension, a relatively new form of memory management that’s designed to provide an extra layer of protection against use-after-free exploits and other memory-corruption attacks
* Automatically locking when offline for extended periods
* Automatically powering down a device when locked for prolonged periods to make user data unreadable without a fresh unlock
* Intrusion logging that writes system events to a fortified region of the phone for use in detecting and diagnosing successful or attempted hacks
* JavaScript protections that shut down Android’s JavaScript optimizer, a feature that can be abused in certain types of exploits

In some respects, Advanced Protection is the Android equivalent of the [Lockdown mode](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/07/introducing-lockdown-from-apple-the-coolest-defense-youll-probably-never-use/) Apple built into iOS in 2022. The main idea in both is to reduce the “surface area” hackers can exploit by turning off non-essential components that are the most susceptible to hacking. In many cases, running iOS in Lockdown mode is indistinguishable from the normal mode. Advanced Protection is likely to behave the same way.
