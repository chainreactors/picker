## Introduction

The overall calculated ratings provided in Goal section & Competency section visibility can be customized in summary section.

There was a requirement from client asking the possibility to hide the calculated rating of Goal section & Competency section in the summary section as they don't want employee to distinguish the ratings for each section.

## Steps to hide the calculated section rating

Please follow the below steps to hide the calculated section rating:

* Navigate to "Manage Templates" and click on specific section of which the calculated rating is not required to display in summary section.

* Under advanced options disable "Display calculated section rating" for goal section

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Objective-section.png)*advanced options in Goal section*

* Under advanced options disable "Show Calculated Section Rating" for Competency section

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Comp-section.png)advanced option in Competency section

* Once "Display calculated section rating" in goal section & Show Calculated Section Rating" in Competency section are disabled then the summary section will not display the overall calculated section rating (As per screenshot below).![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Summary-section-without-rating-Demo.png)Summary section without rating

* Visibility of Summary section when both "Display calculated section rating" in goal section & "Show Calculated Section Rating" in competency section are enabled.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/Summary-section-with-rating-Demo.png)*Summary section with rating.*
