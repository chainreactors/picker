In episode 48 of The AI Fix, OpenAI releases the first AI models capable of novel scientific discoveries, ChatGPT users are sick of its relentlessly positive tone, our hosts say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù a lot, OpenAI eyes a social network of its own, and some robots run a half-marathon.

Graham discovers AI Jesus and a great offer on some Casper mattresses, and Mark wonders if the technological singularity is actually much closer than we thought.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
