Insight The developers of EvilProxy – a phishing kit dubbed the "LockBit of phishing" – have produced guides on using legitimate Cloudflare services to disguise malicious traffic. This adds to the ever-growing arsenal of tools offering criminals who lack actual technical expertise to get into the digital thievery biz.

EvilProxy is a reverse-proxy phishing kit sold on dark-web marketplaces, earning it the moniker "phishing-as-a-service" (PhaaS). The tool has helped crooks launch attacks since at least mid 2022, according to Resecurity – one of the first threat hunters to [warn](https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/evilproxy-phishing-as-a-service-with-mfa-bypass-emerged-in-dark-web) of the toolkit's existence.

Proofpoint sees about a million EvilProxy threats every month, according to the email security biz's director of threat research Daniel Blackford.
