# Weekly Update 357

21 July 2023

Sad news to wake up to today. Kevin was a friend and as I say in this week's video, probably the most well-known identity in infosec ever, and for good reason. He made a difference, and I have fun memories with him 😊

> Felt really sad waking up and seeing “RIP Kevin” in my timeline. I doubt there is a more well known name in our industry but if he’s unfamiliar to you (or you haven’t read this book), go and grab “Ghost in the Wires” which is an exceptional read.

In other news, I share a lot more on the upcoming domain search changes in this week's video and I've gotta say, I'm feeling pretty good about them. I spent most of the day after recording this writing code and drafting the blog post and I'm pretty damn happy with each right now. I'll keep sharing more info via these updates to the extent that by the time everything launches in a couple of weeks, you'll know it all anyway if you're paying attention here 😎
