## **Intro: Why hack in when you can log in?**

SaaS applications are the backbone of modern organizations, powering productivity and operational efficiency. But every new app introduces critical security risks through app integrations and multiple users, creating easy access points for threat actors. As a result, SaaS breaches have increased, and according to a May 2024 XM Cyber report, identity and credential misconfigurations caused [80% of security exposures.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xm-cyber-report-finds-80-of-security-exposures-are-fueled-by-misconfigurations-302136164.html)

Subtle signs of a compromise get lost in the noise, and then multi-stage attacks unfold undetected due to siloed solutions. Think of an account takeover in Entra ID, then privilege escalation in GitHub, along with data exfiltration from Slack. Each seems unrelated when viewed in isolation, but in a connected timeline of events, it's a dangerous breach.

[Wing Security's SaaS platform](https://eu1.hubs.ly/H0jfYyM0) is a multi-layered solution that combines posture management with real-time identity threat detection and response. This allows organizations to get a true identity map of their SaaS ecosystem, detect and respond rapidly to threats, and prevent future attacks.

## **Getting started with SaaS visibility and coverage**

You can't protect what you don't know. The majority of existing solutions (IAM, PAM, IAM, etc.) do not cover SaaS applications or lack the depth needed to detect SaaS threats. This is why the first step is to overcome shadow IT and get complete visibility into the organization's stack, including all apps, accounts, and all the hidden third-party integrations that security teams have no clue about.

Wing's discovery approach is non-intrusive, without agents or proxies. It simply connects through APIs to major IdPs (like Okta, Google Workspace, and Azure AD) and to business-critical SaaS applications (from Microsoft 365 and Salesforce to Slack, GitHub, etc).

Wing discovers:

* Human (users) and non-human (service accounts, API keys, etc.) identities.
* App-to-app connectivity and third-party integrations and their permission scopes.
* AI-powered applications and data usage.
* MFA status, admins in the different SaaS applications (including stale admins)

Visibility alone isn't enough. Understanding identity behavior in SaaS apps is key to detecting and responding to real threats in time. That's where Wing's identity-centric threat detection layer comes in.

## **SaaS Identity Threat Detection** — **From scattered logs to a clear attack story**

Wing maps identity events and IoCs to represent how attackers think. It then correlates them with MITRE ATT&CK techniques to transform long and messy SaaS logs into one clear attack story - simplifying investigations, reducing alert fatigue, and speeding up median time to resolution (MTTR).

Every detection is enriched with threat intelligence for context: IP reputation (geolocation and privacy), VPN/Tor usage, and more. So, instead of digging through raw logs for days, analysts can understand the attacker's playbook in a few minutes.

#### **A real-life example of how hackers try to exploit identities:**

* **Step 1 - Password spray attempt:** A password spray attack targeting multiple user accounts within the Entra ID environment. The attacker attempted to log in using credential-based attacks to compromise one or more user accounts without triggering lockout mechanisms.
* **Step 2 - Cross-account user agent overlap:** Login attempts across multiple accounts from the same user agent (UA) confirmed that the attacker was systematically testing credentials at scale during the reconnaissance phase.
* **Step 3 - Successful login post-reconnaissance:** The attacker successfully logged in to an account. This login matched the same user agent used during the reconnaissance phase, indicating that credentials were compromised via the earlier password spraying activity.
* **Step 4 - Privilege escalation via role assignment:** The attacker escalated the compromised account's privileges by assigning it administrative roles in Entrad ID. This granted the attacker broader visibility and control, including access to OAuth-connected third-party services like GitHub.
* **Step 5 - Data exfiltration from GitHub:** With elevated privileges, the attacker leveraged the Entra ID account's linked GitHub access to infiltrate internal repositories. Activity logs indicate that private repositories were downloaded, including projects that may contain source code, API keys, or internal documentation. The attacker used this foothold to exfiltrate sensitive intellectual property directly from GitHub.
