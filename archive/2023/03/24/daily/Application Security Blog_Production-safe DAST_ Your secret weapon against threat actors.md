Software powers modern businesses, but these ever-evolving applications and systems can also include vulnerabilities that threat actors can exploit to disrupt, threaten, and steal critical data. But fear not: Robust security processes can mitigate most of these risks and ensure that new features and updates are properly tested.

By incorporating dynamic application security testing ([DAST](/dast.html)) into their security processes, businesses can conduct thorough and secure scans of their production environment. This allows them to strike a balance between functionality and security, and makes it possible to deliver new features and functionality to their customers without compromising security. By embracing the challenge of securing applications, organizations can protect their critical data and stay ahead of the curve in a constantly changing market.

## Risking a breach

Production environments are where applications are used and accessed. Applications are most vulnerable in production environments because they are exposed to real-world conditions—including the threats they were or were not designed to withstand.

If an organization’s applications are breached, it risks a range of negative consequences that can impact its reputation, finances, and operations, such as

* Data loss or theft
* Disruption of operations
* Regulatory fines and penalties
* Litigation from various entities
* Reputational damage

Because the risks associated with a breach can be severe, it is essential for organizations to take proactive steps to prevent a breach, as well as have a plan in place to respond quickly and effectively if a breach does occur. This is why testing applications in a production environment is important.
