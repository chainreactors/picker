[2022YiR](/category/2022yir/)
[Year In Review](/category/year-in-review/)

We're back with another year in review focused episode. This time the focus will be the threat landscape generally and I'll be joined by threat researcher Caitlin Huey. In this episode we'll discuss what we found in the last year, with a focus on the general threat landscape.  We'll spend time discussing dual use tools, lolbins, and the surprising re-emergence of USB attacks in 2022.

All episdoes are available on the Talos Takes [podcast page](https://talosintelligence.com/podcasts/shows/beers_with_talos) and most major podcasting outlets.

Visit the [Year in Review page](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/year-in-review) for the full report, with topic summary reports, livestreams, podcasts, and other content starting December 14th.  New content will be added with each topic summary release through February.  You can access the full 2022 Cisco Talos Year in Review report directly here:
