ANY.RUN & OpenCTI: Transform SOC for Maximum Performance

[Security Operations Centers](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/action-plan-for-soc-webinar-recap/) (SOCs) face an overwhelming volume of threat alerts, making it difficult to separate real threats from false positives without heavy resource use.

For teams already working with, or planning to adopt Filigran’s **OpenCTI**, [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=opencti_connector&utm_term=140825&utm_content=linktolanding) now offers powerful interoperability that bring real-time malware analysis and fresh threat intelligence directly into your existing workflows. This helps SOCs boost efficiency, cut response times, and act with confidence, all without replacing current tools.

## Build Faster Response in OpenCTI with ANY.RUN
