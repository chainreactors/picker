# Hacker used a voice phishing attack to steal Cisco customers’ personal information

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

8:03 AM PDT · August 5, 2025

A cybercriminal tricked a Cisco representative into granting them access to steal the personal information of Cisco.com users, [the company said on Tuesday](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/CRM-vishing).

Cisco said it discovered the breach on July 24, blaming the incident on a voice phishing or “vishing” call. The hackers accessed and exported “a subset of basic profile information” from the database of a third party cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) system, according to the company’s disclosure.

Cisco said that the stolen data included the customer’s “name, organization name, address, Cisco assigned user ID, email address, phone number, and account-related metadata,” such as the account creation date.

The networking tech giant did not specify how many Cisco.com users were affected by the breach. When reached by email, Cisco spokesperson Carro Halpin would not say.

As [Bleeping Computer noted](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-discloses-data-breach-impacting-ciscocom-user-accounts/), this breach could be another one in a string of attacks that targeted companies’ Salesforce data, including [U.S. insurance giant Allianz Life](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/allianz-life-says-majority-of-customers-personal-data-stolen-in-cyberattack/), luxury retailer Tiffany and Co., [Australian airline Qantas](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/qantas-hack-results-in-theft-of-6-million-passengers-personal-data/), and others.

Cisco is a known customer of Salesforce, according [to the cloud giant](https://www.salesforce.com/resources/videos/cisco-digitally-transformed-customer-experience/).
