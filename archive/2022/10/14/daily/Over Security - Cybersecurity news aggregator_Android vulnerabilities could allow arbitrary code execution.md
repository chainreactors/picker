# Android vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution

Posted: October 6, 2022
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Several [vulnerabilities have been patched](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2022-10-01) in the Google [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) [operating system (OS)](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/windows-11-is-out-is-it-any-good-for-security/), the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. None of the vulnerabilities have been spotted in the wild.

Operating systems contain and manage all the programs and applications that a computer or mobile device is able to run. The Android OS was developed by Google for mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and more, and it’s installed on more than [70 percent](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide) of the world’s mobile phones.

Google’e latest security update for Android patched 42 vulnerabilities. Four of them received the label “critical”, of which three affect Qualcomm components. Qualcomm is a US-based chip maker that specializes in semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology.

Publicly disclosed computer security flaws are listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Its goal is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, databases, and services). The critical Qualcomm vulnerabilities all relate to the WLAN component and have the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2022-25748](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25748) has a [CVSS score](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/05/how-cvss-works-characterizing-and-scoring-vulnerabilities) of 9.8 out of 10 and could be exploited to trigger memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution.
* [CVE-2022-25718](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25718) has a CVSS score of 9.1 out of 10 and could allow a remote attacker to perform a [machine in the middle (MitM)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2018/07/when-three-isnt-a-crowd-man-in-the-middle-mitm-attacks-explained) attack.
* [CVE-2022-25720](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25720) has a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10 and could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an Android device by sending it send specially crafted traffic.

Looking at the three vulnerabilities listed above it seems that someone has taken a good look at the initial connection and [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) routines inn the Qualcomm WLAN [firmware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-is-firmware). All three vulnerabilities seem to lie in the initial stages of a connection.

The Group temporal key is used to encrypt all broadcast and multicast traffic between an access point and multiple client devices. It is part of the four-way handshake between an access point and the client device to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over wireless.

The other critical vulnerability is listed as [CVE-2022-20419](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-20419) is a vulnerability in Framework that could lead to local escalation of privilege (EoP) with no additional e...
