# Analyzing and remediating a malware infested T95 TV box from Amazon

Posted: January 30, 2023
 by [Nathan Collier](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/nathanmwb)

A couple of weeks ago, [security news outlets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-tv-box-on-amazon-came-pre-installed-with-malware/) made their rounds reporting on an Android TV box available on Amazon that came pre-installed with [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware). The findings came from a Canadian developer, Daniel Milisic, who posted on his [GitHub](https://github.com/DesktopECHO/T95-H616-Malware). What Daniel found was an Android T95 TV box infected with malware right out of the box!

Immediately, I recognized some of the apps that put up red flags, such as [Adups](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/12/mobile-menace-monday-upping-the-ante-on-adups-fwupgradeprovider). Under those circumstances, there’s only one logical thing a curious [mobile malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) researcher can do—I put in an IT Helpdesk request to buy a malware infested TV box! (For the record, I do not recommend putting in such a request at a non-information security company.)

The following is my analysis after days of obsessing over this little black box.

## Toolset

Before we continue with my analysis, let me explain some of the tools I used so when they are referenced it makes more sense. This is for the average reader who is not a tech nerd like myself. If you are technically inclined and want to skip to the good stuff, head down to header [Getting to the Core(java) of the case](#getting-to-the-core-java).

* Android Debug Bridge (`adb`)—I have referenced this command line tool many times in the past. It is your best friend into easily sending commands to an Android device via Windows, Mac, or Linux environments. It’s part of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html), but unless you plan to develop an Android app, I recommend just grabbing the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools). I have a great writeup on the Malwarebytes Forum on [how to install adb and use it to remediate preinstalled malware](https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/216616-removal-instructions-for-adups/).
* [Telerik Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)—Fiddler is an Internet traffic monitor with powerful [HTTPS](https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day) capturing capabilities. Most other internet traffic monitors can’t show details of HTTPS connections, because it is encrypted.  The powers of Fiddler can capture that traffic by installing a special certificate onto the device. Then by proxying internet traffic through a Windows machine, you can see otherwise private HTTPS traffic. The best part is it doesn’t require *root* access. That is unless you have a stubborn TV Box with no place in *Settings* to install certificates. Although more painful, there is a workaround to install with *root* access.
* [NoRoot Firewall](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.firewall)—This handy app allows or denies network traffic based on each individual app. More importantly, it also logs the traffic from each app, giving you a good baseline of what to look for in Internet traffic monitors. Although noi...
