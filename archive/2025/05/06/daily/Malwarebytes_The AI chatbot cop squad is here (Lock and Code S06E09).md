# The AI chatbot cop squad is here (Lock and Code S06E09)

Posted: May 5, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast*…

“Heidi” is a 36-year-old, San Francisco-born, divorced activist who is lonely, outspoken, and active on social media. “Jason” is a shy, bilingual teenager whose parents immigrated from Ecuador who likes anime, gaming, comic books, and hiking.

Neither of them is real. Both are supposed to fight crime.

Heidi and Jason are examples of “AI personas” that are being pitched by the company Massive Blue for its lead product, Overwatch. Already in use at police departments across the United States, Overwatch can allegedly help with the identification, investigation, and arrest of criminal suspects.

Understanding exactly how the technology works, however, is difficult—both Massive Blue and the police departments that have paid Massive Blue have remained rather secretive about Overwatch’s inner workings. But, [according to an investigation last month by 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/this-college-protester-isnt-real-its-an-ai-powered-undercover-bot-for-cops/), Overwatch is a mix of a few currently available technologies packaged into one software suite. Overwatch can scan social media sites for alleged criminal activity, and it can deploy “AI personas”—which have their own social media accounts and AI-generated profile pictures—to gather intelligence by chatting online with suspected criminals.

According to an Overwatch marketing deck obtained by 404 Media, the software’s [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) personas are “highly customizable and immediately deployable across all digital channels” and can take on the personalities of escorts, money launderers, sextortionists, and college protesters (who, in real life, engage in activity protected by the First Amendment).

Despite the variety of applications, 404 Media revealed that Overwatch has sparked interest from police departments investigating immigration and human trafficking. But the success rate, so far, is non-existent: Overwatch has reportedly not been used in the arrest of a single criminal suspect.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with 404 Media journalists and co-founders Emanuel Maiberg and Jason Koebler about Overwatch’s capabilities, why police departments are attracted to the technology, and why the murkiness around human trafficking may actually invite unproven solutions like AI chatbots.

 ”Nobody is going to buy that—that if you throw an AI chatbot into the mix, that’s somehow going to reduce gun crime in Americ,” Maiberg said. “But if you apply it to human trafficking, maybe somebody is willing to entertain that because, well, what is the actual problem with human trafficking? Where is it actually happening? Who is getting hurt by it? Who is actually committing it?”

He continued:

> “Maybe there you’re willing to entertain a high tech science fiction solution.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
