Every person has his or her own compass of values. **Values are a key element at the beginning of every founding story**, whether it is an own company or a grassroots movement in a corporation. Of course, such values are much more than financial values.

**At the corporate level, however, values are often reduced to financial value.**Many of you might recall a recent episode when you were asked to prove the value of your program in Euros.

The **[Economy of Common Good](https://www.ecogood.org/what-is-ecg/ecg-in-a-nutshell/)** takes a **more holistic view of corporate value dimensions**. To explore the tension between individual and corporate values we interviewed three change makers:

* **Dr. Susan Rößner** – Founder [Monomeer](https://www.monomeer.de/)

* **Uwe Treiber** – Founder [Sonnendruck](https://www.sonnendruck.com/)

* **Patricia Springer** – Co-initiator of a grassroots movement at SAP

We would like to thank them for their openness and for sharing their insights.

The questions spanned the **role that values play for change in people and in corporations**. We mixed the content of the conversations into a fictional dialogue between the two founders and the co-initiator of the grassroots movement.

## **Individual Values**

Values indicate which principles are important for a person. **Every human has their unique set of values** and might or might not live them in everyday life. Gaining clarity about one’s values is an important part of coaching. Values support us in making decisions in life, answering for example the following question: *“To what extent do I respect my values when I make this decision?”*.

Therefore, values are a key element when founding a company because they determine our actions. Values drive us, even if we are not always aware of them. Those who live in harmony with their values are authentic and clear which we were able to sense in the interviews.

#### **WHICH VALUES ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU?**

*Founder Sonnendruck:* I live the core values that have driven me since I was a teenager: justice, gratitude and respect. I am hurt by what is happening in the world: poverty, environmental issues, and the extinction of species.

*Founder Monomeer:* I’m very much an idealist and I have a positive view on life. My business idea was born out of activism. I overcame the fear of risk.

> **Insight #1** – **Individual values are at the beginning of a founding story**

*SAP Grassroots Movement:* I feel pain when I think of the wars being waged in the world and the destruction of ecological systems. I would like to contribute with my behavior so that life in all its beautiful and diverse forms can not only continue to exist, but also thrive – however small my influence may be comparatively.

In my value system, what matters most is integrity in thoughts, feelings and actions. When I live in accordance with my values, I feel authentic. Authenticity is good for me and for others. They then know where they stand with me. Mutual trust can develop on the basis of integrity and authenticity. Trust is indispensable for successful cooperation.

The central values that guide me are fairness, freedom, a sense of responsibility and joy in life, coupled with a pinch of humor. Not taking yourself so seriously helps you to cope better with life’s adversities and people’s shortcomings (including your own!). It is good that we are not perfect.

> **Insight #2 – Those who live in harmony with their values are authentic and clear**

*Founder Sonnendruck:* Everyone should do what fulfills them. Fulfillment is when searching stops. I want to make a difference with like-minded people and support other founders.

*Founder Monomeer:* I am free from obligations. Besides my company, my own time is important to me. I want to do things that are good for me in these hours, because my health plays a big role for me.

*SAP Grassroots Movement:* I would like to add that being guided by my values helps me to stay healthy and to face life’s challenges with resilience.

For me, fairness includes *“living and letting live,” keeping “give and take”* in a healthy balance as far as possible, and last but not least, dealing fairly with myself in the sense of self-care and consideration of my own limits. Only if I make sure that I stay healthy I can also make valuable contributions to the greater whole.

Freedom and responsibility are two sides of the same coin. I can only be truly free if I take full responsibility for my actions. For me, my personal freedom ends where it harms others. Instead of lecturing others on how best to live their lives, I practice living by the motto *“Be the change that you wish to see in the world”.* Depending on the situation in life or the mood of the day, I sometimes succeed more and sometimes less well.

I don’t want to make an ideology out of my understanding of values or even fall into a perfectionism or self-optimization trap. Errare humanum est. Life is a continuous learning process. It presents us with challenges from which we can grow and mature inwardly – but only if we accept the challenge and engage in the learning process.

## **Corporate Values**

*“Calculating the value of a company”* is something that many cons...
