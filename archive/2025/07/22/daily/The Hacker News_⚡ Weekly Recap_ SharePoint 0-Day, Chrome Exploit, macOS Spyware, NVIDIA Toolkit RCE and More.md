Even in well-secured environments, attackers are getting in‚Äînot with flashy exploits, but by quietly taking advantage of weak settings, outdated encryption, and trusted tools left unprotected.

These attacks don't depend on zero-days. They work by staying unnoticed‚Äîslipping through the cracks in what we monitor and what we assume is safe. What once looked suspicious now blends in, thanks to modular techniques and automation that copy normal behavior.

The real concern? Control isn't just being challenged‚Äîit's being quietly taken. This week's updates highlight how default settings, blurred trust boundaries, and exposed infrastructure are turning everyday systems into entry points.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Critical SharePoint Zero-Day Actively Exploited (Patch Released Today)](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/microsoft-releases-urgent-patch-for.html)** ‚Äî Microsoft has released fixes to address two security flaws in SharePoint Server that have come under active exploitation in the wild to breach dozens of organizations across the world. Details of exploitation emerged over the weekend, prompting Microsoft to issue an advisory for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, which are now assessed to be patch bypasses for two other SharePoint flaws tracked as CVE-2025-49704 and CVE-2025-49706, an exploit chain dubbed ToolShell that could be leveraged to achieve remote code execution on on-premises SharePoint servers. The two vulnerabilities were addressed by Microsoft earlier this month as part of its Patch Tuesday update. It's currently not known who is behind the mass-exploitation activity.

## Secure your LLMs Against Real-World Threats

LLMs are showing up everywhere ‚Äî from customer support to code generation. But most security tools weren't built for the risks they bring. The LLM Security Best Practices Cheat Sheet is a practical guide to help you identify, mitigate, and prevent the most critical LLM security risks across your AI stack.](https://thehackernews.uk/llm-security-best-practices-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Google Ships Patch for Actively Exploited Chrome Flaw](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/urgent-google-releases-critical-chrome.html)** ‚Äî Google out patches to resolve a high-severity vulnerability in Chrome browser (CVE-2025-6558) that has come under active exploitation in the wild, making it the fifth zero-day to be either actively abused or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC) since the start of the year. The vulnerability is an incorrect validation of untrusted input in the browser's ANGLE and GPU components that could allow an attacker to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page. The issue has been addressed in versions 138.0.7204.157/.158 for Windows and Apple macOS, and 138.0.7204.157 for Linux.
* **[Critical NVIDIA Container Toolkit Flaw Disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/critical-nvidia-container-toolkit-flaw.html)** ‚Äî A critical vulnerability in NVIDIA Container Toolkit (CVE-2025-23266) could be exploited to achieve code execution with elevated permissions. "A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to escalation of privileges, data tampering, information disclosure, and denial-of-service," the GPU maker said. Wiz, which disclosed the flaw, said the shortcoming could be trivially exploited to access, steal, or manipulate the sensitive data and proprietary models of all other customers running on the same shared hardware by means of a three-line exploit.
* **[New CrushFTP Bug Comes Under Attack](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/hackers-exploit-critical-crushftp-flaw.html)** ‚Äî CrushFTP revealed that a critical flaw in its file transfer software (CVE-2025-54309) has been exploited in the wild, with unknown threat actors reverse engineering its source code to discover the bug and target devices that are yet to be updated to the latest versions. The issue affects all versions of CrushFTP 10 before 10.8.5 and 11 before 11.3.4\_23. "The attack vector was HTTP(S) for how they could exploit the server," CrushFTP said. "We had fixed a different issue related to AS2 in HTTP(S) not realizing that a prior bug could be used like this exploit was. Hackers apparently saw our code change, and figured out a way to exploit the prior bug."
* **[Golden dMSA Attack in Windows Server 2025 Enables Cross-Domain Attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/critical-golden-dmsa-attack-in-windows.html)** ‚Äî Cybersecurity researchers disclosed a "critical design flaw" in delegated Managed Service Accounts (dMSAs) introduced in Windows Server 2025 that could enable cross-domain lateral movement and persistent access to all managed service accounts and their resources across Active Directory indefinitely. "The attack leverages a critical design flaw: A structure that's used for the password-generation computation contains predictable time-based components with only 1,024 possible combinations, making brute-force password generation computationally trivial," Semperis researcher Adi Malyanker said.
* **[Google Big Sleep AI Agent Flags Critical SQLite Flaw Before Exploitation](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/google-ai-big-sleep-stops-exploitation.html)** ‚Äî Big Sleep, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent launched by Google last year as a collaboration between DeepMind and Google Project Zero, facilitat...
