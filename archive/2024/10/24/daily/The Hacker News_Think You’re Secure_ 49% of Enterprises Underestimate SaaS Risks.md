It may come as a surprise to learn that 34% of security practitioners are in the dark about how many SaaS applications are deployed in their organizations. And it's no wonder—the recent AppOmni [2024 State of SaaS Security Report](https://appomni.com/reports/state-of-saas-security/?utm_campaign=ADV_GL_Q3FY25_THNStateofSaaS2024SponArticle&utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=hyperlink) reveals that only 15% of organizations centralize SaaS security within their cybersecurity teams. These statistics not only highlight a critical security blind spot, they also point to the fact that organizational culture is often overlooked as a driving factor behind these risks. As SaaS environments become more decentralized, the lack of clarity around roles and responsibilities is leaving companies exposed.

Most security teams focus solely on technical matters, often overlooking how their company's culture—its everyday practices, attitudes, and default policy enforcement processes—shapes their organization's security posture. Overconfidence, unclear responsibilities, and a lack of continuous monitoring can lead to SaaS security breaches. Let's examine why building a culture that values shared responsibility and proactive security is crucial.

## **The Role of Culture in SaaS Security**

Decentralized SaaS app procurement has completely changed the game for many organizations. Business units are now free to choose and adopt the tools they need to stay agile and drive business goals, but

with this freedom comes an enormous challenge: keeping security practices consistent and effective across the board.

### **The Risks of Autonomy Without Oversight**

Business units are often laser-focused on speed and innovation, which means security often takes a back seat. On the other side, security teams are left trying to keep up with a vast and ever-changing landscape of SaaS applications they didn't have a say in choosing. The resulting disconnect can create a culture where security isn't prioritized or worse, is viewed as an obstacle that slows down business initiatives and operations.

What often follows is an environment where vulnerabilities can thrive. Autonomy boosts productivity, but without coordinated security oversight it also brings serious risks. Rolling out new tools quickly without thorough reviews can weaken security controls and allow potential threats to go unnoticed.

### **The Real-World Consequences**

The AppOmni survey of 644 security decision-makers and managers worldwide indicates that [31% say their organizations suffered a data breach](https://appomni.com/reports/state-of-saas-security/?utm_campaign=ADV_GL_Q3FY25_THNStateofSaaS2024SponArticle&utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=hyperlink)—up five points from the year before. This surge in breaches could very well be tied to the culture of SaaS security. The 2023 [Snowflake breach](https://appomni.com/blog/secure-your-saas-environments-snowflake-servicenow/?utm_campaign=ADV_GL_Q3FY25_THNStateofSaaS2024SponArticle&utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=hyperlink), for example, was caused by customers failing to implement secure two-factor authentication to secure their production environments. The [massive supply chain breach at Sisense](https://appomni.com/blog/sisense-customer-data-compromise/?utm_campaign=ADV_GL_Q3FY25_THNStateofSaaS2024SponArticle&utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=hyperlink), a business intelligence (BI) and data analytics platform provider, points to the dangers of not properly securing SaaS ecosystems accessed by third parties.

In both cases, because of decentralized adoption, there was a lack of visibility and control over third-party integrations that led to major data exposures. These incidents drive home the need for a security-first culture that extends throughout the entire organization—not just within IT.

Creating a security-conscious culture isn't just about setting up policies; it's about changing mindsets. Business units need to understand the importance of security and get security teams involved early on when choosing new tools. At the same time, security teams should work proactively with business units and offer guidance that supports innovation rather than hinders it. Bridging this gap between autonomy and security is key to building a secure and productive environment.

## **Overconfidence and Misalignment in SaaS Security**

Many organizations think they're secure, but breaches from preventable issues like misconfigurations keep happening. And overconfidence is a cultural issue that can cause serious trouble.

### **Perception Versus Reality**

While companies often rate their SaaS cybersecurity maturity as high, the reality is often different. There's often a disconnect between what's assumed to be secure and what actually is secure, typically because the complexity and risks of SaaS environments are underestimated.

SaaS platforms are highly customizable and integrate with many tools, but, without careful management, they can introduce significant vulnerabilities. The AppOmni report shows that close to half of survey respondents say they have less than 10 apps connected to the Microsoft 365 platform, but aggregated data indicates that there are over a thousand SaaS-to-SaaS connections to Microsoft 365.

### **The Problem of Organizational Silos**

Overconfidence in SaaS security often stems from not fully understanding the shared responsibility model. Many believe that basic security measures—lik...
