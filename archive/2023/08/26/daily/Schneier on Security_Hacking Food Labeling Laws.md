## Hacking Food Labeling Laws

This [article](https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/21/kelloggs-mexico-nutrition-label/) talks about new Mexican laws about food labeling, and the lengths to which food manufacturers are going to ensure that they are not effective. There are the typical high-pressure lobbying tactics and lawsuits. But there’s also examples of companies hacking the laws:

> Companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz have begun designing their products so that their packages don’t have a true front or back, but rather two nearly identical labels—except for the fact that only one side has the required warning. As a result, supermarket clerks often place the products with the warning facing inward, effectively hiding it.

> […]
>
> Other companies have gotten creative in finding ways to keep their mascots, even without reformulating their foods, as is required by law. Bimbo, the international bread company that owns brands in the United States such as Entenmann’s and Takis, for example, technically removed its mascot from its packaging. It instead [printed the mascot](https://www.informabtl.com/bimbo-burla-nom-51-e-internautas-lo-hacen-viral/) on the actual food product—a ready to eat pancake—and made the packaging clear, so the mascot is still visible to consumers.

I wonder if the courts might rule that when the two sides are near identical like this – or generally when either side is usable for attracting customers to pick the product off a shelf – that there are actually two fronts, and therefore the required warning must be on both sides.

> “[The food companies] never stop… They will fight like hell to disrupt anything [aimed at] making that policy successful.”

My work adjusts our health insurance premiums based on 5 metrics: A1C, blood pressure, body composition (BMI), total cholesterol, and a tobacco use attestation.

I’m used to reading food labels and using nutrition trackers. But these actions are *definitely not* one-and-done activities. Dang, what a multi-faceted issue.

My favorite is rounding down to zero grams. Zero grams trans fats, zero grams polonium-210.

Re: My Favorite

My favorite marketing is/was the cholesterol-free banana.

And I once got the option for a cholesterol-free scrambled eggs. That seems to have been real but I do not know whether this was really 0% cholesterol (and I want my eggs with cholesterol).

@Winter: I like the ones where the big print proudly proclaims “Does not contain rat droppings!” while the fine print reads “Federal law does not allow any food product to contain rat droppings.” (Substitute any scary chemical name for “rat droppings”.)

See also: [Why Manufacturers Are Intentionally Adding Allergens to Their Foods](https://snacksafely.com/2020/06/why-allergens-are-being-intentionally-added-to-foods/)

In summary, the USA passed a law requiring food manufacturers to minimize cross-contamination with certain allergens that are not listed product ingredients, such as peanuts. A label like “may have come into contact with peanuts” or “made in a facility that processes peanuts” was no longer acceptable, and it was already illegal to list things as ingredients if they might not be present. Companies found that the cheapest way to comply was to reformulate their products, adding peanut flour—for example—as an ingredient.

On the topic of excessively sugary cereal, have people noticed that some cereals (including Kellog’s Raisin Bran) contain sugar-coated raisins? Raisins are already two-thirds sugar by mass!

Winter, I’ve also seen bananas appear on receipts labeled “GF” for gluten-free. And they’re high in sugar when they ripen, so perhaps a grocery store employee should add warning stickers when they turn yellow or brown.

People already mentioned some concerning ingredients in the previous story (about Parmesan), such as gelatin. Animal products where one wouldn’t expect them is a problem many people aren’t even aware of. Certain salad dressings, such as caesar, sometimes contain fish. Sugar production might involve animal bones. The innocent-sounding “confectioner’s glaze” contains insect secretions, whereas “carmine” usually contains crushed insects. All countries should follow India’s lead and require non-vegetarian and non-vegan products to be explicitly and prominently labeled as such. (But, of course, no manufacturer wants people to start questioning *why* something like candy might be non-vegetarian. Studies have shown people are grossed out by the idea of eating insects, so it’s important that these things can be legally hidden.)

I’m reminded of the movie Clerks, with Jay and Silent Bob\*, when the activist plopped, in the truest sense of the word, a cancerous human lung down on the counter. I thought it was quite amusing. Today, the clerk would simply pull out a Glock and 10-ring the bastard, like the Sikh’s and their wooden stick last week in Cali.

I’m with Chris Porter ( search youtube for ‘chris porter ugly and angry’ ), we should stop marketing to stupid people. He and I differ in that I include the unfortunate who are foodstuff intolerant (eg. lactose, nuts, artichokes\*\*, etc)

* + pre heart attack Silent Bob.
    \*\* – not really, but i’m allowed to act offended when questioned about this alergy

“Federal law does not allow any food product to contain rat droppings.”

Actually, it does....
