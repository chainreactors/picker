[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Yesterday, Cisco Talos debuted the [first Humans of Talos episode](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/humans-of-talos-meet-hazel-burton/), where I interviewed Hazel Burton, a face and voice you’re probably familiar with. In our conversation, Hazel shared not just the story of how she found her way onto the team, but also the passions and hobbies that energize her work. Plus, she offered a sneak peek into what she’s most looking forward to at Black Hat this year! With future Humans of Talos episodes, you’ll get to learn not only about the people behind the research, but the people behind the communications, operations, and design, too.

My team chose to name the series “Humans of Talos” as a cheeky wink to the world of machine learning (ML) and a reminder that no matter how sophisticated our technology gets, it’s always our humanity that makes the difference.

I'm a sci-fi nerd who loves a captive audience, so let’s consider Murderbot from Martha Wells’ “The Murderbot Diaries”(now a TV show starring Alexander Skarsgård). Designed as a security unit with both organic and mechanic parts, self-named Murderbot secretly hacks its own governor module and, instead of turning on humans, spends its free time watching soap operas like “The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon." So relatable, right? What draws readers in isn’t its technical specs. It’s Murderbot’s dry humor, awkwardness, struggle with newfound autonomy, and the way it wrestles with what it means to care for others (even if it pretends not to). Despite its past, when it was treated as a piece of equipment rather than a living thing, Murderbot is both highly analytical and empathetic. Advanced technology is most powerful when paired with genuine human creativity and insight, and this is a balance we seek every day at Talos.

If cozy, found family sci-fi is more your vibe, take Lovey (aka Sidra) from Becky Chambers’ “A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet” and “A Closed and Common Orbit.” Originally an AI managing a tunneling spaceship, Lovey is suddenly transferred into a human-like body kit and faces the challenge of living in a world she was never designed for, which is where her story really gets interesting. She has to learn everything from how to move and act to how to build friendships and find her own purpose. Learning to ask for help, make mistakes and trust the people around us is familiar to many of us in the cybersecurity community. No matter how advanced our tools become, it’s our willingness to learn from each other, collaborate and grow together that truly makes us stronger and better at our work.

So while Talos has practically always used ML in our work, I’ll always say that it is nothing without the humans behind it. We all share one mission: protecting our customers.

Tune into the next episode mid-August, and whether you’re streaming “Sanctuary Moon” or finding your place in the universe like Lovey, stay safe and secure out there!

## The one big thing

Cisco Talos Incident Response (Talos IR) has [identified a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-chaos-ransomware/) called Chaos, which is actively targeting organizations worldwide with sophisticated attacks involving phishing, remote management tool abuse, and double extortion tactics.

We assess with moderate confidence that Chaos was likely formed by former members of the BlackSuit (Royal) gang. They use advanced encryption, anti-analysis techniques, and target both local and networked systems for maximum disruption. We believe the new Chaos ransomware is unrelated to previous Chaos builder-generated variants, and the group uses the same name to create confusion.

### Why do I care?

Chaos is going after organizations of all sizes across verticals using techniques that can bypass common security measures, steal sensitive data and disrupt business operations. Even if you’re not a direct target, your company could be affected if you work with a business that is attacked, or if similar tactics are used against your sector.

### So now what?

Review your organization’s security posture, especially around email, remote access and backup systems. Make sure you’re using multi-factor authentication, keeping software up-to-date and educating employees about phishing and social engineering.
