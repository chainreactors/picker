  - [Reporting a vulnerability](Hello!

I hope you are doing well!

We are a security research team. Our tool automatically detected a vulnerability in this repository. We want to disclose it responsibly. GitHub has a feature called Private vulnerability reporting, which enables security research to privately disclose a vulnerability. Unfortunately, it is not enabled for this repository.

Can you enable it, so that we can report it?

Thanks in advance!

PS: you can read about how to enable private vulnerability reporting here: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository) - [discussion](https://github.com/chainreactors/picker/issues/294)
