## Russian Cyberwarfare Documents Leaked

Now [this](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/30/vulkan-files-leak-reveals-putins-global-and-domestic-cyberwarfare-tactics) is interesting:

> Thousands of pages of secret documents reveal how Vulkan’s engineers have worked for Russian military and intelligence agencies to support hacking operations, train operatives before attacks on national infrastructure, spread disinformation and control sections of the internet.
>
> The company’s work is linked to the federal security service or FSB, the domestic spy agency; the operational and intelligence divisions of the armed forces, known as the GOU and GRU; and the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence organisation.

Lots more at the link.

The documents are in Russian, so it will be a while before we get translations.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Big Business + Government.

Remember the shock when the NSA room in an AT&T major node was made public?

The noise about RIM / BlackBerrygetting under the covers with Packistan and Saudi Arabia?

How about Google and others snuggling up to the Chinese?

The list goes on and on… They talk about “Battle Fatigue”, “Shell Shock” and all sorts of other names when such atrocities nolonger even get a “shoulder shrug”…

It is what “business does” it’s always profit / growth / share holder value before morals, ethics, or quite often legality…

After all how many corps have had their collars felt over bribery and corruption with foreign governments?

Thus this “tie-up” is shall we say “expected” rather than “unexpected”.

I’m sure many will be shocked by some of what comes out but I can remember back to the early 1990’s where Russian Business was done with bombs, bullets and killer dogs, and those from the West who had invested and not taken appropriate precautions if they were lucky faced hundredsd year jail sentances for crimes they not their Russian partners had committed… With all the forged paperwork, bribed judges, frightened off or misteriously dead defence witnesses, the only sensible thing was to get the heck out of dodge with if you were lucky your shirt still on your back…

As we now know a lot of that alleged criminal activity and “wet work” was actually carried out by Russian Security Forces for certain Russian persons that are now only just getting put on international lists and having their cruise ships etc confiscated…

Let’s just say the closer you are the harder it is to say NO to such “inducements”. As someone pointed out “family tickets for flying lessons” especially out of hospital upper floors tend to only have one very short lesson, that often does not get to “terminal velocity” not that that effects the outcome.

“Later, I understood that we weren’t just collecting data. But that it was being used by the Russian secret service.”

“You don’t find network diagrams and design documents like this very often. It really is very intricate stuff. This wasn’t meant to be ever seen publicly.”

The experts cautioned that it was not clear which of the programs had been completed and deployed, as opposed to being merely developed and ordered up by the Russian military, including by units linked to the GRU. This includes programs to create fake social media pages and software that can identify and stockpile lists of vulnerabilities in computer systems across the globe for possible future targeting.

The documents detail a suite of computer programs and databases that would allow Russia’s intelligence agencies and hacking groups to better find vulnerabilities, coordinate attacks and control online activity. The trove offers a rare window into the secret corporate dealings of Russia’s military and spy agencies, including work for the notorious government hacking group Sandworm. The unsigned, 11-page document, dated 2019, showed a Sandworm official approving the data transfer protocol for one of the platforms.

Several mock-ups of a user interface for a project known as Amezit appear to depict examples of possible hacking targets, including the Foreign Ministry in Switzerland and a nuclear power plant in that nation. Another document shows a map of the United States with circles that appear to represent clusters of internet servers. The documents do not, however, include verified target lists, malicious software code or evidence linking the projects to known cyberattacks.

“With physical access, you can plug this tool into a network and it will map out vulnerable machines.” Emails suggest that the Amezit systems were at least tested by Russian intelligence agencies by 2020. Emails suggest that the Amezit systems were at least tested by Russian intelligence agencies by 2020.

Amezit is intended to enable discovery and mapping of critical facilities such as railways and power plants, but only when the attacker has physical access to a facility.

NTC Vulkan has held contracts with Russian intelligence services on projects to enable cyber and IO operations, potentially in tandem with cyber operations against OT targets.

Capabilities documented in the contracted NTC Vulkan project Scan could help automate parts of the reconnaissance and preparation of operations. Scan is a framework comprising multiple components including a large-scale database, methods to gather data from various sources, and a platform to process and action such data collections.

The documentation about Scan is incredibly comprehensive, detailing data transfer between components, open-source and foreign-made software and hardware. Additionally, the capabilities described for this tool’s design take into consideration the need for coordination across groups and operators in different locations. Comprehensive capability gat...
