Sports fans always appreciate athletes who demonstrate extraordinary skill on the field, especially when it results in a stunning, game-winning point or surpasses league records. That same admiration is also present in many organizations working with SAP partners.

Like athletes, partners are expected to offer profound knowledge in business processes and strategies, demonstrate proficiency in deploying and using relevant technology, and provide innovations that enhance the employee and customer experience. Reaching that level of competitiveness requires access to consistent, quality coaching that‚Äôs relevant and always available.

For that reason, enablement through coaching has become a mainstay for SAP partners using [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform.html) (SAP BTP), according to *Pavel Penaz, global head of Partner Solution Adoption Strategy and Execution for SAP Business Technology Platform at SAP.*

In his [blog](https://news.sap.com/2023/01/partner-enablement-through-coaching/), Penaz explains: ‚ÄúWith the introduction of a portfolio of partner coaching services for SAP BTP, SAP partners can get the insight they need for a specific use case from SAP experts. They can short-circuit the challenges and complexities of their use cases and resolve their development or implementation milestones more quickly and with confidence.‚Äù

By accessing consistent SAP expertise *through a variety of* individual and real-time live coaching options, SAP partners can become well-equipped to improve the dynamics and impact of innovation projects on SAP BTP. Such coaching services range from end-to-end partner co-innovation support to use case advisory services and technical guidance, and from prototyping to solution realization support and demand generation assistance.

Ready to explore the various partner coaching services for SAP BTP that can help your organization advance the future of innovation?
