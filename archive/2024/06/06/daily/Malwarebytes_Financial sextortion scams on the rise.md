# Financial sextortion scams on the rise

Posted: June 5, 2024
 by [Wendy Zamora](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/wzamora)

“Hey there!” messaged Savannah, someone 16-year-old Charlie had never met before, but looked cute in her profile picture. She had long blonde hair, blue eyes, and an adorable smile, so he decided to DM with her on Instagram. Soon their flirty exchanges grew heated, and Savannah was sending Charlie explicit photos. When she asked him for some in return, he thought nothing of taking a quick snap of himself naked and sending it her way.

Within seconds, “Savannah” morphed from vixen to vice, threatening Charlie with posting his nude picture all over social media—unless he sent $500. Then she gave Charlie three days to get her the money, otherwise she’d share the compromising photos with his friends and family.

While the above scene is fictional, it’s indicative of what the FBI and Department of Homeland Security agree is the fastest-growing cybercrime of the last three years. It’s called financially motivated sextortion, or financial sextortion, and its victims are mainly teenage boys between the ages of 14 and 17.

Financial sextortion happens when adult criminals create fake accounts posing as young women on social media, gaming platforms, or messaging apps, and coerce victims into sending explicit photos. Scammers then threaten victims into sending payment, usually in the form of [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency), wire transfer, or gift cards, otherwise they’ll post the images online for all to see.

In an emerging trend, some sextortion scammers are now using [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) to manipulate photos from victims’ social media accounts into sexually graphic content. The predators then threaten to share the content on public forums and pornographic websites, as well as report victims to the police, claiming they’re in possession of child pornography. Demands for money immediately follow.

In 2023 alone, the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC](https://www.missingkids.org/blog/2024/ncmec-releases-new-sextortion-data)) received 26,718 reports of financial sextortion of minors, more than double the 10,731 incidents reported in 2022. Sadly, these figures are likely far understated, since they rely on kids or their parents calling in the crime. A January 2024 threat intelligence report from [Network Contagion Research Institute](https://networkcontagion.us/wp-content/uploads/Yahoo-Boys_1.2.24.pdf) (NCRI) found children in the United States, Canada, and Australia are being targeted at an alarming rate, with a massive 1,000 percent surge in financial sextortion incidents in the last 18 months.

To illustrate how quickly the digital landscape has changed, a [2018 national survey](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1079063218800469) found just 5 percent of US teens reported being victims of sextortion. Fast forward to June 2023, and [51 percent of Generation Z respondents](https://www.weprotect.org/blog/two-thirds-of-gen-z-targeted-for-online-sextortion-new-snap-research/) said they or their friends were catfished in sextortion scams—47 percent in the last three months.
