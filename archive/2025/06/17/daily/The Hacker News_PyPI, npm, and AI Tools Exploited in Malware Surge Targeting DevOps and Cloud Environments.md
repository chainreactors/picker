Cybersecurity researchers from [SafeDep](https://safedep.io/digging-into-dynamic-malware-analysis-signals/#abnormal-binary-execution) and [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/blog/down-the-rabbit-hole-of-unicode-obfuscation/) detailed a number of malware-laced npm packages that are designed to execute remote code and download additional payloads.

The packages in question are listed below -

* eslint-config-airbnb-compat (676 Downloads)
* ts-runtime-compat-check (1,588 Downloads)
* solders (983 Downloads)
* @mediawave/lib (386 Downloads)

All the identified npm packages have since been taken down from npm, but not before they were downloaded hundreds of times from the package registry.

SafeDep's analysis of eslint-config-airbnb-compat found that the JavaScript library has ts-runtime-compat-check listed as a dependency, which, in turn, contacts an external server defined in the former package ("proxy.eslint-proxy[.]site") to retrieve and execute a Base64-encoded string. The exact nature of the payload is unknown.

"It implements a multi-stage remote code execution attack using a transitive dependency to hide the malicious code," SafeDep researcher Kunal Singh said.

Solders, on the other hand, has been found to incorporate a post-install script in its package.json, causing the malicious code to be automatically executed as soon as the package is installed.

"At first glance, it's hard to believe that this is actually valid JavaScript," the Veracode Threat Research team said. "It looks like a seemingly random collection of Japanese symbols. It turns out that this particular obfuscation scheme uses the Unicode characters as variable names and a sophisticated chain of dynamic code generation to work."

Decoding the script reveals an extra layer of obfuscation, unpacking which reveals its main function: Check if the compromised machine is Windows, and if so, run a PowerShell command to retrieve a next-stage payload from a remote server ("firewall[.]tel").

This second-stage PowerShell script, also obscured, is designed to fetch a Windows batch script from another domain ("cdn.audiowave[.]org") and [configures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus) a Windows Defender Antivirus exclusion list to avoid detection. The batch script then paves the way for the execution of a .NET DLL that reaches out to a PNG image hosted on ImgBB ("i.ibb[.]co").

"[The DLL] is grabbing the last two pixels from this image and then looping through some data contained elsewhere in it," Veracode said. "It ultimately builds up in memory YET ANOTHER .NET DLL."

Furthermore, the DLL is equipped to create task scheduler entries and features the ability to [bypass user account control](https://v3ded.github.io/redteam/utilizing-programmatic-identifiers-progids-for-uac-bypasses) ([UAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/how-it-works)) using a combination of [FodHelper.exe](https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/multi-stage-valleyrat-targets-chinese.html) and programmatic identifiers ([ProgIDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/fa-progids)) to evade defenses and avoid triggering any security alerts to the user.

The [newly-downloaded DLL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bd5febfeaaa40b763b88be3542d3b3e540f3b098c7f0c1659268d187f5bab8cf) is [Pulsar RAT](https://github.com/Quasar-Continuation/Pulsar), a "free, open-source Remote Administration Tool for Windows" and a variant of the Quasar RAT malware.

"From a wall of Japanese characters to a RAT hidden within the pixels of a PNG file, the attacker went to extraordinary lengths to conceal their payload, nesting it a dozen layers deep to evade detection," Veracode said. "While the attacker's ultimate objective for deploying the Pulsar RAT remains unclear, the sheer complexity of this delivery mechanism is a powerful indicator of malicious intent."

### Crypto Malware in the Open-Source Supply Chain

The findings also coincide with a report from Socket that identified credential stealers, cryptocurrency drainers, cryptojackers, and clippers as the main types of threats targeting the cryptocurrency and blockchain development ecosystem.

[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcsRCN99dbQ031CIsCTK7kBJHyBJTeAby02So3-6fNBY8TXKGHT3lFV-fN6IRbzHosYIDxtmgbVDcQ9L9XMq0KrjEZD9lERvh-LGzve0StDKczeWQBMolYIzc_7EHXqCP9F5YZM7XuxiVTQas7PNUPkpNBqATgfIMUouhlUa7F9wcfhha7Cq02guZ3wtKY/s790-rw-e365/stages.jpg)

Some of the examples of these packages include -

* express-dompurify and pumptoolforvolumeandcomment, which are capable of harvesting browser credentials and cryptocurrency wallet keys
* bs58js, which drains a victim's wallet and uses multi-hop transfers to obscure theft and frustrate forensic tracing.
* lsjglsjdv, asyncaiosignal, and raydium-sdk-liquidity-init, which functions as a clipper to monitor the system clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet strings and replace them with threat actor‑controlled addresses to reroute transactions to the attackers

"As Web3 development converges with mainstream software engineering, the attack surface for blockchain-focused projects is expanding in both scale and complexity," Socket security researcher Kirill Boychenko [said](https://socket.dev/blog/2025-blockchain-and-cryptocur...
