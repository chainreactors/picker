### Security VS Corporate Management

The devil and holy water

**THE SITUATION**

Having had the opportunity to observe a few hundred companies over the past 30 years, to date there is a greater and growing awareness of information security issues or corporate security more generally. It can be said that a good portion of the corporate and medium-sized enterprise has become well aware of the topic, in several cases somehow forced…

However, “pockets of resistance” still exist. There are still too many occasions, despite we are in 2023, when we find entities employing thought, energy and thus resources in comparing the “minimalistic approach” to security, when not merely cosmetic, of some corporate departments (the holy water), and the systematic, functional and substantial approach suggested by corporate security departments (the devil), whether or not headed by Chief Information Security Officers, Security Managers, or their equivalents. Still a bipolarity that tends to place the parties in constant confrontation, procrastinating investments and thus risk mitigation actions, a condition that is based on a continuous ideological clash, further fuelled by the pattern of prevarication typical of classic vertical hierarchies.

Finally, it should be reminded that investments in security can no longer be promoted and/or tied solely to the sensitivities of willing individuals (often considered a nuisance), since by current legislation, industry regulations and in addition to the standards that permeate the marketplace, common security measures and controls for the protection of information (and people) are on many occasions of mandatory adoption. I am not going to expand on listing these European and domestic, cross-cutting or industry regulations and standards; many of you know very well which ones I am referring to.

**QUESTION OF BALANCING FORCES**

To better express the central concept of this article, we intend to use the principle of magnetism. A magnet has two poles: a positive force, here likened to optimism, i.e. the consideration that there is a low likelihood of an adverse event occurring that would affect normal business operations; the other pole, a negative force, pessimism, for the matter at hand is closer to realism, that is the expectation that risk mitigation measures will be put in place to produce an environment prepared to withstand the impact of any adverse events.

Having made this introduction, it can be said that corporate management by definition has an optimistic attitude, “natural optimism,” particularly toward the business, but also toward the likelihood of risks occurring and consequently also toward the posture that the company should take on security.

In contrast, corporate security can only assume, by nature, a pessimistic attitude, “natural pessimism,” regarding the likelihood that risks may occur. This is normal, otherwise in the presence of excessive optimism a security department would produce a paradox and would certainly be of no use.

**Figure 1: the balance point**

Thus, reaching a “balance point” between the parties leads to the consideration that there is precisely a proper relationship and balance between optimism and pessimism, such that an appropriate security posture can be pursued and achieved, implemented through proper risk evaluation and treatment, within a shared cost-benefit ratio.

However, in the absence of systematic risk evaluation, the approach may be more humoral and less objective. The imbalance caused by a preponderance of optimism (and sometimes wait-and-see attitude), can easily result in taking a security posture that is undersized compared to the critical issues present, to the real business needs, which manifests itself in disinvestment toward security processes. Similarly, the preponderance of pessimis...
