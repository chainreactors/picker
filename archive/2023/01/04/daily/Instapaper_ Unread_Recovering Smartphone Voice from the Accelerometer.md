## Recovering Smartphone Voice from the Accelerometer

Yet another smartphone side-channel attack: ‚Äú[EarSpy: Spying Caller Speech and Identity through Tiny Vibrations of Smartphone Ear Speakers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12151.pdf)‚Äú:

> **Abstract:** Eavesdropping from the user‚Äôs smartphone is a well-known threat to the user‚Äôs safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system *EarSpy* can successfully detect word regions, time, and frequency domain features and generate a spectrogram for each word region. We train and test the extracted data using classical machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks. We found up to 98.66% accuracy in gender detection, 92.6% detection in speaker detection, and 56.42% detection in digit detection (which is 5X more significant than the random selection (10%)). Our result unveils the potential threat of eavesdropping on phone conversations from ear speakers using motion sensors.

It‚Äôs not great, but it‚Äôs an impressive start.

> zero-permission motion sensors

I think the root of the problem is that there are zero-permission data sources in mobile phones. Maybe the only solution for this game of whack-a-mole is complete segregation of data streams between apps.

Every app should be considered a security risk for every other app. For instance, if one app plays to the speakers, no other app should have zero-permission access to the speakers.

@ ALL,

Whilst this ‚Äúinstance‚Äù is relatively small it falls into a more general ‚Äúclass‚Äù of mechanical vibration ‚Äúside channels‚Äù.

And it‚Äôs got a lot worse since ‚ÄúMicro Electro-Mechanical Systems‚Äù(MEMS) transducers. Basically MEMS are made in a very similar way to semiconductor chips, thus you get many thousand on a standard wafer.

The thing is the mechanical component that moves is extrodinarily small, light, and sensitive, which gives them a very wide bandwidth.

The difference between a MEMS microphone transducer and MEMS accelerometer or motion sensor is actually very small. The real difference is in what part of the mechanical vibration frequency range you want them to work.

Typically microphones in the 50-15,000Hz range and motion sensors below 50Hz.

Thus what makes the MEMS different is the ‚ÄúDigital Signal Processing‚Äù.

However we know that recovering usable audio in that low frequency range is quite ‚Äúachivable‚Äù from the work of those using high speed video cameras watching light reflect of crisp/chip packets and similar shiny surfaces.

FYI ‚Ä¶ if you want to experiment with what the researchers used, you can download the **Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite** app. The app connects with a lot of your phone‚Äôs sensors.

You can use it to view your phone‚Äôs accelerometer data. The Z-axis was most relevant for measuring ear speaker vibrations. It‚Äôs pretty fun.

See no evil: People find good in villains

=Across these measures, the research indicated that both children and adults consistently evaluated villains‚Äô true selves to be overwhelmingly evil and much more negative than heroes‚Äô. At the same time, researchers also detected an asymmetry in the judgments, wherein villains were more likely than heroes to have a true self that differed from their outward behavior.=

@Clive Robinson

That was very informative, thank you. [Here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/VisualMic/) is an MIT project demonstrating what they deemed a ‚Äúvisual microphone‚Äù. One use I thought was really interesting is recovering audio from silent movies which with a ton of approximation could restore the actors‚Äô vocal performances (if you can extract tone and cadence, the script can be used to generate the audio).

It should also be possible to recover audio from charged particles in the air or WIFI even similar to [this](https://youtu.be/g3LT_b6K0Mc) project. I suppose neutrinos could tell you about vibrations in a planet‚Äôs core. As a friend and colleague once told me, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all just waves man.‚Äù üòÑ

It‚Äôs important to discuss this in the context of existing mitigations in Android. There are new restrictions for sampling motion at 200 Hz and older restrictions (Android 9 and later) on apps running in the background.
