# iPhone users in 98 countries warned about spyware by Apple

Posted: July 12, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In April 2024, we reported how Apple was [warning people of mercenary attacks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/apple-warns-people-of-mercenary-attacks-via-threat-notification-system) via its threat notification system. At the time it warned users in 92 countries. In a new round, Apple is now warning users in 98 countries of potential mercenary [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) attacks.

The message sent to the affected users says:

> “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID.”

In the same message, Apple says that it is very likely that the person in question is being specifically targeted because of what they do or who they are. And, although there is a certain margin of error, the user should take this warning seriously.

Mercenary spyware is used by governments to target people like journalists, political activists, and similar targets, and involves the use of sophisticated tools like [Pegasus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/02/the-worlds-most-coveted-spyware-pegasus-lock-and-code-s03e04). Pegasus is one of the world’s most advanced and invasive spyware tools, known to utilize zero-day vulnerabilities against mobile devices.

On the [website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174) that explains Apple threat notifications and protection against mercenary spyware, it specifically mentions Pegasus:

> “According to public reporting and research by civil society organizations, technology firms, and journalists, individually targeted attacks of such exceptional cost and complexity have historically been associated with state actors, including private companies developing mercenary spyware on their behalf, such as Pegasus from the NSO Group.”

Apple has sent out similar notifications multiple times a year since 2021 but doesn’t disclose how it determines who to send them to, since that might aid attackers in evading future detection.

Amnesty International urges those that have received such a notification to take it seriously. Amnesty’s Security Lab offers digital forensic support to potential victims like human rights defenders, activists, journalists and members of civil society.

If you are a member of civil society, and you have received an Apple notification, you can contact Amnesty International and request forensic support using the [Get Help form](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/get-help/).

Whether you’ve received that notification or not, every iPhone user should make sure they have the latest updates, protect the device with a passcode, use [multi-factor authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for) and a strong password for Apple ID, only install apps from the Apple Play store, use a [mobile security product](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile), and be careful what they open or tap on.

People that have reason to believe they might be individually targeted by mercenary spyware attacks, can enable [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120) on their Apple devices for additional protection.

Lockdown Mode does the following:

* Blocks most message attachments
* Blocks incoming FaceTime calls from pe...
