## For starters: Crypto, import tariffs, and Microsoft shipping out staff

Kettle It's been a fairly troubling week in terms of the relationship between China and the Western world.

Chiefly, America announced stiff [import tariffs](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/us_china_tariff_hikes/) on Chinese-made tech, Microsoft gave key engineering and cloud staff [the opportunity](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/microsoft_china_staff_relocate/) to get out of China while they still can, and the UK signaled it is [absolutely fed up](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/the_uks_alarm_over_china/) with Beijing menacing cyber-space. (Yes, we have heard of the NSA and GCHQ.)

For this latest [Kettle](https://www.theregister.com/Tag/Kettle) episode, which you can watch below, our cybersecurity editor Jessica Lyons weighed it all up, Brandon Vigliarolo discussed the [bizarre case](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/biden_mineone_cryptocurrency/) of an American nuclear missile base blocking a Chinese crypto-coin-mining operation, and Tom Claburn added his experience to the debate, hosted by Iain Thomson. The show was produced by Nicole Hemsoth Prickett.
