Someone called OxShagger thinks he has come up with the perfect Valentine‚Äôs surprise for Oxford students, but is the way he has gone about ‚Äúbookworms with benefits‚Äù really a good idea? Robot security guards are trundling the streets of ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì America. And a writer of paranormal bully romances (no, we don‚Äôt know what that means either) returns from the grave‚Ä¶

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Host Unknown‚Äôs Andrew Agn√™s.
