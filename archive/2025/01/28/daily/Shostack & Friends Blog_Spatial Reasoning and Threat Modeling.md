# Spatial Reasoning and Threat Modeling

Do diagrams leverage the brain in a different way?
![An abstract images for the header](/images/blog/img/2025/spatial-reasoning-and-threat-modeling-1000w.png)

Creating, refining, communicating, and working with models are all
important parts of how I think about answering “what are we working
on?” People often want to eliminate the diagramming or modeling step
as “not required,” and that’s a mistake. The act of engaging with
the higher order question of ‘what are we ~~building~~ working on’ is important,
and diagramming acts as a forcing function. Committing to a specific
representation opens the door to reflecting, criticism or even
disagreement, sometimes in counter-productive ways, sometimes ‘merely’
letting the pursuit of perfection distract us.

So as I was reading [Improving
Computer Science
Performance by Developing Spatial Skills](https://cacm.acm.org/research/improving-cs-performance-by-developing-spatial-skills/),
I was struck by one of the pull quotes: “Humans recruit spatial
structures in the brain for pseudo-spatial representations of complex,
abstract ideas.” The paper is focused on how spatial
reasoning can help people learn computer science, and that
spatial reasoning is unusual because it’s can be taught and improves
performance on a wide range of tasks. In this blog post, I’m engaging
with that really interesting idea of “recruiting spatial structures to
represent complex ideas.” Wow.

Threat modeling is, in part, an exercise in associative
reasoning. “This thing looks like that thing, and that thing had these
problems.” Structures like STRIDE per element give us value in part by
helping focus our iteration, and in part by chunking security. (I
don’t think anyone’s done an experiment, but it wouldn’t surprise me
if STRIDE takes up only one chunk of working memory in experts.) But
everything that we’re trying to do takes space in the brain. In a
recent class, someone asked me about some very specific security
impact of a thing, after a minute of stammering said something like:
“I have no idea. I’m tracking how students are responding to prompts,
overall participation and energy, time, and I don’t worry about the
security of this fake system.”

But short term memory is tiny and cramped. (It’s [famously described](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4486516/)
as “seven plus
or minus 2.”) If we can trick our brains into using additional memory systems
beyond our normal short term and long term memory, we absolutely
should. And as I think about it, one of the most famous and enduring
tricks for memorization is the ‘memory palace,’ which may be using
some of these same mechanisms.

This also ties into how we might use LLMs to help us threat model. On
the one hand, they can act as giant contextual retrieval engines. That
requires that we set the context well. It may be possible to do that
without a diagram, but a picture is not only worth a thousand words,
but it’s easier to review. And if it really uses a different part of
the brain, then it can help us keep more information at hand, to
better see how an LLM is doing.
