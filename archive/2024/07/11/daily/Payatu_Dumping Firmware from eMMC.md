## Introduction

Welcome to this blog! Today, weâ€™ll explore how to read data from an eMMC chip. Based on my experience with hardware security, Iâ€™ve observed that many IoT devices utilize eMMC chips for firmware storage. Therefore, comprehending how to extract data from these chips is crucial. In this post, Iâ€™ll discuss a technique you can employ to read data from an eMMC chip and proceed with further analysis. For demonstration purposes, the eMMC chip featured in this blog post is sourced from an EV scooter. ðŸ˜€
