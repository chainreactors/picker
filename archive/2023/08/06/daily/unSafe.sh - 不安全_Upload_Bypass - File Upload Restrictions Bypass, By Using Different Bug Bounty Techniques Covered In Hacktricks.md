## Disclaimer

**Please note that the use of Upload\_Bypass and any actions taken with it are solely at your own risk. The tool is provided for educational and testing purposes only. The developer of Upload\_Bypass is not responsible for any misuse, damage, or illegal activities caused by its usage.**

While Upload\_Bypass aims to assist Pentesters and Bug Hunters in testing file upload mechanisms, it is essential to obtain proper [authorization](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Authorization "authorization") and adhere to applicable laws and regulations before performing any security assessments. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions from the relevant stakeholders before conducting any testing activities.

The results and findings obtained from using Upload\_Bypass should be communicated responsibly and in accordance with established disclosure processes. It is crucial to respect the privacy and integrity of the tested systems and refrain from causing harm or disruption.

By using Upload\_Bypass, you acknowledge that the developer cannot be held liable for any consequences resulting from its use. Use the tool responsibly and ethically to promote the security and integrity of web applications.

1. Webshell mode: The tool will try to upload a Webshell with a random name, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the tool enters an "Interactive shell".
2. Eicar mode: The tool will try to upload an Eicar(Anti-Malware test file) instead of a Webshell, and if the user specifies the location of the uploaded file, the tool will check if the file uploaded successfully and exists in the system in order to determine if an Anti-Malware is present on the system.
3. A directory with the name of the tested host will be created in the Tool's directory upon success, with the results saved in Excel and Text files.

Download the latest version from Releases page.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The tool will not function properly if the file upload mechanism includes CAPTCHA implementation.

Perhaps in the future the tool will include an OCR.

## ***Attension***

The Tool is compatible exclusively with output file requests generated by Burp Suite.

Before saving the Burp file, replace the file content with the string \*content\* and filename.ext with the string \*filename\* and Content-Type header with \*mimetype\*(only if the tool is not able to recognize it automatically).

How a request should look before the changes:
