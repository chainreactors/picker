Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent script code injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Boom CMS v8.0.7 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The vulnerability is located in the input fields of the album title and album description in the asset-manager module.
Attackers with low privileges are able to add own malformed albums with malicious script code in the title and description.
After the inject the albums are being displayed in the backend were the execute takes place on preview of the main assets.
The attack vector of the vulnerability is persistent and the request method to inject is post. The validation tries to parse
the content by usage of a backslash. Thus does not have any impact to inject own malicious
java-scripts because of its only performed for double- and single-quotes to prevent sql injections.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] assets-manager (album)

Vulnerable Function(s):
[+] add

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] title
[+] description

Affected Module(s):
[+] Frontend (Albums)
[+] Backend (Albums Assets)

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Login to the application as restricted user
2. Create a new album
3. Inject a test script code payload to title and description
4. Save the request
5. Preview frontend (albums) and backend (assets-manager & albums listing) to provoke the execution
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable title and description parameters.
Restrict the input fields and disallow usage of special chars. Sanitize the output listing location to prevent further attacks.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the application is estimated as medium.
