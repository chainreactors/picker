# Rebooting

[November 17, 2022](https://rdist.root.org/2022/11/17/rebooting/) ~ [Nate Lawson](https://rdist.root.org/author/rdist/)

I’ve recently had some time to catch up on reading and research. I’ve decided to start writing again here about cryptography, embedded systems, and security.

Recently, I enjoyed being on the “[Security, Cryptography, Whatever](https://securitycryptographywhatever.buzzsprout.com)” podcast. I got a chance to cover some past projects and how the fields of cryptography and security have changed over the past 25 years.

* [Part 1](https://securitycryptographywhatever.buzzsprout.com/1822302/11291490-nate-lawson-part-1) (1997 – 2007): Netscape, FIPS-140, Cryptography Research, satellite TV piracy wars, Blu-ray content protection wars
* [Part 2](https://securitycryptographywhatever.buzzsprout.com/1822302/11410130-nate-lawson-ii): (2008 – 2016): toll systems & smart meter hacking, designing a secure payment terminal (one of my favorite design projects), binary similarity analysis for app stores startup ([SourceDNA](https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/19/apple-app-store-apps-privacy-advertising/)), and the possible future of high assurance designs

I hope you enjoy hearing these stories as much as I did retelling them. More to come soon!
