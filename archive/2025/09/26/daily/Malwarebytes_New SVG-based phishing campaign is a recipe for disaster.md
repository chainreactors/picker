# New SVG-based phishing campaign is a recipe for disaster

Posted: September 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

We’ve written in the past about cybercriminals using SVG files for [phishing](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/criminals-smuggle-phishing-code-in-svg-images) and for [clickjack campaigns](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/adult-sites-trick-users-into-liking-facebook-posts-using-a-clickjack-trojan). We found a new, rather sophisticated example of an SVG involved in phishing.

For readers that missed the earlier posts, SVG files are not always simply image files. Because they are written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), they can contain HTML and JavaScript code, which cybercriminals can exploit for malicious purposes.

Another advantage for phishers is that, on a Windows computer, SVG files get opened by Microsoft Edge, regardless of what your default browser is. Since [most people prefer to use a different browser](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share), such as Chrome, Edge can often be overlooked when it comes to adding protection like ad-blockers and web filters.

The malicious SVG we’ve found uses a rather unusual method to send targets to a phishing site.

Inside `RECElPT.SVG` we found a script containing a lot of food/recipe-related names (“menuIngredients”, “bakingRound”, “saladBowl”, etc.), which are all simply creative disguises for obfuscating the code’s malicious intentions.

This is the part of the code where the phishers hid a redirect:

![function to define the ingredients](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/ingredients.png?w=1024)

Upon close inspection, the illusion of an edible recipe quickly disappears. 141 cups of eggs, anyone?

But picking the code apart, we noticed that the decoder works like this:

1. Search for data-ingredients=”…” in the given text.
2. Split the string inside the attribute by commas to get a list. E.g., 219cups\_flour, 205tbsp\_eggs,…
3. For each element, extract the leading numeric value (e.g., 219 from 219cups\_flour).
4. Subtract 100 from this value.
5. If the result is an ASCII printable character (ranging from 32–126), then convert it to the character with that number.
6. Join all characters together to form the final decoded string.

Using this method we arrived at `window.location.replace("https://outuer.devconptytld[.]com.au/");`

`window.location.replace` is a JavaScript method that replaces the current resource with the one at the provided URL. In other words, it redirects the target to that location if they open the SVG file.

When redirected, the user will see this prompt, which is basically intended to hide the real location of the server behind Cloudflare services, but also provides some sense of legitimacy for the visitor.

It doesn’t matter what the user does here, they will get forwarded again with the code passing the e parameter (the target’s email address) on to the next destination.

But this is where our adventure ended. For us, the next site was an empty one.

We couldn’t determine what conditions had to be met to get to the next stage of the phishing expedition. But it is highly likely it will display a fake login form (almost certainly Microsoft 365- or Outlook-themed), to capture the target’s username ...
