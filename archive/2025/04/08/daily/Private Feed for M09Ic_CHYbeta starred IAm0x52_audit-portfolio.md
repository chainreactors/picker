#

As a professional smart contract auditor, I have conducted over 100 security reviews for public and private clients. With 30+ first-place finishes in public contests on platforms like [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/%400x52) and [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/watson/0x52), I have been recognized as a top-performing security expert. By prioritizing rigorous analysis and providing actionable recommendations, I have contributed to securing over **$1 billion in TVL across 100+ protocols**. Throughout my career I have collaborated with many organizations including the prestigious [Blackthorn](https://www.blackthorn.xyz/) as a founding security researcher and as a Lead Security researcher at [SpearbitDAO](https://cantina.xyz/u/iam0x52).
