### [Microsoft DCU's Takedown of RaccoonO365](https://garwarner.blogspot.com/2025/09/microsoft-dcus-takedown-of-raccoono365.html)

When I saw the name of the Microsoft Digital Crime Unit's latest target, "RaccoonO365" I probably reacted to it differently than most.  With the help of a friend in Lagos, we've been watching the money launderers and things have reached a point that they now refer to what we previously called "Business Email Compromise" or BEC as "O365 Jobs."

Microsoft DCU is famous for doing massive takedowns of the infrastructure used by cyber criminals via Civil action in the US courts.  This case is no different, as they filed for an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order in the Southern District of New York in a co-filing with the Health-ISAC.  The venue is justified in their filing in part by showing that New York City was one of the most targeted cities, based on victims that they were able to identify.

Microsoft used several methods of determining that Joshua Ogundipe of Nigeria played a key role in this Phishing-as-a-Service enterprise, which began in the summer of 2024 after Microsoft had terminated a similar platform called Fake ONNX.

A great deal of the infrastructure for RaccoonO365 was hidden behind Cloudflare's Reverse Proxy service and/or using Cloudflare's Domain Registration service, and Microsoft was able to determine that Joshua controlled the associated Cloudflare accounts.

Microsoft also reveals the LinkedIn account of Joshua Ogundipe, which displays the logo of DIGIhubng and indicates that he lives in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. Yet another criminal who works for a company that claims to teach "Ethical Hacking"  ...

### Microsoft & Health-ISAC's Interest in RaccoonO365

The Complaint filed by Microsoft and Health-ISAC, says that "at least 25 healthcare companies, including 9 organizations who are members of Health-ISAC have been hit by RaccoonO365 phishing kits."  In some cases the phishing emails were detected and blocked, while in other cases an employee fell victim to the phish, sharing their credentials to the criminal, however the organizations responded swiftly with password resets for those individuals.

Microsoft and Health-ISAC charge that the following violations were performed by the RaccoonO365 co-conspirators, harming both organizations and their customers and members.

Count I: Violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 USC § 1030.
Count II: Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 USC § 1962.
Count III: Conspiracy to Violate RICO, 18 USC § 1962(d).
Count IV: Violation of Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 USC § 2701.
Count V: (Microsoft only): False Designation of Origin under the Lanham Act, 15 USC § 1125(a).
Count VI: (Microsoft only): Trademark Infringement Under the Lanham Act, 15 USC § 1114 et seq.
Count VII: (Microsoft only): Trademark Dilution under the Lanham Act, 15 USC § 1125(c).
Count VIII: Common Law Trespass to Chattels.
Count IX: Conversion.
Count X: Unjust Enrichment.

### RaccoonO365 Crypto Addresses

When Microsoft made a test purchase by interacting with the "RaccoonO365" admin on Telegram, they were provided a Bitcoin address, bc1qmlsuqm4p6lme8e2qna3mkj07k8j7vttp0l7ydv, to make their payment.  That address is hosted at the Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange Bitnob.com, and had received deposits 132 times between October 16, 2024 and July 1, 2025, totaling just under $34,000.

Cloudflare's "Cloudforce One" team also published a list of [Indicators of Compromise for RaccoonO365](https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/research/report/cloudflare-participates-in-global-operation-to-disrupt-raccoono365/#indicators-of-compromise-iocs).  They share a different Bitcoin address, bc1qjtlzug5wu7ag8yskn5h2xjd27uetq5cc4sahh5, which went live on July 3, 2025 and received payments through September 13, 2025.  An ERC20 address, also received $2800 between May 7, 2025 and August 29, 2025 (0xf5C2E3749F332175D94C7de7bf7AA8d679E460B7).  The USDT address, TBB5T28b9n2SK8shXb9oq867EcsNE5dZie, also went live the first week of July and received $7,448 through September 12, 2025. Those funds flow to a [ChipperCash](https://www.chippercash.com/) account, which has more than 5 million downloads in the Google Play Store. The animation on their home page shows people in the United States sending funds to people in Nigeria.
