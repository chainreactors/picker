Qantas says that when cybercrooks attacked a "third party platform" used by the airline's contact center systems, they accessed the personal information and frequent flyer numbers of the "majority" of the circa 5.7 million people affected.

The Aussie airline said today this personal information includes names and/or email addresses, and warned frequent flyer numbers, customer tiers, status credits, and points balances might also be compromised.

In a "minority" of the total number of cases – reportedly up to one million people – other data points were also revealed. These include:

* Physical addresses (residential addresses and business addresses, including hotels for misplaced baggage delivery)
* Dates of birth
* Phone numbers
* Genders
* Meal preferences

No doubt hoping to mitigate worries about exposing physical addresses, the airline said its investigations showed that many of these were years old and potentially outdated, while others were only partially completed (postcodes only).
