# Datamesh: A Private Data Storage Layer

## Overview

Datamesh is a secure, decentralized data storage layer built in Rust using the libp2p protocol. It enables users to register, upload, download, and manage files with strong privacy guarantees. Users authenticate using ed25519 cryptographic keys, ensuring secure access to their data. It uses a peer-to-peer network to store and share data, ensuring privacy and security.
The platform is built using Rust and leverages the Tokio runtime for asynchronous operations.
It supports user registration, file uploads , and secure downloads with signature verification.
The Protocol uses ed25519 for public key cryptography to ensure the integrity and authenticity of data transfers.
This Protocol uses libp2p for peer-to-peer networking,
