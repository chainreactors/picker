## But failing to recover from incidents is unforgivable because 'adrenalin does not scale'

Zero tolerance of failure by information security professionals is unrealistic, and makes it harder for cyber security folk to do the essential part of their job: recovering fast from inevitable attacks, according to Gartner analysts Chris Mixter and Dennis Xu.

In their keynote at the firm's Security & Risk Management Summit in Sydney, Australia, today, VP analyst Mixter and director analyst Xu argued that no amount of effort can prevent infosec incidents, and the quality of organizations' response is a more appropriate measure of an infosec team’s effectiveness than expecting they will never fail to fend off the never-ending torrent of attacks.

"Adrenalin does not scale," Xu told the event – a reference to the practice of infosec teams responding to incidents by attacking them without a rehearsed plan.
