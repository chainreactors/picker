What is ‘predictive policing’? Sounds like a concept from the 1984 movie.

Wikipedia has quite a gloomy entry on it, EU being the least serious offender: it would be interesting to see what the other readers of this blog think.

…and of course, not a word about the cancer of the “Free World” – the StingRay almighty…not in my state anyway, even though I’ve been able to detect them, plus a word about the CIA offices and officers operating WITHIN the USA would be nice, since we the sheeple are financing all that crap, dontcha think? Oh, but think about the children, right?

Hmmph! To “Explore the Map” you need javascript on, and accept third party cookies. What was that about surveillance … ?

@ Daniel Popescu,

With regards your request,

> “it would be interesting to see what the other readers of this blog think.”

Predictive policing might sound like it’s,

“a concept from the 1984 movie”

But I assure you it does not have the glamour or excitement the movies try to instill for the purposes of entertainment.

The thing is it’s kind of “Doomed to Fail” just as CCTV has, which is why people who do not know enough are suggesting they both be “augmented by AI”.

Look on it as an evolutionary process where “Predictive Policing” is in effect at best a very imperfect statistical model based very much on the past. That is therefore always going to be “behind the curve” except for type 3&4 miscreants.

Because type 1&2 criminals actually think observe hypothesize and test. So in effect “out evolve” not just CCTV but Predictive Policing.

One way the type 1&2 and a fair number of type 3 criminal can do this, is by totally changing the way they commit crime. So “the smarter ones” have taken up “crime on line” where the authorities really don’t have a presence let alone an effective one.

Yes the authorities are starting to change, but it’s largely not by their own abilities, they have to “buy in”. That is they are reliant on those who have a strong presence in technology and pushing it forward. So a lot of “On-line crime busting” is actually done on the out-growth of “student projects” and “research projects” that get wrapped up in an expensive UI for the authorities to use. Or as is now more the case by technology companies to use for them.

Doesn’t seem to do anything. Let me know when it’s actually working.
