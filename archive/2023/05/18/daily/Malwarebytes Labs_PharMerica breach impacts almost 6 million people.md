# PharMerica breach impacts almost 6 million people

Posted: May 17, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

US pharmacy giant PharMerica has [notified](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23813101-pharmerica-sample-letter?responsive=1&title=1) over 5.8 million people about a security incident in which it says [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) and medical information may have been obtained by cybercriminals. The [Data Breach Notification](https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/6282d559-46ff-434c-9edd-41815a7fcd74.shtml) lists the total number of persons affected as 5,815,591.

An investigation was started after PharMerica noticed suspicious activity on its network. The investigation showed that an unauthorized party accessed PharMerica computer systems on March 12-13, 2023, and that this party may have had access to certain personal information. The incident was noticed on March 14, and a week later PharMerica identified that the personal information accessed included names, dates of birth, [Social Security numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web), medication lists and health insurance information.

[Ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) group Money Message has claimed responsibility for the attack. The gang claims that they encrypted almost the entire PharMerica infrastructure, and has published parts of the stolen data to their leak site.

Money Message is a new ransomware which targets both Windows and Linux systems. As we mentioned in our [May ransomware review](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/05/ransomware-review-may-2023), Taiwanese PC parts maker MSI also fell victim to Money Message.

On its [website](https://pharmerica.com/data-privacy-incident/) PharMerica says:

> “At this point, PharMerica is not aware of any fraud or [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft) to any individual as a result of this incident, but is nonetheless notifying potentially affected individuals to provide them with more information and resources. The notice will include information on steps individuals can take to protect themselves against potential fraud or identity theft. PharMerica has arranged for complimentary identity protection and credit monitoring services for potentially affected individuals.”

An extra point of concern is that a relative large part of the people affected by the breach have passed away, which makes it unlikely that relatives will regularly monitor their credit reports, making any cybercrime related to the stolen data even more difficult to detect and stop.

## What to do if you’ve been caught in a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the victim of a [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach).
