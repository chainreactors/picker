# Building Intuition into Monitoring for OT/ICS Security

Feb 22, 2023

*by Danielle Jablanski*

The current state of operational technology and industrial control systems cybersecurity is turning a corner. It has progressed from decades of admiring hypothetical scenarios, to realizing the significance of very real threats and vulnerabilities that exist across critical infrastructure all over the globe. [Recent revelations](https://blog.gigamon.com/2022/04/27/the-visibility-paradox-in-critical-infrastructure-monitoring/) from Industroyer2 and INCONTROLLER teach us that you can only alert on and potentially catch what you know how to look for in these environments.

The evolution of the technologies we care about in OT/ICS began with on premises connectivity between systems, often using ethernet, to connecting multiple sites and often remote locations, to the expansion of SCADA architectures, and are increasingly adopting cloud technologies. Some sectors are experiencing technological revolutions, changing the principles of operations, and introducing increasingly smart and connected devices. Others are refocusing their attention on industrial and legacy systems difficult and costly to replace, shoring up their security approaches in a renaissance of enlightened approaches to a difficult problem set.

This evolution has ushered in waves of complexity for communication across the levels and zones of [the Purdue model](https://www.zscaler.com/resources/security-terms-glossary/what-is-purdue-model-ics-security), and new layers of centralized management on top of many decentralized nodes and systems with limited embedded or enabled security features. In practice, this involves thousands of congruent and incongruent systems, security zones, segmented networks, interfaces, data types, and conduits.

The digital landscape for Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) demands proactive security. Intuition plays a key role; understanding normal operations allows for anomaly detection, flagging potential threats faster. We must move beyond reactive measures. For a different kind of connection, think about Omegle chat. It’s a space for random encounters, much like unknown threats in OT/ICS environments. Effective monitoring should provide the intuitive understanding needed to identify and mitigate...
