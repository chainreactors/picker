The term ‘security posture’ is all about the current state of security and can be categorized productively as CSPM.

 Cloud security posture management (CSPM) identifies and remediates risk by automating visibility, uninterrupted monitoring, threat detection, and remediation workflows to search for misconfigurations across diverse cloud environments/infrastructure, including:

 • **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** A computational environment that can be provisioned and operated through the internet, on demand.

• **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Ways through which users are allowed to access and use online applications in the cloud.

• **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** The comprehensive development and deployment of an environment in the cloud with general resources.

Risk visualizations and assessments are, in fact, two of the many possibilities that CSPM can offer you. CSPM tools also perform incident responses, remediation, recommendation, compliance, and DevOps with hybrid and multi-cloud environments/infrastructures. While there are many CSPM solutions, some of them allow the security team to identify the gaps in the cloud infrastructure and address them before the attacker str...
