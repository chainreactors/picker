### 64-bit Intel Assembly Language Programming for Hackers

Friday 14:00 for 4 hours, at LVCC - L2 - N253 (Workshops)

#### Wesley McGrew

Assembly language has a reputation for being intimidating, but once you learn the basics--and know how to read the documentation for the rest--you can easily pick up the rest. There are many interesting fields of study in computer security that depend on the "closer to the metal" knowledge you'll gain from learning to code in assembly:

* Software reverse engineering
* Vulnerability and exploit research
* Malware/implant development
* Digital forensics

...among others. There is no substitute for the confidence that you gain from being able to research and understand computer systems at lower levels of abstraction.

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce Intel x64 architecture and assembly language to the attendees. We will be using the Microsoft Macro Assembler, and we will be examining our code step-by-step in the x64dbg debugger. No prior programming experience is required--we will be working on things from first principles. There will be few slides. This is a new version of the workshop that makes better use of the x64dbg debugger to illustrate concepts of the class, live. Attendees can follow along with their own laptops and programming environments.

### Accelerating Malware Analysis with WinDbg Time Travel Debugging

Friday 09:00 for 4 hours, at LVCC - L2 - N257 (Workshops)

#### Joshua "jstrosch" Stroschein Google

#### Jae Young Kim Google

Malware analysis and reverse engineering involve intricate execution, obfuscation, and anti-analysis techniques that hinder traditional debugging. This intensive, hands-on workshop introduces WinDbg's powerful Time Travel Debugging (TTD), allowing you to record a complete execution trace and replay it forwards and backwards. Designed for reverse engineers and malware analysts, this workshop provides practical skills to harness TTD, significantly cutting analysis time compared to traditional methods.

Throughout this 4-hour session, dive directly into practical application. Start with TTD essentials and capturing traces (GUI/CLI), then quic...
