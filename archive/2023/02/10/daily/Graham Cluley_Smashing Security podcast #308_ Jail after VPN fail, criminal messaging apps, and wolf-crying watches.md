When Ubiquiti suffered a hack the world assumed it was just a regular security breach, but the truth was much stranger‚Ä¶ why are police happy that criminals keep using end-to-end encrypted messaging systems‚Ä¶ and why is the Apple Watch being accused of crying wolf?

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Mark Stockley.

Plus don‚Äôt miss our featured interview with SecurEnvoy‚Äôs Chris Martin.
