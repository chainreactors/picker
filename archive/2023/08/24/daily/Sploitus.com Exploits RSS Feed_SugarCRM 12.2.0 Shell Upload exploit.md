-----------------------------------------------------------------
SugarCRM <= 12.2.0 (Notes) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

https://www.sugarcrm.com

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 12.2.0 and prior versions.
Version 12.0.2 and prior versions.
Version 11.0.5 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

When handling the "save" action within the "Notes" module the
application allows uploading
of any kind of file into the /upload/ directory. This one is protected
by the main SugarCRM
.htaccess file, i.e. it doesn't allow access/execution for PHP files.
However, this behaviour
can be overridden if a subdirectory contains another .htaccess file. So,
an attacker can
leverage the vulnerability to firstly upload a new .htaccess file and
then to upload the
PHP code they want to execute.

[-] Proof of Concept:

https://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2023-35808.php
