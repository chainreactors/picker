Google is notifying the customers of its Fi cell service that some of their information was exposed following a security breach at one of its upstream network providers.

Google says the intruder collected phone numbers, SIM card serial numbers, and mobile service plan details. The data appears to have been taken from a customer support system used to integrate its Fi service with the larger upstream mobile operator.

Other more personal details, such as names, ID scans, addresses, or financial information, were not compromised, Google said in an email to customers seen by *RiskyBizNews*.

Google did not name the upstream operator by name, but its Fi service uses only two upstream providers, namely T-Mobile and US Cellular, and T-Mobile [disclosed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1283699/000119312523010949/d641142d8k.htm) a security breach to the SEC earlier this month—so connecting the dots is definitely not rocket science.

While Google told customers they should be wary of possible phishing emails trying to leverage this incident, at least one Reddit user [says](https://old.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/10pjtie/google_fi_data_breach/j6kysv8/) the email they received from Google Fi also included an additional line notifying them that their Fi service was changed to a new SIM card as part of what looks like a SIM swapping incident. However, this scenario is currently being called into question as, per Google's email, the supposed stolen data would not have been enough to perform a SIM-swapping attack.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**GitHub breach:** GitHub says that a threat actor breached internal source code repositories and stole two code-signing certificates. The breach took place last year on December 7. [GitHub says](https://github.blog/2023-01-30-action-needed-for-github-desktop-and-atom-users/) the certificates were encrypted and password-protected, and as a result, they haven't seen any sign they were misused in the wild. Furthermore, both certificates were about to expire in January and February this year and will become useless to the intruder either way. The breached repositories contained the source code of the GitHub Desktop app and the GitHub Atom code editor. GitHub's security team says it did not find any unauthorized edits to the code, and both apps remain safe to use.

**JD Sports incident:** JD Sports, one of the largest sportswear chains in the UK, says a threat actor gained access to a system that was storing data on past customer orders. In [a filing](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/JD./cyber-security-incident-regarding-historic-orders/15815662) with the London Stock Exchange, the company says the personal data of more than 10 million customers who placed online orders between November 2018 and October 2020 was likely stolen. Compromised PII data includes names, addresses, email accounts, phone numbers, order details, and the final four digits of bank cards.

**Yandex leak:** The [Yandex source code leak](https://habr.com/ru/news/t/712992/) from last week has apparently exposed the [secret sauce](https://searchengineland.com/yandex-search-ranking-factors-leak-392323) (1,922 factors) the company uses to classify and rank web pages, but also [racial slurs](https://cyberscoop.com/racial-slurs-discovered-in-leaked-yandex-source-code/).

### **General tech and privacy**

**Oracle Java licensing change:** Oracle has [changed](https://itassetmanagement.net/2023/01/24/ouch-oracle-java-licensing-switches-to-employee-count/) Java's licensing model to a per-employee model [*[PDF](https://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/pricing/price-lists/java-se-subscription-pricelist-5028356.pdf)*]. Running very outdated and insecure software has now become insanely expensive. kek!

### **Government, politics, and policy**

**Ireland spyware investigation:** The Irish Parliament is investigating how many companies involved in the production of spyware and surveillance products are based in the country. The government started an investigation after it was discovered that Intellexa, the maker of the Predator spyware, has two business entities registered in the country. Namely, the spyware maker's holding company, Thalestris Ltd, and a subsidiary called Intellexa Ltd have registered addresses in Dublin. According to the *[Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/oireachtas/2023/01/29/justice-committee-to-investigate-controversial-spyware-technology-group-with-links-to-ireland/)*, MP Barry Andrews alerted the Joint Committee on Justice and asked for an investigation to avoid the country becoming a "haven" for spyware makers.

**Abraham Accords expand to cybersecurity:** The [Abraham Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Accords), a collaboration treaty between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain has been expanded to cover cybersecurity, according to [US DHS Under Secretary Rob Silvers](https://archive.ph/r0tiu).

**Ransomware drill in Japan:** Japanese police and more than 130 Japanese tech companies [held a drill](https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2023013000282/tokyo-police-start-cybersecurity-drill.html) on Monday that mimicked the aftermath of a ransomware attack. Authorities said the drill will last through February 9 and is meant to prepare law enforcement and IT providers for a possible attack on Japanese infrastructure before and during the [G7 Summit](https://www.mofa.go.jp/press/release/press6e_000434.html), to be held in Hiroshima between May 19 and 21 this year.

**Academia warning:** The Swiss Federal Intelligence Service has [published](https://www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-92701.html) a 19-page brochure [*[PDF](https://www.vbs.admin.ch/content/vbs-internet/en/vbs/organisation-des-vbs/die-verwaltungseinheiten-des-vbs/-der-nachrichtendienst-des-bundes/_jcr_content/contentPar/tabs/items/dokumente_und_publik/tabPar/downloadlist_2015528307/downloadItems/272_1675096020796.download/NDB-Technopol-Broschuere-e.pdf)*] to warn members of universities, colleges, and research institutes that they may be the target of foreign intelligenc...
