Simplify Threat Analysis and Boost Detection Rate with Detonation Actions

Threat analysis is a complex task that demands full attention, especially during active incidents, when every second counts. ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=detonation_actions&utm_term=190625&utm_content=linktolanding) is designed to ease that pressure with an intuitive interface and fast threat detection.

Our new feature, Detonation Actions, takes this further by highlighting detonation steps during analysis. When a specific action is needed to trigger the sample, like launching a file or clicking a link, it appears as a suggestion, so you know exactly what to do.

Detonation Actions work in both manual mode and with [Automated Interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity-stage-two/). Whether you’re investigating manually or running automated sessions, this guided mode reduces the time it takes to respond to threats and helps you catch the full scope of malicious behavior with minimal effort.

## What Are Detonation Actions?

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image9-6-1024x580.png)

Detonation Actions are built-in hints in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox that guide users step-by-step through the threat analysis process. They are available in every sandbox session, for all users, and help make both manual and automated investigations clearer and more efficient.

[See example](https://app.any.run/tasks/069d90f5-58e5-4178-90f6-7b1626847d5f)

Here’s how it works depending on your plan:

* **Community (free) and Hunter Plans**: You can see the suggested actions and follow them manually during your session.

* [**Enterprise Plan**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-enterprise-plan/): Track each action performed by Automated Interactivity, including via API, for a fully automated, hands-free analysis with full transparency.

## One Button to Start the Guided Mode

Before launching your analysis, you’ll now see a new *Auto* button during the VM setup phase. Clicking this button starts your session with **Automated Interactivity** enabled, which in turn activates the **guided mode,** powered by Detonation Actions.

For your convenience, you can also enable the same feature manually by toggling *Automated Interactivity (ML)* in the *Additional settings* section above.

Once the session begins, you’ll notice Detonation Actions appear on the right side of the screen, next to the process tree. These hints show you exactly what steps have been or should be taken to trigger malicious behavior.

This gives you a clear picture of what was done, what triggered the threat, and how it unfolded, helping you detect malicious activity faster and respond more confidently.

In the manual mode, you can manually approve actions (by clicking the *Approve* button) or reject them (by clicking the *X* icon) for each suggested step.

Automated Interactivity handles the actions for you; no manual approval needed.

Thanks to Detonation Actions, you get a guided analysis flow that improves detection and drastically cuts down your time to respond.
