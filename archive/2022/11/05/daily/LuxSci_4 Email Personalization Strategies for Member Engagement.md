## Insurance Information is ePHI

Before we get to strategies for improving engagement, it’s worth reflecting on the regulatory hurdles. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, healthcare payers, insurers, and benefits administrators are covered entities. This means they must abide by HIPAA regulations when transmitting and storing protected health information (PHI).

Emails about an individual’s insurance coverage and eligibility, plan types and offerings, health status, and financial information are considered PHI and must be protected accordingly. We’ve written extensively about the HIPAA requirements for email elsewhere, but in brief, this means that emails containing PHI need to be encrypted and archived appropriately. Do not proceed with the following strategies until a HIPAA-compliant email solution is implemented correctly.

## 4 Email Personalization Strategies for Member Engagement

Segmentation and personalization are the keys to crafting messages that appeal to your audience. Particularly when it comes to healthcare coverage, there is no one-size fits all approach. Personalization techniques allow marketers to create highly relevant emails that the audience will find beneficial.

### Age-Related Changes

In the US health insurance market, insurance coverage is often tied to age. As individuals reach new stages of life, there is an opportunity for them to change their insurance coverage. For example, insurers and benefits administrators can create targeted messaging to:

* 26-year-old individuals about to enter the healthcare marketplace and
* 65-year-old individuals who qualify for Medicare

It would not make sense to send these messages to a sizeable non-segmented email list because they would be irrelevant to the majority of recipients. By segmenting your email list by age and creating targeted messaging, you will receive a better response and return on investment from your email campaigns.

### Plan and Benefit Educational Opportunities

There are many different types of health insurance coverage and benefit plans. Educating enrollees on their plan benefits makes them more likely to utilize their coverage and be satisfied with their plan. For example, if eligible members are not taking advantage of a dental benefit, it may be wise to create an email campaign that educates them on what they can access with their benefits.

### Geography-Specific Messaging

There are often differences in enrollment periods, eligibility, and benefits in the US market on a state-by-state basis. Creating personalized messages based on the recipient’s residence makes the messages more relevant. For example, sending recipients the accurate enrollment date based on their residence is essential to getting people to sign up!

### Health Status Messaging

You can also use information you know about your members to craft messages that can help improve their health. For example, it may be possible to know who is overdue for an annual appointment, and email messages can help them reschedule care. Similarly, several standard preventative screenings are tied to age and gender, like annual mammograms for women at 40 years old. By sending an email to all members who meet that criteria reminding them to get screened, it can improve population health and reduce costs.

## Conclusion

Today’s consumers prefer email communications from businesses and brands. Personalizing your approach can improve your campaign performance and deliver significant results. If you want help improving your enrollment outreach with HIPAA-compliant email, contact LuxSci.
