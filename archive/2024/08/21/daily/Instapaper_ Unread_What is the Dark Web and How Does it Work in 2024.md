# What is the Dark Web and How Does it Work in 2024?

![what is the dark web and how does it work image](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_1723963915-e1722999034774.jpg)

Please note that the dark web is NOT safe, and you can get malware just by visiting some sites on the dark web. We recommend that you do NOT use the dark web unless you are in a sandboxed environment.

## **Uses of the Dark Web**

Before we dive into the question of what is the dark web and how does it work, let’s look at WHY people use the dark web. It’s not always for illegal activities. The anonymity of the dark web attracts both legitimate and criminal users. Some legal uses include:

* Secure communication for journalists and whistleblowers
* Circumventing censorship in oppressive regimes
* Privacy-focused social networks and forums
* Academic and research databases

However, the dark web is also known for hosting illegal marketplaces and services such as:

* Ransomware and extortion sites
* Drug and weapons sales
* Stolen data and login credentials
* Counterfeit currency and documents
* Hacking tools and services

Law enforcement agencies actively work to shut down criminal operations on the dark web, but the anonymous nature of the network makes this challenging.

## **What is the Dark Web and How Does It Work?**

The dark web refers to encrypted online content that is not indexed by standard search engines and requires a special browser. The dark web makes up a small portion of the deep web, which is any part of the internet not accessible through search engines like Google, and contains things like cloud storage, email systems, and medical records. Some key characteristics of the dark web include:

* It uses encryption to hide user identities and locations
* Websites have .onion domain extensions instead of .com, .org, etc.
* It requires specific software like the Tor browser for access
* Content is not indexed by search engines
* Sites and services frequently change addresses

Now, let’s address the “how it works” portion of the question.

The dark web functions by using a technology called onion routing to obscure the source and destination of internet traffic. You travel a “circuit,” which is a path through the network that consists of a:

1. **Guard node:** Node “A” below is the entrance computer that is a trusted source and must be authorized.
2. **Middle node:** Node “B” below is a node that can’t talk directly to the source or destination.
3. **Exit node:** Node “C” is the last stop before your destination.

This process makes it extremely difficult to trace the original user or their location. The encryption and routing provide anonymity for both visitors and website operators on the dark web.
