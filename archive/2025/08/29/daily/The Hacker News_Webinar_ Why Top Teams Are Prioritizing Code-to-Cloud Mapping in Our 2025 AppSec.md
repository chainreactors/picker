Picture this: Your team rolls out some new code, thinking everything's fine. But hidden in there is a tiny flaw that explodes into a huge problem once it hits the cloud. Next thing you know, hackers are in, and your company is dealing with a mess that costs millions.

Scary, right? In 2025, the average data breach hits businesses with a whopping $4.44 million bill globally. And guess what? A big chunk of these headaches comes from app security slip-ups, like web attacks that snag credentials and wreak havoc. If you're in dev, ops, or security, you've probably felt that stress—endless alerts, teams arguing over who's to blame, and fixes that take forever.

But hey, it doesn't have to be this way. What if you could spot those risks early, from the moment code is written all the way to when it's running in the cloud? That's the magic of code-to-cloud visibility, and it's changing how smart teams handle app security. Our upcoming webinar, "Code-to-Cloud Visibility: The New Foundation for Modern AppSec," is your chance to learn how. It's happening on September 8, 2025—just a few weeks away.

This isn't some boring lecture; it's real talk from experts who've been there, packed with tips you can use right away. [Sign up for the Webinar Now](https://thehacker.news/code-to-cloud-appsec?source=article) and grab your spot before it's gone!

## The Real Headache Hiding in Your Apps

Let's be honest: As companies grow and push more work onto dev teams, things get messy. Risks pop up in code but only show up later in the cloud, leading to confusion, slow fixes, and attackers getting the jump on you. Recent reports show that inefficient vulnerability handling is a top pain for 32% of organizations, and securing AI tools like GenAI is right behind at 30%. Even worse, 97% of companies are dealing with GenAI-related security issues. Without a clear view from code to cloud, you're basically guessing—and that leaves doors open for bad guys.

I've chatted with folks in the trenches who share war stories: Late nights scrambling to patch holes that could've been fixed days earlier. It's draining, and with breaches costing more than ever, it's hitting the bottom line hard. The good news? Code-to-cloud visibility connects the dots, giving you full sight into vulnerabilities, secrets, and setup mistakes. It helps teams catch issues early, fix them fast, and work together better—no more finger-pointing.

## What You'll Walk Away With: Simple Steps to Level Up Your Security

In this quick 60-minute chat, our pros will break down why this approach is becoming a must-have for app security programs. Gartner says by 2026, 40% of companies will jump on board with tools like ASPM to handle risks smarter. We'll keep it straightforward, no tech overload—just practical stuff.

Here's what you'll get:

1. **Get Everyone on the Same Page**: See how linking code risks to cloud behavior creates a simple shared plan. Dev, ops, and security teams can finally team up, cut the noise, and speed up feedback.
2. **Focus on What Really Matters**: Learn easy ways to map out risks and zero in on your key apps. We'll share real examples, like tracing a code glitch to its cloud weak spot, so you can plug holes before hackers notice.
3. **Fix Things Quicker**: Grab step-by-step ideas to automate fixes and slash remediation time—some teams see drops of 30% or more in vulnerabilities and days shaved off fixes. Imagine adding this to your workflow without slowing down your work.
4. **Stay Ahead of New Threats**: We'll cover hot topics like safe AI use and rules pushing for better security. Plus, a handy checklist to check your setup and quick wins to try tomorrow.

People who've joined similar sessions say it changed how they work: "It connected the dots and stopped us from chasing shadows," one ops guy told me. Ready to make that change for your team? [Sign up for the Webinar Now](https://thehacker.news/code-to-cloud-appsec?source=article) and start turning those insights into action.

## Why Jump In Now? Threats Aren't Waiting

With big attacks making headlines—like the PowerSchool breach hitting millions or ransomware messing with supply chains in 2025—delaying isn't smart. Code-to-cloud visibility isn't fancy tech; it's your shield to bake security in from start to finish. Don't wait for a crisis—get ahead and make your apps tougher.

Seats are going quickly, so sign up today. You'll also snag a free ASPM checklist and the recording to watch later. It's a small time investment for big peace of mind.
