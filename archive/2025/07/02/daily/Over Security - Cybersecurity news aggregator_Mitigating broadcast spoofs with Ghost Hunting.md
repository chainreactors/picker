# Mitigating broadcast spoofs with Ghost Hunting

Don't bother bringing an EMF detector, this EDR has you covered from ghosts!

## Intro

If you are unaware of my [Ghost Hunting technique](https://fluxsec.red/edr-syscall-hooking), check my previous post where I explain my thought process.

So, whilst designing the **Ghost Hunting** technique for the EDR; I have thought of one obvious bypass that a malware developer could easily implement.

Up until now, we have two signal sources - the driver, and an injected process. Ghost Hunting works by comparing the two signals to make sure that
it was indeed our hooked syscall that made the syscall - if the driver emits an event but we have no matching syscall hook signa...
