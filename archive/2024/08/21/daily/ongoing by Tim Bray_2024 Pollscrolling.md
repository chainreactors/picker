The 2024 US election has, in the last few weeks, become the most interesting one I can recall. I’m pretty old, so that’s a
strong statement; I can recall
a *lot* of US elections. The Internet makes it way too easy to obsess over a story that’s this big and has this many
people sharing opinions. Here is my opinion, not on who’s winning, but on how, with only a very moderate expenditure of time and
money, you can be as well-informed as anybody in the world as to how it’s going.

Disclosures: I’m not American, got no vote on this one. Am left of the US Democratic party, but at this point they represent
an infinitely better option for America than does anything connected to Donald Trump. Thus, the following remarks should be
assumed to have a strong Harris/Walz bias.

I claim that using the following sites should, in 5-15 minutes a day, give you an understanding of the state of the
race that is very close to that of the big-name prognosticators writing in the big-name publications.

Polls generally ·
They’ve been wrong a lot recently. The industry is still trying to complete the transition off landlines, which few people
have any more; those who still do are an entirely unrepresentative sample. I’ve seen a few smart people guessing that pollers
may be getting better, this cycle. We’ll see, won’t we?

Prognosticators generally ·
They suck. The arm-waving, gut-feel bullshit, and undisclosed bias is disgusting. In the pages of the really big
properties like the NYT and WaPo, the opinion columnists are mostly partisan hacks looking for reasons to explain why their
favored party is doing just fine and the other is failing. I’ve pretty well given up reading them.

OK, now let’s get to our sources, in no particular order.

Talking Points Memo ·
[TPM](https://talkingpointsmemo.com)
is the home of Josh Marshall, the ur-blogger on US Politics, and still as good as anyone.
He’s hired a bunch of other clear and clear-eyed writers, who obsess about elections all day every
day. They have a strong and acknowledged pro-Democratic and anti-Trump bias, but in my opinion don’t let it
clutter their analyses. If you’re reading the polling sites
that I’m recommending below, TPM will have smart interpretive pieces about what they might mean.

A lot of their stuff is free, but the best isn’t. Unfortunately, they only offer annual subscriptions at US$70; I’ve
subscribed for many years. It depends on how fierce the election monkey on *your* back is, but in my
personal experience, there is no other site that offers more depth and clarity on US politics. Maybe worth your money for one
year, this year.

Nate Silver ·
The former 538 guy is now at the
[Silver Bulletin](https://www.natesilver.net). Nate is not everyone’s cup of tea, but he retained the IP rights to
the 538 election model, which is updated on a daily basis. He admits to being moderately pro-Harris this time around but argues
convincingly that he doesn’t let this cloud his analysis, which I generally find pretty cogent.
You probably need a little bit of statistical literacy to fully appreciate this stuff.

As of today, August 20, 2024, his probability-of-win numbers are Harris 53.6%, Trump 45.7%.

The Silver Bulletin has some free stuff, but the best parts, including the model updates, are paywalled. The price is
currently $14/month, but on September 1st they’re going up to $20, just until the election is over. Because a lot of people like
me signed up with every expectation of unsubscribing in three months.

If you happen to care about professional sports there’s lots of brain candy there too.

[![538 Poll Report](538.png "538 Poll Report")](-big/538.jpg.html)

538 ·
Their
[Latest Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/) page is now part of ABC news but seems to retain many of
the virtues that made 538 the flavor-of-the-month a few years ago.

The crucial thing, if you’re visiting once a day, is to find the “Sort by Date” widget and click on “Added”, which brings the
most recent stuff that you probably haven’t seen yet to the top.

As I write this, their national polling average has Harris 46.6%, Trump 43.8%. This is quite different from Silver’s
“probability of winning”. 538’s main virtue is that they get the polls up about as fast as anyone else. It’s free.

[![RealClearPolitics](RCP.png "RealClearPolitics")](-big/RCP.jpg.html)

RCP ·
I kind of hate to mention [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com) because it is at least in part a
hive of filthy MAGA-friendly screamers. Their front page is all links, MAGA-dominated but including a
sprinkling of analysis from more even-handed or openly-progressive sources. Anyhow, the problem with that stuff isn’t the bias,
it’s the fact that they’re just a bunch of low-value prognosticators. I wouldn’t waste much time on the front page, I’d start by
clicking on “Polls”, near the top left.

Their aggregation of poll results will contain about what you’ll see at 538 (sometimes important polls get to one place
first, sometimes the other). But RCP offers other useful resources. There is the
[RCP Pollster Scorecard](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/rcp-pollster-scorecard/), which offers data on the
accuracy and bias of most of the pollers whose results they report. Since some of those pollers are super extra biased, this can
be a useful sanity check.

What I really like is the
[Electoral College Map](https://www.realclearpolling.com/maps/president/2024/no-toss-up/electoral-college), which as
I write is predicting a Trump victory, 287-251 in EC votes. You can click on each state and see the polls they used to compute
their prediction for that state.

I think their MAGA bias shows in the predictions, but that’s OK, because there’s a “Create Your Own Map” link, where
you can disagree with them and explore each side’s path to victory or defeat. Looking at today’s map, my conclusion is that if
Harris can flip Pennsylvania from red to blue she probably wins, and if she can bring along either or both of Arizona and North
Carolina, Trump is roadkill.

CNN ·
No, really. It’s
[cheesy and overhyped](https://www.cnn.com) but feels to me like it’s speaking to a pretty big constituency that I
don’t know anybody from, there’s a bit of *zeitgeist* in the flow. To my eye it leans a little more Dem than GOP (that’s a
surprise) and is not actually terrible.

When? ·
My advice is to wait until at least mid-afternoon, when the polls of the day have been published and ingested, then put in
your pollscrolling time. Won’t take too long and you’ll know what the allegedly-smart people know.

I don't read all the polling guys, I have a couple of university profs do it for me: <https://www.electoral-vote.com/>

They do two things: 1) they are very knowledgeable about the polling industry and worth reading for that alone, and 2) focus on how it all cashes out at the Electoral College level, which can get a little too arcane for much of the commentariat. They have basically been my first thing in the morning read for many years now.

They also seem to have a very significant American ex-pat readership, which I take as a good sign actually.

They used to be fairly neutral, but once Trump came on the scene they couldn't keep that up. I would describe them as being not so much pro Democrat, as pro not being insane.

Can't tell if it's just a temporary election season thing, but the TPM membership page has a toggle for annual/monthly plans.
