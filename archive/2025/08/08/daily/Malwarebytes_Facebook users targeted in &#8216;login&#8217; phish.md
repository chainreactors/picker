# Facebook users targeted in ‘login’ phish

Posted: August 7, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A few weeks ago we [warned](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/watch-out-instagram-users-targeted-in-novel-phishing-campaign) our readers of a [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) campaign targeting Instagram users that didn’t resort to the usual links to phishing websites, but used mailto: links instead. Now, it seems that these scammers have turned their attention to Facebook users.

It works like this: The target receives an email saying that your Facebook account was logged into from a new device. Even though the subject line says “We’ve Received a request to Reset your password for Facebook Account !”

![email header](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/email_header.png)
![new device login](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/email.png)
> “A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device iPhone 14 PRO Max. We are sending you this email to verify it’s really you.”

All the links you see in the email: “Report the user”, “Yes, me”, “unsubscribe”, and even the obfuscated email address at the bottom, do exactly the same thing.

They open your default email program with a pre-addressed message with a subject line that matches the button/text you clicked on.

The email addresses these messages will be sent to are the same as the ones we saw with the Instagram phish:

* `prestige@vacasa[.]uk.com` (typosquat of vacasa.com vacation rentals)
* `ministry@syntec[.]uk.com` (typosquat of syntechnologies.co.uk hardware provider)
* `technique@pdftools[.]com.de` (typosquat of pdf-tools.com software provider)
* `service@boss[.]eu.com` (several possibilities)
* `threaten@famy[.]in.net` (science news site, possibly compromised)
* `difficulty@blackdiamond[.]com.se` (known malicious domain)
* `anticipation@salomonshoes[.]us.com` (typosquat of salomon.com running shoes)

This is kind of surprising since we found last time that several of the addresses were unresponsive.

![undeliverable](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/undeliverable.png?w=1024)

The unusual Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like uk.com, com.de, eu.com, com.se, and us.com are actually second-level domain extensions operated by private entities, not official country-code top-level domains.

Though these domain extensions themselves are legitimate registration services, their openness and global accessibility mean they can be misused by phishers and other cybercriminals to make them look more legitimate or country-specific than generic .com domains. They may also be used to [typosquat](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/06/explained-typosquatting) legitimate domains.

## How to avoid Facebook phishing

Since we can expect to see more phishing campaigns that use mailto: links, here are some tips to avoid falling victim to such a scam.

* As with regular links, scrutinize the destination of an email link. Even if the domain looks legitimate, your Facebook account isn’t secured by a shoe maker or vacation provider, or someone using a gmail address. The email address should be one that belongs to Facebook or Meta.
* Remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to mail them your account details, credentials, or other [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecuri...
