This blog is co-authored by Makesh Gupta and Rena Yu Ning Wang, and it is about our journey participating in the SAP.iO journey, with the idea of building a SAP Live Shopping Platform.

## **Context:**

It was a late Friday evening and I was bored and so I did what I always do when most of us feel bored – pick up the phone and started scrolling through my social media feed – Facebook, instagram and then my latest favorite – TikTok. And something there on TikTok caught my eye. There was this lady selling watches on TikTok. This brought back memories of the good old days when we used to walk into a bazaar and see all kinds of wares being hawked. That’s exactly what this lady was doing – hawking her goods (which happened to be some sort of watches), only she was doing that live on TikTok. For the moment, it seemed interesting and then with as with everything else on social media, I continued to scroll away.

A couple of days later, when I was doing some research on trends in retail (for a meeting I was planning to host for the Retail Industry special interest group that I convene), I stumbled upon a news article about Li Jiaqi and how he [sold 15000 lipsticks in a 5 mins live stream](https://jingdaily.com/the-live-stream-incident-that-rocked-chinas-kol-market/) (a record of sorts till then). This now caught my eye. I started researching this a bit more and found out that during the pandemic lockdowns, many retailers got their retail associates (specially in china) to keep selling their products using their personal WeChat and other social channels.

The more I read about this trend, the more it felt like this is an important trend playing out and one that has tremendous upside potential. According to a McKinsey article, Live Commerce (or social commerce) sales in China already reached 170 Billion Dollars in 2020 and expected to cross 400 Billion Dollars by 2022. And this is only China. Add to this the Korea, Japan, Singapore, India and the other early adopters of this trend and we can see that this can become. growth engine for retail like none other seen in a long time.

As part of the preparation for the Retail Special Interest Group meeting, I tried to find if SAP has any solution that could enable its customers to ride and benefit from this trend and realised that we didn’t have any thing to offer. It made sense. Most of the sellers on these Live Commerce platforms were individuals or small businesses and they didn’t need this from SAP. The platforms (FaceBook, Instagram or TikTok) were able to satisfy their needs. So, that was that.

It was about a week later, when I was hosting Gunter for a conversation around Low Code, No Code solution that SAP has to offer for the SAP India User group, that I shared this idea with him and see if this could be a use case for developing the app quickly using the Appgyver platform. He liked it and agreed that we can try.

It was at this time that SAP launched a cohort for the SAP.io program. This program was designed to find and fund ventures within SAP. When I asked Gunter if this is an idea that we can submit to build as part of the program, he loved the idea. He then shared this thought with Yu Ning (Rena) and connected us. I loved the energy she brought to the idea and we had a word and decided to apply to be part of the SAP.io cohort.

## **Design Thinking Session:**

Our team started discovering our ideas through two rounds of Design Thinking Session following the human-centered approach to innovation, which we used to understand user’s needs, and generating creative ideas. For these Design Thinking sessions, we have invited members from Digital Labs, including designers, developer, and innovation project manager.

We were able to brainstorm together, shared and prioritized our ideas in the first session. We were able to create detailed personas and journey map in the second session.

## **Market Research:**

After deciding our problem statement, our team had done in-depth research on the live shopping platform already existing in the markets. We were able to map them according to the available functionalities on the x-axis, and degree of engagement with the viewer on the y-axis, whether it is public or targeted & exclusive.

On the top left corner, we have observed live shopping platforms such as YouTube Live, Facebook Live, and Instagram live, they are generally very open, public, but include minimum functionality related to upstream transparency. On the bottom left corner there is also Zoom and LinkedIn, which is targeted and exclusive, with no functionality related to supply chain. Mature live shopping platforms such as amazon live, Rakuten live, and Alibaba.com are listed in the top right corner. We can also observed that a lot of start-up such as bambuser, shopify, livescale, are listed in the middle, they are public and contains some degree of upstream transparency.

Even though there are already many live shopping platforms in the market, but most of these established platforms have their own limitations. We see a gap, and a lack of customization in these live shopping experiences. The blue highlighted area, representing where our team saw an opportunity in and decided to focus for our initial MVP.
