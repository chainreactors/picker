**becomeCloud Supplier Contract Management**

The becomeCloud Supplier Contract Management aims at closing a gap in SAP Business ByDesign by providing the capability to manage supplier contracts in an integrated way. Through a user interface the users are able to create and edit supplier contracts. Supplier master data is directly read from SAP Business ByDesign. Next to the general contract data and the contract item data, additional information can be added for cancellation notifications, automatic contract renewals, contract approvals, and recurring invoices. Automatically scheduled jobs will directly create supplier invoices and postings in SAP Business ByDesign.

**1st Runner Up** – [AGILITA](https://www.agilita.ch/)

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/smallAgilitaLogo.png)

**AGILITA Consignment Cockpit**

With AGILITA Consignment Cockpit, customers can streamline their consignment inventory on Smart Cupboards and gain real-time visibility.  Amongst other issues, the solution addresses the low visibility of VMI at Hospitals which leads to the risk of either overstocking and higher warehousing costs or expensive last-minute shipments at other locations with shortages.

Instant and accurate digital usage capture via a ready-to-use IoT interface or manual entry by the customer. Leveraging the SAP BTP Workflow approval steps can be tailored to the customer's business needs. Event-driven creation of consignment sales orders through seamless integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud completes the picture. An open connector architecture allows for the integration of various backend systems.
