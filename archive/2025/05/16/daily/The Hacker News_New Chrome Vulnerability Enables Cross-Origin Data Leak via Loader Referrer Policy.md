[![New Chrome Vulnerability](data:image/png;base64... "New Chrome Vulnerability")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXw1xC9EO5yYpl-F2qtW0nNZRVQcddB9hrVa4G5vtW1VGE7-btdYljqxc2LmnD7C1KQCXZJcnFXEgSr5-pM8_MDspU1FizVFvULtAiXmygkRShNXvaUkn0wLocqzlBJGI0m1kg7ZNkA28tqPn1VqTEUHpoMyHwlWkZCQfSk8wy60DGsV5U-5MQfewfRA_Q/s790-rw-e365/chrome-update.jpg)

Google on Wednesday [released](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_14.html) updates to address four security issues in its Chrome web browser, including one for which it said there exists an exploit in the wild.

The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-4664** (CVSS score: 4.3), has been characterized as a case of insufficient policy enforcement in a component called Loader.

"Insufficient policy enforcement in Loader in Google Chrome prior to 136.0.7103.113 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page," according to a [description](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4664) of the flaw.

The tech giant credited security researcher Vsevolod Kokorin (@slonser\_) with detailing the flaw in X on May 5, 2025, adding it's aware "an exploit for CVE-2025-4664 exists in the wild."

"Unlike other browsers, Chrome resolves the Link header on sub-resource requests," Kokorin [said](https://x.com/slonser_/status/1922750094140440964) in a series of posts on X earlier this month. "The issue is that the Link header can set a referrer-policy. We can specify unsafe-url and capture the full query parameters."

The researcher went on to add that query parameters can contain sensitive data that can lead to a full account takeover and that the query parameter information can be stolen via an image from a third-party resource.

It's not clear if the vulnerability was exploited in a malicious context outside of this proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration. CVE-2025-4664 is the second vulnerability after [CVE-2025-2783](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/zero-day-alert-google-releases-chrome.html) to have come under "active exploitation" in the wild.

To safeguard against potential threats, it's advised to update their Chrome browser to versions 136.0.7103.113/.114 for Windows and Mac, and 136.0.7103.113 for Linux. Users of other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available.

### Update

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on Thursday, [added](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/05/15/cisa-adds-three-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) CVE-2025-4664 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by June 5, 2025.
