March 27, 2024

Is your Android device secure? Think again. On March 21st, cybersecurity experts at [SOCRadar](https://socradar.io/labs/campaigns/1058/details) in the Dark Web(in a hacker forum under their surveillance): EagleSpy v3.0, a powerful Android Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that’s been making waves in hacker forums.

This isn’t just another piece of malware. EagleSpy v3.0 is like a Swiss Army knife for cybercriminals, packed with features that can turn your smartphone into their personal playground. Let’s dive into what makes this threat so dangerous and how you can protect yourself.

## The Arsenal of EagleSpy v3.0

Ever since more and more people started using their mobile devices to purchase goods or access financial info, it was a matter of time before a comprehensive malicious software like EagleSpy arrived at our ‘doorstep’.

This trojan with its wide array of features, can be compared to a Swiss Army knife in the context of cyber threats.

#### 1. Crypto Injections: Your Digital Wallet at Risk

The feature targets popular cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, including Trustwallet, Metamask, Coinbase, Kraken and others. Typically, RATs like EagleSpy are capable of keylogging, screen capturing, and accessing files stored on the infected device. For example, if a user enters a private key, or if the private key is stored in a readable format on the device, the malware could potentially capture this information.

#### 2. Show Scam Page

Continuously monitors the victim’s device activities, with a focus on web browsing habits. Upon detecting an attempt to navigate to a financial website, the malware then intervenes, redirecting the user to a counterfeit web page, mimicking legitimate banking or financial services. These pages are designed to deceive the user into entering personal, acting like a tipical web phising method. The entered information is then transmitted to the attackers.

#### 3. Injection: The Persistent Threat

Injection is a capability that ensures the scam pages are a recurring event. Every time the user attempts to access their cryptocurrency wallet for example, the fake page is shown again. And again, increasing its chances of capturing critical data.

#### 4. PIN & Pattern Lock Grabs: Your First Line of Defense, Compromised

EagleSpy 3.0’s code contains various techniques used to record the device’s PINs, passwords, or unlocking patterns. Again, like a keylogger.

#### 5. Real-time Data Transmission

Captured data is sent to a specified Telegram bot controlled by the attackers. This is really bad, because attackers can take advantage immediately upon receiving the stolen data.

#### 6. Screen Manipulation

With each mentioned feature I feel like I need to take a pause, to reset passwords, scan my devices and uninstall unused apps. The malware can alter the device’s display and show custom messages or even a blank screen, effectively locking the user out or distracting them. This is truly effective and the shivers on my spine are still going strong.

#### 7. Custom Injection & Ransomware: Tailored Attacks

Attackers are provided with the capability to customize add their own scripts to the malware. Or even implement custom ransomware.

#### 8. Permission Manager: The Silent Operator

Ensures that the malware retains its full capabilities without prompting user alerts for permission requests that could lead to its detection. Horrifying!

#### 9. Google 2FA Stealer

Saving the worst for last. This feature is referring to stealing Google’s two-factor authentication codes. By obtaining these codes, the attackers can bypass even well-protected accounts.

## How Does EagleSpy Infect Devices?

The activation of malware like EagleSpy typically involves a few common methods that trick or compel the user into installing the Trojan on their device.
While the exact methods for EagleSpy aren’t confirmed, Android RATs and Trojans typically spread through:

![Threat Analysis: EagleSpy Android RAT (Remote Access Trojan) 3.0](https://alexmacra.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/57773652-7237-l__5151-e1711521116425.jpg)

Firstly is the phishing attack. Users might receive emails, SMS, or messages in apps that contain links or attachments. These are designed to look legitimate but contain the malicious attachments. This attachment can be hidden as a polyglot. We discussed about those in the [StrelaStealer article](https://alexmacra.com/news/cyberwatch/incidents/massive-strelastealer-cyber-attack-strikes-100-organizations-in-the-u-s-and-europe/). Once it’s executed, the malware is up and running on the device.

Another way of spreading EagleSpy is through malicious apps. These apps could be made available on third-party app stores or even, [in some cases](https://alexmacra.com/news/cluster-of-vpn-apps-on-google-play-transformed-android-smartphones-into-proxy-nodes/) with free VPN apps, slip through checks and appear in Google Play Store.

## Protecting Your Device: Your Action Plan

Make use of built-in tools like Google Play Protect and, if available, device-specific security features like Samsung’s Device protection to sca...
