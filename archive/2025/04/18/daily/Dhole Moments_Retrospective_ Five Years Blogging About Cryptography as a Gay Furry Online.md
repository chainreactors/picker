The history of this blog might very well be a cautionary tail (sic) about scope creep.

## The Original Vision For *Dhole Moments*

Originally, I *just* wanted a place to write about things too long for Twitter (back when I was an avid Twitter poster).

I also figured, if nothing else, it would be [a good place to write down the things I’m learning](https://soatok.blog/2020/04/21/welcome-to-soatok-blog/).

Before I had started this blog, I wrote a few posts on Medium. Today, the only Medium post that hasn’t already been discussed better here is one about [coordinated inauthentic behavior](https://soatok.medium.com/defeating-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-at-scale-a872badf721).

Several months before I started *Dhole Moments*, I got *really* tired of Medium constantly pressuring me to monetize.

Thus, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, I started to look elsewhere.

I decided to resist the developer urge to engineer a platform from scratch and settled on just writing stuff on WordPress. However, I didn’t really want to deal with self-hosting either, so I settled for a WordPress.com-hosted blog.

> If I had succumbed to this urge, instead of wriitng substantive posts, I’d still be tweaking the custom CMS platform for an empty blog that no one reads.

WordPress.com isn’t nearly as annoying or intrusive as Medium, but some nudges to monetize were still present in the dashboard.

It does, of course, have [other annoyances](https://soatok.blog/2024/09/18/the-continued-trajectory-of-idiocy-in-the-tech-industry/).

If you ever wondered why I make such a big stink about [avoiding advertising or marketing](https://soatok.blog/2021/05/18/avoiding-the-frigid-hellscape-of-online-marketing/) with my blog (and why I resent being accused of being paid to promote any product or service), know that the rejection of advertising money was part of the very inception of this blog for me.

Resistance to advertising and paywalls is *baked in*.

### Derailed At Departure

This original vision lasted exactly one day, because I wrote a rebuttal to misinformation about [a source code leak allegedly being used to assist computer hackers](https://soatok.blog/2020/04/22/source-code-leak-is-effectively-meaningless-to-endpoint-security/) the following day, which ended up cited by [an article by The Register](https://archive.ph/f5U0C).

Less than a week later, I’d found that [Twitter failed to enforce the length restriction server-side on their Gender field](https://soatok.blog/2020/04/27/why-server-side-input-validation-matters/) (despite a client-side restriction).

I did try to correct course a little bit by writing about [fun observations about hash functions](https://soatok.blog/2020/05/05/putting-the-fun-in-hash-function/), but then immediately proceeded to document [fraudulent COVID-19 contact tracing apps on the Google Play Store](https://soatok.blog/2020/05/08/fraudulent-apps-on-the-google-play-store-covid-19-contact-tracing-edition/).

By the time I got around to penning *[Why AES-GCM Sucks](https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/)* (which is one of my most heavily read posts), I realized I accidentally created something other people found useful.

![Stats For All Time  Home page: 90,115 views  Return To Office Is Bullshit And Everyone Knows It: 61,189 views.  Why AES-GCM Sucks: 47,100 views.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-3.png?resize=768%2C207&ssl=1)

Stats taken at a random point earlier in April.

#### But Not Useful *Enough*, Because *Furry*

Despite writing stuff for free, and not even forcing anyone to view advertisements, a handful of strangers complained incessantly about [my inclusion of furry art on my furry blog](https://soatok.blog/2023/11/17/this-would-be-more-professionally-useful-if-not-for-the-furry-art/), because they felt self-conscious showing *my* writing to *their* boss.

Meanwhile, I’ve taken fursuit selfies at professional infosec and cryptography conferences.

There’s [an old saying](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/12/04/those-who-mind/): “Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.”

The actual luminaries of software security and cryptography quite simply
**do not give a fuck**.

That is to say: They don’t have any of the same hang-ups about my blog’s furry art (or even being openly gay) that some commentators fear from their bosses and/or peers.

### A Modicum Of Real-World Impact

In 2022, I [rallied a bunch of folks to raise money for a library](https://soatok.blog/2022/02/09/that-one-time-furries-saved-a-library/) whose funding was at risk by a homophobic mayor upset over LGBTQ+ books (and books from queer authors) on display. The story made [Pink News](https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/02/07/mississippi-library-lgbt-books-fund-furry-help/), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/mississippi-furry-book-banning/), and [the Clarion Ledger](https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2022/02/04/furry-community-raises-thousands-mississippi-library-ridgeland/6662813001/).

I ended up turning down a few interview requests during that time that made me uncomfortable–including an invitation to a Facebook Live event by the editors of the paper that first broke the original story that spurred us into action. A few folks reached out to me from various activist groups and law firms, including the ACLU.

The funding ensured the library stayed afloat for the next six months while they negotiated [a new contract with the city](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/city-of-ridgeland-signs-library-contract-averting-ridgeland-library-shutdown/), thus ending the saga for several years.

The last time I checked, the mayor of Ridgeland, Mississippi still had me [illegally blocked](https://www.aclum.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-social-media-blocking-p...
