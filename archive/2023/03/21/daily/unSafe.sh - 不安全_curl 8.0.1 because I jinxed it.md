Right. I said in the [8.0.0 blog post](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/03/20/curl-8-0-0-is-here/) that it might be a good release. It was. Apart form the little bug that caused it to crash in several test cases.

So now we shipped curl 8.0.1, which is almost identical apart from a single commit that was reverted.

Exactly why this was not discovered in our tests and CI jobs before the release we have yet to figure out, but it is certainly more than just a little disturbing.

My deepest apologies for this.
