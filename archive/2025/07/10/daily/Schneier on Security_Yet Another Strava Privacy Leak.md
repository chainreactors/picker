## Yet Another Strava Privacy Leak

This time it’s the Swedish prime minister’s [bodyguards](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/08/swedish-pm-safety-strava-data-bodyguards-ulf-kristersson-running-cycling-routes). (Last year, it was the [US Secret Service](https://www.securityweek.com/fitness-app-strava-gives-away-location-of-biden-trump-and-other-leaders-french-newspaper-says/) and Emmanuel Macron’s [bodyguards](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/10/27/how-emmanuel-macron-can-be-tracked-watch-the-first-episode-of-stravaleaks_6730708_7.html). in 2018, it was [secret US military bases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases).)

This is ridiculous. Why do people continue to make their data public?

well well, säpo recently was not aware that the son of the minister of immigration is a member of some nazi organization. They are not really the most competent at their job.

Because companies produce software with defaults to publish the data, and there is no incentive (hefty fines, regulation, threat of lawsuits etc) to change companies’ behaviour.

On the other hand, the software is so ridiculously complex that even security-conscious people are perpetually at risk of exposing their data.

Is this really Strava’s fault? You would thing security people (body guards) would stay off social media….

security people -body guards/cops- are people that barely follow ‘logic’, yes some of them are smart but usually on management/supervising positions

@ Bruce, ALL,

With regards,

> “This is ridiculous. Why do people continue to make their data public?”

I guess many here have not been members of a small military / security group that in effect “lives apart” from normal society by way of the job requirements?

There are two basic reasons for such behaviour,

1, Esprit de corps.

In essence they do not think it “public” they regard it more like the message/cork board in the mess hall, a public area to the group but effectively private from everyone else.

Further because of the nature of their jobs they don’t get very much at all if any “oversight” from outside the group.

Any one else remember the consequences of this with the US Secret Service?

The 20 Cartagena Colombia prostitutes back more than 12 years ago?

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17747793>

This gives details some of the more egregious incidents in the following half decade,

<https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/06/politics/timeline-secret-service-misconduct/>

And there have been plenty more since, that the US SS have managed to have be less public, but some like the failings that gave rise to a “remodel” of Trumps right ear are quite hard to cover up…

Just about every “long term group” that has to be competitive within the group gets into this mind set. And those above are largely to blame for not “hard setting” boundaries. Because at the end of the day the group are,

1, All boys together.
2, Boys will be boys.

The problem for superiors trying to keep it in check is that there is so much “social technology” in effect set up to “collect surveillance information” actually encouraged if not enforced by the US Government and it’s legislation to do this…

So if you want to point the finger, I’d start with the US Congress Critters and those that lobbied for the spying on citizens.

Bit of a side-comment, but note what it’s revealed “details of their running and cycling routes”, and the linked article shows the leaders of Sweden, Norway, and Finland out for a run. Contrast this with another leader where all you’d get from Strava is which hamberder joint he’s currently in.

@ Dave,

With regards

> “the linked article shows the leaders of Sweden, Norway, and Finland out for a run. Contrast this with another leader where all you’d get from Strava is which hamberder joint he’s currently in.”

Whilst not talking about the “only exercise is mastication” leader… I’m reminded of the first days of the previous incumbent and his “his exercise bike” being a cyber-security threat… Dr Jill Biden and her husband were keen long distance cyclists and for “lockdown” the good Dr got Joe a static exercise bike with all the trimmings/extras.

Apparently the high end static bike has not only internet connectivity so people can join in classes, but also a webcam and microphone so the experience could be interactive…

However go back a bit further and Barack Obama’s wife had similar problems and had to have a “down grade” on her bike,

Having been –untill physical issues– a keen cyclist, walker hill/fell/mountain climber and occasional marathon runner in my past and getting 500+miles/week by my own power under my belt for three decades, I very much understand the need to feel the freedom of the great outdoors zoom by.

Whilst I was occasionally “competitive” in organised events, I was not “competitive to show others” as some are. I was doing it for fun and feel good not to rub it in peoples faces. So I’ve never felt the need to “log my progress” on-line even in closed groups.

But… We may not have much if any choice in the near future… “Company Insurance” providers –not just health– are still pushing for all insured members to wear 24h/day 365.25days/year “exercise monitors” by “hiking up the rates and offering a discount if the company sells the souls of it’s employees”…

Back just before the turn of the century I changed employers a...
