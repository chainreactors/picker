Say you are allergic to peanuts. While out to dinner, you order a plate of spaghetti with meatballs. The server lets you know that there are no peanuts in the spaghetti with meatballs. Unfortunately, the server has no knowledge that the onions within the meatballs were fried in peanut oil. The indirect dependency on the peanut oil that was included in the meatballs by way of the fried onions left you vulnerable to an attack.

Similarly dangerous is finding big license and security problems in an acquisition’s software after the close because no one analyzed the software’s dependencies.

## How software is built

Modern software is a mix of proprietary code, off-the-shelf commercial code, and open source code. Open source often includes many dependencies.

The Linux Foundation describes direct and indirect dependencies in the following way:

* A direct dependency is a package that you included in your own directory.
* An indirect dependency is a package that you are not using directly, but one that is used by one of your direct dependencies.

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) often have extremely tight timelines, so it may seem that performing due diligence only on a seller’s source code/proprietary code is sufficient to identify all the [compliance and security risks](/blog/manage-risks-with-software-due-diligence.html). But buyers should also be concerned about the components upon which the seller’s application depends. If components under copyleft licenses are nested in the application’s direct and indirect dependencies, the buyer is taking on the responsibility to comply with those copyleft licenses as part of the whole work. Similarly, security vulnerabilities in dependencies may expose the entire application.

If an open source project is licensed under a permissi...
