A former ASML and NXP semiconductor engineer will spend three years in a Dutch prison after stealing secret chip technology from his employers and sharing it with Russia.

The Rotterdam District Court [convicted](https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Rechtbanken/Rechtbank-Rotterdam/Nieuws/Paginas/-Celstraf-voor-man-die-hightech-bedrijfsinformatie-deelde-met-persoon-in-Rusland.aspx) an unnamed 43-year-old defendant of computer hacking and violating EU sanctions by illegally providing technical assistance to Russia.

While the Dutch court documents don't name the defendant, earlier [media reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ex-asml-employee-dutch-custody-had-contact-with-russian-intelligence-prosecutors-2025-02-06/) claim the perpetrator was a Russian national named German Aksenov, and report that he sold the corporate data to Russia's FSB intelligence service. He reportedly [raked in €40,000](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/04/amsl_russian_spy/) (about $44,000) in exchange for the chip makers' IP.
