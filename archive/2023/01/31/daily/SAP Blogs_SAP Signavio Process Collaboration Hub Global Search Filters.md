Searching for the right information can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when dealing with large data sets across different geographies and business units. With the January 2023 release we are excited to introduce Global search filters: an SAP Signavio Process Collaboration Hub feature that improves the navigation and performance of your searches.

Here is what‚Äôs new:

* **Improved accessibility:** search filters can be set before the first search is triggered

* **Faster results:** search is only triggered if filter criteria were changed

* **Less effort:** filters are kept when switching from one type to another; unsupported filters are disabled

* **Faster exploration:** search results remain unchanged since search results open in a new tab

* **Better guidance:** breadcrumbs on results to provide context; ‚Äòsearch in content‚Äô is always enabled

Global search filters allow you to filter your search results by various criteria such as description, publishing date, and custom attributes, right from the start of your search. This means you can quickly find the information you need instead of assessing less relevant results while narrowing down your search results in multiple steps.

You can set your search criteria from the very beginning by adding search filters below the search bar accessible in the header.

Header search with filters

You can choose filter criteria directly for ‚ÄòAll types‚Äô, allowing you to find all relevant folders, diagrams, and files corresponding to the criteria without the need to narrow down your search to a type of content first. You can also share the link to the search criteria with your co-workers, so that they can find the same information you are looking at, provided they have the required access rights.

Shareable search results

For all former users of the search capability in SAP Signavio Process Collaboration Hub Classic version, you might already be familiar with using search filters across different content types. With the January 2023 release, we brought forward this feature into the new SAP Signavio Process Collaboration Hub (SaaS), extending its range to content from all SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite solutions¬†and providing better guidance on how your search results are affected:

Filters that are not applicable to your selected content type will show as disabled. In case some filters could not be applied, a hint is displayed at the top of the page. Note that currently no search filters are supported for journey models.

We also improved how you work with search filters on the results list page: additional search queries are only triggered once search criteria have been changed, which removes intermediate search queries, thus reducing the time you spend looking for the right content.

Furthermore, clicking on search results opens them in a new browser tab, so you can quickly explore your top search results and return to the extended list without the need to perform another search.

Another advantage of the January 2023 release is the addition of breadcrumbs on search results. For diagrams, files, folders, and journey models, breadcrumbs above the search results show their location in the folder hierarchy, providing additional context and more visibility into your process landscape.

Breadcrumps - folder hierarchy

Search results for dictionary items contain the dictionary category in the breadcrumbs providing you with the necessary visibility of the type of the dictionary entry.

### Summary

You can now find what you are looking for faster and with less clicks.¬† With the ability to filter by various criteria, improved performance by removing repetitive actions, and better guidance with folder structure and categories, you can find the information you need quickly and with precision. Try it out today and see the improvements for yourself.
