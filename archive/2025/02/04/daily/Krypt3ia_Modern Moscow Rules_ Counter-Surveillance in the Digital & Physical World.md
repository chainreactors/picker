## Introduction:

Surveillance isn’t what it used to be. The days of trench coats and dead drops have given way to a world where the watchers don’t need to be human, and the tails don’t need to have legs. The Cold War spooks who wrote the original **Moscow Rules** played a game of human tradecraft; today, the game is played against **algorithms, cameras, and data brokers** who never sleep, never forget, and never stop correlating your every move. The battlefield has shifted from the back alleys to the invisible lattice of networked devices, facial recognition grids, and metadata traps.

You’re being watched, whether you realize it or not. Not just by government agencies with three-letter acronyms but by **corporations, social media giants, cell carriers, and AI-driven surveillance systems that track, catalog, and predict your behavior**. Your phone is a beacon. Your car is a snitch. Your social media is a psychological dossier you’ve written on yourself. Every digital footprint you leave—an IP address, a Like, a late-night Google search—feeds into systems designed to map who you are, what you do, and where you’re going before you even know it yourself.

The old rules still apply—**don’t be predictable, don’t trust appearances, don’t leave a trail**—but now they need an upgrade. It’s not just about **who’s following you in the street; it’s about who’s watching you from the other side of a machine-learning algorithm trained to spot anomalies and identify you even when you think you’re being careful**. Your adversaries aren’t just men with binoculars in parked cars; they’re **pattern-recognition systems that see through obfuscation and track you in ways you don’t even understand yet**.

If you want to operate outside the all-seeing eye of **Big Data surveillance and AI-driven social control**, you need to **break the system’s expectations**. Disrupt patterns. Create noise. Separate identities. Play the long game. The **modern Moscow Rules** aren’t just for spies anymore—they’re for anyone who values their autonomy in a world where privacy is an illusion and the only real security is the kind you make for yourself.

What follows isn’t paranoia. It’s survival.

## **Digital & Social Media Counter-Surveillance**

### **Limit Your Digital Footprint**

* **Minimize Identifiable Information**: Avoid sharing real-time locations, work schedules, or routine activities.
* **Compartmentalize Identities**: Use **separate accounts** (burner profiles) for different purposes (personal, professional, activism, etc.).
* **Be Mindful of Metadata**: Photos, videos, and documents contain hidden data (geotags, timestamps, device info). Scrub metadata before sharing.
* **Avoid Predictable Online Behavior**: Regular posting times, frequent check-ins, and habitual interactions create patterns that can be tracked.

### **Social Engineering & OSINT Risks**

* **Limit Public Engagement**: Be cautious about interacting with unknown accounts, especially those asking probing questions.
* **Beware of Deepfakes & AI Manipulation**: Reverse-image search suspicious profiles and verify video authenticity.
* **Assume DMs are Compromised**: Never share sensitive information through social media direct messages—treat them as if they’re being monitored.
* **Control Who Sees What**: Use privacy settings strategically, but never trust them completely—assume someone can access your content regardless.

## **Phone Calls, Texts, and Messaging**

### **Secure Communications**

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Use **Signal, Session, Threema, or Matrix** instead of SMS, WhatsApp, or Telegram (which can be subpoenaed).
* **Burner Phones & SIM Rotation**: Use prepaid, non-registered SIM cards and change numbers periodically. Never register a burner phone with your personal info.
* **Avoid Biometrics**: Fingerprint or facial recognition can be forced—use strong passcodes and enable auto-wipe on multiple failed login attempts.
* **Disable Unnecessary Features**: Turn off **Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS** when not in use to prevent tracking and remote access.

### **Voice & Call Security**

* **Assume Calls Are Monitored**: Use **code words or prearranged phrases** if discussing sensitive topics.
* **Watch for IMSI Catchers (Stingrays)**: In protests or high-risk areas, avoid making sensitive calls due to cell tower spoofing devices.
* **Use Encrypted VoIP Calls**: Prefer secure voice services over traditional phone calls.

### **Texting & Messaging Red Flags**

* **Phishing & Fake Messages**: Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited messages—even from known contacts (their accounts may be compromised).
* **Disappearing Messages**: Use platforms that allow auto-deleting messages, but **never assume they are truly erased**—screenshot protection is weak.
* **No Personal Details Over Text**: Treat every message as if it could be leaked, intercepted, or subpoenaed.

## **Out in the Open: Physical Counter-Surveillance in the Age of Ubiquitous Surveillance**

### **Facial Recognition & Smart Cameras**

* **Use Face Obfuscation Techniques**:
* Wear **sunglasses, hats, masks, or hair alterations** to break facial recognition patterns.
* Use anti-surveillance clothing (e.g., patterns that disrupt AI recognition).
* Modify gait and posture—many cameras now track movement patterns.
* **Avoid Looking Directly at Cameras**: Many systems prioritize clear facial captures—adjust your walking angles when approaching security cameras.
* **Reflective or Infrared-Blocking Accessories**: Some glasses and scarves can interfere with night vision or infrared tracking.

### **Avoiding Location Tracking**

* **Use Cash or Privacy-Focused Payments**: Digital purchases create location timestamps—use cash or privacy-focused crypto when possible.
* **Turn Off Smart Devices in Sensitive Areas**: Phones, smartwatches, and even car infotainment systems track movement. Use **Faraday bags** or remove batteries if necessary.
* **Use Dead Drops for Exchanges**: In high-risk situations, avoid direct meetings. Instead, use designated drop points that don’t require simultaneous presence.

### **Evading Persistent Surveillance**

* **Public Transport Over Rideshares**: Uber, Lyft, and taxis log rides, times, and destinations. Public transport (with cash payment) is harder to track.
* **Multiple Exits & Route Changes**: When entering a building or meeting place, identify multiple exits in advance.
* **Crowd Blending**: In urban areas, blend into groups, adjust walking speeds, and use natural obstructions (cars, pillars, construction sites) to break line of sight.

## **Cyber Threat Awareness & Mitigation**

### **Prevent Hacking & Digital Infiltration**

* **Use Secure Operating Systems**: TAILS, Qubes, or Linux-based systems reduce tracking compared to Windows/MacOS.
* **Regularly Wipe Data**: Use secure deletion tools—deleting files normally still leaves recoverable traces.
* **Beware of Malicious USBs & Charging Ports**: Avoid unknown USB drives and use **data blockers** when charging in public.
* **Monitor Network Traffic**: Use a VPN with obfuscation features (like **Mullvad or IVPN**) to prevent deep packet inspection tracking.

### **Device Tracking Countermeasures**

* **Burner Laptops/Tablets**: If handling sensitive digital work, use disposable or air-gapped devices with minimal personally identifiable information.
* **Control IoT Devices**: Smart home tech (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Ring cameras) are surveillance tools. Disable or unplug when discussing private matters.
* **Use Non-Trackable Browsing**: Tor (with proper precautions), Mullvad Browser, or hardened Firefox setups mi...
