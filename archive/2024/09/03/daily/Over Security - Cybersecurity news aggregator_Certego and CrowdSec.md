Since our founding in 2013, Certegoâs MDR services have been driven by Threat Intelligence, providing proactive protection backed by high-quality, up-to-date data. This approach allows us to respond swiftly to threats, continuously strengthening our clientsâ defenses and delivering adaptive, effective protection in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

Our many initiatives over the years have established Certegoâs Threat Intelligence team as a recognized force on the international stage. A notable example is our recent participation in #FIRSTCON24 in Fukuoka, Japan, in June 2024, where we showcased IntelOwl, Certegoâs Threat Intelligence Investigation platform, which is integrated within our Unified Security Operations platform, PanOptikonÂ®.

We believe that information sharing and global cooperation are essential for enhancing security. Over the years, weâve established top-tier international partnerships in the Threat Intelligence field. Today, **we are proud to announce a new collaboration with CrowdSec, an international leader in Cyber Threat Intelligence**.

"This partnership aims to create a more integrated and effective security ecosystem, **leveraging the sharing of Indicators of Compromise (IoC) between the two companies to provide increasingly advanced solutions for protecting infrastructures**," says Matteo Lodi, Threat Intelligence Team Leader at Certego.

# CrowdSec

[CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) is an **innovative cybersecurity company that adopts a collaborative, open source approach to protect digital assets from emerging threats**.

The CrowdSec Security Engine is designed for SOC and DevSecOps communities, using collective intelligence to proactively detect and mitigate attacks. One of CrowdSecâs key features is its global IP reputation database, supported by over 65,000 active installations and 80,000 active users across more than 190 countries. Each user contributes to this collective intelligence, continuously updating the IP reputation database, resulting in a constantly evolving defense against cyber threats. **Threats shared by users are processed using the CrowdSec consensus calculator, ensuring the CTI info is reliable, properly classified, and updated in real time, providing always fresh data**.
CrowdSec stands out for its ability to prevent intrusions rather than merely reacting to breaches, making it an ideal tool for stopping threats before they can compromise systems.

"The partnership between Certego and CrowdSec combines the reliability of both companies' information and expertise. CrowdSec chose Certego for the high reliability of our IoCs and our solid experience in aggregating and sharing indicators of compromise," adds Matteo Lodi. This collaboration represents a perfect synergy, harnessing the strengths of both companies to deliver advanced defense tools against digital threats.

The collaboration between Certego and CrowdSec will bring significant benefits to both parties and their clients:

* **For CrowdSecâs clients**: Certegoâs data, in the form of IoCs, will be directly integrated into CrowdSecâs platform. This will allow clients to access broader, constantly updated, and high-quality Threat Intelligence, enhancing their ability to prevent attacks and safeguard their infrastructures.
* **For Certegoâs analysts**: access to IoCs from CrowdSecâs global network will enable Certego to conduct more detailed and accurate investigations. Analysts will be able to leverage this data to improve incident detection and response, increasing the precision of investigative and threat response activities.

The partnership between Certego and CrowdSec unites two companies that share a core value: the reliability of information and collaboration in the fight against cyber threats. Through this strategic partnership, Certego and CrowdSec are at the forefront of cybersecurity, offering increasingly effective and dependable solutions.

**Together with CrowdSec, we are working to make the digital world a safer place for all organizations, helping to build a future founded on shared intelligence and collaborative security**.
