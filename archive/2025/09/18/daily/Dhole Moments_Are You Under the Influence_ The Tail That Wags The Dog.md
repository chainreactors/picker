It is tempting and forgivable to believe that we’re in control of our social media experiences.

After all, we write what we want in our bio, select our avatars, and even come up with our own handles. We decide who we follow, what we post, and which recommendations to consider.

It never feels like we’re not in the driver’s seat the whole time, especially if you use [a trustworthy adblocker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (which I **highly** endorse as a security feature).

But as tempting as this notion is, it’s simply not a fact. You and I are more prone to manipulation than anyone ever realizes.

At the heart of our vulnerability is this: **We are social animals**.

But first, we need to talk about advertising and marketing. I promise this will get interesting.

## Advertising and Marketing

Advertising and marketing go hand-in-hand. Which is the most appropriate way to describe the two industries, as they often see themselves as a sort of extra [invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) in the marketplace, driving consumer spending behaviors.

It is difficult for us in 2025 to imagine what either of the two might look like if they hadn’t [appropriated the work of psychologists in order to manipulate the masses](https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2012/02/27/torches-of-freedom-women-and-smoking-propaganda/).

However, we can venture some guesses as to what that world would compose of.

The 1929 “Torches of Freedom” campaign that feminized tobacco in the public zeitgeist came nearly half a century after an elephant walked across the Brooklyn bridge to convince the American public of its safety.

In absence of psychological science, mythology and superstition filled the void.

However, don’t think too low of cognitive science: They also study the effects of this problem.

### What Does the Science Say?

This won’t be on the final exam, but it’s worth knowing.

We know that [humans have an innate need to belong](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777651/), and that need drives a lot of group behaviors. As far as we can tell, these needs evolved because social groups are evolutionary advantageous–leading to a so-called [social brain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19575315/).

But we also know that [dark patterns can have an empirically observable effect on human behavior](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3577060). This isn’t just about psychology; it also comes up in [discussions around phishing attacks](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2014.0522) and possible mitigation strategies.

### Dark Patterns in the Digital Age

I’ve written about this before, but [the tech industry doesn’t seem to understand consent](https://soatok.blog/2024/02/27/the-tech-industry-doesnt-understand-consent/). It’s a lesson that bears [repeating](https://soatok.blog/2024/12/18/the-better-daemons-of-our-profession/) occasionally.

![A Fediverse poll by X00001@masto.hackers.town asking "Do you think Microsoft understands consent?" with two options: "Yes" (which received 0 votes) and "Remind me in 3 days" which received 1386 votes.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png?resize=344%2C333&ssl=1)

Consent.

Of course, it can be difficult to convince someone of a fact when their salary depends on them not understanding that fact.

Advertising and marketing love dark patterns like this, because it gives them plausible deniability (“look, we technically abided by legal demands for an opt-out to *exist*“) while still controlling the narrative (your options are “Yes” or “Maybe Later”).

All of those obnoxious cookie banners in the EU don’t need to exist. They’re a nuisance mechanism because advertisers want to use third-party cookies to track you on the Internet, and if you consent to these cookies, you’ve waived your rights. So they engineered the consent mechanism to be as high-friction as possible to say “no”, while the “yes, violate my privacy” choice is always a single click.

![Windows prompt. Title: "Howdy, Stranger?" Window contents: "Would you like to have sex? Right here, right now." There are two buttons. The first (selected) is labeled "Yes". The other is labeled "Maybe Later".](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image.png?resize=274%2C169&ssl=1)

This isn’t acceptable, but tech companies think it is.

Advertising has been at odds with privacy for most of the history of the Internet, but it’s not just tech companies that commit these offenses.

What did you think the “Big Data” hype was all about? Or the recent push for *AI-everything*?

As creepy as advertising and marketing are, social media platforms are so much worse than most people imagine (and they get there by exploiting many of the same psychological quirks that marketers do).

## Social Media and Recommendation Systems

What if you could take all the creepiness of digital advertising and use it to deceive the public?

This isn’t a hypothetical. It’s the reality we’ve been living with for years.

I recommend watching all three videos in this series by Smarter Every Day.

The first video details how low-quality content farms generate videos to try to capture virality in order to sponge ad revenue off YouTube. This is exacerbated by the algorithm prioritizing engagement over quality.

Manipulating YouTube seems a more obvious place to start for a YouTuber, but the more pernicious examples are in the subsequent two entries. First, Twitter:

The second ...
