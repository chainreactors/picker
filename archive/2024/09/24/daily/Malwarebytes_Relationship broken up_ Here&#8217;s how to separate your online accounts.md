# Relationship broken up? Here’s how to separate your online accounts

Posted: September 23, 2024
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

Breaking up is hard to do. The internet has made it harder.

With couples today [regularly sharing access](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/43-of-couples-experience-pressure-to-share-logins-and-locations-malwarebytes-finds?srsltid=AfmBOooIUkMSTLLsjsombMQqKRbHIuqHq1_PgLSbrHxXUdFZJ_J5F7ST) to one another’s email accounts, streaming services, social media platforms, online photo albums, and more, the risk of a bad breakup isn’t just heartache. [Equipped with unfettered access into sensitive, shared online accounts](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/when-things-go-wrong-a-digital-sharing-warning-for-couples), a vindictive ex could track someone who is actively using services like DoorDash, Uber, or Airbnb, spy on someone through a Ring doorbell, raise the temperature on a Nest thermostat, or shout obscenities through a baby monitor.

As every relationship is different, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to safely disentangling your digital life from your ex, but there are a few rules that can make the process easier.

And, because this can be a lot of work, here are a few things that can help you along the way:

* A [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) that will help you create and store unique passwords for each online account.
* The use of multifactor/two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) on every sensitive account that allows it.
* A friend who can go through these exercises side-by-side with you.

Further down is a more comprehensive checklist of many considerations you can take in separating your digital life from your ex, but, here’s a quick, handy guide:

[![Digital breakup checklist](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Digital-Breakup-Checklist_v1.png?w=598)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Digital-Breakup-Checklist_v1.png)

It’s important to remember that this work won’t be completed in a day. That’s entirely okay. Instead of trying to accomplish everything in one weekend, prioritize the most sensitive work—cutting off access to email accounts, online banking, shared photo albums, social media, and any services or apps that can reveal your location.

As Malwarebytes recently discovered in [research conducted this year](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Whats_Mine_is_Yours_Malwarebytes_Report_2024.pdf), 56% of people in committed relationships in the United States agreed that they “would like to see more guidance on how to handle shared logins, accounts, and apps in a relationship or during a breakup,” and 45% agreed that they “would have a hard time knowing where to begin if I no longer wanted to share location-based apps or services with my partner or in the event of a breakup.”

We hope this digital breakup checklist, which is not comprehensive, [can provide some of that guidance](https://www.malwarebytes.com/modernlove).

Here is the Modern Love Digital Breakup Checklist.

## 1. **Review shared devices**

* Log out of personal accounts on shared devices, including laptops, tablets, e-readers, smartphones, smart TVs, and [Internet of Things](https://w...
