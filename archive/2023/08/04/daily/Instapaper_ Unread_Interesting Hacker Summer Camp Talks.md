# Interesting Hacker Summer Camp Talks

Publish DateAugust 2, 2023925 Views

Hacker Summer Camp, as it is colloquially known, is three security conferences that are all next week in Las Vegas. The three conferences that makeup Security Summer Camp are:

* [BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org/)
* [Blackhat USA](https://blackhat.com/us-22/)
* [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/)

While preparing for these conferences, I dug through their schedules and picked out the talks I was most interested in catching.

### BSides Las Vegas

[BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org/) is back with a fantastic schedule and is always one of the best community events of the year. I am giving a talk on Wednesday at BSides titled [Vulnerability Intelligence for All: Say Goodbye to Data Gatekeeping](https://bsideslv.org/talks#PEYCPQ), which I am super excited about.

Here are a few other fantastic talks I will try to catch:

* [Cyber risk: How does cyber events become so costly?](https://bsideslv.org/talks#DRT37L)
* [Enemy at the Gate, and Beyond: Detecting and Stopping Account Takeover](https://bsideslv.org/talks#MRUMWU)
* [For Intel and Profit: Exploring the Russian Hacktivist Community](https://bsideslv.org/talks#QEQYQH)
* [Honey, is that you? Building test-driven, identity-centric honeypots together.](https://bsideslv.org/talks#D7HAWD)
* [Machine Learning for Insider Threats: At the Intersection of Security and Privacy](https://bsideslv.org/talks#U7VD8W)
* [Security Data Science Teams: A Guide to Prestige Classes](https://bsideslv.org/speakers#GM9UEP)
* [The Dark Playground of CI/CD: Attack Delivery by GitHub Actions](https://bsideslv.org/talks#Q83C7G)
* [Towards Effective & Scalable Vulnerability Management](https://bsideslv.org/talks#BUC7QH)

## BlackhatUSA

[Blackhat USA](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23)is the “commercial conference” of the three but has a lot of good [talks this year](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/). The talks I am looking forward to this year are:

* [What Does an LLM-Powered Threat Intelligence Program Look Like?](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#what-does-an-llm-powered-threat-intelligence-program-look-like-32511)
* [Compromising LLMs: The Advent of AI Malware](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#compromising-llms-the-advent-of-ai-malware-33075)
* [Entrepreneur Journeys: What it Takes to Start a Startup](https://www.blackhat.com/us-23/briefings/schedule/#entrepreneur-journeys-what-it-takes-to-start-a-startup-34863)

## DEF CON

[DEF CON](https://defcon.org) is probably the world’s most well-known hacker conference, and this year’s schedule looks impressive.  Here is what I am going to attempt to see this year:

[Growing the Community of AI Hackers with the Generative Red Team](https://forum.defcon.org/node/246104)
[Badge of Shame: Breaking into Secure Facilities with OSDP](https://forum.defcon.org/node/245721)
[ndays are also 0days: Can hackers launch 0day RCE attack on popular software only with chromium ndays?](https://forum.defcon.org/node/246107)
[Vacuum robot security and privacy – prevent your robot from sucking your data](https://forum.defcon.org/node/245765)

Along with these talks, they have these interest-specific villages where I will spend a lot of time. Here are the villages where I know I will be spending time.

* [Car Hacking Village](https://www.carhackingvillage.com/)
* [Blue Team Village](https://www.blueteamvillage.org/)
* [App Sec Village](https://www.appsecvillage.com/)
* [Crypto & Privacy Village](https://cryptovillage.org/)

## Wrapping Up

While the talks above are the ones that I am looking forward to, my friends have built HackerTracker, which has a complete list of all the talks for the weekend and is worth checking out.

I am also really hoping someone hacks the new [Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_at_The_Venetian_Resort) next week.
