# The OSINT playbook: essential tools and tutorials for every analyst

Apr 7, 2025

Over the years, I’ve published numerous tutorials and resource lists dedicated to OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). Many of you have found these resources valuable for your research and investigations. Today, I wanted to compile a fresh, comprehensive, and updated article that brings together the best search engine-based OSINT tools and tutorials available for free online.

Whether you’re a cybersecurity professional, investigative journalist, researcher, or simply curious about OSINT techniques, this guide aims to be your one-stop resource for elevating your open-source intelligence gathering capabilities.
