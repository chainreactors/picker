# Recapping the top stories from Black Hat and DEF CON

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

I had a significant amount of FOMO last week seeing everyone out in Vegas. (I was happy to not get conference crud sickness, but it seems like I missed a great time otherwise.)

But, as anyone who works with me could guess, I was following closely online through social media and news reporting. If you’re in the same boat as me and couldn’t attend BlackHat or DEF CON in person, I wanted to use this space to recap what I felt were the top stories and headlines coming out of the various new research that was published, talks, interviews and more.

Unsurprisingly, it seems like AI was the talk of the town. One panel, which featured the former Cyber Czar in the Obama administration, [promised coming action from the Biden administration](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/black-hat-2023-generative-ai-panel/) around AI and its intersection with cybersecurity, including an executive order that apparently will be as broad as [earlier orders around the U.S.’ broader approach to security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/).

There were many other panels and talks around AI, along with questions about [whether the technology](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366547733/Generative-AI-takes-center-stage-at-Black-Hat-USA-2023) has plateaued after so many companies developed their own ChatGPT-like.

I was also fascinated by several interviews and talks from an FBI official about distributed denial-of-service attacks. I’ve written before about how there’s a renewed interest in DDoS attacks recently, especially those targeting high-profile companies and games.

Two high-ranking government officials gave a joint talk at Black Hat where they said the majority of DDoS attacks are the [result of a dispute over business transactions](https://therecord.media/ddos-attacks-tied-to-gaming-business-disputes-fbi-says) or good ‘ol fashioned video game beef.

The same presenters gave additional details on [how the FBI prioritizes stopping DDoS attacks](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/12/fbi-ddos-for-hire-cyberattackers/?guccounter=1). Chances are, if you’re a bad actor who makes the news for DDoS attacks, the federal government is not far behind.

I also always love the crazy vulnerabilities or hacking methods that come out of both these conferences. A highlight for me was a group of researchers who [found a way to hijack one of the most popular automatic card shufflers](https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/) (fitting for Vegas) to the point that someone could know the order of cards ahead of time in a gambling game.

I’m not quite sure what the actual attack surface is here because the potential hacker would need to install a [tiny physical USB device into the shuffler](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-enables-security-researchers-to-hijack-casino-card-shuffling-machine), and I don’t think any casino worker would be thrilled to see you crawling around on the floor, but I do always love to see the downside of putting a USB port on everything.

And there was the brief, but confusing, saga at DEFCON about the [pop-up notifications iPhone users were getting](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/researcher-says-they-were-behind-iphone-popups-at-def-con/) asking people to pair with a rogue Apple TV. Turns out it was a harmless prank from one of the attendees, who just wanted to drive home the point that it’s [important to really turn off Bluetooth](https://infosec.exchange/%40jb0x168/110879394826675242) all the way, and not just click the little button in the Control Center.

Lastly, we wanted to thank Viktor Zhora, the deputy chairman and chief digital transformation officer at the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection for Ukraine, for taking the time to say “Hi” to us on the show floor. He specifically took time out of his day to make sure he could meet Matt Olney, who’s been one of our leaders in helping support Ukraine. Viktor was a speaker at BlackHat and had a very busy schedule of media appearances, so we were flattered that he made sure to see Matt.

## The one big thing

Since AI was already the talk of the town at Black Hat and DEF CON, we wanted to continue the conversation around tehse tools and the implications on cybersecurity. As one of our incident responders [wrote in the latest in our “On the Radar” series](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/the-rise-of-ai-powered-criminals/), AI’s influence is growing across the security space, bringing with it major implications for cybercriminals and defenders. The recent adoption of AI has raised significant concerns for cybersecurity due to the many ways that criminals can use AI for disruption and profit.

### Why do I care?

AI can help streamline criminals' operations, making them more efficient, sophisticated, and scalable while allowing them to evade detection and attribution. AI presents another avenue for cybercriminals to exploit by utilizing it to analyze enormous amounts of information, including leaked data. This analysis empowers them to identify vulnerabilities or high-value targets, enabling more precise and effective attacks that could potentially yield greater financial gains. For defenders, though, AI also opens the door to new defensive tactics and tools, so it’s important to see the positives and negatives of AI in security.

### So now what?...
