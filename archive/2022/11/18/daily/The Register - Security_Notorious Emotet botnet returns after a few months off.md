The Emotet malware-delivery botnet is back after a short hiatus, quickly ramping up the number of malicious emails it's sending and sporting additional capabilities, including changes to its binary and delivering a new version of the IcedID malware dropper.

There also are reports that Emotet also is delivering the [Bumblebee](https://twitter.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1590002190298804225) malware loaders as well, according to Proofpoint analysts.

The various changes after almost four months of silence also could indicate a change of management for [Emotet](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/10/emotet-malware-chrome-credit-cards/), which has been run by the threat group TA542 and in April was ranked as the [top malware threat](https://www.checkpoint.com/press-releases/april-2022s-most-wanted-malware-a-shake-up-in-the-index-but-emotet-is-still-on-top/) – affecting six percent of companies worldwide.
