# Facebook wants to look at your entire camera roll for “AI restyling” suggestions, and more

Posted: July 1, 2025

Facebook’s pursuit of your personal data continues apace, and now it has a new target: photos on your phone that you haven’t shared with it yet.

Techcrunch [reports](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/facebook-is-asking-to-use-meta-ai-on-photos-in-your-camera-roll-you-havent-yet-shared/) that the social media giant is now asking its users to peek at the photos on their phones’ camera rolls. In return it will give them new ideas to view their photos.

In a pop-up message seen by some of the site’s users, Facebook asks users to “allow [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) processing” of the photos in their camera roll. “To create ideas for you, we’ll select media from your camera roll and upload it to our cloud on an ongoing basis, based on info like time, location or theme,” the message says.

The site will then offer things like collages, recaps, [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) restyling or themes like birthdays or graduations, it continues, adding that Facebook won’t use the photos to target you for ads.

But what else might Meta do with those photos? Its [AI terms of service](https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms) allow it to analyze the images you load using AI, “including facial features”.

Incidentally, you can’t share any images with Meta that contain images of people in Illinois or Texas unless you’re legally authorized to consent on their behalf, it warns. That’s likely because both those states have strict laws around the use of biometric data, including facial recognition, in photos. We’re not sure how that works, then, if you grant the company unfettered access to your camera roll which includes photos of your trip to Chicago or Austin to visit friends and family.

Another question is over whether the company will scan children’s images. If you have an aversion to sharing your kids’ photos on Facebook, this could be a real issue.

We can extend this into even more worrying areas. What if you have photos of your kids in the bath that you don’t want an AI to train on? Or if you have intimate photos of yourself or a partner on your phone?

Facebook reserves the right to subject any content to “automated or manual (i.e. human) review and through third-party vendors in some instances”. There’s nothing in Meta’s messaging that seems to stop it from subjecting your camera roll photos to this.

Facebook has made camera roll cloud processing an opt-in service, meaning that you must deliberately select it for the app to start scanning your camera roll. However, this wasn’t enough for at least one Reddit commenter, who warned that you can’t control your photos once you share them with others.

“So although I always uninstall Facebook and Instagram, if I share a photo of me with my family, Meta will still get to analyze it, because at least one of them will still have those apps installed,” they [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1lm4nap/comment/n059slu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_...
