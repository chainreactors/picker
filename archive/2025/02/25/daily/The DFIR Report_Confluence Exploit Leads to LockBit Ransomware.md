# Confluence Exploit Leads to LockBit Ransomware

[February 24, 2025](https://thedfirreport.com/2025/02/24/confluence-exploit-leads-to-lockbit-ransomware/)

## Key Takeaways

* The intrusion began with the exploitation of CVE-2023-22527 on an exposed Windows Confluence server, ultimately leading to the deployment of LockBit ransomware across the environment.
* The threat actor leveraged various tools, including Mimikatz, Metasploit, and AnyDesk.
* The threat actor leveraged RDP for lateral movement, deploying LockBit ransomware through multiple methods, including copying files over SMB shares for remote execution and automated distribution via PDQ Deploy.
* Sensitive data was exfiltrated using Rclone, transferring files to [MEGA.io](https://MEGA.io) cloud storage.
* The intrusion had a rapid Time to Ransom (TTR) of around just two hours.

## [Case Summary](#case-summary)

The intrusion started with the exploitation of CVE-2023-22527, a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Confluence, against a Windows server. The first indication of threat actor activity was the execution of system discovery commands, including net user and whoami.

Shortly after, the threat actor attempted to download AnyDesk via curl, but the attempt initially failed. They then pivoted to using mshta to retrieve a remote HTA file containing a Metasploit stager. After establishing command and control with the Metasploit server, they leveraged it to successfully download and install AnyDesk. Once installed, AnyDesk was configured with a preset password, providing the threat actor with persistent remote access.

Within ten minutes, the threat actor began process enumeration using tasklist, identifying several processes of interest, which they then terminated. We assess that these processes belonged to a prior threat actor, and by killing them, the attacker ensured exclusive control over the server. Notably, they terminated PowerShell, inadvertently killing their own Metasploit process. This forced them to rerun the exploit to drop a new Metasploit stager and reestablish command and control. After regaining access, they created a new local account and added it to the Administrators group.

They accessed the beachhead host via rdp, using a newly created local account and then executed Mimikatz. Next, they leveraged SoftPerfect’s NetScan to enumerate remote hosts across the network. Using this information, they targeted a backup server,...
