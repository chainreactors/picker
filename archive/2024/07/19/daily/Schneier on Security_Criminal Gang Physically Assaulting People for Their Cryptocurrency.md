## Criminal Gang Physically Assaulting People for Their Cryptocurrency

This is [pretty horrific](https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-home-invasion-crime-ring/):

> …a group of men behind a violent crime spree designed to compel victims to hand over access to their cryptocurrency savings. That announcement and the criminal complaint laying out charges against St. Felix focused largely on a single theft of cryptocurrency from an elderly North Carolina couple, whose home St. Felix and one of his accomplices broke into before physically assaulting the two victims—­both in their seventies—­and forcing them to transfer more than $150,000 in Bitcoin and Ether to the thieves’ crypto wallets.

I think cryptocurrencies are more susceptible to this kind of real-world attack because they are largely outside the conventional banking system. Yet another reason to stay away from them.

Ahh, the ol’ rubber hose cryptanalysis.

And, of course, the relevant xkcd: <https://xkcd.com/538/>

From the DOJ release [1]

10 months, 4 states, multiple violent home invasions.

Assailants compromised victims’ email.

Nothing in a quick perusal about how the specific victims were initially targeted. Ignoring wired’s “untraceable” commentary, assailants were identifed through cryptocurrency transactions including laundering exchanges and mistakes attempting secure messaging.

I don’t see this as a particular risk confined to cryptocurrency. Any person(s) who can be targeted because of disclosure of assets, cultural tendencies [2], legal or illegal activities, is at some degree of risk from criminal actors. Some attention and discretion are required in life, because bad actors are always looking and probing, in person and online.

I hope the judge imposes significant, severe sentences on the assailants and wish comfort, and a restoration of the victims’ peace of mind and freedom to enjoy life.

P.S. Violent home invasions aside, I find plenty of other risks keeping me away from cryptocurrencies.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Easily Transportable value.

> “I think cryptocurrencies are more susceptible to this kind of real-world attack because they are largely outside the conventional banking system.”

It’s a lot more than just “outside the conventional banking system”.

In the UK and other places hogh end cars were “grabbed off the street” and gone before the authorities could do anything about it.

Before that there were the “Rolex grabbers” who would just grab the watches and again they would be gone before the authorities could do anything about it.

As far as has been said the valuables were out of the country legitimised and sold on.

Then high end cars were stolen from peoples homes, in some cases because of poor security in the vehicles.

Also there was a gang in London that were targeting people in their homes with a level of violence via torture etc that few recovered from.

The problem is the mentality of the thrives and the fact of easy “grab and run” with value.

So it’s not just Crypto-coins that are going to come under this sort of attack it’s what gives apparently easy gain of value.

However it appears the physical attacks were far less successful than the online attacks for this gang.

So I suspect that we will soon be reading about a new form of home invasion or similar physically violent attack on things that have high value but are easy to transport away and beyond current recovery.

Because the only way to stop it is to stop those with the mentality for this type of violent crime. How you do that is currently an open question as the “old fashioned ways” are considered abhorrent to modern society.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Not the first time either.

A search on the name suggests that it is by no means the first “violent crime, attempted abduction and attempted murder carried out by “the florida man” from West Palm Beach, also known as Remy Ra St. Felix,

So the jury (?) convicted him guilty but the judge will decide sentencing: the minimum 7 or the maximum life?

Right; robbers would never go after cash.

“I think cryptocurrencies are more susceptible to this kind of real-world attack because they are largely outside the conventional banking system. Yet another reason to stay away from them.”

That’s pretty poor logic. We should be staying away from conventional banking because not only can it be stolen by physically assaulting you, but it can also be done systematically by the banking system itself.

That’s the whole reason cryptocurrency was invented, to stop the theft that was happening as part of the system.

The fact that the victi...
