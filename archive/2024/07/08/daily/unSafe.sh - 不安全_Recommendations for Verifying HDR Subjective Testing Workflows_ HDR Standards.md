## II. HDR STANDARDS

The current HDR standard [11] for television and broadcast deployment of HDR content within the streaming media industry is hindered by the fact that this content requires a very-high bitrate for visual retention of cinematic and artistic intent in motion pictures. Since 2017, EBU’s Video System and Workflows working group have laid out various testing methodologies for HDR picture monitors. In 2019, EBU Tech Report TR047 [5] and 3320v4.1 [4] showcased the performance and recommendations for using first-generation HDR studio monitors. In 2022, Tech Report 3225v2 [6] expanded with more testing guidelines using specific HDR test patterns. In a similar timeline (2021), ITU published BT.2390- 10 [3], which explains Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) HDR TV architecture from content acquisition to display.

Given the fact that current ITU subjective testing methodologies [12], [13] do not accurately account for HDR characteristics, different authors designed different methodologies for testing the quality of HDR videos [7]–[10]. Due to different test mechanisms and different interactions within the testing pipeline, it is unclear whether we can compare them.

To wrap up, there are currently ongoing efforts from various standardisation bodies and researchers to define a methodology for the testing workflow of HDR videos.
