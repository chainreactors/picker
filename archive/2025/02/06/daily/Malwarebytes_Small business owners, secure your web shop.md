# Small business owners, secure your web shop

Posted: February 5, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

An online shop is more than just another way to sell your products. It comes with a responsibility to keep the web shop secure.

Cybercriminals are looking to steal your customers’ credit card details, their personal data, and even your revenue.

And it’s not as if using a platform that is used by major retailers makes it safe. Platforms like Shopify, Wix, and Magento are always under scrutiny of cybercriminals that are looking for a vulnerability that allows them to insert skimmers or get access to your database.

Let’s look at some examples to demonstrate my point.

A cybercriminal specializing in breaching Shopify stores is posting huge data sets as free downloads. Using the monicker ShopifyGUY, which implies they specialize in Shopify sites, the cybercriminal posted a few datasets containing millions of customer records.

![boAt Lifestyle data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Boat.png?w=1024)

boAt Lifestyle data free download

For example, boAt is reportedly Indian’s most active company that markets audio-focused electronic gadgets. ShopifyGUY dumped files of a data breach with access to [PII](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) information of boAt customers, which has 7,550,000 entries.

![Piping Rrock breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Piping_rock.png?w=1024)

Piping Rock data for download

ShopifyGUY also uploaded the Piping Rock database containing 2.1million email addresses from the online health products store Piping Rock.

We found several Magento-based web shops that had skimmers injected into their code busy stealing credit card information. [One of them even infected visitors with the SocGolish malware](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/web-shop-spreads-socgolish-malware-and-steals-credit-cards/), a sophisticated JavaScript [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) framework that has been actively used by cybercriminals since at least 2017. It tricks users into running a script supposedly meant to update their browser. What it actually does is infect the machine and send the details back to a human operator, who can decide how best to monetize it. Lately, SocGholish has been found to install information stealers on both Windows and Mac machines.

## How to secure your web shop

The most common attacks web shop owners need to worry about are:

* Credential [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) where the criminals try to steal your login credentials.
* Malware injection where the criminals inject malicious code into your web shop by abusing a vulnerability in the platform itself or a plug-in.
* [Brute force](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/brute-force-attack) attacks, where the criminals try a whole bunch of passwords they obtained from other breaches.

So, to keep your web shop safe you should:

* Be extra vigilant when it comes to phishing attempts.
* Keep your software up to date.
* Protect the device(s) you use to login with an [active anti-malware solution](https://www.malwarebytes.com/teams).
* Make it harder to log in by using [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-a...
