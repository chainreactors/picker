# Windows Server 2025 and MsMpEng.exe

Posted on [2024-12-22](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2024/12/22/windows-server-2025-and-msmpeng-exe/ "12:37 am")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

In my previous [post](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2024/12/20/windows-server-2022-and-msmpeng-exe/) I have provided a long list of paths Windows Defender is trying to access when the Windows Server 2022 starts. Since the Windows Server 2025 is now available, I thought it would be interesting to repeat the exercise and provide a very similar list for the latest version of the server. Surprisingly, the log file is waaaay longer now. See it for [yourself](https://hexacorn.com/d/winsrv2025_MsMpEng.exe.txt).
