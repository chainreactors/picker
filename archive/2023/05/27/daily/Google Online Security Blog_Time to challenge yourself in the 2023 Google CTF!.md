It’s Google CTF time! Get your hacking toolbox ready and prepare your caffeine for rapid intake. The competition kicks off on June 23 2023 6:00 PM UTC and runs through June 25 2023 6:00 PM UTC. Registration is now open at [g.co/ctf](//g.co/ctf).

Google CTF gives you a chance to challenge your skillz, show off your hacktastic abilities, and learn some new tricks along the way. It consists of a set of computer security puzzles (or challenges) involving reverse-engineering, memory corruption, cryptography, web technologies, and more. Use obscure security knowledge to find exploits through bugs and creative misuse. With each completed challenge your team will earn points and move up through the ranks.

The top 8 teams will qualify for our [Hackceler8](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/hackceler8#about) competition taking place in Tokyo later this year. Hackceler8 is our experimental esport-style hacking game, custom-made to mix CTF and speedrunning. In the competition, teams need to find clever ways to abuse the game features to capture flags as quickly as possible. See [the 2022 highlight reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEmtf9EZhrs) to get a sense of what it’s like. The prize pool for this year’s event stands at more than $32,000!

Itching to get started early? Want to learn more, or get a leg up on the competition? Review challenges from previous years, including previous Hackceler8 matches, all [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/google/google-ctf)

. Or gain inspiration by binge watching [hours of Hackceler8 2020 videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hackceler8)!

If you are just starting out in this space, check out last year’s event [H4CK1NG GOOGLE](https://h4ck1ng.google/)! It’s a great way to get acquainted with security. You can also get ready for this year’s [Beginner’s Quest](https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest) that’ll be launching later this summer which will be in the theme of Computer History, so get ready for some technology archaeology.

Whether you’re a seasoned CTF player or just curious about cyber security and ethical hacking, we want you to join us. Sign up to expand your skill set, meet new friends in the security community, and even watch the pros in action.
