At Palo Alto Networks, we are dedicated to simplifying and enhancing network security management for organizations of all sizes. [Last year](/blog/2023/11/pan-os-11-1-cosmos-strata-cloud-manager/), we proudly launched [Strata Cloud Manager](/network-security/strata-cloud-manager) – the network security industry’s first AI-powered solution for end-to-end management and operations of your entire network security estate. Strata Cloud Manager offers AIOps, Digital Experience Management (DEM) and management capabilities in a single, cohesive interface. It’s available across all network security enforcement points.

This allows you to manage your entire Palo Alto Networks security estate from one place, proactively strengthening your security posture and preventing operational disruptions, aligning seamlessly with our [platform approach](/blog/2024/06/platformization-unified-platforms/) to network security. We’ve made Strata Cloud Manager even better and easier to use, and it is now available in [two tiers](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/strata-cloud-manager/activation-and-onboarding/strata-cloud-manager-licenses-and-support/strata-cloud-manager-essentials-and-pro): Strata Cloud Manager **Essentials** and Strata Cloud Manager **Pro.**

## Strata Cloud Manager — Unify Network Security Management and Proactively Improve Security and Operations

Strata Cloud Manager revolutionizes network security by unifying the management of all your security products into a single interface. This comprehensive solution empowers security teams to tackle modern challenges, such as visibility, security and operational efficiency, with the support of advanced AI capabilities.

#### **Key Benefits**

**1. Complete Visibility Across Your Network Security Estate**: Achieve real-time, comprehensive insights into your entire network security landscape, allowing you to focus on critical threats through a single interface.

"The holistic view into my network makes platformization not just a goal but a tangible reality," shared one of our customers.

Get a unified view of users, devices, applications and threats to assess how everything is protected in your enterprise and remediate with actionable insights. Learn more about the visibility capabilities here.

**2. Simplified Network Security Lifecycle Management:** Security teams can easily manage configurations and policies across all hardware, software and SASE enforcement points seamlessly from one interface, reducing human error and improving operational efficiency.

"The ability to create one configuration and apply it seamlessly across our entire deployment has been a game-changer. Rollouts and management of firewalls are now streamlined and efficient," said [TUI Hotels & Resorts](/blog/network-security/netsec-strata-cloud-manager/).

“Our configuration and deployment time reduced by 72% using automation with Strata Cloud Manager compared to traditional configuration methods,” noted another Palo Alto Networks customer.

Enable simple and consistent network security lifecycle management with zero touch onboarding, best practice configurations, guided workflows and centralized troubleshooting.

**3. Strengthen Security Posture in Real Time**: Our AI-powered analysis detects policy anomalies, providing real-time recommendations to resolve the anomalies and maintain compliance with industry standards. Strata Cloud Manager proactively helps prevent security gaps and ensures your organization remains protected.

Strata Cloud Manager identifies over 1.9 million misconfigurations per month with customers, so they can take action and fix them. This is all while reducing the time to detect security gaps and providing inline best practice recommendations for resolutions. *(Reference: Internal data from October 2024)*

“Strata Cloud Manager provides us with a built-in best practice advisor that guides us when creating new policies or security profiles like Prisma Access,” shared [TUI Hotels & Resorts](/blog/network-security/netsec-strata-cloud-manager/). “It also automates updates across all devices after certificate expirations, saving us time and effort.”

**4. Proactively Resolve Network Disruptions and Enhance User Experience**: Anticipate and resolve network issues, such as user experience problems, capacity bottlenecks and service connection issues up to 7 days in advance, avoiding operational disruptions that affect productivity.

Strata Cloud Manager processes 300 billion metrics across 250,000+ devices and identifies and shares more than 635,000 health issues for resolution per month. *(Reference:* Internal *data from October 2024).* It also helps minimize downtime and ensures optimal end-user application experience across network security by reducing mean time to detection (MTTD) by up to 95% and mean time to resolution (MTTR) by 77% for thousands of customers.

**5. Instant Knowledge at Your Fingertips**: Strata Cloud Manager’s built-in AI-powered assistant, [Strata Copilot](/blog/network-security/strata-copilot-is-here/), provides quick access to product knowledge and critical insights in your environment, drawing from over 50,000 vetted sources, from technical documentation to LIVEcommunity blogs. Strata Copilot has already assisted hundreds of customers around the globe in resolving security and operational challenges quickly.
