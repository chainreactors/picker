# GDB Tricks: Tricking the Application into Generating Test Data

While reverse engineering a Linux binary, I ran into a fairly common situation:
I wanted to understand how a decompression function works, but I didn’t have
compressed data to test with. In this blog, I’ll look at how to we can
manipulate the instruction pointer in the GNU debugger (`gdb`) to trick the
software into generating test data for us!

I posted this on Mastodon awhile back, but I cleaned it up and expanded it a bit
to make it a full blog post.

I did this work in the context of my research team at Rapid7 - you can check
out all of our work on the [Rapid7 Research Blog](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/tag/research/) ([secret rss link!](https://blog.rapid7.com/tag/research/rss))!

Anyway, while working on an application, I ran into a function called
`LZ4_decompress_safe`. I wanted to learn how it worked, but EVERYTHING I tried
to decompress returned an error - even test data generated by a legitimtae LZ4
library! I’m not sure why it didn’t work - maybe they modified it? Maybe it’s a
different version? Maybe the `lz4` CLI tool has more or less file headers? -
Dunno! But let’s make the application create its own test data!

I know (from Googling) that the signatures for the decompress and compress
functions are:

```
int __fastcall LZ4_decompress_safe(const char *src, char *dst, int compressedSize, int dstCapacity)
int __fastcall LZ4_compress(const char *src, char *dst, int srcSize, int dstCapacity)
```

The calling code looks like:

```
mov     ecx, dword ptr [rsp+80h+capacity] ; dstCapacity
mov     edx, dword ptr [rsp+88h+size] ; compressedSize
mov     rsi, cs:buffer ; dst
mov     rdi, [rsp+88h+out_buffer] ; src
call    LZ4_decompress_safe ; I can't figure out how to get this to work :(
```

The functions have the exact same signature, which is super handy!

I put a breakpoint on the function `LZ4_decompress_safe`, which will stop
execution when the application attempts to decompress data:

```
(gdb) b *LZ4_decompress_safe
Breakpoint 4 at 0x40bc40

(gdb) run
Starting program: [...]
```

Then I sent a message to the server with the “this message is compressed!” flag
set, but with uncompressed data (specifically, the contents of `/etc/passwd` -
my go-to for longer test data). So basically, the server will think the data is
compressed, but it’s actually not.

When the service tries to decompress the packet, it’ll hit the breakpoint:

```
(gdb) run
Starting program: [...]

Breakpoint 4, 0x000000000040bc40 in LZ4_decompress_safe ()
```

The [calling convention on x64 Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI)
means that the first three arguments are placed in the `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx`
registers. We want the `dst` buffer, which is the second argument, so we print
out `rsi`:

```
(gdb) print/x $rsi
$63 = 0x6820f0
```

Then we can change the instruction pointer (`rip`), placing it at the beginning
of the `LZ4_compress` function instead of `LZ4_decompress_safe`, which means
that once we resume execution, it’ll execute the compression function instead
of the decompression function! Since they have the same signature, which means
they expect the exact same set of arguments, the application can’t tell the
difference and will just continue on from the `rip` you set!

Here’s the command to change the instruction pointer:

```
(gdb) set $rip=LZ4_compress
```

Then we can let ‘er run (the `finish` command in `gdb` runs the current
function - which is now `LZ4_compres` - until it returns):

```
(gdb) finish
Run till exit from #0  0x0000000000409360 in LZ4_compress ()
0x000000000040778b in [...] ()
```

Then we can verify it worked (by printing the return value, which should be the
size of the compressed data):

```
(gdb) print/x $rax
$62 = 0x62b

(gdb) print/d $rax
$63 = 1579
```

The function successfully compressed my `/etc/passwd` file to 1579 bytes! Now
we can dump the buffer (which was at the address we saw earlier - `0x6820f0`)
to a file:

```
(gdb) dump memory /tmp/compressed.bin 0x6820f0 0x6820f0+0x62b
```

The arguments to `dump memory` are the file to dump it to, the starting address,
and the ending address - all of which we know!

Then we can verify it wrote data to the file:

```
$ file /tmp/compressed.bin
/tmp/compressed.bin: data

$ hexdump -C /tmp/compressed.bin
00000000  b1 72 6f 6f 74 3a 78 3a  30 3a 30 3a 0b 00 12 2f  |.root:x:0:0:.../|
00000010  06 00 f0 04 62 69 6e 2f  62 61 73 68 0a 62 69 6e  |....bin/bash.bin|
```

The `file` command doesn’t recognize the format, which supports my idea that
this is some sorta modified LZ4 function, but the file does contain
legit-looking data!

I sent that compressed file to the application as a compressed packet, and it
successfully decompressed, allowing me to continue my testing! And that was
that. We could certainly take this a step further and call that function
directly to generate data on the fly, but thankfully, one set of test data was
all I actually needed.

It was mostly luck that both functions have the same signature, but with a few
tweaks we could have changed around the arguments to fit whatever prototype we
needed. Thankfully, we didn’t have to. :)
