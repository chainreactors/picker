Most of the internet’s blessings—the opportunities for communities to connect despite physical borders and oppressive controls, the avenues to hold the powerful accountable without immediate censorship, the sharing of our hopes and frustrations with loved ones and strangers alike—tend to come at a price. Governments, corporations, and bad actors too often use our content for surveillance, exploitation, discrimination, and harm.

It’s easy to dismiss these issues because you don’t think they concern you. It might also feel like the whole system is [too pervasive](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/02/privacy-isnt-dead-far-it) to actively opt-out of. But we can take small steps to better protect our own privacy, as well as to build an online space that feels as free and safe as speaking with those closest to us in the offline world.

This is why a community-oriented approach helps. In speaking with your friends and family, organizing groups, and others to discuss your specific needs and interests, you can build out digital security practices that work for you. This makes it more likely that your privacy practices will become second nature to you and your contacts.

Good privacy decisions begin with proper [knowledge](https://ssd.eff.org/module/seven-steps-digital-security#2-the-weakest-link) about your situation—and we’ve got you covered. To learn more about building a community privacy plan, [read our](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/building-community-privacy-plan) [‘how to’ guide here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/building-community-privacy-plan), where we talk you through the topics below in more detail:
