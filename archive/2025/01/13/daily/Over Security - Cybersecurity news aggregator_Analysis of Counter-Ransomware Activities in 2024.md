The scourge of ransomware continues primarily because of
three main reasons: Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), cryptocurrency, and safe havens.

* RaaS platforms enable aspiring cybercriminals to join a gang and begin launching attacks with a support system that help extract ransom payments from their victims.
* Cryptocurrency enables cybercriminals to receive funds from victims around the world without the option to freeze or refund them due to the immutable nature of the virtual funds.
* Safe havens are countries that permit cybercriminals to launch attacks without immediate fear of arrest, enabling them to earn vast fortunes through ransomware campaigns.

With these three challenges in mind, law enforcement and
governments have a very difficult job to do when it comes to fighting ransomware
but fight it they must. In this blog we shall recall what counter-ransomware
activities took place in 2024, analyse their effectiveness, and assess how the
landscape shall evolve as a result.

## Ransomware Operator Arrests and Sanctions

During 2024, there were significant disruption operations by
law enforcement and financial authorities targeting individuals behind
ransomware campaigns (see the Table below). The main focus of 2024 for Western
law enforcement was squarely on the LockBit RaaS and its affiliates as it was
the largest and highest earning ransomware operation to date.

Several key players of the ransomware ecosystem were
arrested, including the main developer of LockBit ransomware. Interestingly,
Russian law enforcement also decided to arrest ransomware threat actors located
in Moscow and Kaliningrad as well.

Law Enforcement Activity

| [February 2024](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2114) | LockBit | Two Russian nationals, Ivan Kondratiev and Artur Sungatov, were sanctioned by the US Treasury for being affiliates of LockBit, among other RaaS. |
| [May 2024](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/lockbit-leader-unmasked-and-sanctioned) | LockBit | Dmitry Khoroshev, the administrator and developer of LockBit was sanctioned by the US Treasury. |
| [May 2024](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem) | IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader, Bumblebee, TrickBot | European police took down malicious spam botnets that support ransomware campaigns. This resulted in 4 arrests (1 in Armenia and 3 in Ukraine), over 100 servers and 2,000 domains being seized. One of the main suspects earned €69 million by renting out infrastructure sites to deploy ransomware. |
| [June 2024](https://cyberpolice.gov.ua/news/atakuvaly-providne-pidpryyemstvo-u-niderlandax-ta-belgiyi-policzejski-vykryly-posobnyka-rosijskyx-xakeriv-4010/) | Conti, LockBit | A Ukrainian national was arrested for supporting Conti and LockBit ransomware attacks as a crypter developer. |
| [August 2024](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/suspected-head-of-prolific-cybercrime-groups-arrested-and-extradited) | Reveton, RansomCartel | Maksim Silnikau, a Belarusian national, was arrested in Spain for running Reveton and RansomCartel. |
| [August 2024](https://therecord.media/us-charges-alleged-karakurt-ransomware-member) | Karakurt, Conti | Deniss Zolotarjovs, a Latvian national was arrested and extradited to the US from Georgia for running the Karakurt data extortion gang linked to Conti. |
| [October 2024](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/732-evil-corp-behind-the-screens/file) | Evil Corp, LockBit | The UK, alongside the US and Australia, has sanctioned 16 members of Evil Corp, including Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, Viktor Yakubets, and Eduard Benderskiy. |
| [November 2024](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/phobos-ransomware-administrator-extradited-south-korea-face-cybercrime-charges) | Phobos | Evgenii Ptitsyn, a Russian national, was arrested and extradited to the US from South Korea for running the Phobos ransomware gang. |
| [December 2024](https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/us-charges-dual-russian-and-israeli-national-developer-lockbit-ransomware-group) | LockBit | Rostislav Panev, a dual Russian and Israeli national, was arrested in Israel for developing LockBit ransomware. |
| [December 2024](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/u-s-offered-10m-for-hacker-just-arrested-by-russia/) | LockBit, Babuk, Hive | Mikhail “Wazawaka” Matveev was arrested in Russia for violating domestic laws against the creation and use of malware. He was fined and had his cryptocurrency seized and is awaiting trial. |

The ransomware ecosystem has fragmented due to the [law enforcement disruptions](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ransomware-disruptions-impact/) of the largest players, such as
ALPHV/BlackCat and LockBit. In the case of ALPHV/BlackCat, the operators [staged
a law enforcement takedown](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/alphv-ransomware-site-claims-it-was-seized-by-fbi-researchers-suspect-22m-scam/) as they put up a fake seizure notice as part of
an exit scam in March 2024 after the attack on UnitedHealth.

Following these disruptions, some affiliates have migrated
to less effective strains or launched their own strains. This includes
Akira and RansomHub at the top of the list as well as Hunters International and
PLAY.

## Cryptocurrency Exchanges Disrupted

During 2024, law enforcement seized funds from and
sanctioned a number of cryptocurrency exchanges and individuals running payment
processors using cryptocurrency (see the Table below).

One of the most interesting disclosures this year came from
the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) around Operation Destablise. The NCA linked
payments to ransomware gangs to money laundering networks used by Russian
oligarchs to covertly purchase property and Russia Today, the state-run media
organization, to covertly fund pro-Russia foreign entities.

Another notable investigation in 2024 was when the US
Treasury sanctioned more Russian cryptocurrency exchanges, such as PM2BTC and
Cryptex, that led to money launderers that facilitate the cashing out of ransom
payments being arrested by Russian law enforcement.
