## The Password Game

[Amusing](https://neal.fun/password-game/) parody of password rules.

[BoingBoing](https://boingboing.net/2023/06/30/the-ridiculous-and-fun-password-game-parodies-the-frustration-of-picking-a-password.html):

> For example, at a certain level, your password must include today‚Äôs Wordle answer. And then there‚Äôs rule #27: ‚ÄúAt least 50% of your password must be in the Wingdings font.‚Äù

EDITED TO ADD (7/13): Here are [all the rules](https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-password-game-fun-little-browser-based-game-to-pass-time-tag-spoilers-itt.735783/page-2#post-108123093).

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a parody of some of the ridiculous password rules some sites impose

@ Bruce, ALL,

Just remember,

‚ÄúWhat starts in the fun zone can all too quickly end in the pain zone[1]‚Äù

Some one will at some point implement some of these rules ‚Äúfor realzies‚Äù‚Ä¶

Just don‚Äôt say you‚Äôve not been warned üòâ

[1] As any after party hangover or competitive skate-border etc who‚Äôve broken a few can tell you. But also much else in life relationships not excluded if the divorce rate is anything to go by‚Ä¶

It needs JS to do anything. Without JS you get nothing. Perhaps that is also part of the ‚Äújoke‚Äù where we need high powered machines and blind trust in websites to deliver non-booby-trapped code?

The JS code is unreadable also. Minification or some other obfuscation tool has been applied.

Haha! That is so much fun! I was doing good until my password caught on fire! (repeating fire emojis‚Ä¶ )

Should I have added a fire extinguisher emoji?? üòÄ

One rule asks for the current moon phase, another asks you to add the country name of a photo. There‚Äôs a rule that asks for the best chess move, and rule that asks you to add a two letter symbol from the periodic table‚Ä¶

I am no dumber for having played that marvelously fun little game! If only my password manager would generate emojis! That would be super fun!

I was stuck with ‚Äúpassword on fire‚Äù ‚Äì is there a way to get past it? Or is it just the final joke.

If one manages to change their password, it should then crash within a logfile:

@ Ted @ Peter A

password caught on fire

It‚Äôs not really the  *password*  that‚Äôs on fire.
