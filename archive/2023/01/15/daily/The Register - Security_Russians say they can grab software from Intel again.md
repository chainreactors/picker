People in Russia can reportedly once again download drivers and some other software from Intel and Microsoft, which both withdrew from the nation after its invasion of Ukraine.

Be aware that folks and companies in Russia have to take a somewhat circuitous route to get those files, according to Moscow's [CNews](https://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2023-01-11_intel_tajkom_vernulas_v_rossiyu).

The situation, we're assured, is this: while Intel's website generally remains closed to netizens visiting from Russia, if those people can reach Intel's [download portal](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html) from a search engine or some other place, they can now, once again, use that site even if they are in the land of Putin. In other words, they can't come in through the front door, but if they can find the correct URL, it should now work. After war broke out, that wasn't the case, we're told.
