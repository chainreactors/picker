SAP strives to equip our customers and partners with valuable release readiness resources for each SAP Procurement and SAP Business Network quarterly release.

**Early Release Series**

The SAP Procurement and SAP Business Network Early Release series of webcasts covers features planned for the upcoming quarterly release.  This platform, available to customers and partners, has a clear mission: deliver an interactive forum to engage with SAP product experts providing simple, direct answers to your most pressing questions.  There is a different session for each product area with content tailored for the specific audience:

* Procurement

* Business Network

* Supplier Management & Risk

* Sourcing

If you want to learn more and actively engage with SAP subject matter experts, we encourage you to participate in these informative sessions.  [Register now!](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4083071/7A8EE9C1EDD6E6C1B23DE7F1A88DF2C9/4458720)

**Additional Release Management Information**

Due to the proximity of the Next-Generation Cloud Delivery migration for North America SAP Procurement solutions and global SAP Business Network (February 4-5, 2023), it has been decided to modify the planned 2302 Release for SAP Procurement and SAP Business Network release date. The planned general availability date is changed to Friday, March 17, 2023.

**Quarterly Release Communications**

The [release calendar](https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/185165) on SAP Ariba Connect identifies quarterly release dates several quarters in advance.

Notice of upcoming quarterly releases will be communicated to Buyer customers three weeks prior to the release date.  Suppliers receive notice two weeks prior.  Releases are communicated via email notification (look for subject line starting with: Advance Release Notice).

Designated Support Contacts (DSC) and anyone from your organization that has chosen to subscribe to product notifications will receive these announcements.

**Where to find out more details?**

On demand [replays](https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/186303) of webcasts from completed quarterly releases can be consumed from SAP Ariba Connect.
