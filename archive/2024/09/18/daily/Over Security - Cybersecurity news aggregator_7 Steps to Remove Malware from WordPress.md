![Sucuri Blog - 7 Steps to Remove Malware from WordPress](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Blog-Post-7-Steps-to-Remove-Malware-from-WordPress-820x385.png)

If you’ve ever had your website compromised by malware, you know the sheer panic it can cause. But don’t worry, you’re not alone. More importantly it’s something you can fix! In this guide, we’ll walk you through seven essential steps to remove malware from your WordPress site. From backing up your website to removing the last security warning, we’ll make sure you know exactly what to do to clean up and fortify your WordPress site.

Below is a quick overview, but for a more detailed walkthrough you can see our guide on this topic [here](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-hacked-wordpress/).

## Step 1: Back Up Your WordPress Website & Database

Removing malware can be messy and sometimes things can break in the process. For this reason we’ll want to make sure we have a backup to restore if something goes wrong.

To back up a WordPress site you will want to take a manual backup. Download all the files and folders from the root folder for your WordPress site using a file manager or FTP client, then export the WordPress database. You can also simply create a compressed archive (.zip) of your **public\_html** or **httpdocs** directory directly from your cPanel file manager, depending on your hosting provider and package. You may also want to check to see if backups are already made available to you as a part of your hosting or security package.

If you have a clean, functional backup of your website, the path of least resistance may just be to simply restore it and skip the malware removal process altogether. However, if your website has a blog or is frequently updated with new content, this may not be a viable option.

Next we’ll go over how to backup your database. Once you have accessed your site’s phpMyAdmin or Adminer, follow these steps:

### phpMyAdmin

1. Access your phpMyAdmin panel and select the database for your WordPress site. This is the database you created when you [installed WordPress](https://wordpress.org/installation/how-to-install-wordpress/).
2. Click **Export** from the top menu and choose **custom** for the export method.
3. Select **SQL** from the **Format** drop-down and select all of the tables.
    ![SQL table list](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/blog-one.png)
4. In the **Output** section, check **Save output to a file** and select **None** for **Compression** if your site is standard size. If your site is large you will want to select a compression style.

5. Select **Export** at the bottom and the database will be saved into your computer.

### Adminer

1. Select the database that holds your WordPress data.
2. Click **Export** at the top.
3. In the **Export** section, leave all tables selected as they are by default.
4. In the **Output** section check **Save**. Select **None** for **Compression** if your site is standard size, if your site is large you will want to select a compression style.
5. Select **SQL** as the format.
6. Ensure that **data** is selected to export both the structure and the data.
7. Click **Export** and the backup will be saved as an .sql on your computer.

## Step 2: Check for Recently Modified Files & Scan WordPress for Malware

There are several ways to check new or recently modified files to see if they may be part of the hack, like reviewing cPanel or SSH.

### SSH: Check with the ls command

1. Log into your server via SSH and navigate to your site’s home directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   $ ls -1tlah | head -10
   ```
3. Review the most recently modified files, starting at the top.

### SSH: Check with the find command

1. Log into your server via SSH and navigate to your site’s home directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   $ find . -type f -mtime -90
   ```
3. Results will show an output with files that were modified within the last 90 days.
4. Review these files. Unfamiliar modifications ...
