**The clarity and control to stop threats before they strike**

# Modern fraud is complex, but you donât have to be

### As gatekeepers of the financial system, we are constantly implementing solutions which help us keep our customers safe, while also avoiding burdening them with the complexity behind the scenes.

## **Retail banking**

Protect your most-used channel from your most dangerous blind spot

Over 85% of your customers now bank online. Every login, session, and app interaction is now the front line and a potential attack surface. Cleafy provides live visibility into every session, spotting malware, bots, hijacked devices, and social engineering tactics **before money moves**.

**With Cleafy, you can:**

* Detect fraud early, before funds are touched
* Cut false positives without hurting the customer journey
* Investigate less noise, act faster, and stop attacks from scaling

## **Corporate banking**

Complex corporate payments demand precise detection

Corporate banking faces unique and complex fraud challenges, with high-value transactions, multi-layered approval processes, and frequent international payments providing ample opportunity for fraudsters. Traditional fraud detection struggles with the sheer volume and complexity of these transactions, making it easier for fraud to go unnoticed.

â

Cleafyâs platform is specifically designed to address these challenges, offering real-time, multi-layered protection that detects subtle anomalies and advanced threats.

â
