Every hype cycle in the technology industry continues a steady march towards a shitty future that nobody wants.

Note: I know this isn’t *unique* to the tech industry, but I can’t write about industries I don’t work in, so this is what’s being covered.

## The Road to Hell

Once upon a time, everyone was all hot and bothered about **[Big Data](https://web.archive.org/web/20211106230607/https%3A//bernardmarr.com/whats-really-behind-the-big-data-hype/)**: Having lots of information–far too much to process with commodity software–was supposed to magically transform business.

How do you build technology that can process that much information at scale? Well, obviously, you just need to invest in **The Cloud**! (If you’re using the *Cloud to Butt Plus* Chrome extension, this entire blog post may be confusing to you.)

But don’t scrutinize the Cloud too long, you might miss your chance to invest in **[blockchain](https://tonyarcieri.com/on-the-dangers-of-a-blockchain-monoculture)**.

![Oprah meme. YOU GET A BLOCKCHAIN! AND YOU GET A BLOCKCHAIN! EVERYBODY GETS A BLOCKCHAIN!!](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/blockchain.png?resize=600%2C518&ssl=1)

Blockchainiacs practically invented an entire constructed language of buzzwords. Things like “DeFi”, “Web3”, and so on. To anyone not accustomed to their in-signaling, it’s potent enough cringe to repel even the weirdest of furries.

But the only thing to know about blockchain is its proponents they like it when the line goes up, and every “innovation” in that sector was in service of the line going up.

Blockchain, of course, refers to [cryptocurrency](https://soatok.blog/2021/04/19/a-furrys-guide-to-cryptocurrency/). The security of these digital currencies is based on expensive consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work). The incentives baked into the design of these consensus mechanisms led users to [buy lots of GPUs](https://www.techradar.com/news/cant-buy-a-new-gpu-blame-cryptominers-who-bought-25-of-them) in order to compete to solve numeric puzzles (a.k.a. “mining”).

For a while, many technologists observed that whenever the line actually goes down or a popular cryptocurrency decides to adopt a less wasteful consensus mechanism, the secondhand market gets flooded with used GPUs.

That all changed with the release of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models.

Now GPUs are a hot commodity even when the price of Bitcoin goes down because tech company leaders are either malicious or stupid, and are always trying to appease investors that have more money than sense. It’s not just tech companies either.

Of all these hype cycles, I suspect that the “AI” hype has more staying power than the rest, if for no other reason than it provides a hedge against the downside of previous hype cycles.

* Not sure to do with the exabytes of Big Data you’re sitting on? Have LLMs parse it all then convincingly lie to you about what it means.
* Expensive cloud bill? Attract more investor dollars by selling them on trying to build an Artificial General Intelligence out of hallucinating chatbots.
* Got a bunch of GPUs lying around from a failed crypto-mining idea? Use it to flagrantly violate intellectual property law to steal from artists with legal impunity!

This “AI” trend is the Human Centipede of technology.

(Yes, there are [some valid use cases for the technology that underpins this hype](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/). I’m focusing on Generative AI exclusively for this blog post, since that’s what a lot of the hype is centered around.)

So you can imagine how I felt when I went to add an image to a blog post draft one day and saw this:

![The WordPress.com add image block now has a "Generate with AI" button and no way to disable or opt out of its existence.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/generate-with-ai.png?resize=557%2C214&ssl=1)

Generate with AI? Fuck you.

There is no way to opt out of, or disable, this feature.

WordPress is not alone in its overt participation in this consumption of binary excrement.

### Tech Industry Idiocy is Ubiquitous

![User to Oracle's AI: "I want to delete my account".  Oracle's AI responded with some "helpful" resources, which mostly were "how to train your model for natural language understanding" and a "knowledge search" link.  The AI chatbot then asks "Did you find the resources helpful?" to which the user replies "No, the resources did not help"](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/oracle.jpg?resize=571%2C595&ssl=1)

Behold, Oracle’s AI innovation. [Source](https://meow.social/%40crumbcake/113156927685392932)

EA’s CEO called generative AI [the “very core of our business”](https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1836100160478138527), which an astute listener will find reminiscent of the time [they claimed NFTs and blockchain were the future of the games industry at an earnings call](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-says-nfts-and-blockchain-games-are-the-future-of-our-industry-).

> Nevermind the fact that they’re actually in the business of publishing video games!

[Mozilla Firefox 128.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1dqngjy/privacypreserving_ad_measurement_concerns/) released a feature ([enabled by default of course](https://soatok.blog/2024/02/27/the-tech-industry-doesnt-understand-consent/)) to help advertisers collect data on you.

Per 404 Media, [Snapchat reserves the right to use AI-generated images of your face in ads (also on by default)](https://www.404media.co/snapchat-reserves-the-right-to-use-ai-generated-images-of-your-face-in-ads/).

**At this point, even *Rip Van fucking Winkle* can spot the pattern.**
