In episode 26 of The AI Fix, an AI does surgery on pork chops, holographic Jesus wants your consent to use cookies, Mark opens the pod bay doors, our hosts discover OpenAI‚Äôs couch potato health coach, and Graham finds a robot made of drain pipes.

Graham pits Mark against an AI in a morality quiz that asks ‚Äúwould you kill sentient robots?‚Äù, and ‚Äúare lobsters more delicious than cats?‚Äù, while a surprisingly useful answer from ChatGPT leads Mark on a quest for world peace.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
