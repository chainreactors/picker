Hello Reader,

For over 15 years, I’ve had the honor of serving as the red team captain for the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NCCDC). Since its inception in the early 2000s, NCCDC has evolved from a  a handful of schools into a premier, nationwide event that now attracts teams from over 180 institutions across the country. This competition is more than just a contest—it’s a rigorous, real-world simulation where our nation’s next generation of cyber defenders learn to tackle emerging threats head-on (us).

At NCCDC, we simulate live attack scenarios, leveraging the very tools and techniques that threat actors use in the field. Every year, I bring together the most effective strategies and custom tooling I've encountered in my real worfk, challenging collegiate teams to defend against sophisticated, dynamic cyber engagements. The environment is intense, and every engagement is a testament to the creativity and resilience of our future security professionals. Don't feel bad for these college students they train all year long to have a chance of locking us out.

What truly sets NCCDC apart is its lasting impact on participants. Many past competitors have gone on to become leaders in the cybersecurity world—working with top-tier companies, federal agencies, and innovative startups. Our alumni network is a vibrant community of experts who continue to shape our nation’s cybersecurity landscape, using the skills honed in these competitions to safeguard our digital future.

Now, as we gear up for another exhilarating season, I’m reaching out to all skilled individuals ready to step into one of the best cyber simulations on the planet. Ever year I put out a call for the limited number of volunteer spots for our red team—those with a knack for thinking like an adversary. If you have a proven track record demonstrated by a robust GitHub portfolio, innovative custom tooling, and a passion for making our digital world more secure, we want to hear from you.

This is your chance to:

* **Challenge Yourself:** Engage in realistic simulations that push your skills to the limit.
* **Inspire Future Defenders:** Share your expertise with tomorrow’s cybersecurity leaders.
* **Be Part of a Legacy:** Join a community whose alumni have gone on to make significant impacts in cybersecurity nationwide.
* **Be Destructive:** We are one of the few competition that allows the red team to take down blue team infrastructue and forces them to rebuild and defend.

If you believe you have what it takes to survive in one the best cyber simulation engagements, please email your resume and GitHub portfolio to **dlcowen@gmail.com**.
