The White House’s recently-unveiled “[AI Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf)” wages war on so-called “woke AI”—including large language models (LLMs) that provide information inconsistent with the administration’s views on climate change, gender, and other issues. It also targets measures designed to mitigate the generation of racial and gender biased content and even [hate speech](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content). The reproduction of this bias is a pernicious problem that AI developers have struggled to solve for over a decade.

A new executive order called “[Preventing Woke AI in the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/preventing-woke-ai-in-the-federal-government/),” released alongside the AI Action Plan, seeks to strong-arm AI companies into modifying their models to conform with the Trump Administration’s ideological agenda.

The executive order requires AI companies that receive federal contracts to prove that their LLMs are free from purported “ideological biases” like “diversity, equity, and inclusion.” This heavy-handed censorship will not make models more accurate or “trustworthy,” as the Trump Administration [claims](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-...
