# Adoption agency leaks over a million records

Posted: July 17, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Security researcher [Jeremiah Fowler](https://x.com/yoda69) found a publicly accessible database online that contained highly personal information from an adoption agency.

Jeremiah, who specializes in locating exposed [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) storage, is used to [finding sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/4-8-million-healthcare-records-left-freely-accessible) exposed. However, because of the nature of the information, this one immediately raised his concern and he hurried to find out who owned the data.

Research indicated that the database belonged to the Fort Worth (TX) based non-profit [Gladney Center for Adoption](https://adoptionsbygladney.com/). After notifying the agency, the database was secured the following day. Let’s hope nobody else found it before that time.

In total, the unencrypted and non-password-protected database contained 1,115,061 records including the names of children, birth parents, adoptive parents, and other potentially [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) like case notes.

The risks of leaking this type of data and it potentially falling in the hands of cybercriminals are huge. The sensitivity of adoption-related data makes these exposures particularly damaging, both for children and families, since adoption records often include highly personal details about children, birth parents, adoptive parents, and agency staff.

Criminals that get their hands on this kind of information could engage in [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) with very specific information, making their queries plausible. And in some cases, the information could even be sensitive enough to use for extortion or [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft).

The researcher [notes](https://www.websiteplanet.com/news/gladney-breach-report/):

> “The records did not contain full case files, and the publicly exposed records were a combination of plain text and unique identifiers.”

He goes on to explain that unique identifiers are not necessarily a security enhancement.

> “From a cybersecurity perspective, a UUID is designed for unique identification, not secrecy, and it can potentially be guessed, reverse-engineered, or enumerated. UUIDs are not recommended to be used to protect sensitive data.”

Given the long-standing reputation of an adoption center like Gladney, people feel confident to share their personal information. People providing that amount of trust should not be let down by something as basic as securing an online database with a password.

It should be noted that it is unknown whether the database was exposed by Gladney itself or a third-party provider.

[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/adoption-agency-data-exposure-revealed-information-about-children-and-parents/) posted a statement by Gladney’s Chief Operating Officer, which was not very helpful in determining what went wrong:

> “The Gladney Center for Adoption takes security seriously. We always work with the assistance of external information technology experts to conduct a detailed investigation into any incident. Data integrity and operations are our top priority.”
