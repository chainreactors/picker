#### Palo Alto Networks® positioned both highest in the Ability to Execute and furthest in Completeness of Vision in 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Single-Vendor SASE.

![Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/figure1-1.png)Today, Palo Alto Networks was recognized for the second straight year as a Leader in the [2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sase-mq-2024.html). We were also positioned both highest in the Ability to Execute and furthest in Completeness of Vision. We believe we are a Leader because we go beyond traditional SASE with a future-proof solution that helps address the complexities of a hybrid workplace.

## A SASE Solution for the Future of Work

The 2024 recognition as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE comes shortly after our acknowledgment as a Leader in the [2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Security Service Edge (SSE](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/gartner-sse-mq-leader-2024.html)). Earlier this year, we introduced [Prisma SASE 3.0](/blog/2024/05/prisma-sase-3-0/), representing a paradigm shift in SASE:

* **Securing Any User, Device or App, Anywhere –** [Prisma SASE](/sase) is the industry's only SASE solution that secures both managed and unmanaged devices through a natively integrated enterprise browser in minutes, extending protection to anywhere for devices, users and even branches.
* **Leveraging AI-Powered Data Security –** Prisma SASE’s AI-powered Document Classification combines the strengths of machine learning models with the power of LLM-based natural language understanding, further enhancing our DLP solution to help keep customer data secure.
* **Providing a Seamless Digital Experience –** Prisma SASE App Acceleration is the only solution that securely understands each user's journey inside the app and proactively computes the dynamic content for that user, enabling application performance up to 5x faster for users everywhere, including those in branches.

By extending protection to unmanaged devices and incorporating advanced data security and performance optimization capabilities, [Prisma SASE](/sase) empowers organizations to confidently navigate the complexities of today’s dynamic work environment. This future-proof solution allows CISOs and CIOs to embrace a secure and productive work model without sacrificing agility or user experience.

## Leading a New Era of SASE

The shift to an on-the-go, cloud-driven world was a necessary business decision. However, many of the solutions deployed in the initial rush to support this shift had prioritized immediate needs rather than a cohesive, long-term strategy. As a result, companies end up with multiple secure access tools, all with different policies, network sensors and management panes in place. This creates challenges in making sense of it all, ensuring policy consistency, and achieving a unified view of your network security.

As organizations look ahead, the limitations of a patchwork SASE approach become increasingly clear. These existing SASE solutions may have initially sufficed, but the compromises inherent in disconnected solutions will hinder your future growth:

* **Security Gaps –** Contractors, third-party collaborators and BYOD devices introduce unique security risks that might not be fully covered by your current solutions.
* **Inadequate Data Protection –** Limited data classification capabilities can leave you vulnerable to potentially damaging data breaches.
* **Inconsistent Application Performance –** Legacy SASE models may struggle to deliver the seamless user experience that modern dynamic applications demand, which impacts productivity.

The ideal solution is to adopt a complete, fully integrated SASE solution to address the totality of your work requirements. Only a converged solution with unified management, data and AI-powered security can optimize hybrid work performance alongside uncompromising protection.

## Palo Alto Networks — Staying Ahead of Tomorrow’s Threats

When Palo Alto Networks was the only vendor to be recognized as a Leader in the inaugural [2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE](/company/press/2023/palo-alto-networks-recognized-as-the-only-leader-in-single-vendor-sase--period-), we believe we had been given the responsibility of setting a standard customers would seek as they established SASE as a critical component of their transformation to a hybrid, cloud-based world. Our recognition as Leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Single-Vendor SASE, in our opinion, represents that continued commitment to staying ahead of tomorrow’s threats.
