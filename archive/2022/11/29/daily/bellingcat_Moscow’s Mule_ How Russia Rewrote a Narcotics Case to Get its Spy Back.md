# Moscow’s Mule: How Russia Rewrote a Narcotics Case to Get its Spy Back

November 28, 2022

A series of indictment documents and information from Russia’s data markets show that Moscow’s pretext for recalling a spy behind bars in Brazil appears not only implausible, but impossible, Bellingcat can reveal.

When the blond 36–year old man carrying a Brazilian passport in the name of Victor Muller Ferreira landed at São Paulo airport in April 2022, he was immediately taken away by Brazilian security service officers. He tried to argue that he was, in fact, just as Brazilian as they, and that he could not comprehend why the Dutch authorities had told the Brazilians that he was in fact Sergey Cherkasov, a deep-cover spy of Russia’s GRU foreign military intelligence agency who had attempted to infiltrate the International Criminal Court at the Hague as an intern.

As Bellingcat [reported at the time](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2022/06/16/the-brazilian-candidate-the-studious-cover-identity-of-an-alleged-russian-spy/), his cover story was full of holes. Brazil’s Federal Court quickly sent him off to jail for fifteen years after he was convicted on charges of fraudulently obtaining and abusing Brazilian identity documents.

But now Moscow wants him back.

Shortly after his conviction, Cherkasov’s story took an unexpected direction. In July 2022, Russian investigative bodies approached Brazilian authorities requesting the extradition of the jailed Russian, who they admitted was Sergey Cherkasov. However Russian authorities claimed Cherkasov was not a deep-cover GRU spy but a hardened criminal on the run from Russian justice, who ran a heroin smuggling ring in Russia in the early 2010s.

To back up this claim, the Russian authorities provided Brazil with dozens of pages of indictment documentation and forensic affidavits alleging Sergey Cherkasov was part of a crime group that smuggled drugs from Afghanistan via Tajikistan and sold them to gangs in Russia between 2011 and 2013. Sergey Cherkasov reportedly confessed to these crimes and requested to be transferred to Russia. As BBC Brazil [has noted](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/internacional-63352777), it is implausible that this is a genuine demand given that the crime for which he is wanted in Russia would require him to serve out a longer sentence (20 years) than he would have to endure for his fraudulent documents in Brazil (where Cherkasov [has been sentenced](https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2022/07/01/espiao-russo-que-fingia-ser-brasileiro-e-condenado-a-15-anos-de-prisao-pela-justica-federal.ghtml) to 15 years’ imprisonment).

Copies of the Russian charging documents were submitted to Brazilian courts and obtained independently by our investigative partners [VG](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/rlP7Je/russland-hevder-avsloert-agent-er-heroinsmugler-ber-om-aa-faa-ham-utlevert) (Norway) and [RecordTV](https://recordtv.r7.com/domingo-espetacular/videos/farsa-descoberta-como-um-espiao-russo-passou-os-ultimos-12-anos-vivendo-como-se-fosse-um-brasileiro-27112022) (Brazil) who shared them with Bellingcat and The Insider. A detailed review of the documents show glaring inconsistencies in the Russian claims.

Moreover, this version of events also clashes with travel data obtained independently by Bellingcat from [Russia’s black data markets](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/) that show Cherkasov travelled to Russia under his own name several times after he was supposedly wanted on criminal charges. These drug trafficking charges only appeared in Cherkasov’s criminal record after he had been deported to Brazil and his cover blown — nearly a decade after Cherkasov was supposedly implicated in the drug smuggling ring.

Attempts by Russia’s intelligence services to recover their failed agents abroad by fabricating criminal charges against them — thus competing with other countries for their custody — is not a new phenomenon, and has been unsuccessfully pursued in the past.

If Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court approves the extradition, it will then be up to the President of Brazil to authorise it. Brazil’s lame duck President Jair Bolsonaro remains in office until January 1 and so is in a position to make a consequential decision for Brazil-Russia relations before his successor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva takes office.

## Russia’s Indictment Claims

Russia initially addressed Brazil’s Justice Minister with an extradition request on 27 June 2022, just under three months after Cherkasov’s arrest and a month after his sentencing in Brazil.

The request, signed by Russia’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor Pyotr Gorodov, alleges that Cherkasov was indicted by a Moscow district court on 24 June 2022 (three days before the letter was sent) on charges of trade in narcotics as part of an organised crime group. The letter assures Brazilian authorities that Cherkasov, once extradited, will not be prosecuted on political grounds and will be extended the full protection of Russian law, and if convicted will serve out his sentence in a Russian penitentiary institution.

Attached to the extradition request letter is a 20-page indictment document signed by the chief of the Russian Interior Ministry’s narcotics investigative unit. The indictment alleges that Cherkasov “no earlier than June 2011, while being in Moscow, accepted a proposal to become part of an organised crime group trading in narcotics in Russia”. Cherkasov’s role is succinctly described in the first paragraph of the document as overseeing the delivery of heroin from Moscow to other members of the group based in Lipetsk, a city in central Russia.

Following this introduction, the indictment exhaustively narrates a complicated drug smuggling operation involving multiple legs and crossing several borders from Afghanistan to Russia. The charging papers introduce several other individuals whose role in the drug smuggling operation  is set out in minute detail, including their exact locations on certain dates, telephone numbers used and even locations of dead drops and safehouses. The individuals mentioned in this indictment do indeed correspond to suspects named in Russian judicial documents and activist websites, which outline details of the case. These websites mention that these individuals were charged [in 2015](https://www.rod-pravo.org/6-grazhdan-tadzhikistana-i-rossiyanin-ikmet-dzhafarov-otvetyat-pered-sud...
