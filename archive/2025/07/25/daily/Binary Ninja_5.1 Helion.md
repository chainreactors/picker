Binary Ninja 5.1 might not help you see in the dark like Riddick (our 5.1 Helion release is named after a system from the Riddick universe), but it WILL help you reverse engineer better! With a bunch of quality of life improvements, bug-fixes, and even a few new features, weâre continually working to improve your reversing experience. Weâre introducing WARP, our new static function matching system, which will be helping not only Binary Ninja users in the future, but the entire reverse engineering community. Also, weâre shipping the BinExport plugin pre-built for all platforms, for easy integration with BinDiff. Finally, weâve added a ton of improvements to the readability and presentation of decompilation, better tooling for re-writing IL with scripts, and a ton of architecture improvements.

We really wanted to focus on quality and fixes for 5.1, but even with that focus we were still able to ship a number of major new features that will enable a better reverse engineering experience. Weâve also got a major update for [Sidekick](https://sidekick.binary.ninja/) coming soon, so keep an eye out on the blog or our social media!

## WARP

Check out WARP: our powerful new function signature-matching system!

[![WARP](/blog/images/5.1-release/warp-overview.png)](/blog/images/5.1-release/warp-overview.png)

You should never have to rely on heuristics or raw analysis if you have exact type information you can apply. Prior to this release, our main mechanisms for importing or applying large amounts of types were:

* [Importing](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/types/typeimportexport.html) type information from headers or another analysis database
* [Type Libraries](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/types/typelibraries.html) with type information matching specific imported libraries
* [Type Archives](https://docs.binary.ninja/guide/types/typearchives.html) that collect and synchronize types between multiple analysis databases
* [Signature Libraries](https://docs.binary.ninja/dev/annotation.html?h=sigkit#signature-libraries) (generated by [Sigkit](https://github.com/Vector35/sigkit)) that apply types to functions that match a given signature

WARP is the next-generation equivalent of Sigkit and, as of 5.1, is available and enabled by default. You can still use Signature Libraries for at least one more stable release, but we will be deprecating Sigkit in the near future. All official signature libraries will be shipped via WARP going forward.

Why replace Sigkit with WARP? First, letâs start with the design goals:

* Better performance on both generation and matching
* Significantly improved ease-of-use for generating new libraries
* Support both type information and symbols (Sigkit only matched symbols, relying on other type libraries to then bring over type information)
* Support for network lookups and submissions (similar to [Lumina](https://docs.hex-rays.com/user-guide/user-interface/menu-bar/lumina))
* Cross-tool-compatibility: One of our goals with WARP is to enable better cross-platform sharing of type information between other major tools. Keep an eye out on future releases as we plan to include plugins for [Ghidra](https://github.com/Vector35/warp/issues/11), [IDA](https://github.com/Vector35/warp/issues/10), [Angr](https://github.com/Vector35/warp/issues/32), and [Radare](https://github.com/Vector35/warp/issues/33) that can all consume and create the same WARP signature libraries

For our 5.1 release, weâre starting with an [open-source plugin](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/tree/dev/plugins/warp) that is enabled by default as well as signatures for some common Windows libraries like `msvcrt`. In future releases, we will be releasing additional signatures and moving forward with plans to address our other design goals.

If youâd like to see some other use-cases for WARP (such as matching the Go runtime and matching it from start to finish) check out its showcase in [our feature release live-stream video](https://www.youtube.com/live/UG5PHLJPe_0?t=435&si=y-bJ0lJ294xT7Vg7), or keep an eye out here for the forthcoming blog post where weâll show off even more ways you can use it to make your reverse engineering experience better.

Finally, keep an eye out for an upcoming deep-dive here on this blog that will showcase other ways WARP can help you quickly make sense of your binaries.

## Pseudo Objective-C

In what has to be one of the most overkill accidental-job-applications of all time, one of the best features in 5.1 actually comes from [a third-party contributor](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api/pull/6807) who is now first-party! If youâre in the Slack, make sure to welcome Mark to the team. While originally written before he was at Vector 35, heâs of course even more active now that heâs joined us and is helping support our iOS, Objective-C, kernelcache, dyld\_shared\_cache, and Swift reverse engineering workflows.

This plugin showcases the power of what you can do with [Language Representations](https://binary.ninja/2024/11/20/4.2-frogstar.html#language-representations) and is even more useful than the two examples we launched the feature with.

Not only does decompiling back to the original source language help represent language-specific features better, but if your goal is to be able to recompile, this is a step much clo...
