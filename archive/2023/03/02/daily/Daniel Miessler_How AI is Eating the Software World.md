Our discussions around Generative AI are focused on the wrong thing, and it’s causing us to miss what’s about to happen. We’re infatuated with what it can do, like getting better search results, creating custom art, or becoming an interactive teacher. It’s all really exciting, but it’s distracting us from the advancement that makes it all possible.

That advancement is understanding. Generative AI is an unfortunate misnomer. Yes, it’s generating things, but the name ignores the critical prerequisite of needing to understand before it can create.

I don’t use the word *understand* lightly, it’s the most important word in this essay. But what does it actually mean for software to understand something? Here’s how I think about the progression from data to understanding, and this is the definition I’m using to back my claim that large GPT models actually understand.

* **Data**: Raw facts or figures without context
* **Information**: Data that has been processed, organized, or structured
* **Knowledge**: Information that has been analyzed and integrated
* **Understanding**: The ability to apply knowledge in new situations and contexts

Or:

* Data is **raw**
* Information is **organized**
* Knowledge is **integrated**
* Understanding is **applied**

People are defining understanding as special because it’s human, which is begging the question. You have to start with a definition and see if it applies.

So do Generative Pre-trained Transformers really understand things? There are endless pundits out there saying no:

GPTs are nothing but next character predictors.

Or:

They’re just filling in the next letter of text based on what they’ve been trained on! It doesn’t really **understand** anything.

They’re half-right. The models are just deciding the next best character to write based on their training, but so is Prince when he does an off-the-cuff guitar solo. If you watch it in slow motion he’s just going from one note, to the next, in order. But the only reason he can do it is because of all the music he’s listened to in his life, and all the hours he’s practiced. He can do it because he understands guitar.

GPTs are similar. When they are to told to:

Write a romantic poem from Luke to Leia in the style of Shakespeare.

…they’re also "just completing the next character" in a piece of text. But look what they can do.

O Leia, fairest of all maidens fair,

Thy beauty doth my very soul ensnare.

Thy shining eyes, like stars that light the night,

Doth fill my heart with love’s sweet, shining light.

Thy gentle touch, like feathers on my skin,

Doth make my heart to dance and leap within.

Thy voice, like music to my eager ears,

Doth soothe my soul and calm my deepest fears.

And though our love may be forbidden, true,

I cannot help but give my heart to you.

For thou art all I ever could desire,

My Leia, thou hast set my heart on fire.

So let us steal away into the night,

And let our love take wing and take to flight.

For in thy arms, I know I shall find peace,

And all the world’s troubles shall surely cease.

This was made one letter at a time, but in order to do so it had to first learn and understand the following non-trivial subjects:

1. The English language
2. How poets write
3. How Shakespeare writes
4. Star Wars
5. The fact that Luke and Leia are siblings
6. The concept of forbidden love

Looking our definition—"the ability to apply knowledge in new situations and contexts", that’s precisely what just happened. You simply cannot write such a poem (much less an infinite number of them) without understanding the underlying concepts. And it’s the same for any sufficiently trained GPT. The point isn’t that they generate. The point is that they understand.

## Software, before and after

So what about software? What is software’s purpose? What does it actually do, from a first-principles perspective? And why is our current software in imminent danger from this new type of understanding AI? I’d say software is something like, "providing an interface to information and action in order to create understanding and pursue results." So:

* *Interfaces to information*: the ability to store information in organized structures that we can query
* *Interfaces to action*: connecting inputs and outputs to action, such as sending emails
* *Creating understanding*: when we get the information back it creates knowledge and understanding inside human brains
* *Pursue results*: we configure the software such that its execution moves us closer to higher-level outcomes we’re trying to achieve

Generative AI is eating our existing software not because it does some things better than legacy software, but because it’s working at a completely different layer of the stack. Rather than working with information and action, AI deals in understanding and outcomes. Those are the two maturity models: The Understanding axis—which goes from data to understanding, and the outcomes axis—which goes from task to outcome.

I recommend all of [Stephen Few](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Stephen-Few/author/B001H6IQ5M?ref=ap_rdr&store_ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true&utm_source=danielmiessler.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=how-ai-is-eating-the-software-world) >’s reading on metrics, reporting, and dashboards. They’re the best out there.

At Apple I had a team focused on creating security insights for the company. The goal I gave the team was to move up the intelligence stack over time. Meaning the better we got, the more we’d move from providing data, to providing information, then to knowledge, and finally to "intelligence" that was ready for a decision. So it was a data "enrichment" process, arriving at the form that was as close as possible to action.

This has, until now, been an uniquely human capability. On the Understanding axis, going from satellite images, intercepted phone communications, and log files—to an analysis and recommendation for a general—has been unreachable for computers because it required too much background knowledge of the world. Actually, too much understanding of the world.

It’s the same for doing something complex in software, like finding the best possible thing to say to a customer to get them to buy something. The software could help the human by providing as much supporting information as possible in Salesforce, but ultimately it came down to the human knowing what exactly to say in the email, or where exactly to recommend for a perfect dinner.

Motion on the Outcomes axis is similar, and is currently mostly handled by humans. We can easily ask software today to email a list of people that’s provided, or to do a series of tasks such as, 1) query the database for those who currently work in Boise, and then 2) email those customers with the Boise\_Invite template. But a human had to come up with those steps, and then program a computer to execute them.

Everything unfolds from understanding.

Moving from basic task execution to driving towards an Outcome has always required a human. You first have to understand the desired outcome, and then you have to understand the entire world well enough to break ...
