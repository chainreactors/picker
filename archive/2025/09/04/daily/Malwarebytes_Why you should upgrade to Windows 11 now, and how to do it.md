# Why you should upgrade to Windows 11 now, and how to do it

Posted: September 3, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

I know many of us love(d) Windows XP and Windows 7 almost as much as we dislike Windows 10 and 11, but if you want to stay secure on Windows, the time to bite the bullet is closing in fast.

Support for Windows 10 will [end on October 14, 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-of-support?r=1), which means the only Windows version that will continue to receive updates after that date is Windows 11.

## Why you should upgrade

Using an out‑of‑date Windows version leaves you exposed to threats designed for yesterday’s flaws. Each Windows update patches known vulnerabilities, some of which might already be used by cybercriminals, so closing those gaps as soon as possible is important. When official support ends, so do the security updates that help keep criminals out.

Through its updates, Microsoft also steadily adds new protection features, like better firewalls and improved warnings, which will never make it to older versions of Windows.

Security software is built for the latest, safest codebase. While programs may support older Windows versions, you may be missing out on some of the options, simply because the older Windows version does not support them.

Other programs may also be unavailable if you are sticking to an old Windows version.

## How to upgrade

If you’re on Windows 10 than the upgrade to the equivalent version of Windows 11 is free, but that only works if your computer meets the minimum system specifications. If not you’ll either need another computer or you can explore other options.

You can check if your Windows 10 computer is eligible to upgrade for free to Windows 11 by selecting the Start button, then going to **Settings** > **Update & Security** **> Windows Update**. If your system isn’t compatible with Windows 11, there’ll be a big box letting you know, along with the option to grab the Microsoft PC Health Check App. This will explain in more detail why you may not be able to meet system requirements for Windows 11.

Before upgrading or switching, always do a complete backup of your system and all personal files. If something goes wrong, you’ll be glad you took this extra step.

Windows does retain your old operating system (OS) for up to 10 days after upgrading, letting you revert if problems pop up. After that period, rolling back means a clean install and restoring from backup.

At Malwarebytes, we want you to stay safe and secure, regardless of which operating system you use. While Malwarebytes continues to support Windows 7 and higher at this time, we strongly recommend updating to the latest operating system to ensure you receive the full protection and latest features we offer.

Make sure to have a plan ready before October 14, 2025 and be aware that doing nothing is also a choice, even though it may not be the best one.
