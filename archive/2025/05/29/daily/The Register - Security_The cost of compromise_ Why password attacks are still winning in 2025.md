# The cost of compromise: Why password attacks are still winning in 2025

## Poor password management is responsible for thousands of data breaches, but it doesn’t have to be this way.

Sponsored feature The IT business likes to reinvent things as quickly as possible. Except passwords, that is. We've been using them since Roman times, only now they're digital. They're the fungal skin disease of tech; irritating and hard to get rid of.

We've tried. Passkeys and biometric authentication have made some inroads, but they're far from ubiquitous. Each also has their own implementation problems. Despite their reliance on industry standards, passkeys are often trapped inside vendor ecosystems.

Biometrics vendors are in a constant [cat-and-mouse game with hackers](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/hackers-unlock-any-phone-using-photographed-fingerprints-in-just-20-minutes), and some smartphones fall back to a PIN code when that authentication fails anyway. What's the betting that the code is a mixture of grandchildrens' birthdays, which also unlocks a bank card?

So passwords remain the main digital access mechanism, and the primary point of friction. "The password is just the thing that gets in the way," says Darren James, senior product manager at [password management and authentication systems vendor Specops](https://specopssoft.com/?utm_source=theregister&utm_medium=referral&utm...
