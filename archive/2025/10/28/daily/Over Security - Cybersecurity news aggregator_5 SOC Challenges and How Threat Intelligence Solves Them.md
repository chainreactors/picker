5 SOC Challenges and How Threat Intelligence Solves Them

No SOC is perfect, but it’s possible to overcome frequent shortcomings and achieve measurable results by introducing one essential component of modern cybersecurity operations: threat intelligence.

Organizations using [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5_soc_challenges_ti&utm_term=281025&utm_content=linktolanding)’s TI solutions report the following results:

* **94%** experience faster triage

* Up **to 58%** more threats get detected

* **3x** improvement in overall SOC performance

Quality, real-time threat intelligence helps SOCs tackle their toughest challenges. More on that below.

## #1. Low Detection Rates

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8-2.png)

As attackers continuously refine their evasion tactics, low detection rates remain a key challenge for SOC teams. When even one missed threat can quickly escalate into serious operational and reputational risks, businesses can’t afford to overlook this metric.

**Solution:** Threat intelligence is a powerful driver for early detection. This alone can radically boost your performance rates. How? Through expanded threat coverage, which is the key mission of [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=5_soc_challenges_ti&utm_term=281025&utm_content=linktofeedslanding).

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screen02large-1024x577.jpeg)

By aggregating live attack data from 15,000+ organizations across industries and counties, TI Feeds highlights which malware is targeting real business right now. The result is **99% unique network IOCs** that do not overlap with other sources and get carefully filtered to avoid false positives.

For your business, this means a wide, in-depth, and relevant visibility into the latest threats. That’s what drives the SOC team’s detections up and helps you remain one step ahead of attackers, mitigating the risk of costly disruptions.

**Outcome:**

* **Proactive detection** – identify emerging threats in your SOC early on.

* **Wide coverage of threats** – monitor latest malware and phishing globally.

* **Resources saved** – no time and effort is wasted on false positives and escalations.

## #2. Slow Incident Response

The underlying reasons behind slow incident response often include a lack of automation and alert prioritization. But when incidents miss context, even the most efficient workflow might stall. Timely reaction becomes impossible when analysts have to go through disconnected alerts and bare IOCs.

**Solution:** Threat intelligence fueled with live context from ongoing malware investigations allows you to detect threats early on and cut response time dramatically. Each indicator from TI Feeds has a detailed sandbox report behind it. With it, you can see how malware behaves, what processes it affects, and what related IOCs there are.

**Outcome:**

* **Full threat visibility** – it takes seconds to dig deeper into a malicious sample for actionable insights.

* **Shorter MTTR** – 21 min less per incident.

* **Instant threat blocking** – integrate TI Feeds with your SIEM, SOAR, or EDR to refine playbooks in real time.

## #3. Large Alert Backlog

SOC teams must face massive amounts of data, and each unprocessed item awaiting manual investigation is a potential risk. That is why there’s a demand for solutions that work fast and support automated workflows.

**Solution:** Efficient TI solutions clear backlogs quickly and ensure that no threat is overlooked, including evasive or hidden threats that might act...
