A software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is an inventory of what makes up a software application: the “ingredients list” of everything in it. There’s pressure today for companies to make SBOM information available, and it has implications for who is liable when there are issues in the software.

A food analogy is apt. When you read the ingredients list of chocolate chip cookies, you will see flour, sugar, butter, chocolate chips, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, salt, etc. But within those chocolate chips is a subinventory ingredients list—chocolate chips contain sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, milkfat, and soy lecithin.
