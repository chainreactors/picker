## Moving on to a new place

At the end of July, I made the following announcement via Twitter:

<https://x.com/rtrouton/status/1815414758184558984>

Time has marched on and today is my last day at [SAP](https://www.sap.com). I wanted to take the opportunity to express my gratitude to my team. I am proud of what we were able to do together and wish each one of you every success for the future.

One of the things that I valued greatly while I was at SAP was that I was encouraged to write (both for this blog and [my first book](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/category/books/)), speak at conferences and be involved with the Mac admin community. Thank you to everyone at SAP who provided this encouragement and made sure I always had what I needed.

I look forward to continuing to speak, write and be engaged with community work as part of my move to [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com), where I’m joining a great team doing amazing things for Jamf’s customers. May the next seven years be as good (or better!) as the past seven.

   First I feel sorry for the hiring manager responsible for hiring your replacement at SAP. That will be a nearly impossible task. And second, I feel sorry for whomever they do hire as the shoes they’re to fill are impossibly large.

   I look forward to your next stage! Congrats!
