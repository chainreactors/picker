With the 2H 2022 release right around the corner this coming weekend, let's take a look at the innovation and enhancement highlights in this release for SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals and SAP SuccessFactors Succession & Development.

### **SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals**

We continue to reimagine the goal management user experience with a new streamlined approach to [team-based goals](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_PERFORMANCE_AND_GOALS/4a24e48b5c384b18a81f6b661305021e/031b17925da7450ca31e1e59a19fd045.html). In this release, we have added role-based permissions tied to team goals, simplified adding comments in a goal plan, and made it easier to copy former goals into a new goal plan. These new experiences are also available within the SAP SuccessFactors mobile app, including the ability for managers to create, manage, and track team goals. This will allow for a more intuitive and efficient experience for the end-user.

We are also pleased to share that the rollout of the Horizon visual theme for SAP Fiori has begun within the latest version of performance and goal management. These new design elements provide a modern look with a vibrant color palette. Rounded corners and softer shapes enhance the look and feel, while greater contrast, space, and visual hierarchy promote increased focus.

In addition, public APIs are now available for the latest version of continuous feedback within SAP SuccessFactors Performance & Goals, enabling development of integrations with third-party applications and supports the ability to build custom front-end experiences around feedback.

### **SAP SuccessFactors Succession & Development**

With that, let's jump into a few highlights of what is coming in the 2H 2022 release with SAP SuccessFactors Succession & Development.

In this release, [career explorer](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_RELEASE_INFORMATION/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/0e8e8cb080374619880f49f9fdc33196.html) is now Generally Available, providing a fully AI-driven role recommendation engine. Intelligent recommendations are curated based on analysis of career moves by other employees in the organization with similar competencies and interests, leading to self-empowered career planning and improved employee satisfaction and talent retention.

With our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, we have added non-binary gender as an option within the People Profile. This gender information is then made available in calibration, succession management, presentations, and mentoring to those with the appropriate permissions.
