# Flare-On 2024 Challenge #5 - sshd

November 29, 2024 Â· 1 min Â· 123 words Â· fG!

Flare-On 2024 is gone and I just made a presentation about the challenge #5 at the local meetup called 0xOpoSec. I think it’s a nice challenge to introduce a few RE and forensics concepts, and a perfect candidate to present this year.

The slides are available [here](https://papers.put.as/papers/re/2024/OpoSec_Nov_2024.pdf), and the Unicorn Engine emulator I used to extract the flag from the final shellcode [here](https://github.com/gdbinit/flare-on/tree/main/2024/05).

Last year I did the same with [challenge #12](https://github.com/gdbinit/flare-on/tree/main/2023/12), also with a Unicorn Engine emulator. Slides are available in Github and also [here](https://papers.put.as/papers/re/2023/OpoSec_Dez_2023.pdf).

Since my loader fix was censored by Hex-Rays with a spurious [DMCA takedown](https://github.com/gdbinit/fuckyouilfak) (not worth the trouble to fight this garbage) I’m leaving here its full and uncensored NFO :-).

We love `.DS_Store` :))))))))))))

Have fun,
fG!
