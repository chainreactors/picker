# Ukrainian hackers claim to have destroyed servers of Russian drone maker

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

9:30 AM PDT · July 15, 2025

Ukrainian hacktivist group BO Team has claimed to have hacked into the network of Russian drone maker Gaskar Group and disrupted its operations.

In a [post on its Telegram channel](https://t.me/BO_Team_UA/568), BO Team announced the breach, saying it carried out the attack along with the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, [another hacktivist group that operates in Ukraine](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/08/ukrainian-hackers-take-credit-for-hacking-russian-isp-that-wiped-out-servers-and-caused-internet-outages/), as well as Ukraine’s military intelligence.

The three groups, according to a machine translation of the announcement, “carried out large-scale work to seize the entire network and server infrastructure of the Gaskar Group, collect valuable information about existing and promising [unmanned aerial vehicles], followed by the destruction of information and the disabling of this infrastructure.”

BO Team said that during the cyberattack it destroyed more than 250 systems, including 46 virtual servers and more than 200 workstations, as well as wiping 47 terabytes of company data and 10 terabytes of backups. The hacktivists added that they stole the personal data of Gaskar Group employees, including their home addresses and family information, during the breach.

Both Ukraine and Russian soldiers have extensively used drones since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Gaskar Group [reportedly supplies drones](https://theins.ru/en/society/270648) to the Russian military.

Gaskar Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to its official Telegram phone number.
