In episode 14 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, Graham makes an apology, Mark wonders if suicide drones have second thoughts, people pretend to be robots, and some researchers prove that all you need for an AI to generate a somewhat usable version of the computer game Doom out of thin air is to already have a fully-working copy of the computer game Doom.

Graham learns how to escape from a police sniffer elephant, an AI-generates a smell with no odour, and Mark explains why the world‚Äôs best LLMs think there are two Rs in ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
