5 Characteristics
of Good Threat Intelligence Feeds

In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, access to high-quality threat intelligence feeds is crucial for detecting and mitigating threats in real time. Not all feeds are created equal, however, and choosing the right one can make a significant difference in your organization’s defense strategy.

Let’s explore five key characteristics of good [threat intelligence feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds) and demonstrate how [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=good_ti_feeds&utm_term=081024&utm_content=linktolanding) meets these essential standards.

## Quality of indicators

False positives can cause unnecessary alerts, diverting the security team’s focus from real threats.

A good threat intelligence feed should focus on the accuracy and relevance of indicators. High-quality feeds filter out false positives, duplicates, and outdated data to ensure that the [indicators of compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs) are actionable.

At ANY.RUN, we emphasize the purity of our data. Our feed data undergoes rigorous pre-processing, leveraging advanced algorithms and proprietary technology to minimize false positives.

Thanks to our [interactive sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-sandbox/), we [capture valuable information](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-collect-iocs-in-sandbox/) such as domains and URLs from each session, ensuring that our users get only the most relevant and accurate IOCs in their feeds.

We also extract IOCs from [malware configurations](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-configuration/). This is the most valuable source of quality IOCs, as it contains critical data that threat actors use to run their operations.

## Volume of threat data

While quality is essential, the quantity of data should not be overlooked. A good threat intelligence feed draws from a large, diverse pool of sources to provide a broad view of emerging threats. The more varied and widespread the data sources, the more comprehensive the threat intelligence.

At ANY.RUN, we have an expansive community of over 500,000 analysts from around the globe, continuously submitting fresh samples of malware and phishing to our sandbox for analysis. In [Q2 2024](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-q2-2024/) only, ANY.RUN users ran 881,466 public interactive analysis sessions.

This ensures our threat intelligence feeds are populated with indicators from various geographical regions and attack vectors.

## Freshness of data

The speed at which threat intelligence feeds are updated is another critical factor. Timely data is essential for defending against fast-moving cyber threats. Feeds that rely on outdated data leave organizations vulnerable to attacks. The best feeds provide real-time or near-real-time updates to ensure their users stay ahead of emerging threats.

ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Feeds are continuously updated in real time, drawing from live [analysis sessions](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=good_ti_feeds&utm_term=081024&utm_content=linktopublicsubmissions) in our sandbox environment. This rapid update cycle ensures that our users receive fresh data on the latest threats, significantly reducing the detection lag. With near real-time updates, security teams can react quickly to new threats and enhance their overall defense strategy.

## Data enrichment

Basic threat feeds usually offer limited information, such as IP addresses or file hashes. How...
