I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

**Update 6/10:** *Based on a short [conversation](https://x.com/cambridgemike/status/1932260008278012265?s=46) with an engineering lead at X, some of the devices used at X are claimed to be using HSMs. See more further below.*

Matthew Garrett has a [nice post](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/71646.html) about Twitter (uh, X)’s new end-to-end encryption messaging protocol, which is now called XChat. The TL;DR of Matthew’s post is that from a cryptographic perspective, XChat isn’t great. The details are all contained within Matthew’s post, but here’s a quick TL;DR:

* **There’s no forward secrecy.** Unlike Signal protocol, which uses a [double-ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) to continuously update the user’s secret keys, the XChat cryptography just encrypts each message under a recipient’s long-term public key. The actual encryption mechanism is based on an encryption scheme from [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/).
* **User private keys are stored at X.** XChat stores user *private key*s at its own servers. To obtain your private keys, you first log into X’s key-storage system using a password such as PIN. This is needed to support stateless clients like web browsers, and in fairness it’s not dissimilar to what Meta has done with its encryption for [Facebook Messenger and Instagram](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/). Of course, those services use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs.)
* **X’s key storage is based on “Juicebox.”** To implement their secret-storage system, XChat uses a protocol called [Juicebox](https://juicebox.xyz/). Juicebox “shards” your key material across three servers, so that in principle the loss or compromise of one server won’t hurt you.

Matthew’s post correctly identifies that the major vulnerability in X’s system is this key storage approach. If decryption keys live in three non-HSM servers that are all under X’s control, then X could probably obtain anyone’s key and decrypt their messages.X could do this for their own internal purposes: for example because their famously chill owner got angry at some user. Or they could do it because a warrant or subpoena compels them to. If we judge XChat as an end-to-end encryption scheme, this seems like a pretty game-over type of vulnerability.

So in a sense, everything comes down to the security of Juicebox and the specific deployment choices that X made. Since Matthew wrote his post, I’ve learned a bit more about both of these things. In this post I’d like to go on a slightly deeper dive into the Juicebox portion of X’s system. This will hopefully shed some light on what X is up to, and why you shouldn’t use XChat.

### What’s Juicebox even for?

Many end-to-end encryption (E2E) apps have run into a specific problem: these systems require users to store their own secret keys. Unfortunately, users are just plain bad at this.

Sometimes we forget keys because we lose our devices. Often we have more than one device, which means our keys end up in the wrong place. A much worse situation occurs when apps want to ...
