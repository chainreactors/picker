# PE Section names – re-visited, again

Posted on [2024-06-08](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2024/06/08/pe-section-names-re-visited-again-2/ "10:59 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

I recently caught up with torrents shared by [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/) and after merging the new VS samples with my repo decided to extract [PE section stats](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/category/pe-sections/) from all the files again…. This time, instead of actually attributing section names to protectors, programs, etc. I just share the actual statistics file…

So… there you have it… 100M entries, 660K unique section names – it is an interesting clustering exercise…

You can download the resulting file [here](https://hexacorn.com/d/2024-06-08_PE%20Sections.zip).
