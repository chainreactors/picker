<https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-brainprobe-platform-uses-ai-000703302.html>

=As per a report on Taipei Times, researchers at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH)
have developed an artificial intelligence-powered platform capable of helping diagnose
schizophrenia.

The tools, a first-of-its-kind in the world, mark a major leap forward in the world of
psychiatric care, long hampered by subjectivity and guesswork.

> Named BrainProbe, the tool analyzes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to detect
> structural and functional changes in the brain associated with schizophrenia.

With an accuracy rate of 91.7 percent, it’s the world’s first AI tool of its kind and a
dramatic departure from traditional methods that rely heavily on clinical interviews and
behavioral observation.

“The field of psychiatry has long hoped to identify objective biological markers that can help quantify the symptoms [of mental illness],” TVGH Medical AI Development Center deputy director Albert Yang was quoted as saying by Taipei Times.

Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive disruptions.

With that challenge in mind, Yang’s team turned to artificial intelligence. Using more than a decade of brain scan data from over 1,500 individuals, including both healthy and those diagnosed with schizophrenia, the AI tool was trained to detect subtle, early-stage changes invisible to the human eye.

More than just a diagnostic tool, BrainProbe can also track how the brain changes over
time.

“We hope this platform can be applied across different ethnic groups to enable more
accurate research,” Yang added.=

That is move to real objectivity in mental health diagnostic. Many security related vectors.

The UK govt has told the Alan Turing Institute “the UK’s AI capabilities was “critical” to national security and should be at the core of the Alan Turing Institute’s activities.”

@ lurker,

With regards the “Alan Turing Institute”(ATI), it’s very probably “money down the drain” already… and switching to a larger AI focus will almost certainly not produce any worthwhile benefits.

Let’s put it this way, if the stories I’ve been told have any real truth in them… Then a visit by Musk’s old DOGiE minions would probably improve things a lot.

The ATI have sort of been doing Current AI for most of the past decade,

“But can you remember anything they’ve done in that time?”

No me neither. But I’m not exactly surprised, it’s management at best gave been ineffective, and after a decade it’s still “slumming it” “cap in hand” in other organisations premises. Currently it’s got a back office or two hanging off the back of The British Library (that you might remember had a major ITCSec disaster not so long ago).

A little over a year ago a very large number of employees –a little under half– wrote what was a letter of serious complaint with legal implications. Put simply the leadership were accused of “non inclusive behaviour” that would have caused major issues if it got into a Tribunal or Court to do with employment issues. The Leadership response was to try to force “around a third of the employees into redundancy. And things carried on going down hill with what was very likely unlawful employment behaviours.

As for UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle’s letter of last Thusday (3rd of this month) all I can say is what the BBC has “reported” is not realy what the letter was realy all about as reported in several other places including,

<https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-government-ai-institute-prioritize-security-defense/>

In short for the letter was a demand for “action this day” calling for a further serious root and branch overhaul of the ATI and it’s direction. In effect calling for a significant refocusing of it’s work direction away from “health” and on to “defense” with basically a decapitation strike on the leadership team. In the letter to the chair of the ATI, the Minister apparently wrote that,

“[I]t remains clear that further action is needed to ensure the ATI meets its full potential”.

Which is a diplomatic way of saying “fall on your sword” or “we will publicly terminate with prejudice”. Or another way of saying “no cushy jobs, knighthoods, MBEs, OBEs or other honours for you lot.”

But… Not the coincidence of the letter to the “Orange One in Office” demanding that Europe spends 5% of GDP on military. With the unstated implication that Europe should give that 5% to the US Defence Industry.

The UK is in an awkward position of it’s own political making… With Brexit more or less destroying sone of the world leading Aero & Space technology companies and forcing them to be sold to European or US entities.

The UK Government hope is if it can “get in on the bottom floor of AI” then it can “get the elevator”… Well personally I see current AI LLM, LRM, and ML systems really are a pile of “slop draining into the basement” drowning all who actually did not get the elevator…

Let’s be blunt the current AI LLM, LRM and ML systems are about as close to useless as you can get for actually doing anything “Frontline Defence” related. Defence systems need to have “Fully Autonomous High Capability” whilst also being low weight and power and occupying little volume. Otherw...
