## Winner, Name that Ware September 2025

The Ware from September 2025 is a Hotronic AF 75 time base corrector. Really great comment thread, it was fun to read the sleuthing work and thought process behind the guesses. And yah, those SRAM chips make me nostalgic – I remember how expensive those were! Back when 32kiB cost real money.

A couple folks had guessed a time base corrector out of several possibilities, but I like how Guy Dunphy backed his guess up with an explanation of how it works. So, I’ll give Guy the prize this month. Congrats, drop me an email to collect your prize!
