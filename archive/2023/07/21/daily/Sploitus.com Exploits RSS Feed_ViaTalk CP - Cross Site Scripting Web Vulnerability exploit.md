Technical Details & Description:
================================
A non-persistent cross site web vulnerability has been discovered in the official viatalk control panel web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious script code in get method requests to compromise user
session data or to manipulate application contents for client-side requests.

The vulnerability is located in the folder parameter of the myvoiceemail module. The request method to inject is get
and the attack vector is non-persistent. The issue is a classic cross site scripting vulnerability.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent
external redirects to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /cp/

Vulnerable Function(s):
[+] myvoiceemail

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] folder

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
