# Description #

The Active eCommerce CMS 6.5.0 application has a vulnerability in the
profile picture upload feature that allows for stored cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of
"svg" image files, which can contain malicious code. An attacker can
exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted "svg" image
file as a profile picture, which will then be executed by the application
when the user views the profile. This can allow the attacker to steal
sensitive information, such as login credentials, or to perform other
malicious actions on the user's behalf. This vulnerability highlights the
importance of proper input validation and image file handling in web
application development.
