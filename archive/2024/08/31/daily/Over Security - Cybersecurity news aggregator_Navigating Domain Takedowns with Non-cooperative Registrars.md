Over the past couple blog articles, we have discussed how malicious domain takedowns remain a relevant cybersecurity tactic, particularly for midsize to large organizations, to minimize attack surface and protect customers. What is often misunderstood about this process and cybersecurity in general, is the critical importance of domain registrars to the security equation.

Domain registrars can play a significant role in safeguarding websites by providing various security features, assuming they are reputable. But there are also ‘bad’ registrars; ones that are not only harmful for a company’s website and its users, but also for their lack of compliance in handling takedown requests resulting in threats to other organizations. These registrars are often referred to as ‘bulletproof’ – hinting at the way they shield cybercriminals from takedowns.
