## *A Hacker‚Äôs Mind* News

[*A Hacker‚Äôs Mind*](https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/) will be published on Tuesday.

I have done a [written interview](https://ash.harvard.edu/hacking-can-harm-and-heal-democracy) and a [podcast interview](https://www.somethingyoushouldknow.net/843-understanding-the-hackers-mind-your-ever-shrinking-attention-span/) about the book. It‚Äôs been chosen as a ‚Äú[February 2023 Must-Read Book](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/next-big-idea-clubs-february-2023-nominees/38659/)‚Äù by the Next Big Idea Club. And an ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Pick‚Äù‚Äîwhatever that means‚Äîon Amazon.

There [have](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2023/01/a-hackers-mind-book-review.html) [been](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2022/11/kirkus-review-a-hackers-mind.html) [three](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2023/01/a-hackers-mind-book-review-2.html) reviews so far. I am hoping for more. And maybe even a published excerpt or two.

Amazon and others will start shipping the book on Tuesday. If you [ordered](https://www.schneier.com/product/a-hackers-mind-hardcover/) a signed copy from me, it is already in the mail.

If you can leave a review somewhere, I would appreciate it.

Great interview with Bruce on the Lawfare podcast.

<https://shows.acast.com/lawfare/episodes/the-hackers-mind>

‚ÄòA Hacker‚Äôs Mind‚Äô is a fun topic to explore and invites some pretty thought-provoking conversation. I‚Äôm going to have to ask someone with kids if kids really are natural hackers. I‚Äôm guessing people will have stories üòÑ

@ Ted,

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have to ask someone with kids if kids really are natural hackers.‚Äù

When young yes, very much so ask any parent a toddler has learnt to manipulate üòâ

But more seriously as far as I can tell realy only four things are required,

1, Curiosity.
2, Inteligence.
3, A form of associative memory.
4, Constructive creativity.

We learn by recognising then applying patterns and distilling out the essential basics that form the foundations. Over and above that we don‚Äôt realy know but there are a lot of observation based hypothesis out there that boil down to three basic higher intelligence models,

1, those that see in words.
2, those that see in graphs/pictures
3, those that see in equations.

Make of that what you will, but my personal observation is that an affinity for complex music both apriciation for the ten thumbed like myself and actual playing ability tends to go with higher order thinking needed for the likes of cryptography.

But there is still atleast ‚Äúelement X‚Äù the ability to see any system in a way that it‚Äôs 7F faults can be seen. Whilst some of it is definitely latent much of it is ‚Äútime served‚Äù learnd like the abiliry to handle complex objects be they musical instruments or machine tools and similar of ‚Äúgetting it wrong till you get it right‚Äù.

But also ‚Äúelement Y‚Äù which is kind of an eye for beauty, symmetry and elegance.

These two elements appear to be the mainstay of ‚Äúthinking hinky‚Äù along with a deep understanding of testing.

It has been said you learn nothing from a design that works, but everything from designs that fail and you get to work.

I‚Äôm a firm believer in people doing testing techniques, and I get them to show their abilities at testing rather than coding excercises and similar.

page 43: ‚ÄúThe second baseman and the third-base coach are allowed to try to read the catcher‚Äôs signs.‚Äù

I believe you meant ‚Äúthe runner on second‚Äù; the second baseman is on the catcher‚Äôs team, and has no need to read the signs.
