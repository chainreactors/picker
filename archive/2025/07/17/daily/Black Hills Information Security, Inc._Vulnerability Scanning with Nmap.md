Nmap, also known as Network Mapper, is a commonly used network scanning tool. As penetration testers, Nmap is a tool we use daily that is indispensable for verifying configurations and identifying potential vulnerabilities. With so many options and capabilities, it’s no surprise how many use cases there are for Nmap. Everything from general TCP and UDP port scanning, verifying running versions of software for a service, brute forcing commonly used credentials, and validating vulnerabilities found with other tools.

In this blog, we will cover basic vulnerability scanning with Nmap using built-in Nmap NSE scripts. This blog assumes you have some general knowledge of Nmap’s core functionality and NSE scripts. If you’re not Nmap savvy, I recommend checking out Serena DiPenti’s blog *Using Nmap Like a Pro* (https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/shenetworks-recommends-using-nmap-like-a-pro/) for a quick primer on basic Nmap functions and commonly used scripts.

## **NSE Script Categories**

First, a little about the NSE script categories. The Nmap scripting engine (NSE) has defined categories to group scripts with similar properties together. Scripts can belong to multiple categories based on their function. They are broken down into the following fourteen categories.

* auth
* broadcast
* brute
* default
* discovery
* dos
* exploit
* external
* fuzzer
* intrusive
* malware
* safe
* version
* vuln

For this blog, we will primarily focus on the default and vuln categories. Scripts included in the default category were chosen based on factors related to speed, usefulness, verbosity, reliability, and intrusiveness. If you’re curious about what scripts are included in a particular category, you can use the following command to view the scripts included in each category, with this command providing the scripts included in the vuln category.

```
nmap --script-help vuln
```

The output includes details for all scripts in that category, shown in the following screenshot. Each entry also includes the category memberships for each script. For example, the `afp-path-vuln` script is included in the exploit, intrusive, and vuln categories.

### **Nmap Default Scripts**

Using Nmap to find some of the low hanging fruit in an environment can be accomplished using the following command. We will be scanning a lab network using the subnet 192.168.56.0/24, comprised of vulnerable virtual machines for demonstration purposes.

```
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oA labscan-sC-sV-allports 192.168.56.0/24
```

Let’s break this command down, and then we’ll discuss the results. The command runs Nmap with the `-sC`, `-sV`, `-p-`, and `-oA` options. The following is a breakdown of the purpose of each option.

* `-sC`: Executes the “default” category scripts of the NSE. These scripts provide safe and useful checks for basic vulnerabilities, service metadata, SSL details, and default configurations.
* `-sV`: Enables service version detection. This helps determine the specific version of services running on open ports, which can be useful for identifying vulnerabilities tied to those versions. It also provides data that can be leveraged by other scripts during a scan.
* `-p-`: Scans all 65,535 TCP ports. This is a comprehensive port scan and can be replaced with `-p 1-65535` for the same effect; the diff...
