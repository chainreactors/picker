As enterprises continue to shift their operations to the browser, security teams face a growing set of cyber challenges. In fact, over 80% of security incidents now originate from web applications accessed via Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other browsers. One particularly fast-evolving adversary, Scattered Spider, has made it their mission to wreak havoc on enterprises by specifically targeting sensitive data on these browsers.

Scattered Spider, also referred to as UNC3944, Octo Tempest, or Muddled Libra, has matured over the past two years through precision targeting of human identity and browser environments. This shift differentiates them from other notorious cybergangs like Lazarus Group, Fancy Bear, and REvil. If sensitive information such as your calendar, credentials, or security tokens is alive and well in browser tabs, Scattered Spider is able to acquire them.

In this article, you'll learn details about Scattered Spider's attack methods and how you can stop them in their tracks. Overall, this is a wake-up call to CISOs everywhere to elevate the organization's browser security from an ancillary control to a central pillar of their defense.

## **Scattered Spider's Browser-Focused Attack Chain**

Scattered Spider avoids high-volume phishing in favor of precision exploitation. This is done by leveraging users' trust in their most used daily application, stealing saved credentials, and manipulating browser runtime.

* **Browser Tricks**: Techniques like Browser-in-the-Browser (BitB) overlays and auto-fill extraction are used to steal credentials while evading detection by traditional security tools like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR).
* **Session Token Theft**: Scattered Spider and other attackers will bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to capture tokens and personal cookies from the browser's memory.
* **Malicious Extensions & JavaScript Injection**: Malicious payloads get delivered through fake extensions and execute in-browser via drive-by techniques and other advanced methods.
* **Browser-Based Reconnaissance**: Web APIs and the probing of installed extensions allow these attackers to gain access map critical internal systems.

For a full technical breakdown of these tactics, see *[Scattered Spider Inside the Browser: Tracing Threads of Compromise.](https://seraphicsecurity.com/resources/blog/scattered-spider-inside-the-browser-tracing-threads-of-compromise/?utm_campaign=170407105-THN_Organic_Article_1&utm_source=THN&utm_medium=Organic_Article_1&utm_content=Seraphic_blog_scattered_spider)*

## **Strategic Browser-Layer Security: A Blueprint for CISOs**

To counteract Scattered Spider and other advanced browser threats, CISOs must utilize a multi-layered browser security strategy across the following domains.

### **1. Stop Credential Theft with Runtime Script Protection**

Phishing attacks have been around for decades. Attackers like Scattered Spider, however, have advanced their techniques tenfold in recent years. These advanced phishing campaigns are now relying on malicious JavaScript executions that are executed directly inside the browser, bypassing security tools like EDR. This is done to steal user credentials and other sensitive data. In order to successfully block phishing overlays and intercept dangerous patterns that steal credentials, organizations must implement JavaScript runtime protection to analyze behavior. By applying such protection, security leaders can stop attackers from gaining access and stealing credentials before it's too late.

### **2. Prevent Account Takeovers by Protecting Sessions**

Once user credentials get into the wrong hands, attackers like Scattered Spider will move quickly to hijack previously authenticated sessions by stealing cookies and tokens. Securing the integrity of browser sessions can best be achieved by restricting unauthorized scripts from gaining access or exfiltrating these sensitive artifacts. Organizations must enforce contextual security policies based on components such as device posture, identity verification, and network trust. By linking session tokens to context, enterprises can prevent attacks like account takeovers, even after credentials have become compromised.

### **3. Enforce Extension Governance and Block Rogue Scripts**

Browser extensions have become extremely popular in recent years, with Google Chrome featuring [130,000+](https://cropink.com/chrome-statistics) for download on the Chrome Web Store. While they can serve as productivity boosters, they have also become attack vectors. Malicious or poorly vetted extensions can request invasive permissions, inject malicious scripts into the browser, or act as the delivery system for attack payloads. Enterprises must enforce robust extension governance to allow pre-approved extensions with validated permissions. Equally important is the need to block untrusted scripts before they execute. This approach ensures that legitimate extensions remain available, so the user's workflow is not disrupted.

### **4. Disrupt Reconnaissance Without Breaking Legitimate Workflows**

Attackers like Scattered Spider will often begin attacks through in-browser reconnaissance. They do this by using APIs such as WebRTC, CORS, or fingerprinting to map the environment. This allows them to identify frequently used applications or track specific user behavior. To stop this reconnaissance, organizations must disable or replace sensitive APIs with decoys that deliver incorrect information t...
