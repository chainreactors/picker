This week, our news radar shows that every new tech idea comes with its own challenges. A hot AI tool is under close watch, law enforcement is shutting down online spots that help cybercriminals, and teams are busy fixing software bugs that could let attackers in. From better locks on our devices to stopping sneaky tricks online, simple steps are making a big difference.

Let's take a closer look at how these efforts are shaping a safer digital world.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**DeepSeek's Popularity Invites Scrutiny** ‚Äî The overnight popularity of DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence (AI) platform originating from China, has led to extensive scrutiny of its models, with several analyses [finding ways](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/italy-bans-chinese-deepseek-ai-over.html) to [jailbreak its system](https://lab.wallarm.com/jailbreaking-generative-ai/) and produce malicious or prohibited content. While jailbreaks and prompt injections are a persistent concern in mainstream AI products, the findings also show that the model lacks enough protections to prevent [potential abuse by malicious actors](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/google-over-57-nation-state-threat.html). The AI chatbot has also been targeted by what the company said were "large-scale malicious attacks," prompting it to temporarily limit user registrations. The service has since been banned in Italy over data protection concerns. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott has also [issued](https://apnews.com/article/texas-deepseek-apps-ban-3828a4743e9919398dfac0ba9d4a5c25) a ban on DeepSeek for government-issued devices.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Law Enforcement Operation Takes Down Illicit Cybercrime Services** ‚Äî A series of law enforcement operations have taken down various online marketplaces such as [Cracked, Nulled, Sellix, StarkRDP](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/authorities-seize-domains-of-popular.html), and [HeartSender](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/us-and-dutch-authorities-dismantle-39.html) that sold hack tools, illegal goods, and crimeware solutions. Millions of users are estimated to have been impacted, earning the threat actors hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal revenues.
* **Apple Fixed an Actively Exploited Zero-Day** ‚Äî Apple released software updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS to [address a zero-day vulnerability](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/apple-patches-actively-exploited-zero.html) (CVE-2025-24085) that it said has been exploited in the wild. The flaw is a use-after-free bug in the Core Media component that could permit a malicious application already installed on a device to elevate privileges. There are currently no details available on how it has been weaponized in real-word attacks, who may have been targeted, and the scale of the attacks.
* **New WhatsApp Spyware Campaign Targets 90 Individuals** ‚Äî Meta-owned WhatsApp disclosed it disrupted a campaign that involved the use of spyware owned by an Israeli company named Paragon Solutions to [target about 90 journalists and civil society members](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/meta-confirms-zero-click-whatsapp.html). The attack chain is said to be zero-click, meaning the deployment of the spyware occurs without requiring any user interaction. The company noted the targets were spread across over two dozen countries, including several in Europe. The development marks the first time Paragon, which claims to provide "ethically based tools" to "disrupt intractable threats," has been linked to spyware misuse.
* **Patched Mitel Flaw Exploited by Aquabot** ‚Äî A Mirai botnet variant dubbed [Aquabot](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/new-aquabot-botnet-exploits-cve-2024.html) is actively attempting to exploit a medium-severity security flaw impacting Mitel phones in order to ensnare them into a rogue network capable of mounting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The flaw (CVE-2024-41710), a command injection vulnerability that allows for arbitrary command execution within the context of the phone, was addressed by Mitel in July 2024.
* **UAC-0063 Uses Stolen Docs to Target Other Victims** ‚Äî A hacking group tracked as [UAC-0063](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/uac-0063-expands-cyber-attacks-to.html) has been linked to a series of attacks that involve the use of documents stolen from one victim as lures to target others and infect them with a known loader malware called HATVIBE. The attacks have also involved the deployment of a newly discovered USB data exfiltrator codenamed PyPlunderPlug in at least one incident targeting a German company in mid-January 2023.
