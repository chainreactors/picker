**Looking to get into physical security? Not sure what you need to get started? Look no further.**

## What are Physical Security Assessments?

Physical security assessments evaluate an organization’s physical security measures to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities that could compromise the safety and security of its people, assets, and facilities. The assessment typically involves a combination of physical inspections, bypasses/lockpicking, tailgating, and access control abuse to name a few. This assists in assessing the effectiveness of existing security measures and identifying areas for improvement.

This is a basic list of tools, where to get them, and videos on how to use them. (Access controls and badge cloning aren’t included, but there may be a Part 2 in the future.)

## Environmental Considerations

Awareness of your environment is crucial. Being aware of your environment could be the key to you not needing a key.

TLDR; Just look at it!

### Sebaceous Oils

Let’s begin with a common bypass that is seen with keypads all over the world. Sebaceous oils. Sebaceous oils are simply oils from your fingers that could cause discoloration on a keypad. Anyone could use this to guess the correct combination. Below is an example. Can you guess the combination?

Congrats! You probably guessed correctly.

### I’m Snow Excited!

Another use case Is simply looking around your environment for a way In. Here Is an interesting edge case where the snowbank was high enough to clear a barbed wire fence.

This doesn’t apply to just snow. It could be new construction with dirt or even pallets that are high off the ground.

## Lock Bypasses

Why lock bypasses? It’s fast and usually easy. Low complexity and high impact is always valuable for a client. You don’t need to be a rocket surgeon to use these simple tools.

### Traveler Hook

This can be purchased from [MBUSA](https://mbausa.com/shrum-tool/) for $3.99. Also known as a shrum tool, this tool Is capable of bypassing dead latched locks. These locks are almost everywhere.

Often, the deadlatch plunger is [not set properly](https://www.go-rbcs.com/articles/the-deadlocking-plunger-weakness). If not set properly, an attacker could simply insert the traveler hook in the door gap and push the locking mechanism in, opening the door in a matter of seconds. Check out this video from our friends at [Covert Instruments](https://covertinstruments.com/).

### Knife Bypass

A knife bypass tool is another simple bypass that could be used on certain padlocks. It’s as simple as sticking the bypass tool into the lock, bypassing the locking mechanism. You can also use this tool to decode combination locks and file cabinets. This tool can be found at [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/products/sparrows-shank) for $14.95.

### Wafer Key Bypass

Warded locks, often located outside of a facility to secure power generators and other valuable assets, can be picked with a wafer key. This product can be purchased from [LockPickWorld](https://www.lockpickworld.com/products/warded-lock-picks) for 18.99.

### Double Door Tool

The double door tool allows an attacker to engage push bars located on double doors from the outside. You can purchase the DDT from [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/products/ddt) for $16.00.

### Thumb Turn Tool

Otherwise known as a J-Tool, this tool can fit in between door gaps and twist the handle that twists the bypass mechanism, allowing an attacker to open the door from the outside simply by turning the knob. This tool can be purchased at [Covert Instruments.](https://covertinstruments.com/collections/bypass-tools/products/j-tool)

### Under Door Tool

One of the oldest bypass tools, an under door tool can be leveraged by placing it under a door, rotating the hook, and pulling the door lever down. This tool can be purchased at [Sparrows](https://www.sparrowslockpicks.ca/produ...
