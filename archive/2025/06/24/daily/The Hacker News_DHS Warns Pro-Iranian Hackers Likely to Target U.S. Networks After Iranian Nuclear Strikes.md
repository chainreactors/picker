[![Pro-Iranian Hackers](data:image/png;base64... "Pro-Iranian Hackers")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjX95e2Q5m0BEh8axXtneCEbnZORGcEWa9-R7mZCDrIgL3dMX0sPgdo2zwrLLM3BZOtcHl-RvoRzoERw7ie41-RLrwsUQA6qhbwRtHUNP6uS5jHSog7vocIVnKiDGCIwIJsZBHk9cZNtUig3rMykaP-yj7Ra0TgcQCGxA5MSAvP018jUiE78A4H4dYhdOSr/s790-rw-e365/cyberwar.jpg)

The United States government has warned of cyber attacks mounted by pro-Iranian groups after it launched airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites as part of the Iran–Israel war that commenced on June 13, 2025.

Stating that the ongoing conflict has created a "heightened threat environment" in the country, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a bulletin that cyber actors are likely to target U.S. networks.

"Low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against U.S. networks," the DHS [said](https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-22-2025).

"Both hacktivists and Iranian government-affiliated actors routinely target poorly secured U.S. networks and Internet-connected devices for disruptive cyber attacks."

The development comes after U.S. President Donald Trump [announced](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9r4q99g4o) that the U.S. military had conducted a [bombing attack](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1936572896492797987) on three Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump described the strikes as a "spectacular military success" and warned of "far greater" attacks if Tehran does not make peace.

The Iran-Israel war of 2025 has [triggered](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/irans-state-tv-hijacked-mid-broadcast.html) a maelstrom in cyberspace, what with hacktivist groups aligned with the two nations targeting the other.

In response to the U.S. military strikes, a pro-Iranian group named Team 313 [claimed](https://x.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1936622894836040099) it took down Trump's Truth Social platform in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
