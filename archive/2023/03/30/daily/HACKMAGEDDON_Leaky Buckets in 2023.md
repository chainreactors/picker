Similarly to what I have done in [2022](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/02/21/leaky-buckets-in-2022/) and [2021](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/01/leaky-buckets-a-list-of-cloud-misconfigurations/), I am now collecting the incidents due to [cloud misconfigurations](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/01/leaky-buckets-a-list-of-cloud-misconfigurations/) and leading to the exposure of data. Unfortunately despite the growing risks and awareness this trend does not seem to slow down.

During both 2022 and 2021, AWS S3 accounted for roughly 60% of breaches. Let’s see if it will retain its leadership in this particular chart even in 2022. So far it looks like things are not going to change…
