Picture this: It's 4 a.m. A security analyst jolts awake to a ping on their phone. Another alert. Another potential threat. Another disrupted night of tackling manual processes and painstaking investigations. Another day, another strong pot of coffee.

This scene, unfortunately, is all too common in today's cybersecurity landscape. But, there is a way to transform fire drills into smooth, automated processes. Security teams can spend less time chasing false positives and more time strategizing against real threats. See how three of our customers across various industries and regions are leveraging Cortex XSOAR. They transform their security operations from a constant state of firefighting into a strategic tool that anticipates and neutralizes threats *before* they escalate.

# Unifying Security Operations with Cortex XSOAR

[Cortex XSOAR](/cortex/cortex-xsoar) simplifies security operations by unifying automation, case management, real-time collaboration and threat intelligence management. This integrated approach allows security teams to manage alerts across all sources, standardize processes with playbooks, take action on threat intelligence, and automate response for virtually any use case.

## Customer Story #1 — BCA: Standardizing Security Response and Boosting Efficiency

[PT Bank Central Asia Tbk (BCA)](/customers/transforming-the-soc-for-bank-central-asia), Indonesia's largest lender by market value, faced significant challenges with multiple security tools and manual processes. Like many large organizations, BCA's security team was grappling with a multitude of security tools, each with its own set of guidelines and configurations. This fragmented approach led to inefficiencies, increased the potential for human error, and hindered the team's ability to respond quickly to threats. Hans Christianto, AVP of IT Security at BCA, explained their predicament:

"We did not have a standardized method for security response, as we had multiple tools from various brands. We needed to integrate these numerous solutions and use automation to achieve our goal of faster detection and response capabilities."

By deploying XSOAR, BCA achieved significant improvements across multiple areas:

* Automated 30,000 out of 740,000 security tickets handled in 2023, reducing the manual workload for the SOC team.
* Developed and deployed 85 custom playbooks, streamlining security processes and enhancing operational efficiency.
* Decreased incident response times by replacing limited Java-based scripts with comprehensive war room capabilities, improving both mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR).

BCA's implementation aligned with best practices for security automation:

* **Starting Simple** **–** BCA began by focusing on integrating their existing security tools and automating repetitive tasks. This approach allowed them to achieve quick wins and demonstrate the value of automation to their organization.
* **Gradual Implementation –** Following the "crawl-walk-run" approach, BCA steadily expanded their use of XSOAR, developing and customizing playbooks to suit their stakeholders’ specific needs.
* **Leveraging Prebuilt Content** **–** BCA took advantage of XSOAR's extensive library of prebuilt integrations and playbooks, which helped accelerate their automation journey.
* **Standardizing Processes** **–** Created consistent, repeatable workflows for incident response, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

Lily Wongso, EVP of IT Security at BCA, highlighted the platform's comprehensive capabilities: "Cortex XSOAR marries threat intelligence with SOAR, providing us with extensive threat intelligence capabilities and complete control over threat data management."

## Customer Story #2 — State of North Dakota: Automation Helps Staff Scale

[The State of North Dakota Information Technology (NDIT)](/customers/north-dakota-it-safeguards-citizens-with-ai-driven-secops) faced the monumental task of scaling security from 20,000 endpoints to 250,000 while maintaining their current staffing levels and budget. They also needed to unify over 600 state entities, each with its own siloed security tooling and unique processes. Their objectives were clear and without automation, seemingly impossible to achieve.

By implementing Cortex XSOAR, NDIT achieved remarkable results:

* 57% reduction in false positives for phishing incidents, leading to 21,000 fewer incidents a year.
* Automated 60% of total incidents with the help of 196 playbooks.
* Achieved operational efficiencies equivalent to 8-10 SOC analysts.

These impressive outcomes were the result of a well-planned, strategic approach to implementing Cortex XSOAR. Let's delve into the key elements of NDIT's implementation strategy that drove their success:

**Starting with Core Integrations**: NDIT began by integrating XSOAR with their most critical security tools. This allowed them to immediately address the challenge of unifying the disparate security systems across state entities.

**Scalable Automation**: To meet their ambitious scaling goals, NDIT focused on creating scalable automation workflows. They started with high-volume, low-complexity tasks to quickly demonstrate the value of automation.

**Leveraging Threat Intelligence**: NDIT took advantage of XSOAR's threat intelligence capabilities to enhance their detection and response times, contributing to their dramatic improvement in identifying true positives.

**Standardizing Across Entities**: With XSOAR, NDIT created standardized playbooks that could be applied statewide. This not only improved efficiency but also ensured consistent security practices across all entities.

These strategic implementations allowed NDIT to efficiently manage their expanded security responsibilities, showcasing the power of automation in improving large-scale security operations.

> We had a vision to build, manage and maintain the best state cyber operations center in the United States. Working with Palo Alto Networks, we’ve been able to bring that forward.

## Customer Story #3 – Playtika: Transforming Incident Response and Resource Allocation

[Playtika](/customers/playtika-manages-security-with-fewer-resources-using-palo-alto-networks-cortex-xsoar), a leading global gaming company, struggled with limited visibility and delayed incident response times. Liran Sheinbox, Head of Cyber Security at Playtika, described their goal: "We wanted a consistent, holistic approach to cybersecurity, using modern technologies, like AI and automation to efficiently safeguard the organization."

To achieve this vision, Playtika implemented a similar approach with Cortex XSOAR:

**Focused Use Case Implementation** **–** Playtika began their XSOAR journey by targeting their most pressing challenge: phishing responses. This allowed them to quickly demonstrate value and gain buy-in for further automation initiatives.

**Gradual Expansion of Automation** **–** Following initial successes, Playtika steadily expanded their use of XSOAR. This measured approach allowed them to refine their processes and adapt to the new workflow.

**Customizing for Gaming-Specific Needs** **–** Playtika leveraged XSOAR's flexibility to create custom playbooks tailored to the unique security challenges of the gaming industry, inte...
