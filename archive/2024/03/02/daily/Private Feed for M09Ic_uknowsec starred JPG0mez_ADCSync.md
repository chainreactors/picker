# ADCSsync

This is a tool I whipped up together quickly to DCSync utilizing ESC1. It is quite slow but otherwise an effective means of performing a makeshift DCSync attack without utilizing [DRSUAPI](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/credentials/dumping/dcsync) or [Volume Shadow Copy](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows-hardening/stealing-credentials#volume-shadow-copy).

This is the first version of the tool and essentially just automates the process of running Certipy against every user in a domain. It still needs a lot of work and I plan on adding more features in the future for authentication methods and automating the process of finding a vulnerable template.

```
python3 adcsync.py -u clu -p theperfectsystem -ca THEGRID-KFLYNN-DC-CA -template SmartCard -target-ip 192.168.0.98 -dc-ip 192.168.0.98 -f users.json -o ntlm_dump.txt
