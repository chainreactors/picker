Release Notes: SDK Integration, Notifications, 1,000+ Detection Rules, and APT Reports

April was another busy month for the [ANY.RUN](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_apr_25&utm_term=300425&utm_content=linktolanding) team!
We continued improving our malware detection capabilities, expanded our behavior signatures, and sharpened threat intelligence, all to make your investigations faster, deeper, and even more precise.

From adding fresh [Suricata rules](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/detection-with-suricata-ids/) and [YARA signatures](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/yara-rules-explained/) to detecting new malware behaviors, here’s what’s new at ANY.RUN this month.

Let’s dive in!

## Product Updates

### Integration of ANY.RUN Services with Your Security Systems via SDK

In April, we’ve announced the release of the [ANY.RUN SDK](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/sdk-integration/), making it easier than ever to integrate our products directly into your infrastructure.

Security teams can now automate submissions, accelerate workflows, and tailor ANY.RUN’s solutions to fit their existing systems like SIEM, SOAR, or XDR.
This gives them faster investigations, fewer manual tasks, and more resources freed up for critical analysis.

By integrating ANY.RUN’s products into the security infrastructure via SDK, you can:

* Automatically submit files and URLs to the [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-use-interactivity-in-a-malware-sandbox/)

* Search IOCs, IOBs, and IOAs across our threat database via [TI Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/)

* Receive and process network-based IOCs with [TI Feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-feeds-integration/)

The SDK is available for users with the [**Hunter**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/subscriptions-hunter-plan/) and [**Enterprise**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/anyrun-enterprise-plan/) plans.

With the help of this simple integration, we want to make sure that organizations reduce incident response time, improve detection rates, and build a stronger, more resilient security posture.

**How to get started:** The SDK is Python-based and includes documentation, libraries, and ready-to-use code samples. Find full instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/anyrun/anyrun-python-sdk) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anyrun-sdk/).

Contributions and suggestions from other developers are also welcome! For more info on how to contribute, see [our guide](https://github.com/anyrun/anyrun-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Stay Informed with the New Notifications Window

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-17-1024x565.png)

ANY.RUN users will now have access to Notifications directly from the platform interface.

This section is built to keep you informed about the most important updates without cluttering your workflow.

With quick access to key information, your security team can easily stay on top of new capabilities, detection improvements, and emerging threats.

Notifications are short, clear, and actionable, so you can stay focused on your investigations while staying in the loop.

Inside the Notifications section, you’ll find:

* Key product updates and new feature announcements

* Alerts about critical service improvements

* Links to major research reports and threat analyses

* Important security advisories from our team

## Threat Coverage Updates

In April, we expanded our detection coverage across Android, Windows, and Linux environments with updated rules, behavior signatures, and threat intellige...
