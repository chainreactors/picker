## Hearing on the Federal Government and AI

On Thursday I testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at a hearing titled “[The Federal Government in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/the-federal-government-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/).”

The other speakers mostly talked about how cool AI was—and sometimes about how cool their own company was—but I was asked by the Democrats to specifically talk about DOGE and the risks of exfiltrating our data from government agencies and feeding it into AIs.

My written testimony is [here](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Schneier-Written-Testimony.pdf). Video of the hearing is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKkk-uWi7HM).

If I were a nation state adversary I might concentrate my initial kinetic attacks first against the cable distribution points, then against the data centres, worldwide. No cloud, no AI, could be a significant short to medium term disability to business and govt. No data to steal.

Will an HKS Fellow pointing out DOGE activities prompt more government attacks against Harvard University?

I wouldn’t be worrying about data that government has gathered on me being used by AI or private businesses. The main worry over people’s data is that government has it in the first place. Government has far more ability to cause damage to individuals based on that data.

Now, that we just learned about OpenAI storing all prompts and all results, in order to comply with a court order, I think the risk of information leaks should be apparent to everyone.

It’s cool guys. AI will just hallucinate Buttle instead of Tuttle.

@ Bruce,

When you say,

> “I was asked by the Democrats to specifically talk about DOGE and the risks of exfiltrating our data from government agencies and feeding it into AIs.”

Begs the question,

“Is there a smell of burning bridges lingering on the hill?”

Mind you from what has been reported in the MSM just recently Manbaby Hellon Rusk and the Mufina Don the Marmalade Doughnut are not seeing eye to eye any longer…

Also I understand that DOGiE has already cost more than it claimed incorrectly it was saving…

Then there is that “Friends of Russia” incident that has still not been answered…

Of course the question that some may ask is did Hellon get his money back and how much Marmalade is going to get spiteful.

There are stories circulating that NASA did not get a new leader, because of the split, others blame “some immigrant nobodies ever heard of” because he did not get his ring kissed…

All that aside, people do need to stand up and say the expectations stirred up as part of the hype of current AI LLM and ML systems is not going to be delivered by them and that frankly they are very very expensive auto-complete systems that based on probability actually “lower the tone” even when not outputting falsehoods.

And that’s before we talk about how they can oh so simply be used for fraud and other unlawful acts.

As for Corporations getting their hands on the data… I’ve been warning about the likes of Palantir here for quite some time now. They are amalgamating data not just from the US but other nations including the UK. Their aim is to replace human “investigators and analysts” with their computer systems, apparently so far this has not been a success. But as part of the process they got Police and similar to type in a lot of raw data into Palantir’s systems. This data after a little massage and repackaging is being sold to anyone “with a fist full of dollars” without any real checking…

But the AI business plan of Meta and Microsoft and I assume Alphabet as well is as a surveillance tool to gather as much “Personal and Private Information” from people as possible.

I’ve called it the “BE Plan” for,

“Bedazzle, Beguile, Bewitch, Befriend, and BETRAY”’

Because this just shows the steps which are already in full progress and as a result,

“All your privacy will be striped bare”

And endlessly be sold over and over, passing from hand to hand each making their percentage on you.

That’s “the Future in the US” and every where else if the big Silicon Valley Corps can lobby and get the legislation they want…

@**Clive**: That’s “the Future in the US” and every where else if the big Silicon Valley Corps can lobby and get the legislation they want…

Given the gross incompetence (almost typed “*incontinence*” there and now that I think of it, that’d probably fit as well) of the Silly Valley Bros as seen by the DOG (sic) fiasco, I’m not sure that we have all that many worries.

Most of those clowns got in early and got lucky once and are now convinced they’re geniuses when they’re really walking, talking examplars of the Dunning-Kruger Effect with the ability to custom order hats and tee shirts.

Mad DOGE and South Africans, out in the noonday sun. . .

To spend years constructing an artificial intelligence platform long before the market understood its value or potential applications was repeatedly derided.
Many were skeptical, if not outright hostile. Early investors were skittish; their commitment was often fleeting, at best.
Our results are not and will never be th...
