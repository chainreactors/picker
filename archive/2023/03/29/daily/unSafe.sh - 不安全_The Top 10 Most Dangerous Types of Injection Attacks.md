When it comes to protecting your website from bad actors, there’s one threat you should be aware of: **injection attacks**. These attacks target weaknesses in your website’s security and are unfortunately quite common. In fact, the well-known organization [OWASP](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp_top_10_2021_edition/) ranks injection attacks as the [third most significant risk to web application security](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

Simply put, injection attacks happen when hackers find a way to sneak harmful data or commands into your website’s code. This can be done in various ways, but the main idea is that the attacker takes advantage of unverified information provided by users (like logging into your site or filling out a form) to cause damage.

The type of damage incurred to your environment depends on the attacker’s goals and the vulnerability they exploit. Bad actors might try to access your website’s database, interfere with how your site functions, bypass security measures, or even take complete control of your website. The consequences of a successful injection attack can be severe, ranging from data breaches (theft) to rendering your site unusable.

So, as a website owner, it’s essential to be aware of injection attacks and take steps to prevent them from happening to your site.

Let’s take a look at the top ten most dangerous injection attacks.

1. **[Cross-site scripting](#cross-site-scripting)**
2. **[SQL injection](#sqli)**
3. **[Remote code execution](#rce)**
4. **[Host header injection](#host-header-injection)**
5. **[LDAP injection](#ldap)**
6. **[XXE injection](#xxe)**
7. **[Server-side template injection (SSTI)](#ssti)**
8. **[CRLF injection](#crlf)**
9. **[Mail command](#mail-command)**
10. [**NoSQL injection attacks**](#nosqli)

## Cross-site scripting

When a website or app takes information from a user and includes it in the content it displays without checking or altering it, it can create an opening for cybercriminals to sneak harmful code into the site. This type of attack, known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allows hackers to insert malicious scripts into trustworthy websites, which then gets passed along to other users.

The problem is that the victims’ web browsers don’t know that the harmful script shouldn’t be trusted, so they run it as if it were a normal part of the website. This can let the malicious script access personal information stored by the browser, such as login details or cookies. If the script is cleverly designed, it might even change the content of the website itself.

XSS attacks generally fall into two main categories: stored and reflected.

In **stored XSS** attacks, the harmful script gets saved on the target website — for example, in a forum post, database, or visitor log. Victims encounter the script when their browsers request the affected content from the site. In **reflected XSS** attacks, the malicious script bounces back as part of a response that includes the victim’s input, such as an error message or search result.

## SQL injection

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language used to communicate with databases to perform various actions, such as retrieving, deleting, and saving data. Unfortunately, attackers can exploit this language to gain unauthorized access to your data through SQL injection (SQLi) attacks. These attacks typically occur when a hacker manipulates the SQL query in a web application by entering malicious code into web form input fields, comment sections, or other areas accessible to users.

When an attacker successfully manipulates an SQL query, they can exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication and authorization procedures of a web application. If successful, the SQL database will execute the malicious commands injected by the attacker. Depending on the type of SQL injection, the attacker can read, modify, add, or delete data from the database, potentially causing significant damage to your website and its users.

To execute an SQL injection attack, the hacker inserts an SQL script into a text input field, which is then sent to the web application. The application, unaware of the malicious nature of the script, executes it directly on the database. This can lead to a range of negative outcomes, such as allowing the attacker to bypass login screens, access sensitive data, modify or destroy database information, or even perform administrative operations on the database.

## Remote code execution

Remote code execution (RCE), also known as code injection vulnerability, occurs when attackers manage to input their own application code into your website, causing the server to execute it. For instance, if your website is built using PHP, hackers can inject malicious PHP code that will be executed by the PHP interpreter on your web server.

Common methods of RCE include:

1. **Code Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code into a website or application through input fields, query parameters, or other user-supplied data points. This code is then executed by the server, leading to RCE.
2. **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** If a website allows users to upload files without proper validation, an attacker can upload a malicious script disguised as an image or other file format. Once uploaded, the attacker can execute the script to perform RCE.
3. **Third-party Software Vulnerabilities:** Websites often utilize third-party plugins, themes, or other software components. If these components are not regularly updated or have known security flaws, attackers can exploit them to achieve RCE.
4. **Server Misconfigurations:** Poorly configured servers can allow attackers to exploit security weaknesses, such as weak file permissions or exposed management interfaces, to gain unauthorized access and execute code remotely.

A host header injection is a type of web application attack that involves adding or modifying the Host header in an HTTP request in order to trick the web server into processing the request in a way that is not intended.

The host header is a mandatory field in an HTTP request that specifies the domain name or IP address of the server that the client is communicating with. It is used by the server to determine which virtual host or website the client is requesting.

In a host header injection attack, an attacker manipulates the host header to point to a different domain than the one originally intended. This can allow the attacker to:

* Bypass security controls that rely on the domain name in the Host header
* Conduct phishing attacks by making the victim believe they are interacting with a legitimate website
* Exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or application by manipulating the Host header to trigger unexpected behavior

## LDAP injection

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol designed to enable the search for resources (files, devices, or users) within a network. It is highly beneficial for intranets and, when incorporated into a single sign-on system, can store usernames and passwords. LDAP queries utilize special control characters that influence its functionality. Attackers may alter the intended behavior of an LDAP query if they can insert control characters into it.

LDAP is a protocol used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It is commonly used for authentication, authorization, and accou...
