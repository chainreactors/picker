# PartnerLeak scam site promises victims full access to “cheating” partner’s stolen data

Posted: September 12, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Earlier this week, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/your-partner-is-cheating-on-you-scam-asks-you-to-pay-to-see-proof) on a new type of scam that tells you your partner is cheating on you. However, we hit a dead end because we were unable to get hold of an original copy of the email.

That was until the scammers were “kind enough” to send one to one of our co-workers.

![your partner is cheating on you and we have proof](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/mail_redacted.png)

your partner is cheating on you and we have proof

> “Hi (target’s name],
>
> [Partner’s name] is cheating on you. Here is proof.
>
> As a company engaged in cyber security we’ve found information related to [partner’s name] that might interest you.
>
> We made a full backup of [his/her] disk. (We have all [his/her] address book, social media, history of viewing sites, dating apps, all files, phone numbers, and addresses of all [his/her] contacts) and are willing to give you a full access to this data. For more details visit our website.”

With this, we were able to investigate the scammers’ intentions.

All three of the links in the email (Here, website, and Check now) point to the same website. Through a landing page located at click[.]cardfoolops[.]com visitors are redirected to partnerleak[.]com.

The partnerleak[.]com domain was registered on August 1, 2024, with NameCheap anonymously. Anonymous registration doesn’t automatically mean the person registering is up to no good, but it did block us from researching this avenue any further.

The registration date, however, matches with the first complaints we started seeing about these emails.

During the redirection process, your email address is passed on, which means when you register at the site your email address is already filled out.

The PartnerLeak site itself says it offers anonymity, as well as “crucial insights” into the behaviour of the one you love.

> “completely anonymous service leverages [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) and the vulnerabilities of popular smartphones to provide crucial insights into your partner’s behavior.”
