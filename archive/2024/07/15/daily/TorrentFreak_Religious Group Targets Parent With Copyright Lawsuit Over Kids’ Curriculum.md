Alarmed at what they describe as "psychologically damaging" religious instruction, received by school children from LifeWise, an organization providing off-site teaching in the United States, a group of parents decided to take action. As part of their mission to raise awareness, Parents Against LifeWise recently obtained LifeWise's curriculum and published it on the group's website. LifeWise responded with a potentially crushing copyright infringement lawsuit.

[![pala-logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pala-logo.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pala-logo.png)Under a concept known as Released Time for Religious Instruction (RTRI), children in the United States are permitted to leave school to receive religious instruction elsewhere.

Whether an hour a day or once per week, the fact that young students are taken off-site is a component of the law.

Use of the tax-supported public school system, to finance and help spread whatever beliefs various groups may have, is disallowed under the First Amendment. To remain constitutional, RTRI takes place away from public school premises, with school teachers and authorities’ involvement limited to releasing children for instruction.

The current controversy stems from the nature of the ‘religious instruction’ children receive when not being supervised by their school or their parents. In this matter, rapidly expanding religious group LifeWise provides the instruction. However, a quest by local parents, to raise public awareness of the nature of that instruction, has led to one of their group in Indiana being sued by LifeWise for copyright infringement.

## Copyright Complaint, Religious Controversy

Filed in the Northern District of Indiana (Fort Wayne Division) on July 2, 2024, plaintiff LifeWise Inc. of Indiana describes itself as a “privately funded Christian non-profit” that provides “religious instruction in traditional, character-based, Biblical teaching.” Such instruction is only provided to children after permission has been obtained from their parents and, in line with the law, instruction only takes place away from school premises, LifeWise notes.

On the website of [Parents Against LifeWise](https://parentsagainstlifewise.online/), an opposition group formed to raise awareness of LifeWise and its alleged practices, the religious group is described in somewhat different terms. We’ll touch on the more serious allegations later on.

“The business model consists of a motivational ‘character-based’ school assembly where religion is hinted at but never fully addressed, followed by the invitation to join them again ‘after school’ for a more ‘gospel-centric outreach concert’. Sometimes these are held off school property at a local church but often they are held in the same place the assembly was during the school day,” the [statement reads](https://parentsagainstlifewise.online/about/#about-lw).

The basis for the lawsuit, which targets Parents Against LifeWise member Zachary Parrish, is relatively straightforward. The organization’s religious instruction program, marketed as LifeWise Academy, has a curriculum which outlines the religious instruction children receive.

In the belief that the curriculum contains information supportive of the group’s cause and in the wider public interest, it’s alleged that Parrish set out to obtain a copy. The curriculum later appeared on the Parents Against LifeWise website and on Facebook; that attracted the negative attention of LifeWise and allegations of copyright infringement. In the complaint, how the curriculum was allegedly obtained is painted as a serious matter too.

## Obtaining the Curriculum

“Upon Information and belief, Mr. Parrish used unauthorized means to obtain the password-protected LifeWise Curriculum only accessible by paid employees of LifeWise who have been issued login credentials,” the allegations begin.

“Defendant Zachary Parrish posed as a LifeWise volunteer to gain access to internal LifeWise documents. Mr. Parrish published internal LifeWise documents and the entire copyrighted LifeWise Curriculum on his website [Parents Against LifeWise]. LifeWise tried multiple times to reason with Mr. Parrish to remove the LifeWise Curriculum from his Website. But Mr. Parrish refused,” the complaint notes.

At the time of writing, items from the curriculum are plainly visible in search engine results. A cursory test suggests that access to at least some of those files requires no credentials. Whether these are official uploads is unclear but even in a limited way, files are available to the public.

The LifeWise complaint puts forward its own theory to explain what motivated Parrish to obtain the curriculum. Noting that the Parents Against LifeWise Facebook group has already attracted around 2,500 members since it was created September 1, 2023, LifeWise is of the belief that “Mr. Parrish does not support LifeWise’s mission.”

“[H]is goal was to gather information and internal documents with the hope of publishing information online which might harm LifeWise’s reputation and galvanize parents to oppose local LifeWise Academy chapters in their communities,” the religious group claims.

“[A]fter submitting his fraudulent volunteer application, Mr. Parrish improperly gained access to LifeWise’s information storage systems, downloaded internal LifeWise documents, and posted them to his Website. He also improperly obtained and posted a digital copy of the entire LifeWise Curriculum.”

## Complaint: Parrish Was Motivated By His Opposition

The complaint makes no mention of why any of the documents, whether allegedly sought or obtained, might have the potential to harm LifeWise’s reputation. Likewise, there’s nothing to explain how a curriculum may have the potential to “galvanize parents” against LifeWise Academy providing religious instruction to local children.

In its complaint the plaintiff makes clear that Parrish is considered an opponent who strongly objects to LifeWise’s mission. The Parents Against LifeWise website leaves no doubt that the conclusion drawn by LifeWise is 100% accurate. The opposition group [claims that LifeWise Academy](https://parentsagainstlifewise.online/) “is spreading Evangelical Christianity, Purity Culture, Christian Nationalism, homophobic beliefs, transphobia, and hateful rhetoric to the youngest of our children.”

The veracity of these claims plays no part in the copyright lawsuit, but they do serve to underline the only aspect of this matter upon which both the plaintiff and defendant agree; Parrish strongly opposes LifeWise’s mission to reach “every unchurched child in America.” To that background, LifeWise’s complaint alleges that Parrish’s “exploitation of the Registered Copyrighted Works” was willful and in disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.

At this point there appears to be a shift in direction. LifeWise says that on information and belief (something it has been ...
