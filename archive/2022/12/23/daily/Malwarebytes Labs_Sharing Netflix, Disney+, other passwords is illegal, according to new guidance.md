# Sharing Netflix, Disney+, other passwords is illegal, according to new guidance

Posted: December 22, 2022
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

The [Intellectual Property Office (IPO)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office), the UK government body overseeing intellectual property rights in the UK, has quietly released [new guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meta-counterfeit-and-piracy-campaign) on [piracy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meta-counterfeit-and-piracy-campaign/the-effect-of-piracy) and online [counterfeit goods](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meta-counterfeit-and-piracy-campaign/the-effect-of-counterfeit-goods). This campaign is a joint effort between IPO and Meta, Facebook’s parent company.

The general issue on piracy is about the use of [illegal streaming boxes](https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/tv-streamers/article/kodi-boxes-everything-you-need-to-know-aFF265I905eN) and apps and how these not only expose children to age-inappropriate content due to lack of [parental control](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/parental-control) but also risk putting sensitive [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) in the hands of [hackers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) and digital thieves. What’s noteworthy—[as TorrentFreak pointed out](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-govt-netflix-password-sharing-is-illegal-potentially-criminal-fraud-221219/)—is that the UK now flags **password sharing**, a most talked-about issue in the realm of streaming services, as piracy. Therefore, it is illegal and a potential crime.

When TorrentFreak reached out to the IPO for clarification, it was told: “There are a range of provisions in criminal and civil law which may be applicable in the case of password sharing where the intent is to allow a user to access copyright-protected works without payment.”

“These provisions may include breach of contractual terms, fraud or secondary copyright infringement depending on the circumstances.”

Under Section 11 of [the Fraud Act of 2006](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/fraud-act-2006) in the UK, someone using “services of a members’ club without paying and without being a member” is considered fraud.

It’s unlikely that streaming services are going to start dragging password-sharing subscribers and moochers (those who borrow subscriber credentials) to court, but the guidance could serve as (1) a deterrent for people who’re thinking about sharing their subscriber credentials and (2) a good conversation starter between the subscriber and the relative or friend who doesn’t live with them but shared their credentials with them.

## A lose-lose situation

Regardless of how the UK public takes the IPO’s new guidance, the fact remains that sharing one’s streaming service credentials with others is risky, security- and privacy-wise, for subscribers and usually yields negative results for the service provider. That said, these providers could lose money and will continue to as long as they let this behavior go on. According to [survey findings](https://www.bey...
