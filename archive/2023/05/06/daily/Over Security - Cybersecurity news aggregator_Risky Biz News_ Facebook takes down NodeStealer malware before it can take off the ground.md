Meta's security team has disrupted the operations of a newly launched malware family named NodeStealer.

The company says it caught the malware shortly after it launched and, through cooperation with domain registrars and hosting providers, took down all of its web infrastructure.

Meta says the malware launched in late January, and following its efforts, they have not seen any new NodeStealer samples since February 27.

In a [technical write-up](https://engineering.fb.com/2023/05/03/security/malware-nodestealer-ducktail/), Meta says the malware was designed to infect Windows systems, install a modified version of the Node.js JavaScript runtime, and then extract credentials and authentication/session cookies from a victim's local browser.

The malware specifically targeted user credentials for Facebook, Gmail, and Outlook. In the case of Facebook, Meta says the NodeStealer operators accessed customer accounts using the compromised logins, bypassed 2FA, and, if the user had access to the Facebook Advertising platform, ran malicious ads.

Meta says the malware appears to have been created and distributed by threat actors based in Vietnam.

This would mark the third known malware operation based out of Vietnam that's focused on compromising Facebook advertising accounts and using them to post malicious ads. Previous operations include the likes of [Ducktail](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/ducktail-returns) and [Malverposting](https://labs.guard.io/malverposting-with-over-500k-estimated-infections-facebook-ads-fuel-this-evolving-stealer-54b03d24b349).

Meta's takedown of NodeStealer comes a week after Google also took steps to disrupt the operations of [CryptBot](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-google-disrupts-cryptbot), another infostealer strain focused on stealing credentials and cookies for online accounts.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**MSI private key leak:** The Money Message ransomware gang has leaked the private cryptographic keys for hundreds of MSI products, according to [Alex Matrosov](https://archive.ph/mlcgi), the founder and CEO of firmware security company Binarly. Leaked private keys include firmware image signing keys for 57 MSI products and Intel BootGuard keys for 116 MSI products [*see the full list [here](https://github.com/binarly-io/SupplyChainAttacks/blob/main/MSI/MsiImpactedDevices.md)*]. The leak originates from a [ransomware attack](https://www.pcmag.com/news/msi-confirms-breach-as-ransomware-gang-claims-responsibility) that hit MSI's US branch at the start of April, during which the company refused to pay the ransom.

**Orqa bricking incident:** Croatian company Orqa says that "a greedy former contractor" planted a "[ransomware time-bomb](https://orqafpv.com/blog-details/bricking-incident-public-announcement)" in the firmware of some of its products with the intention of extracting a ransom. Orqa says the time bomb triggered over the last weekend, on April 29, and crashed the bootloader of Orqa first-person view googles used to visualize and experience drone flight paths. The company says the malicious code was planted in its firmware years in advance, and the incident was intentionally timed to take place on the Saturday of the May 1st Labor Day extended weekend when its support teams would not be in office, and most drone owners would be flying their devices. The company says the contractor tried to explain the malicious bootloader code as an expiring license. Orqa has released fixes for owners with bricked devices and has hinted at "pending legal and criminal proceedings."

**Bluefield ransomware attack:** A ransomware gang has breached the internal network of a private US university and hijacked its emergency alerts system to threaten students and faculty members with leaking their data unless the administration paid a ransom demand. The incident affected Bluefield University, a small, private university in the state of Virginia. The university's RamAlerts system is typically used to warn students via email and SMS about the cancellation of classes due to weather, IT outages, and active shooter drills. The Avos ransomware gang took credit for the incident in some of the messages sent throughout last week. [*Additional coverage in [WVVA](https://www.wvva.com/2023/05/01/ransomware-cyberattack-continues-bluefield-university/)*]

**Dallas ransomware attack:** Dallas, the 9th largest city in the US, was hit by a ransomware attack that has disrupted its IT networks and official websites. The city's 311 public service hotline, municipal court, police department, and city hall IT services have been disrupted. The attack took place on Wednesday, May 3, and was allegedly carried out using the Royal ransomware, which apparently started printing its ransom note via all of the city's available printers.

### **General tech and privacy**

**FTC proposes ban on Facebook monetizing youth data:** The US Federal Trade Commission has [proposed](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/05/ftc-proposes-blanket-prohibition-preventing-facebook-monetizing-youth-data) barring Meta from monetizing children's data. FTC officials say the company violated a 2020 privacy order in regard to its Facebook Messenger for Kids service. The agency says Meta misled parents about their ability to control with whom their children communicated through the Messenger Kids app and misrepresented the access some app developers had to children's data.

**40+ orgs sign open letter:** More than 40 leading pro-privacy organizations have signed an [open](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2023-05-03-40-organizations-call-on-world-leaders-to-uphold-encryption-privacy-press-freedom) [letter](https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/press-freedom-day-encry...
