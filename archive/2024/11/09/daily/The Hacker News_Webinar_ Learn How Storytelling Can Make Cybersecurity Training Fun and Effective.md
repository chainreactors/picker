Let's face it—traditional security training can feel as thrilling as reading the fine print on a software update. It's routine, predictable, and, let's be honest, often forgotten the moment it's over. Now, imagine cybersecurity training that's as unforgettable as your favorite show.

Remember how "Hamilton" made history come alive, or how "The Office" taught us CPR (Staying Alive beat, anyone?)? That's the transformative power of storytelling—and it's exactly what Huntress Managed Security Awareness Training (SAT) is bringing to cybersecurity.

### **Why Storytelling is the Secret Weapon in Security Training:**

Human brains are wired for stories; it's how we process complex information and retain it. Stories give lessons meaning and make concepts stick, so why not apply this to something as vital as cybersecurity awareness?

In our upcoming webinar, "[Storytime with Huntress Managed Security Awareness Training](https://thehacker.news/security-awareness-training?source=article)," we're diving into why storytelling isn't just for movies—it's a game-changer for cybersecurity training.

### **What to Expect in the Webinar:**

Industry experts, Dima Kumets (Principal Product Manager) and James O'Leary (Product Marketing Manager), will guide you through a fresh approach to security training that resonates with users and admins alike. Here's what we'll cover:

1. **Why Storytelling Works:** Understand how storytelling can make complex cybersecurity concepts engaging and relatable, fostering stronger retention and action.
2. **The Benefits of a Managed Solution:** Discover how Huntress Managed SAT supports your training admins with streamlined, effective security awareness training.
3. **Innovative Tools to Boost Engagement:** From Phishing Defense Coaching to gamification, we'll show you how new capabilities make learning enjoyable and practical for all users.

Ready to supercharge your security culture with training that sticks? Join us and see how Huntress SAT transforms security awareness into an engaging story your team won't forget.
