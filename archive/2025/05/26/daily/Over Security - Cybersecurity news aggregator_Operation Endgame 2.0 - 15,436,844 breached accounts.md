## What Happened

In May 2025, [a coalition of law enforcement agencies took down the criminal infrastructure behind the malware used to launch ransomware attacks](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-endgame-strikes-again-ransomware-kill-chain-broken-its-source) in a new phase of "Operation Endgame". This followed [the first Operation Endgame exercise a year earlier](https://www.troyhunt.com/operation-endgame/), with the latest action resulting in 15.3M victim email addresses being provided to HIBP by law enforcement. A further 43.8M victim passwords were also provided for [HIBP's Pwned Passwords service](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
