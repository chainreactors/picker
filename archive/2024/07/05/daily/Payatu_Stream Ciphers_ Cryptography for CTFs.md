Stream ciphers operate on each bit of data in the message rather than on a chunk of data at a time. Encryption and decryption are straightforward with stream ciphers, which use the same keystream for both processes. Stream ciphers are inherently simple, involving only XOR operations for both encryption and decryption, using the same keystream each time.

## OTP (One Time Pad)

The One Time Pad (OTP) is a type of stream cipher, but it has been deemed impractical for long-term use. In OTP, a user encrypts a message by XORing it with a secret key message.

The vulnerability of OTP lies in its XOR operations and properties. It has been observed that if multiple ciphertexts are generated using the same key, an attacker could potentially reverse engineer the ciphertext to recover...
