# Find the Right Open Source Research Tools With Bellingcat’s New Online Investigations Toolkit

Have you ever struggled to find a tool that does exactly what you need? Do you know the feeling of spending hours trying to figure out how to use a tool just to realise that the key features you are interested in are not working anymore, or that the previously free product has turned into a paid one that is more expensive than you can afford?

You are not alone. More than 80 percent of open source researchers that participated in two Bellingcat surveys indicated that finding the right tools can be challenging.

This is where our new [Online Investigations Toolkit](https://bellingcat.gitbook.io/toolkit) comes in: it not only helps you discover tools in categories like satellite imagery and maps, social media, transportation or archiving, but is also designed to help researchers learn how to use each tool by providing in-depth descriptions, common use cases and information on requirements and limitations for each toolkit entry.

Most of the tools included can be used for free.

This is the first time in Bellingcat’s 10-year history that we are opening our toolkit to contributions from the wider open source researcher community. A dedicated group of volunteers, our Toolkit Maintainers and Guardians, help us keep this toolkit up to date and are involved in further improving it. Since it is still a work-in-progress, we expect the number of tools in the toolkit to grow over time.

## Where Open Source Researchers Search For Tools

Open source researchers frequently use tools, from satellite imagery and flight tracking websites to online business registries and social media scraping services, in their work. Some of these are created by big tech companies, while others are built and shared by volunteers. They might come in the form of desktop tools, command line tools on code sharing platforms like GitHub, or browser extensions.

This fragmented tool environment can be confusing, making it difficult or time-consuming for researchers to figure out which tools to use. In a survey conducted by Bellingcat in 2023, only 15 percent of 153 participants indicated that it was easy for them to find the right tools for their research. A previous Bellingcat [survey](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/08/12/these-are-the-tools-open-source-researchers-say-they-need/) from 2022 with more than 500 participants yielded very similar results. This is despite the fact that there was a long list of toolkits for open source researchers out there at that point in time, including the [previous version of our toolkit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18rtqh8EG2q1xBo2cLNyhIDuK9jrPGwYr9DI2UncoqJQ/edit?gid=930747607#gid=930747607), which was available on Google Sheets.

According to Bellingcat’s surveys, most open source researchers use search engines to find tools. Other top methods include going through websites and blogs that present tools and reading the publications of other researchers to see what tools they use.

*Two surveys from 2022 and 2023 show that open source researchers take several approaches to find tools for their research. It is important to note that the 2022 survey had 531 participants while the 2023 survey had 153. Respondents were allowed to select several options*

To get a deeper understanding about how researchers find and use tools, we interviewed 40 open source researchers from various countries, levels of experience and backgrounds. What we learned from those interviews is that what most open source researchers most frequently do is not necessarily what works best for them.

For instance, despite search engines being the top destination for researchers in need of tools, this method does not always lead to the desired results. Our interviewees indicated that it could be difficult to come up with the right keywords: “You sort of know intuitively that certain tools must exist, but you don’t quite know what words to go by. So there’s a lot of feeling around in the dark for search terms to try and find tools that work,” one person explained.

Even if researchers manage to define the right keywords, they struggle to get a sense of whether a tool showing up in the search results might meet their needs. Since tool providers tend to present their tools in an overly positive light, it is often difficult for researchers to understand a tool’s limitations based on the descriptions.

From our interviews and surveys, direct tool recommendations from others in the industry are an important way that researchers make sense of the diverse tools available online. “In my network, I know a lot of journalists who do this kind of OSINT (open source intelligence) work,” one interviewee explained. “Just through word of mouth, I’m able to get recommendations for what the most up-to-date tools are.”

Other interviewees indicated that they turned to websites, blogs and newsletters to get recommendations for tools. “If someone has used a tool and there’s a blog out there that tells me how to use it, then I will try it,” one open source researcher said.

No matter where they find tools for their research, many researchers said they struggled with keeping track of tools that might come in handy later on. “Sometimes I feel like ‘Oh, that might be an interesting one’, but I don’t use it now and when I need to find it, I just really don’t remember,” one interviewee said.

Toolkits are meant to be a solution to this. They are usually organised according to different tool categories and curated by a person or organisation hoping to provide some structure within the open source research tool environment.

Googling keywords like “OSINT” and “toolkit” brings up a long list of toolkit...
