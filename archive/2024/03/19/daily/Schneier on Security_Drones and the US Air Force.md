## Drones and the US Air Force

Fascinating [analysis](https://warontherocks.com/2024/03/drones-the-air-littoral-and-the-looming-irrelevance-of-the-u-s-air-force/) of the use of drones on a modern battlefield—that is, Ukraine—and the inability of the US Air Force to react to this change.

> The F-35A certainly remains an important platform for high-intensity conventional warfare. But the Air Force is planning to buy 1,763 of the aircraft, which will remain in service through the year 2070. These jets, which are wholly unsuited for countering proliferated low-cost enemy drones in the air littoral, present *enormous* opportunity costs for the service as a whole. In a set of comments [posted on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevin-murray-1507a055_deadly-cheap-and-widespread-how-iran-supplied-activity-7162108210366119938-VVMi) last month, defense analyst T.X. Hammes estimated the following. The delivered cost of a single F-35A is [around](https://www.saffm.hq.af.mil/Portals/84/documents/FY24/Procurement/FY24%20Air%20Force%20Aircraft%20Procurement%20Vol%20I.pdf?ver=NMExUp6ZOJkMDUTjzBwtbA%3d%3d#page=117) [$130 million](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106047.pdf), but buying *and* operating that plane throughout its lifecycle will cost at least $460 million. He estimated that a single Chinese [Sunflower suicide drone](https://asiatimes.com/2023/09/killer-sunflower-chinas-kamikaze-drone-has-arrived/) costs about $30,000—so you could purchase 16,000 Sunflowers for the cost of one F-35A. And since the full mission capable rate of the F-35A has hovered around [50 percent](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105341.pdf) in recent years, you need two to ensure that all missions can be completed—for an opportunity cost of 32,000 Sunflowers. As Hammes concluded, “Which do you think creates more problems for air defense?”

> Ironically, the first service to respond decisively to the new contestation of the air littoral has been the U.S. Army. Its soldiers are directly threatened by lethal drones, as the Tower 22 attack demonstrated all too clearly. Quite unexpectedly, last month the Army [cancelled its future reconnaissance helicopter](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12592) ­ which has already cost the service $2 billion—because fielding a costly manned reconnaissance aircraft no longer makes sense. Today, the same mission can be performed by far less expensive drones—without putting any pilots at risk. The Army also decided to retire its aging [Shadow and Raven legacy drones](https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/02/shakeup-army-cancels-planned-fara-helo-will-retire-two-drones/394061/), whose declining survivability and capabilities have rendered them obsolete, and announced a new rapid buy of [600 Coyote counter-drone drones](https://www.army-technology.com/news/us-army-to-rapidly-acquire-600-counter-uas-coyote-drones-under-raa/) in order to help protect its troops.

An important component of decision making is electronic warfare. F35s are loaded to the hilt. Aggressive R&D continues in all areas of EW. Those little drones cannot hoist a significant payload, without robbing from other roles.

It’s dumb to say you’ll just throw a bazillion drones at the enemy so who needs EW stuff. EW is capable of killing drones. This is a very active area.

You need multiple platforms. It’s equally dumb to portray the USAF as flat-footed since the DoD has been actively developing drone technology since long before these journalists were born.

@ jackson, ALL,

Re : “Electronic Warfare”(EW) and drones.

> “It’s dumb to say you’ll just throw a bazillion drones at the enemy so who needs EW stuff. EW is capable of killing drones. This is a very active area.”

Actually like the old ECM, ECCM, ECCCM of the cold war era it’s a two way street and significant arms race.

For various reasons my money is on the drones winning the EW game free and clear and the modern battlefield changed significantly yet again.

Agree with @Clive Robinson here. We already know how to build equipment to survive the EMP and other effects of nuclear war. This is about as hostile as it gets and has been worked on since the 1940s.

We have spread spectrum, laser and other communication methods that resist interference and jamming. Consumer tech such as 5G and WiFi have brought the cost of phased array antennas and all manner of other advanced former military RF technology down to very low levels.

There is 2-way also satellite coverage of basically everywhere on Earth, inertial navigation packages that fit on a fingernail and all sorts of optical, MEMS and other bits developed for mobile phones that rival the big, heavy tech that was cutting edge for defense just a decade or two ago. We also have pretty good autotpilot software and even decision making that can fit on a phone-sized computer.

I can’t imagine that electronic countermeasures are really going to win here. They can almost certainly degrade the accuracy and ability to communicate with drones, but I doubt there is anything non-kinetic that can stop a big swarm of these from getting near their target and having some complete their mission.

No surprise, as the saying goes Generals are always preparing for last year’s war and I would argue “heroic” services suffer it the most, i.e. battleships/fighters, ship captains / pilots as it’s all about them as “knights” as opposed to just another disposable ground pounder. The Army has always suffered that to a lesser extent with mounted forces as well but their entire ethos/service isn’t wrapped up in it nor does embracing unmanned system spark an existential crisis.

The USAF knows it’s days as an preeminent independent uniformed service are numbered with drones eventually going to regulate it to a niche uniformed service like NOAA Corps with Space Fo...
