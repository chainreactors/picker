# HOLY SMOKES! FREE WINFE TRAINING!

[Brett Shavers](https://winfe.wordpress.com/author/winfe/) / [May 12, 2025](https://winfe.wordpress.com/2025/05/12/holy-smokes-free-winfe-training/)

If you work in digital forensics or incident response, you know that **your case starts with acquisition**. And when you‚Äôre acquiring evidence from a forensically booted environment, you want **something fast, court-defensible, and secure**.

That‚Äôs where **WinFE (Windows Forensic Environment)** comes in, and now, for **this week only**, you can get **formal training and certification for FREE**.

üîó **Register Now:**
üëâ [WinFE Certification Course](https://courses.dfir.training/offers/W6xq7cuL/checkout?coupon_code=WINFETTTFREE)
üëâ [Train-the-Trainer Course](https://courses.dfir.training/offers/J5uKFiFr/checkout?coupon_code=WINFETTTFREE)
üìÖ **Offer expires May 14, 2025**

## üß∞ Is WinFE still relevant?

Without the years of community use and support, WinFE may have remained a small, internal tool to a few select organizations‚Ä¶ üò¶

But WinFE has been taken well beyond that!

Unlike Linux-based forensic boot environments, **WinFE supports full BitLocker access**, a familiar Windows interface, and powerful forensic scripting, all while preventing writes to the evidence disk.

Arsernal Recon is pushing WinFE‚Äôs capabilities up a notch! So is Colin Ramsden (he is working on a huge update with cool features).

## üéì Two Free Courses ‚Äî What You‚Äôll Learn

### ‚úÖ **WinFE Certification**

* What WinFE is and how it fits into forensic workflows
* Step-by-step build process using automated scripts
* Real-world applications and legal defensibility
* Instant, verifiable certificate upon completion
* Lifetime access, including the **upcoming** and **updated WinFE training!**

### ‚úÖ **WinFE Train-the-Trainer**

* Everything from the certification course
* How to teach WinFE in an academic or agency setting
* Common student mistakes and how to troubleshoot
* Instructor-use content and build guidance

üì¶ Bonus: Both courses include a **PowerShell script** that builds a complete, functional WinFE automatically‚Äîno prior experience needed.

---

## üìà Over 15,000 Trained ‚Äî and Counting

Since I first began teaching WinFE, **over 15,000 professionals** have taken these courses‚Äîwhether in a physical classroom, live online, or on-demand. My first online WinFE course had over 5,000 sign-ups way back when!

That number is incredible, especially when you consider that **many DF/IR folks are using WinFE today without any formal training on WinFE**‚Äîdespite it being foundational to acquisitions. I‚Äôll admit, it‚Äôs not a requirement or necessity to have training in WinFE to use, but I‚Äôve seen tense moments in trial with an opposing expert struggled to explain his lack of training with WinFE other than having attended less than an hour at a conference.

**This free training changes that**. It‚Äôs not just about learning how to build a forensic boot disk‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing how to defend your acquisition in court and ensure your case doesn‚Äôt fall apart because of a preventable mistake.

---

## üß† Why Training Matters

Let‚Äôs be real: your entire case **depends on the integrity of your acquisition**. WinFE gives you control, transparency, and reliability‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not enough by itself.

If you‚Äôre ever cross-examined and asked:

> *‚ÄúYou booted the system with a forensic environment‚Ä¶ but you didn‚Äôt take the free certification course available at the time?‚Äù*

What do you say?

There‚Äôs **no excuse**. The course is free, fast, and backed by proven field use. Don‚Äôt leave your process open to scrutiny when you can shut that door completely‚Äîwith a certificate to prove it.

## üß† Beyond Booting: Arsenal Recon‚Äôs AIM + WinFE

Want to take your workflow a step further?

**Arsenal Recon‚Äôs Arsenal Image Mounter (AIM)** lets you **virtually boot the OS of the machine that you booted with WinFE**. This enables:

* Live analysis of the user‚Äôs environment without altering evidence
* Remote access to booted systems for investigations
* Full interaction with encrypted or complex user environments

Pairing **WinFE** for acquisition with **AIM** for virtual booting creates an incredibly powerful, fully defensible workflow‚Äîideal for both field work and lab analysis.

If you haven‚Äôt used AIM with your WinFE workflow yet, now is the time to explore what‚Äôs possible.

## üéÅ Why It‚Äôs Free

This isn‚Äôt a gimmick‚Äîit‚Äôs a thank-you. These two courses normally cost a combined $220, but for two days only, I‚Äôm offering both for free as part of a push to make core forensic skills more accessible.

You‚Äôll get:

* Full course access
* Downloadable build tools
* Certification of completion
* ebook
* Lifetime updates
* Powershell script that builds your entire WinFE, hands off.

## ‚è≥ Don‚Äôt Miss Out

The offer expires **May 14, 2025**. After that, both courses return to full price.
