# Here’s the tech powering ICE’s deportation crackdown

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year’s presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.

In his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/ice-deportations-immigrants-trump).

ICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass deportation campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants. To aid its efforts, ICE has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities.

Here is a recap of some of the technology that ICE has in its digital arsenal.

## Clearview AI facial recognition

Clearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.

On Monday, [404 Media reported](https://www.404media.co/ice-spends-millions-on-clearview-ai-face-recognition-to-find-people-assaulting-officers/) that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”

According to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.

ICE [has had other contracts](https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22++AGENCY_NAME%3A%22Immigration+and+Customs+Enforcement%22&s=FPDS.GOV&templateName=1.5.3&indexName=awardfull&x=0&y=0&sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&desc=Y) with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”

Clearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.

## Paragon phone spyware

In September 2024, ICE [signed a contract](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70CTD024P00000012_7012_-NONE-_-NONE-) worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” [putting the contract under review](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-paragon-contract-white-house-review/) to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.

Because of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, [effectively reactivating the contract](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/02/ice-reactivates-contract-with-spyware-maker-paragon/).

At this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.

The records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.

It’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, [and more](https://www.ice.gov/about-ice/hsi/investigate).

Paragon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, [American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/israeli-spyware-maker-paragon-bought-by-u-s-private-equity-giant/), with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site [Calcalist](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1ucev64kg).

In a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications Jennifer Iras.

RedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.

In the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on [journalists](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/) and [immigrat...
