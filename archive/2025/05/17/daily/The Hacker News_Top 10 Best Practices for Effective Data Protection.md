Data is the lifeblood of productivity, and protecting sensitive data is more critical than ever. With cyber threats evolving rapidly and data privacy regulations tightening, organizations must stay vigilant and proactive to safeguard their most valuable assets. But how do you build an effective data protection framework?

In this article, we'll explore data protection best practices from meeting compliance requirements to streamlining day-to-day operations. Whether you're securing a small business or a large enterprise, these top strategies will help you build a strong defense against breaches and keep your sensitive data safe.

## **1. Define your data goals**

When tackling any data protection project, the first step is always to understand the outcome you want.

First, understand what data you need to protect. Identify your crown jewel data, and where you THINK it lives. (It's probably more distributed than you expect, but this is a key step to help you define your protection focus.) Work with business owners to find any data outside the typical scope that you need to secure.

This is all to answer the question: "What data would hurt the company if it were breached?"

Second, work with the C-suit and board of directors to define what your data protection program will look like. Understand your budget, your risk tolerance to data loss, and what resources you have (or may need). Define how aggressive your protection program will be so you can balance risk and productivity. All organizations need to strike a balance between the two.

## **2. Automate data classification**

Next, begin your data classification journey—that is, find your data and catalog it. This is often the most difficult step in the journey, as organizations create new data all the time.

Your first instinct may be to try to keep up with all your data, but this may be a fool's errand. The key to success is to have classification capabilities everywhere data moves (endpoint, inline, cloud), and rely on your DLP policy to jump in when risk arises. (More on this later.)

Automation in data classification is becoming a lifesaver thanks to the power of AI. AI-powered classification can be faster and more accurate than traditional ways of classifying data with DLP. Ensure any solution you are evaluating can use AI to instantly uncover and discover data without human input.

## **3. Focus on zero trust security for access control**

Adopting a zero trust architecture is crucial for modern data protection strategies to be effective. Based on the maxim "never trust, always verify," zero trust assumes security threats can come from inside or outside your network. Every access request is authenticated and authorized, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

Look for a zero trust solution that emphasizes the importance of least-privileged access control between users and apps. With this approach, users never access the network, reducing the ability for threats to move laterally and propagate to other entities and data on the network. The principle of least privilege ensures that users have only the access they need for their roles, reducing the attack surface.

## **4. Centralize DLP for consistent alerting**

Data loss prevention (DLP) technology is the core of any data protection program. That said, keep in mind that DLP is only a subset of a larger data protection solution. DLP enables the classification of data (along with AI) to ensure you can accurately find sensitive data. Ensure your DLP engine can consistently alert correctly on the same piece of data across devices, networks, and clouds.

The best way to ensure this is to embrace a centralized DLP engine that can cover all channels at once. Avoid point products that bring their own DLP engine (endpoint, network, CASB), as this can lead to multiple alerts on one piece of moving data, slowing down incident management and response.

Look to embrace Gartner's security service edge approach, which delivers DLP from a centralized cloud service. Focus on vendors that support the most channels so that, as your program grows, you can easily add protection across devices, inline, and cloud.

## **5. Ensure blocking across key loss channels**

Once you have a centralized DLP, focus on the most important data loss channels to your organization. (You'll need to add more channels as you grow, so ensure your platform can accommodate all of them and grow with you.) The most important channels can vary, but every organization focuses on certain common ones:

* **Web/Email:** The most common ways users accidentally send sensitive data outside the organization.
* **SaaS data (CASB):** Another common loss vector, as users can easily share data externally.
* **Endpoint:** A key focus for many organizations looking to lock down USB, printing, and network shares.
* **Unmanaged devices/BYOD:** If you have a large BYOD footprint, browser isolation is an innovative way to secure data headed to these devices without an agent or VDI. Devices are placed in an isolated browser, which enforces DLP inspection and prevents cut, paste, download, or print. (More on this later.)
* **SaaS posture control (SSPM/supply chain):** SaaS platforms like Microsoft 365 can often be misconfigured. Continuously scanning for gaps and risky third-party integrations is key to minimizing data breaches.
* **IaaS posture control (DSPM):** Most companies have a lot of sensitive data across AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Finding it all, and...
