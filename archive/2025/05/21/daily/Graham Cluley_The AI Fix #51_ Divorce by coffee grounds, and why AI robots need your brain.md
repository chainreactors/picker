In episode 51 of The AI Fix, a Greek man‚Äôs marriage is destroyed after ChatGPT reads his coffee, a woman dumps her husband to marry an AI called Leo, and Graham wonders whether it‚Äôs time to upload his brain into a lunchbox-packing robot.

Meanwhile, a humanoid robot goes full Michael Crawford in a Chinese factory, the UK government launches an AI to read angry public consultations, and Mark dreams of a world where robots finally have common sense ‚Äì and swear like sailors.

Plus Graham uncovers how AI is wrecking relationships and inventing soulmates, and Mark explains why Google‚Äôs Gemini-powered bots might be smarter, more dexterous, and more emotionally stable than most of your exes.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
