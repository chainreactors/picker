The SAP Signavio Process Transformation Suite provides a broad range of analytical capabilities. In today’s post I will primarily focus on the analytical features of SAP Signavio Process Manager and SAP Signavio Journey Modeler to emphasize the criticality of process and journey modeling in analysis, especially when process data is limited or unavailable. A few examples of processes for which it can be challenging to obtain data from source systems are:

1. **Customer service interactions:** It can be difficult to capture all customer service interactions, as they may take place on several different channels, such as over the phone, via email, or on social media platforms.

2. **Physical production processes:** Data on physical production processes, such as those in a factory or manufacturing setting, may not be fully captured by automated systems and may require manual data collection.

3. **Research and development processes:** The nature of research and development processes can be highly variable and exploratory, making it difficult to capture process data in a standardized way.

4. **Healthcare processes:** Healthcare processes involve a wide range of interactions and data sources, including patient data, physician notes, and medical equipment data, which may not always be easily integrated into a single data source.

5. **Supply chain processes:** Supply chain processes can be highly complex, involving multiple partners and systems, making it challenging to collect and integrate data from all relevant sources.

Process modeling is a base that provides a standardized approach to analyzing processes and ensures that all stakeholders can collaborate effectively. It provides a visual representation of all process steps, actors, and decisions. By modeling the process, stakeholders gain a clear understanding of how the process works, how it is currently performed, and where there may be opportunities for improvement. Modeling also allows for the identification of process bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other issues that can be addressed through process improvement initiatives.

Even when data is not readily available from source systems, process analysis remains critical to the overall process management and can provide insights into how the process is working in practice. By collecting data from process participants, such as through surveys & interviews, as well as capabilities such as simulation, process comparison, resource consumption analysis, and cost reports it is possible to analyze process performance and identify areas for improvement.

*Example 1*

In customer service interactions, even if not all interactions are captured in the source system, modeling the process can still help identify areas where the process can be streamlined, or customer satisfaction can be improved. It is possible to identify pain points in the process and develop solutions to address them by analyzing customer feedback or other indicators of customer satisfaction.

*Example 2*

In healthcare processes, process modeling can help identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement, even if all relevant data is not available in a single system. Analyzing patient outcomes, clinical decision-making, or other process metrics can help identify opportunities to improve patient care and reduce costs.

With SAP Signavio Process Manager and SAP Signavio Journey Modeler, users can create detailed process and journey models that provide a powerful platform including a variety of analytical capabilities for process analysis. Here are a few analysis examples:

1. **Simulation**: SAP Signavio supports process simulation, which allows users to create and simulate business process models. With process simulation, users can test and compare different process scenarios and analyze the impact of changes to the process (such as to the cycle times and costs) before implementing them in the live environment. This helps to identify potential bottlenecks or issues and optimize the process for better performance.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/SPM_Editor_Simulation_Multiplecase_012023-1-scaled.jpg)Figure 1. Process simulation capability

2. **Process comparison**: it helps modelers and analysts to understand process evolution and track process changes over time. In SAP Signavio, process comparison is a feature that allows users to compare different versions of a process model or compare two different process models to identify changes and improvements. This feature shows a side-by-side comparison of the two models and highlights the differences between them, making it easy to identify changes and track improvement. For example, it can be ...
