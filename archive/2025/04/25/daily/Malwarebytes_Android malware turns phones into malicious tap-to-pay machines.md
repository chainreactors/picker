# Android malware turns phones into malicious tap-to-pay machines

Posted: April 24, 2025

Got an [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) phone? Got a tap-to-pay card? Then you’re like millions of other users now at risk from a new form of cybercrime – [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that can read your credit or debit card and hand its data over to an attacker. A newly discovered malicious program effectively turns Android phones into malicious tap machines that vacuum up payment card data and send it to cybercriminals half a world away. All you have to do is install the software and tap your card to your phone – and criminals excel at persuading you to do just that.

The malware, which cybersecurity company Cleafy [calls](https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation) SuperCard X, uses a feature now found in most Android phones: near-field communication (NFC). This enables your phone to read the data on a supporting payment card when it comes close enough. It’s how tap-to-pay machines found in retailers and ATMs work their magic.

Attackers get the malicious software via a malware-as-a-service model. This enables them to become affiliates for the developers of the software, who typically offer it for a percentage of the attackers’ takings. They can then focus on finding and targeting victims with [social engineering attacks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering), which Cleafy says they’ve been doing in Italy.

## How the attack works

First the attackers have to get the malware onto someone’s Android phone. That starts with a fraudulent ‘smishing’ message sent via SMS or WhatsApp, often impersonating a bank and asking the user to call.

The telephone number connects the victim to the attacker, who then persuades them to give up their PIN and log into their bank account. From there, they persuade the victim to remove the spending limits on their card, and then to install what they claim is a security application, sent to their phone as a link. This contains the SuperCard X malware.

Finally comes the payoff. The attacker, who by now will likely have built up a rapport with the victim, will ask them to tap their card to their phone. The malware then captures the card details, which it then sends to the attacker’s own Android phone. They can then use the phone as a cloned card for contactless payments. If you’ve ever tapped your phone instead of your card to pay for something, you’ll know how easy that is to do.

## Where did SuperCard X come from?

Like much malware, SuperCard X didn’t come out of nowhere. Cleafy says that it shares code with another piece of malware called NGate, discovered last year. Both of these are likely built on concepts first outlined in NFCGate, a freely available open-source NFC software tool developed by German’s Technical University of Darmstadt.

SuperCard X’s developers have focused on making this software as stealthy as possible. Most [antivirus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus) programs for Android fail to spot it, says Cleafy. That’s because it asks for as few privileges as ...
