## Gift Card Fraud

It’s becoming an [organized crime tactic](https://www.propublica.org/article/chinese-organized-crime-gift-cards-american-retail):

> Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display, open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.

> […]
>
> In card draining, the runners assist with removing, tampering and restocking of gift cards, according to court documents and investigators.
>
> A single runner driving from store to store can swipe or return thousands of tampered cards to racks in a short time. “What they do is they just fly into the city and they get a rental car and they just hit every big-box location that they can find along a corridor off an interstate,” said Parks.

The biggest crime in gift cards is the card themselves. The whole business model is predicated on recipients forgetting them or not using up the whole balance. Always give cash instead.

Nearly everything else (deodorant, razor blades, toothpaste, etc.) is locked behind clear plexiglass doors, why not the same with gift cards?

Article is from April. And

> Police said they found 2,260 Visa, Apple and Mastercard gift cards in his car. Xue entered the U.S. illegally months before his arrest, according to a prosecution motion

and

> Criminals use software to automatically check gift card balances so they can be alerted when a customer buys and loads money onto a tampered card.

. No wonder the big stores had to settle the lawsuits…

An obvious fix would be for the point of sale software to display a newly generated PIN to the cashier who could then write that in marker pen on the packet or affix it as a sticker to the gift card (over the barcode in the window they uncover). This would replace the PIN on the card and prevent the remote software from checking the balance.

Good new year Bruce!

I am unsure how this would work in Germany. The card is activated in stores by the cashier scanning it and the customer paying for it. If both conditions are met the point of sales terminal issues activation of the card code under the scratch and rub field.

If the card would be sold again the point of sales terminal would error and the tamper resistant scratch field would be damaged.

So unless you buy a card “too cheap” from an untrusted vendor, then it is nearly impossible to be scammed. I do believe it is people that may fall for the classic “too good to be true” kind of deal. Unless I missed something.

Cheers!

Addendum
My bad I just realized they wait for the card being legitimately purchased. I still fail to see how the scratch field can be repaired, which you can already inspect in store and alter the cashier of tampering.

Other than that this raises new questions for me: How many API calls do these cyber criminals want to perform to activate the card faster than me? Unless I will wait weeks to use it as a gift for a special person or friend of mines?

It’s certainly an interesting scheme and devious! Thanks for the article. I just think people should always check in a store if the scratch field looks out of the ordinary.

I will not be so foolish myself and claim that criminals are not capable to peel off the tamper resistant field altogether and replace it with a new one bought from a large asian ACME company that can manufacture these.

Are we going back to holograms?
Proposal:
I suppose a simple 2FA/second factor field on the printed receipt by the cashier which you can cut off and use with the card code.

I may be overthinking things.

@Carsten: People have been arrested for x-raying unsold lottery scratch-off tickets before, and keeping the winning tickets for themselves. It’s not hard for organized criminals to acquired gift-card-codes without scratching off. Difficult for you & me, but not for organized crime.

It’s kind of like how you & I go see a movie in a theater, and it’s like we’re entering a demilitarized zone. Person & possessions subject to search & seizure. Cell phones confiscated for duration of the film. Etc. They’re terrified we’re going to video-record their movie. Whereas organized crime simply bribes or intimidates the projectionist and records the movie with professional equipment. Don’t assume that criminals have the same limitations we do.

@Martin: Gamestop will let you buy Steam gift-card-codes on the receipt. It’s very helpful at Christmas. Especially as Steam gift-cards are almost impossible to scratch off without rendering the underlying code unreadable. Nowadays with theft, getting the code on the receipt is an even better idea.

Walmart claimed to offer the same service for Tracfone codes. Unfortunately, ever since being bought out by Verizon, Tracfone now has so many similar-sounding plans, Walmart staff refuse to sell receipt-codes since they can’t figure out which plan you’re trying to buy.

Nevertheless, this idea of printing the gift-card-codes on the receipt is an idea who’s time has come, and people are starting to implement it.

@Carsten: Perhaps it’s as simple as placing a sticker that has the same pattern as the scratch area on top of the scratched PIN. It just has to look good enough at a glance to trick the buyer. The recipient of the gift card probably won’t try to scratch the PIN until he’s using it, which is going to be days or weeks ...
