Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) has emerged as the most anticipated technology in the near future of email marketing. This article gives you an introduction with a summary to the Brand Indicators for Message Identification and instructions for its implementation.

## What is BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification)?

BIMI provides you a simple way to display your brand. BIMI allows email users to see logos associated with specific brands sending authenticated email.

With BIMI you can:

* Display your logos on your emails.

* Control the logos displayed in your email messages.

* Improve immediate brand recognition and enhanced user experience.

BIMI increases the consumer trust you have built and ensures brand recognition by linking your logo to your emails. BIMI provides an additional incentive for brands to adopt proper email authentication.

For more information, see the [BIMI group's own page](https://bimigroup.org/all-about-bimi/).
