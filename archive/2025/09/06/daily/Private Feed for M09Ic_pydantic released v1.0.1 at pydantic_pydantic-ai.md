## Breaking Changes

The following breaking change was slated to go into v1.0.0 but accidentally left out. Because it's a security issue, an uncommonly used feature, and few people will have updated to v1 yet within 24 hours, we decided it was justified to make an exception to the no-breaking-changes policy to get it out ASAP.

* Remove `Python` evaluator from `pydantic_evals` for security reasons by [@dmontagu](https://github.com/dmontagu) in [#2808](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/2808)

## Other Changes

* Remove `eval-type-backport` dependency by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#2814](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/2814)
