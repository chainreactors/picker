For organizations relying on IBM QRadar, the project of switching to a new platform may seem complex. However, with QRadar being increasingly recognized as a legacy system, moving to a more modern and maintained solution is crucial for staying ahead and facilitating security operations.

IBM QRadar has been a trusted solution for many years. However, as security threats evolve and security operations are becoming more complex, the need for strong efficiency in security tools has never been more important (multiplication of security consoles, volumes of logs, etc.).
Sekoia Defend represents a next-generation solution designed to meet todayâ€™s cybersecurity demands with a flexible, modern and cloud-native platform. Sekoia is actively maintained and continually updated to stay ahead of the latest threats and security best-practices.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore why making the switch from QRadar to Sekoia Defend is a rewarding experience and how Sekoiaâ€™s state-of-the-art platform offers unparalleled flexibility and power.

## Benefit from a cloud-native SOC platform

### Modern & efficient user experience

QRadarâ€™s user interface is known for being complex and sometimes outdated, which can slow down daily security operations. Sekoia offers a modern and intuitive front-end designed with security operations efficiency in mind, enabling faster investigations & responses.
Additionally, QRadar is often criticized for its relatively slow performance when searching or hunting for logs. In contrast, Sekoia leverages a fully scalable and cloud-native infrastructure to deliver exceptional search speed and efficiency.

### Collaborative environment

Sekoia allows a collaborative approach, enabling security teams to work together seamlessly. Unlike QRadar, which often feels siloed and rigid, Sekoiaâ€™s architecture is designed for fluid collaboration across detection, investigation, and incident response workflows. On Sekoia, users can collaborate and share their work while investigating a security event, while building an incident response scenario, etc.

### Regular updates and continuous maintenance

One major challenge with traditional SIEMs like QRadar is maintaining and updating detection rules, integrations, threat intelligence feeds, etc.
Thanks to its cloud-native architecture & approach regular updates, directly integrated into the platform, reducing the operational burden on SOC teams.

**ðŸ”‘Â Key takeaway:** Sekoia replaces QRadarâ€™s monolithic architecture with a cloud-native, collaborative, and continuously updated SOC platform, designed for efficiency and scalability.

## Leverage cutting-edge detection capabilities

### Native catalog of rules and powerful detection engines

Sekoia offers a catalog of more than 1 000 native detection rules, constantly updated and tailored to balance false positives and detection efficiency.
These rules span diverse threats, including operating systems (Windows, Linux), cyber threat intelligence (CTI), network activities, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).

With Sekoia, you can also easily create and customize detection rules using a user-friendly console. It is also possible to manage rules at scale centrally through GitHub ([have a look to our dedicated blog article to learn more about this](https://blog.sekoia.io/getting-started-with-detection-as-code-and-sekoia-platform/)).
Sekoia native rules and user-built custom rules rely on four powerful detection engines:

* **IoC-matching:** Match observed activities with known IoCs.
* **SIGMA:** Industry-standard, vendor-agnostic detection rules.
* **SIGMA Correlation:** Advanced threat correlation capabilities.
* **Anomaly detection:** Identify abnormal patterns in vast datasets.

### SIGMA standard: Open and transparent detection framework

QRadar mostly rely on a proprietary Custom Rules Engine (CRE) with a complex and rigid syntax, requiring specialized training to write and maintain rules. While powerful, these rules are vendor-locked, making them non-portable across other platforms and limiting flexibility during migrations or tool integrations.
In contrast, **SIGMA is an open, platform-agnostic standard** designed for clarity, portability, and collaboration:

* **Open standard**: SIGMA rules use a vendor-neutral YAML format, ensuring compatibility across multiple security platforms.
* **Ease of use:** The human-readable syntax makes rule creation and adjustments straightforward, reducing the need for specific skills.
* **Community-driven :** A global cybersecurity community actively maintains and improves the SIGMA framework, ensuring alignment with evolving threats and continuous updates.
* **Flexibility:** Rules can be easily customized to reduce false positives and fine-tune detection accuracy.

### Advanced IoC-hunting capabilities

Sekoia is redefining how companies approach IoC matching. Unlike ...
