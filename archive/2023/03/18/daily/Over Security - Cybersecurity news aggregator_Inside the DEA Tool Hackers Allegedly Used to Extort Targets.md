Hackers accused of using law enforcement tools and other tactics to extort people online gained access to a sensitive, password protected portal run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to a screenshot of the portal obtained by Motherboard.

The new screenshot and other information provides some more clarity on charges unsealed against Sagar Steven Singh, 19, and Nicholas Ceraolo, 25, [earlier this week](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkae7g/nobody-is-safe-in-wild-hacking-spree-hackers-accessed-federal-law-enforcement-database). That pair, who were at one point part of a group called “ViLE,” allegedly went on a wide-spanning hacking spree. That included breaking into the federal U.S. law enforcement portal; using a hacked Bangladeshi police officer’s email account to fraudulently request user data from a social media company; and trying to use it to buy facial recognition services too.

“EPIC Portal,” the top of the screenshot reads, referring to the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC). EPIC is a multiagency intelligence center led by the DEA with 21 participating agencies, [according to the DEA’s website](https://www.dea.gov/what-we-do/law-enforcement/epic). The mission of EPIC is not just limited to drugs, but also [includes terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering, and more](https://americansecuritytoday.com/doj-oig-deas-el-paso-intelligence-center-learn/).

The portal appears to provide access to a variety of tools, including one labeled as “LPR,” according to the screenshot. LPR typically refers to license plate readers, which are cameras that take photographs of vehicles as they pass certain points and record where a certain vehicle was at a particular time. A [2010 email obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/33552-33575_2014.01.31_-_DEA_Response.pdf) says that federal, state, and local agencies have the ability to query an “LPR database via EPIC.” A [report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/reports/DEA/a1005.pdf) says EPIC has access to the “DEA’s License Plate Reader Database,” which stores license plate information captured along the Southwest border.

The screenshot also includes “HSIN,” which is the Homeland Security Information Network, [which is used to share intelligence among agencies](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/A%20Fusion%20Center_s%20Role%20During%20Mass%20Casualty%20Events.pdf). The EPIC Portal also provides other areas for users to explore, such as “seizures,” “reports,” and “global drug pricing,” according to the screenshot. (In [the complaint against Singh and Ceraolo](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23710817-ceraolo-complaint), prosecutors wrote that “Data available through the Portal is not classified but is sensitive and includes detailed, nonpublic records of narcotics and currency seizures, as well as law enforcement intelligence reports.”)

The screenshot also shows access to “Jetway/Pipeline,” referring to two different types of training that teach officers [how to interdict at airports and highways respectively](https://www.iadlest.org/Portals/0/Repository/FedDirectory/Flyers/DEA%20EPIC%20Training.pdf?ver=2020-02-14-121054-770), and the [Deconfliction and Information Coordination Endeavor (DICE)](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/QFR%20Responses%20-%20DOJ%20-%202021-10-27.pdf), which helps law enforcement officials not double up on investigations.

In May 2022, Singh, also known as Weep, allegedly logged into the portal from the same IP address he had previously used to access a social media account registered to him, according to the complaint. Records from Singh’s computer and the government servers themselves...
