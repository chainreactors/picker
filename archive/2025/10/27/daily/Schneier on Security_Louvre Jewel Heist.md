## Louvre Jewel Heist

I assume I don’t have to explain last week’s [Louvre jewel heist](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/19/world/europe/louvre-paris-robbery.html). I love a good caper, and have (like [many others](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/opinion/louvre-heist-internet-thrill.html)) eagerly followed the [details](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/louvre-museum-robbery-thieves-stolen-jewellery). An electric ladder to a second-floor window, an angle grinder to get into the room and the display cases, security guards there more to protect patrons than valuables—seven minutes, in and out.

There were [security lapses](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/praise-louvre-heist/684677/):

> The Louvre, it turns out—at least certain nooks of the ancient former palace—is something like an anopticon: a place where no one is observed. The world now knows what the four thieves (two burglars and two accomplices) realized as recently as last week: The museum’s Apollo Gallery, which housed the stolen items, was monitored by a single outdoor camera angled away from its only exterior point of entry, a balcony. In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world’s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space. There is no surveillance footage of the break-in.

Professional jewelry thieves were not impressed with the four. Here’s [Larry Lawton](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/europe/louvre-heist-jewelry-thieves.html):

> “I robbed 25, 30 jewelry stores—20 million, 18 million, something like that,” Mr. Lawton said. “Did you know that I never dropped a ring or an earring, no less, a crown worth 20 million?”

He thinks that they had a compatriot on the inside.

Museums, especially smaller ones, are good targets for theft because they rarely secure what they hold to its true value. They can’t; it would be prohibitively expensive. This makes them an attractive target.

We might find out soon. It looks like some people have been [arrested](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/europe/louvre-heist-arrests.html)

Not being out of the country—out of the EU—by now was sloppy. Leaving DNA evidence was sloppy. I can hope the criminals were sloppy enough not to have disassembled the jewelry by now, but I doubt it. They were probably taken apart within hours of the theft.

The whole thing is sad, really. Unlike stolen paintings, those jewels have no value in their original form. They need to be [taken apart](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/louvre-robbery-stolen-jewels-jeweler-paris-france/) and sold in pieces. But then their value drops considerably—so the end result is that most of the worth of those items disappears. It would have been much better to pay the thieves not to rob the Louvre.

Lucky we were, they were only burglars.

Numerous security problems of the Louvres are reported by the serious financial auditor Cour des Comptes (French entity “similar” to the Government Accountability Office). This audit isn’t public yet.

You could pay 8 billion people not to rob the Louvre, or you could pay one person to be a security guard. Hummm…

*He thinks that they had a compatriot on the inside.*

Compatriot? Did you (or Lawton, if that’s his wording) mean to say “co-conspirator”?

@ Anonymous Cow, ALL,

> “Compatriot? Did you (or Lawton, if that’s his wording) mean to say “co-conspirator”?”

Compatriot and Co-conspirator are very far from being mutually exclusive.

However the use of “Co-Conspirator” is notoriously used by US Federal Law Enforcement / Guard Labour as a “legal catch all”. Basically to ensure a conviction such that they won’t have to pay out huge amounts of compensation to those they have accused effectively unlawfully.

You can be found guilty of it just by being in the same place as other people such as a public room or open space where refreshments are served.

Even though you had no communication with the other people, and in some cases could not (speaking only English when the alleged conspirators only spoke arabic).
