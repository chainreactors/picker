The blog post aims to evaluate the Monitor material coverage app features WRT  classical tools MD04 and MD07 with use cases.

Please go through the previous blog for other use cases while comparing MD04-MD07- Monitor Material coverage app

**Use Case 3**: Material type – Raw material, Initial stock -0, No supply elements, Future demand exits.

Let us create future demand (Say tomorrow) by creating a manual reservation -MB21

**Use Case 4** : Material type – Raw material, Initial stock -200, No supply elements, Future demand exits and surplus situation.

The above screens show the surplus situation in MD04, MD07, and Green bars in the Material coverage app.

Let us add future demand.

There are many blog posts on features of the Monitor material coverage app. I will not repeat them, however, will put a few screenshots to cover a few important features.

When you access Manage materials, you will get into the monitor coverage app, which looks like the one below.

The stock requirement list in Fiori would look like below when MRP is run

You can see that you can easily edit PO date and other options.

Conclusion: Material coverage and monitor material apps are very useful apps which add value to existing MD07 transaction.

Do give feedback on any other important features I may have missed comparing these objects.
