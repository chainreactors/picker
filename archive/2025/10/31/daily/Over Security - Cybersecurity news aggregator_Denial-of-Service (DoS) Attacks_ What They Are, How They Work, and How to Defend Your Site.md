![Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Denial-of-Service-Attacks-820x385.png)

If your website suddenly crawls to a halt, pages time out, or customers report they can’t log in, you might be staring down a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. These incidents don’t require exotic zero-days or deep levels of access. More often, they’re brutally simple: overwhelm the target with traffic or requests until legitimate users can’t get through. For online businesses, the end result is the same: lost revenue, support tickets piling up, and shaken trust.

Below we’ll go over some DoS basics: what a DoS attack is, how it differs from **distributed** variants (**D**DoS), what happens under the hood, common techniques, the warning signs, and practical steps to reduce your risk and respond effectively.

## What is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack?

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyberattack designed to make a system (website, API, or application) unavailable to its intended users. The attacker overwhelms the target with requests or otherwise disrupts normal operations so that legitimate traffic can’t be processed. The defining trait of a traditional DoS is its origin: it typically comes from a **single source**.

In practice, attackers aim to exceed *some* bottleneck, whether it’s the CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, application thread pools, or database connections. Once that bottleneck is saturated, every legitimate request starts to feel sluggish or fails outright. Even short outages can translate into real losses for ecommerce, SaaS, or media sites.

### DoS vs. DDoS (and why the distinction matters)

You’ll often hear “DoS” and “DDoS” used interchangeably, but they’re not the same:

* **DoS:** Traffic originates from one host or a small number of hosts acting together.
* **DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service):** Traffic originates simultaneously from multiple sources, typically a botnet of compromised devices. This distribution makes filtering far more challenging and amplifies the total volume.

From a defender’s point of view, the *mechanics* of denial (exhausting resources) are similar in both cases. The difference is scale and complexity. A single-source DoS may be blocked or rate-limited at the edge; a widespread DDoS typically requires layered mitigation and, often, outside help (e.g., a scrubbing provider). It’s also common for a smaller DoS to evolve into a DDoS once the attacker sees initial success.

## What actually happens during a DoS attack?

The goal in a DoS attack is to push the target past normal operating capacity. Attackers will:

1. **Generate excessive requests or packets:** Far more than the system is designed to handle.
2. **Exploit resource limits:** Like filling a memory buffer or tying up CPU with expensive operations (think: expensive database queries or heavy dynamic rendering).
3. **Trigger instability:** Slowdowns, timeouts, crashes, or watchdog restarts. Even if your infrastructure auto-recovers, the repeated churn can keep you effectively offline.

Although the public often associates DoS with “big traffic numbers,” many attacks don’t need astronomical bandwidth. A precisely crafted request that forces the app to do a lot of work (server-side rendering, large search aggregation, or repeated cache misses) can deny service with surprisingly little traffic.

## The main categories of DoS attacks

While there are many ways to cause denial-of-service, most tactics fall into two broad categories.

### 1) Buffer overflow–style attacks

**Buffer overflow** attacks aim to overwhelm a memory buffer (or related resource) until the system misbehaves: slowed performance, service crashes, or outright kernel panics. Historically, buffer overflows were also a path to arbitrary code execution; in the DoS context, the attacker’s goal is instability, not necessarily control. Side effects often include spikes in CPU and memory, filled disks (via log storms or files), and persistent service restarts that keep the site unavailable.

### 2) Flood-style attacks

**Flood attacks** bombard a system with more packets or requests than it can handle. Success depends on the attacker’s ability to outpace the target’s capacity for accepting, p...
