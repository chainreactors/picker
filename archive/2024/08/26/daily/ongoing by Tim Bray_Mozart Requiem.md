Vancouver has many choirs, with differing proficiency levels and repertoire
choices. Most gather fall-to-spring and take the summer off. Thus,
[Summerchor](https://www.facebook.com/SummerChor/), which aggregates a couple of hundred singers from many choirs to
tackle one of the Really Big choral pieces each August. This year it was the
[Mozart Requiem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_%28Mozart%29). Mozart died while writing this work and there are
many “completions” by other composers. Consider just
[the Modern completions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_completions_of_Mozart%27s_Requiem); this performance
was of
[Robert Levin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_completions_of_Mozart%27s_Requiem)’s.

[![Mozart’s Requiem performed in St. Andrews-Wesley](PXL_20240825_020725834.png "Mozart’s Requiem performed in St. Andrews-Wesley")](-big/PXL_20240825_020725834.jpg.html)

Summerchor performs Mozart’s Requiem in
[St.Andrews-Wesley United Church](https://standrewswesley.com), August 24, 2024.

The 200 singers were assisted by four soloists, a piano, a trombone, the church’s excellent pipe organ, and finally, of
course, by the towering arched space.

The combined power of Mozart’s music, the force of massed voices, and the loveliness of the great room yielded a
entirely overwhelming torrent of beauty. I felt like my whole body was being squeezed.

Obviously, in an hour-long work, some parts are stronger than others. For me, the opening *Requiem Aeternum* and
*Kyrie* hit hard, then the absolutely wonderful ascending line opening the *Domine Jesu* totally crushed me.
But for every one of the three-thousand-plus seconds, I was left in no doubt that I was experiencing about as much beauty as
a human being can.

God? ·
We were in a house of worship. The words we were listening to were liturgical, excerpted from Scripture. What, then, of the
fact that
[I am actively hostile](/ongoing/When/202x/2022/08/24/On-Faith) to religion? Yeah, I freely acknowledge that all
this beauty I’m soaking up is founded on faith. Other people’s faith, of other times. The proportion of people who profess that
(or any) faith is monotonically declining, maybe not everywhere, but certainly where I live.

Should I feel sad about that?
Not really; The fact that architects and musicians worked for the Church is related to the fact that the Church was willing to
pay. Musicians can manage without God, generally, as long as they’re getting paid.

The sound ·
We’ve been going out to concerts quite a lot recently so of course I’ve been
[writing about it](/ongoing/What/Arts/Music/), and usually discussing the sound quality too.

The sound at the Requiem was beyond awesome. If you look at the picture above you can see there’s a soundboard
and a guy sitting at it, but I’m pretty sure the only boost was on the piano, which had to compete with 200 singers and the
organ. So, this was the usual classical-music scenario: If you want dynamic range, or to hear soloists, or to blend parts, you
do that with musical skill and human throats and fingers and a whole lot of practice. There’s no knob to twirl.

I mean,
[I love well-executed electric sound](/ongoing/When/202x/2024/05/26/TTB), but large-scale classical, done well, is on
a whole other level.

Above, I mentioned the rising line at the opening of the Domine Jesu; the pulses, and the space between them,
rose up in the endless vertical space as they rose up the scale, and yet were clearly clipped at start and end, because you
don’t get that much reverb
when the pews are full of soft human flesh and the roof is made of old wood, no matter how big the church is. I just don’t have
words for how wonderful it sounded.

Classical? ·
Obviously, this is what is conventionally called “classical” music. But I’m getting a little less comfortable with that term,
especially the connotation that it’s “music for old people” (even though I am one of those). Because so is
[rootsy rock music](/ongoing/When/202x/2024/05/26/TTB) and
[bluegrass and Americana](/ongoing/When/202x/2024/08/11/Countrywomen) and
[GoGo Pengin](/ongoing/When/202x/2024/06/23/Lounge-Penguin) and
[Guns N’ Roses](/ongoing/When/202x/2023/10/17/Rock-Tech).

I was one of the singers, and your beautifully-written and beautifully-thought blog brought the magic of the concert back. It was a wonderful experience and I was honoured to be part of it, and I thank you for sharing in it.

How thrilling was this to read your heart-warming response to this performance. After working with Alison Nixon's vision of the piece for 8 weeks it was so good to know that your experience, so eloquently expressed, fulfilled our dreams. Thank you so much. From a singer's perspective it was a pleasure to warm St. Andrews space with such a magnificent work of sheer genius. I'm so glad it touched your heart and soul as it was given from ours.

As an exuberant chorister singing this Mozart’s Requiem I want to acknowledge how wonderfully you’ve captured the impact of this work and the acknowledgment of SummerChor’s performance which couldn’t have happened without the excellent direction under conductor, Alison Nixon. Thank you.

This is sort of the opposite of Mozart’s Requiem but I thought you might appreciate the sparse guitar arrangement. “Funeral March” by Damnation A.D. (after Chopin’s Marche funèbre): <https://open.spotify.com/track/4VNZ8Uv3RMSMtHJpot7HPG?si=LFfHG5stQMKW0CA1X6_jqg&context=spotify%3Aalbum%3A11pZOk9vRfw69ZscOpL5rd>

The whole album is (in my humble opinion) an imminently classic work in the hardcore genre with obvious metal influences. Probably not what you would normally go for but I’d love to hear your opinion on it nonetheless.
