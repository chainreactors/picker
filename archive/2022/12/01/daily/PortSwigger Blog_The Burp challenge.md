We recently launched [the Burp challenge](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/burp-challenge), to give our customers a unique opportunity to demonstrate their skills with [Burp Suite Professional](/burp/pro). Not only that, but the challenges involved put your web vulnerability skills and knowledge, recon, and efficiency to the test.

To keep things fun along the way, we're also introducing unique mini challenges every week. If you complete the mini challenge, within the given time frame, you'll be entered into a prize draw to win exclusive Burp Suite swag.

## How does the Burp challenge work?

If you can complete all four stages of the Burp challenge, by 31 December 2022, you'll be awarded an exam credit for our Burp Suite Certified Practitioner certification completely free of charge. That's because by completing all four stages, we believe you're well and truly prepared to take and pass the exam.

Stage one - [complete one practitioner-level lab from each of the required topics](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/burp-challenge#1-complete-one-practitioner-lab-from-each-of-the-topics).

Stage two - [complete eight specific labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/burp-challenge#2-complete-eight-specific-labs).

Stage three - [complete five different practitioner-level mystery labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/burp-challenge#3-complete-five-practitioner-level-mystery-labs).

Stage four - [take and pass the practice exam](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/burp-challenge#4-take-and-pass-the-practice-exam).

## The mini challenges

The mini challenges have been designed to help you work your way through the preparation steps, in an enjoyably challenging and manageable way. Anybody can attempt the mini challenges, and each week five lucky winners will be selected to win exclusive prizes.
