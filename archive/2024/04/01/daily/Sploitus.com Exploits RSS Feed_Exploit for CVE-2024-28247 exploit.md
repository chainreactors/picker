# CVE-2024-28247 Pi-hole Arbitrary File Read

## Description
This repository contains an exploit for CVE-2024-28247, a high vulnerability (CVSS 7.6) discovered in Pi-hole, a DNS sinkhole widely used to block advertisements and track domains at the network level.

The vulnerability arises from the mishandling of file paths when accessed via the "file://" handler, allowing a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.

Exploiting this vulnerability enables the attacker to control the path of the files to read, thereby permitting the reading of arbitrary files on the system with root privileges.

Such a security flaw not only breaches the system's data confidentiality but also undermines its integrity by allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Affected Versions:
- Up to Pi-hole version 5.17.3, with the issue resolved in version 5.18.

## Installation
Ensure Python is installed on your system to utilize this exploit. Clone the repository and set up the necessary environment as follows:

```bash

cd CVE-2024-28247-Pi-hole-Arbitrary-File-Read
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
