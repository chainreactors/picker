![How to make your website GDPR compliant](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/How-to-make-your-website-GDPR-compliant-820x385.png)

There is a straightforward reason GDPR keeps legal teams awake at night: fines can reach [£17,500,000 or 4% of global annual revenue](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/83), whichever is higher. Across the incident reports studied over the past few years, the businesses that took the largest reputational hits weren’t the ones that suffered an intrusion, but the ones that held personal data without clear consent or failed to report a breach in time. GDPR compliance protects customers, but it also lowers breach impact, shortens forensics time, and keeps regulators away from the door.

Below is a step-by-step plan anchored in those lessons. Follow each phase, verify every control, and you will meet the letter of the regulation while raising your security baseline.

## 1. Inventory and Map Personal Data

### Threat in focus

Attackers target personal data because it converts quickly on underground markets. When organizations do not have a current data inventory, incident response teams waste precious hours establishing what was stored and where. Those hours translate directly into fine calculations, as GDPR’s [72-hour notification clock](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/33) does not pause for guesswork.

### Action plan

* **List [all entry points](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-a-hacked-website/) where users can give data:** Contact forms, checkout pages, live-chat transcripts, tracking pixels, and log files.
* For each entry point, document the specific items collected (name, email, IP, behavior analytics).
* **Identify all storage locations:** Production databases, development copies, CMS backups, third-party SaaS exports, and downloadable reports.
* Create a simple data-flow diagram that shows how information moves through the environment.
* Remove redundant data sets at the end of their legitimate business purpose and set automated retention periods.

### Verification

Search for dark-data copies by scanning servers for files older than expected and by querying the database for tables that mirror current ones. Sucuri users can leverage the Platform’s [file integrity monitoring](https://sucuri.net/website-security-platform/malware-scanning-and-detection) to alert when unexpected archives appear.

## 2. Refresh Privacy Disclosures and Keep Them Plain

### Threat in focus

[GDPR Article 12](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/12) penalizes ambiguous or legalese-heavy policies. Regulators have already ruled that hiding consent details inside labyrinthine wording fails the “transparent and intelligible” standard. Attackers exploit this confusion through look-alike sites that collect data under the guise of an official policy.

### Action plan

* Rewrite the privacy statement in conversational language it’s easy to understand.
* Disclose the exact data categories, processing purposes, and retention time.
* Publish the identity and contact details of the Data Protection Officer or privacy lead.
* Add a concise summary before the full text for mobile users who skim.
* Timestamp version changes and keep an accessible changelog.

### Verification

Ask a colleague outside the legal or tech team to read the policy and explain it back. If they hesitate, it is not plain enough.

## 3. Secure, Explicit, and Granular Consent

### Threat in focus

Pre-checked boxes and bundled consents could trigger six-figure penalties. Attackers also use these sloppy consent flows to inject malicious fields or scripts, stealing credentials during registration.

### Action plan

* Replace every pre-selected checkbox with an unchecked one.
* Separate marketing, analytics, and required operational data into individual toggles.
* Offer a home-built panel for users to adjust choices later.
* Log consent at the field level with timestamp, IP, and policy version.
* Block tracking scripts and third-party tags until the user opts in.

### Implementation tip

Many WordPress users reach for plug-ins to handle banners but forget server-side logging. Store consent logs in the primary database and [back them up](https://sucuri.net/website-backups/) with encrypted snapshots.
