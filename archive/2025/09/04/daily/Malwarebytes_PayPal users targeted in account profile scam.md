# PayPal users targeted in account profile scam

Posted: September 3, 2025

*A co-worker forwarded this rather convincing PayPal scam to me. Thanks Elena.*

A highly sophisticated email scam is targeting PayPal users with the subject line of “Set up your account profile.”

We decided to see what the scammers are after. First thing to do is to look at the headers:

![email header looks legitimate](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/header_red.jpg)

The sender address service@paypal.com (sometimes the emails come from service@paypal.co.uk) looks legitimate because it is, but the scammers have spoofed the address.

Basically, when someone sends an email, their computer tells the email system what address to show as the sender. Scammers take advantage of this by using special software or programs that let them type in any “From” address they want. This technique is called [spoofing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing). The scammer sends their email through the internet, and since most email systems aren’t strict about checking this information, the fake sender address is displayed just like a real one would be.

So it’s hard for the everyday user to tell if the email has been spoofed or not.

There are other signs that the email might be a scam though. There is the unusual recipient address, which is nothing like the one of my co-worker. Rather than targeting one individual, scammers set up a distribution list (often using Microsoft 365/Google test domains) with their own domain or, in this case, a compromised one. This allows them to send bulk phishing emails while masking their intent, but does mean that recipients see an unfamiliar address, e.g. {somebody}@{unknow-domain}.test-google-a.com, instead of their own.

The “.test-google-a.com” part of the address refers to a domain often used in testing or in cloud setups through Google Workspace, but in the context of this scam email, it’s a strong indicator of malicious activity or advanced phishing techniques rather than official Google practice. So, that’s red flag #1.

When looking at the email itself, the subject line has nothing to do with what the email is asking the target to do. That’s red flag #2.

![The Paypal account profile set up email](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/email_cropped_red.jpg)
> “**Set up your PayPal account profile**
> New Profile Charge: We have detected a new payment profile with a charge of $910.45 USD at Kraken.com. To dispute, contact PayPal at (805) 500-8413. Otherwise, no action is required. PayPal accept automatic pending bill from this account.Your New PayPal Account added you to the Crypto Wallet account.
> Your user ID: Receipt43535e
> Use this link to finish setting up your profile for this account. The link will expire in 24 hours.”

The layout of the email looks convincing enough, likely copied from an actual PayPal email.

The content however is typical for a phishing email:

* Urgency: The link will expire in 24 hours.
* Amount: Over $900 dollars to grab your attention
* Crypto wallet: most people have only a vague notion of how crypto wallets work, so they don’t see the lie immediately. And Kraken.com is a crypto trading platform, so there is no discrepancy there.
* The phone number listed is [known by the Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/lookupscam?q=scammer_phone%3D805-50...
