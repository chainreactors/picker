# Tea Dating Advice app has users’ private messages disclosed

Posted: July 29, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A few days after Tea Dating Advice discovered unauthorized access to one of its systems that leaked 72,000 user images, the popular mobile app faced a second issue involving a separate database, as a researcher reported to [404Media](https://www.404media.co/a-second-tea-breach-reveals-users-dms-about-abortions-and-cheating) that they were able to access private conversations.

Tea Dating Advice, or just Tea for short, aims to provide a space for women to exchange information about men they know, have met, or dated in the past. The app seeks to provide a platform for people to share relevant information about, say, potentially abusive partners, and it claims to have more than 1.6 million users. After approving a new user, the system allows them to search for men by name, find people they know, and leave comments about them. Theoretically, men can’t access the app, so they have no recourse if they’re drowning in red flags and warnings on Tea.

The set of leaked images includes 13,000 selfies and photo [IDs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/internet-safety-tips-for-kids) submitted for account verification including driver license photos, as well as 59,000 images from posts, comments, and direct messages.

While Tea [acknowledged](https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident) that a [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) occurred on a legacy data storage system, resulting in unauthorized access to a dataset from prior to February 2024, this is a completely different breach, and even worse for those involved. The researcher was able to see over a million private messages, stretching from early 2023 up until last week.

Kasra Rahjerdi, the researcher who flagged the issue, provided a database of more than 1.1 million messages to prove his findings. With the content of these messages at hand, it was trivial to find social media profiles, telephone numbers, and the real-world identities of most users.

They found messages from women discussing abortions, cheating partners, and other sensitive info.

One internet forum, 4chan, openly shared the images exposed in the first breach, but Rahjerdi informed only Tea and 404Media about his latest work, providing enough information to confirm their findings. But there is no way of knowing whether others used the same method to access Tea’s private messages.

Aside from how you might feel about the Tea app, its purpose, the users, and those intent on destroying it, the developers could have anticipated the scrutiny and attacks on their infrastructure. Leaks happen everywhere, but sensitive data should not be stored unencrypted. And, while Tea claims to donate 10% of it profits to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the company still has a responsibility of safety (through cybersecurity) to its own users.

A Tea app spokesperson limited their statement to:

> “We have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure our systems. At this time, we have implemented additional security measures and have fixed the data issue.”

Tea Dating Advice users will have to be vigilant since [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attacks banking on these incidents might occur.
