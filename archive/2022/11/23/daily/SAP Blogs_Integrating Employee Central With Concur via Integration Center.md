As a system of record, SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central is where all employee master data is housed and the employee lifecycle is managed.

When using  SAP Concur for your Travel and Expenses processes, it’s important to ensure that employee data is available in Concur so that it can be used in those processes.

As a SuccessFactors Employee Central customer, you can benefit from Integration Center to integrate data between SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Concur.
