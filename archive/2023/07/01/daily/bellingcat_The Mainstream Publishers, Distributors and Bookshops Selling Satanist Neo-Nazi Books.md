# The Mainstream Publishers, Distributors and Bookshops Selling Satanist Neo-Nazi Books

Books associated with a Satanist Neo-Nazi group are being sold and distributed in the US by mainstream outlets including Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

At time of publication, Bellingcat found that literature associated with the Order of the Nine Angles (O9A) and its US affiliate Tempel ov Blood (ToB) are being sold in the US as well as a number of international retailers.

In line with O9A ideology the books commonly promote the use of vicious tactics to subvert society such as advocating for ritual murder of civilians. Much of the content is presented in a mystical language and setting, but includes more specific real world Neo-Nazi references including describing the Holocaust as a lie and praising Nazi Germany.

Retailers, bookshops, publishers and distributors involved in the supply and sale of these books may not be aware of the graphic content contained within them, nor their links to the O9A group. However Bellingcat’s investigation uncovered how easy it was to access books and symbols related to the group via mainstream retailers and publishers.

## What is the O9A?

The Order of Nine Angles (O9A) is “[intrinsically intertwined with Nazism](https://hopenothate.org.uk/2019/02/16/state-of-hate-2019-order-of-nine-angles/),” according to a 2019 report on the far-right by HOPE not Hate – the UK’s largest anti-racism and anti-extremism organisation. Variously described as a [network](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2021.2024944), [sect](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/the-satanist-neo-nazi-plot-to-murder-u-s-soldiers-1352629/), or [cult](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d3xxb/neo-nazi-pedophile-cult-arrest-order-of-nine-angles), the O9A follows an ideology that combines Neo-Nazism, wiccan elements and satanism.

The [report](https://hopenothate.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/state-of-hate-2019-final.pdf) outlines that disruption and subversion are key tactics widely encouraged by O9A. Its followers believe that “civilisation must be undermined and destroyed from within, so adherents are encouraged to be as grubby and horrible as they like – committing crimes, random acts of violence, sexual assaults, and even the ‘culling’ of human victims.”

According to HOPE not Hate the group emerged in Shropshire in the UK in the 1960s from a collection of occultist groups. Despite initially having small numbers, limited reach and a decentralised structure, chapters began to emerge in other places partly due to the spread of O9A ideas online as people sought out the “edgiest” positions. People affiliated with the group have been convicted of serious crimes including Ethan Melzer, 24, of Louisville, Kentucky.

Melzer, a former US Army paratrooper, was [sentenced](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ethan-melzer-defense-sentencing-memo.pdf) to [45 years in prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-us-army-soldier-sentenced-45-years-prison-attempting-murder-fellow-service) in March 2023 for a number of charges including attempted murder of US service members and unlawful transmission of national defence information. Melzer [had been](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ethan-melzer-prosecution-sentencing-memo.pdf) interacting with O9A members from the “[Rapewaffen Division](https://hopenothate.org.uk/2020/06/23/the-rapewaffen-telegram-channel/)” on Telegram. Before his arrest he had formed a subgroup “Op Hardrock,” where prosecutors allege Melzer discussed the planned attack. Melzer pleaded guilty to charges and told the court: “I regret every single thing I did.”

According to his defence attorney, Melzer was “[in thrall to a bizarre satanic cult](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ethan-melzer-defense-sentencing-memo.pdf) with white supremacist and ‘accelerationist’ political beliefs, the Order of the Nine Angles (“O9A”), that he had discovered in obscure corners of the internet the year before.”

## What are O9A-affiliated books?

Like O9A itself, the networks of books related to the group are loosely defined. Bellingcat defined O9A-affiliated books as those which list ‘Order of Nine Angles’ or ‘O9A’ in the title or as the author (these are generally self-published works), as well as books that list ‘Tempel ov Blood’ as the author or ‘Martinet Press’ as the publisher of the books. Bellingcat is not naming or linking to active sale links to [prevent amplification](https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1_PART_1_Oxygen_of_Amplification_DS.pdf).

Traditional O9A books commonly describe the Holocaust as a lie, advocate for ritual murder (which they refer to as ‘culling’) while Tempel ov Blood books have even more disturbing content, for example glorifying sexual exploitation of children.

[Patrik Hermansson](https://twitter.com/patrik_h?lang=en), a senior researcher at HOPE not Hate who has [published](https://hopenothate.org.uk/2020/06/23/the-rapewaffen-telegram-channel/) on O9A, told Bellingcat that O9A-affiliated books typically describe ritualistic ceremonies including human sacrifice in vague terms.

But towards the end of the texts, the vague discussion often turns into more concrete suggestions of how to improvise attacks using modern weapons.

“Then it’s back to just straight-up arguing terrorism, but it comes at the end of this very strange ceremony that makes it past the censors first. So it will add this mythological layer over everything.”

Hermansson outlines that O9A-affiliated books are used in ritualistic ceremonies and spread O9A ideology ultimately giving adherents clout within the community.

“You don’t buy a book just to read it, you buy [a Tempel ov Blood book] to smear your own blood over it and take pictures with it.”

## How do the Books Attain Wide Reach?

Bellingcat found that mainstream retailers, bookshops, publishers and distributors were involved in the supply and sale of these books including outlets such as Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

We contacted all retailers, bookshops, publishers and distributors involved in the supply and sale of these books identified in this article including Amazon, Ingram, Martinet Press, Indigo, and Bol.c...
