AI agents are changing the way businesses work. They can answer questions, automate tasks, and create better user experiences. But with this power comes new risks — like data leaks, identity theft, and malicious misuse.

If your company is exploring or already using AI agents, you need to ask: **Are they secure?**

AI agents work with sensitive data and make real-time decisions. If they're not protected, attackers can exploit them to steal information, spread misinformation, or take control of systems.

Join Michelle Agroskin, Product Marketing Manager at **Auth0**, for a free, expert-led webinar — [Building AI Agents Securely](https://thehacker.news/ai-agents-security?source=article) — that breaks down the most important AI security issues and what you can do about them.

### **What You'll Learn:**

* **What AI Agents Are:** Understand how AI agents work and why they're different from chatbots or traditional apps.
* **What Can Go Wrong:** Learn about real risks — like adversarial attacks, data leakage, and identity misuse.
* **How to Secure Them:** Discover proven methods and tools to protect your AI agents and earn user trust.

This is not a sales pitch. It's a practical, no-fluff session with real strategies you can use today. Whether you're already building with AI or just getting started, this webinar will help you stay ahead of threats.
