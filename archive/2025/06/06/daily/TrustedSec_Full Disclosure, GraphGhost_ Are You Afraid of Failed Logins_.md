Another year, another vulnâ€¦It's that time again.

Last year I disclosed the existence of [***GraphNinja***](https://trustedsec.com/blog/full-disclosure-a-look-at-a-recently-patched-microsoft-graph-logging-bypass-graphninja) - a (now fixed) vulnerability in Azure where you could password spray and remain undetected. Well, the Ghost of ***GraphNinja*** is here: another logging failure in Entra ID that could be abused by attackers. And, since Microsoft has fixed it, I'm allowed to tell you about it.

**TL;DR:** There was a logging/reporting problem in Azure where attackers could determine if a password was valid, while showing as a 'failed' login in the logs. It's fixed now.

Sorry, I know - no new hawtness. I hate these types of posts too, but I think it's important for people to know that it existed, because mum's the word from Microsoft.

## Background

Entra ID (previously Azure AD) is the identity portion of Azure. It's really at the core of all of Azure, managing users, apps, and permissions. Sign-in logs are generated by users and applications when they connect to Azure services. As an Azure admin, these logs are your only source of information.

While the cloud simplifies various aspects of IT management, it does so at a cost. As an Azure admin, you are entirely dependent upon the logs provided to you by your cloud provider. You get what you are given. So, what happens when the cloud provider makes a mistake in their logic? You are deprived of logs, or have erroneous logs. I'm not sure which is worse, not knowing or being told the wrong answer.

This type of logging logic has happened at least once before. ***GraphNinja***, a complete logging bypass, had existed in Azure, potentially for years. [Here is my blog post on it.](https://trustedsec.com/blog/full-disclosure-a-look-at-a-recently-patched-microsoft-graph-logging-bypass-graphninja) This was a case of bad back-end logic. It worked like this: when authenticating to Azure via Graph, if you pointed the authentication to another tenant instead of the victim's tenant or the common endpoint, the auth attempt would not be logged to any tenant and would not show up in the Sign-in logs.

The ***GraphNinja*** bypass was simple. Change this:
