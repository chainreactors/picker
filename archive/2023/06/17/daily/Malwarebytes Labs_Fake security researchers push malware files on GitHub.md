# Fake security researchers push malware files on GitHub

Posted: June 16, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Researchers from VulnCheck have [observed a campaign](https://therecord.media/hackers-create-fake-github-profiles) using real security researchers as bait for [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware). The campaign goes to some lengths to appear genuine, using [fake profiles](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/catfishing), downloads, websites, and bogus GitHub profiles, to paint a convincing picture of security professionals offering up exploit code for popular programs.

The campaign included a network of fictitious Twitter accounts posing as employees of a firm called “High Sierra Cyber Security”. The Record notes that several photographs of real security researchers working at well known firms were [misused in the campaign](https://therecord.media/hackers-create-fake-github-profiles).

The tale begins in May of this year, with the discovery of a malicious GitHub repository claiming to be for a zero-day attack for the Signal messaging app. This bogus offering was taken down, but the group behind the page were determined to stick around.

New downloads were offered, but this time in the guise of the previously mentioned security entities. Every High Sierra Cyber Security account claiming to offer [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) for well known products was actually offering up malicious repositories harbouring malware. The supposedly exploitable products included Chrome, Discord, and Exchange. All popular programs, and guaranteed to grab the attention of anyone interested in the security space.

The people behind this leaned heavily into social media to make it all look real, promoting their “finds” on networks such as Twitter. This was a risky gambit for the creators of this malware scam. While it added legitimacy to the overall gameplan, it ran the risk of someone realising that one of the security researchers actually worked somewhere else. This is indeed exactly what happened, and more researchers were identified from the stolen images as the days went by.

The GitHub pages also leaned into social aspects, making use of popular tags like “discordapp”, “cve”, and “rce-exploits” to draw more potential victims in to look at the rogue pages. They must have known that using tags like that would guarantee actual security researchers taking a look and saying “Wait a minute…”

While the GitHub pages are all now offline, the fake Twitter accounts are still live. VulnCheck notes that if you’ve interacted with any of the GitHub pages and Twitter accounts listed on its advisory, you may have been compromised if you downloaded and executed the files.

The GitHub accounts and repositories discovered by VulnCheck are as follows:

**GitHub Accounts**

* github.com/AKuzmanHSCS
* github.com/RShahHSCS
* github.com/BAdithyaHSCS
* github.com/DLandonHSCS
* github.com/MHadzicHSCS
* github.com/GSandersonHSCS
* github.com/SSankkarHSCS

**Malicious Repositories**

* github.com/AKuzmanHSCS/Microsoft-Exchange-RCE
* github.com/MHadzicHSCS/Chrome-0-day
* github.com/GSandersonHSCS/discord-0-day-fix
* github.com/BAdithyaHSCS/Exchange-0-Day
* github.com/RShahHSCS/Discord-0-Day-Exploit
* github.com/DLandonHSCS/Discord-RCE
* github.com/SSankkarHSCS/Chromium-0-Day

If any of the above look familiar, and if you recognise any of the usernames from their matching Twitter accounts, it may well be time to r...
