Ember Bear (aka UAC-0056,Saint Bear, UNC2589, Lorec53, TA471, Nodaria, Nascent Ursa, LorecBear, Bleeding Bear, and DEV-0586)Â is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group believed to be based in Russia.

Their primary targets have been diplomatic and government entities in Europe, particularly Ukraine, and the United States. They have also targeted various industries, including defense, energy, and technology.

**APT Group Description**

**APT Group aliases:**

UAC-0056 (UA CERT)

Ember Bear (Crowdstrike)

Saint Bear (F-Secure)

UNC2589 (Fireeye, IBM)

Lorec53 (NSFOCUS)

TA471 (Proofpoint)

Nodaria (Symantec)

Nascent Ursa (Palo Alto)

LorecBear

Bleeding Bear (Elastic)

DEV-0586 (MIcrosoft)

The group is a suspected Russian state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least March 2021.

The group primarily targets Ukraine and Georgia, but has also targeted Western European and North American foreign ministries, pharmaceutical companies, and financial sector organizations.

The group is known for using various malicious implants such as GrimPlant, GraphSteel, and CobaltStrike Beacon, as well as spear phishing attacks with macro-embedded Excel documents.

In January 2022, the group performed a destructive wiper attack on multiple Ukrainian government computers and websites, known as WhisperGate.

The Lorec53 group is a new type of APT group first identified by NSFOCUS Security Labs, and was later identified as UAC-0056 by the Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Center.

The Lorec53 group primarily targets government workers in Ukraine and Georgia, trying to steal various types of document data or leave backdoor programs for subsequent attacks.

The group exhibits organizational characteristics similar to other known attack groups, but also demonstrates independence and the possibility of cooperating with other APT groups.

The Lorec53 group uses various social engineering techniques, temporary domain names, and unique Trojan horses, and is good at using network facilities of other hacker groups.

The group's attack timeline shows alternating attacks against Georgia and Ukraine, and as time progressed, its attack activity increased significantly, and the quality of each component in the attack process became higher and higher.

The Lorec53 group has strong infiltration ability and flexible attack methods, capable of organizing large-scale and frequent phishing attacks and good at harnessing social engineering technologies and network resource management methods learned from other threat actors.

Malware Arsenal

* **Graphiron**

+ Graphiron is a two-stage threat consisting of a downloader (Downloader.Graphiron) and a payload (Infostealer.Graphiron)
+ The downloader contains hardcoded command-and-control (C&C) server addresses
+ The downloader is configured to check against a blacklist of malware analysis tools and connect to a C&C server to download the payload, which is then added to autorun
+ The payload is capable of stealing information from Firefox and Thunderbird, private keys from MobaXTerm, SSH known hosts, stored passwords, taking screenshots, and exfiltrating data
+ The password theft is carried out using a PowerShell command
+ The payload communicates with the C&C server using port 443 and communications are encrypted using AES cipher
+ Graphiron has similarities with older Nodaria (UNC2589\_EmberBear\_BleedingBear\_Nodaria) tools such as GraphSteel and GrimPlant but can exfiltrate more data such as screenshots and SSH keys
+ Nodaria is a threat group active since at least March 2021, mainly targeting organizations in Ukraine and has also been linked to attacks in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia
+ The group uses spear-phishing emails to deliver a range of payloads to targets and their previous tools include Elephant Dropper, Elephant Downloader, SaintBot, OutSteel, GrimPlant, and GraphSteel
+ Nodaria's earlier tools were written in Go and Graphiron appears to be the latest piece of malware authored by the same developers, using Go version 1.18.

* **Elephant (GrimPlant (Backdoor) and GraphSteel (Stealer))**

+ The Elephant Framework consists of two core components: GrimPlant (Backdoor) and GraphSteel (Stealer).
+ GrimPlant allows remote execution of PowerShell commands and communicates with the C&C server using gRPC and encrypted with TLS.
+ GraphSteel exfiltrates data from infected machines by communicating with the C&C server using WebSockets and the GraphQL query language.
+ GraphSteel exfiltrates information about the infected system, files from various folders and drives, and credentials from various sources including wifi passwords, browser credentials, password vault, and SSH sessions.

* **GraphSteel Backdoor**

+ GrimPlant is a simple backdoor allowing for remote execution of PowerShell commands. Communication with the C2 server uses port 80 and is based on gRPC. The communications are encrypted with TLS, and its certificate is hardcoded in the binary. GraphSteel backdoor is designed to exfiltrate data from infected machines. Communication with the C&C server uses port 443 and is encrypted using the AES cipher. GraphQL query language is used for communication.
+ Attacks reported: GraphSteel & GrimPlant used in email phishing attacks on Ukrainian government organizations on April 26, 2022, March 28, 2022 and March 11, 2022 (Source: CERT-UA). GraphSteel and GrimPlant are both written in the Go language.
+ GrimPlant is a simple backdoor allowing for remote execution of PowerShell commands. Communication with the C2 server uses port 80 and is encrypted with TLS.
+ GraphSteel is designed to exfiltrate data from infected machines. Communication with the C&C server uses port 443 and is encrypted using AES cipher. GraphQL is used for communication.
+ APT responsible: UNC2589 (Ember Bear, Lorec53, UAC-0056)
+ Attacks reported: GraphSteel & GrimPlant were...
