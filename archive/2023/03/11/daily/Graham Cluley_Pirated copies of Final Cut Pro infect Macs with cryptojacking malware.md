Hopefully everyone reading this knows that Macs can be infected by malware, just like PCs.

And hopefully any Mac user reading this blog knows that they should be running anti-virus software on their Macs, just like they would (hopefully) on a Windows PC.

You‚Äôre barmy if you don‚Äôt.

Sure, there‚Äôs much more malware for Windows (by a large order of magnitude) than there is on macOS, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Macs are somehow magically immune from threats.

It‚Äôs simply the case that if you‚Äôre running a Mac, there are a lot less arrows being flung in your direction.

But if you do foolhardy things on your Mac, you can certainly come a cropper.

Take, for instance, if you decide that you don‚Äôt fancy paying the $300 or so that Apple charges for the Mac edition of Final Cut Pro.

Maybe you decide that because you can‚Äôt afford to pay that for video-editing software that you‚Äôll venture onto the internet instead, and see if you can download a pirated version of Final Cut Pro from a torrent instead.

Well, don‚Äôt you like living dangerously?

As security researchers at Jamf have [described](https://www.jamf.com/blog/cryptojacking-macos-malware-discovered-by-jamf-threat-labs/ "Link to Jamf blog post"), torrents on The Pirate Bay which claim to contain Final Cut Pro are instead being used to distribute cryptojacking malware to Macs.

If you do download the pirated version of ‚ÄúFinal Cut Pro‚Äù from a torrent, at installation you‚Äôll be greeted with a message which suggests that the software has become corrupted.

However, behind the scenes, your Mac is already covertly mining cryptocurrency on behalf of cybercriminals ‚Äì gobbling up your CPU cycles and giving your computer‚Äôs fan a good workout.

The lesson? Obviously you should always run up-to-date anti-virus software, but maybe you would also be wise to only install software from legitimate sources ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay to install pirated software.

According to Jamf, the person responsible for the poisoned Final Cut Pro torrents has uploaded numerous other malicious payloads that mine cryptocurrency since 2019.
