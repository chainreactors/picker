# WinFE Builds | The best choices

[Brett Shavers](https://winfe.wordpress.com/author/winfe/) / [August 18, 2024](https://winfe.wordpress.com/2024/08/18/winfe-builds-the-best-choices/)

**The Builds**

There are **two choices** in how to build a WinFE that I recommend. You are on your own to try any others, but these are the two that I have been involved in development and testing.

1. WinFE.net (ie: the Colin Ramsden build) <https://www.winfe.net/>
2. Mini-WinFE (ie: the PEBakery/Winbuilder build) <https://github.com/MistyFromReboot/Mini-WinFE>

**The easiest method of building**

```

**The Training**

WinFE is not a commercial tool, and there is no support. Therefore, you should not only self-learn but also consider taking some training in its construction and usage.

A free quickstart guide is here: <https://courses.dfir.training/opt-in-56206c2e-1c30-4957-826f-c16058b08d17>

**Some things to consider:**

WinFE is currently and intentionally stopped at Windows 10 because, with this version (ADK included), you can build both a 32-bit and 64-bit WinFE. This is an important consideration if you come across a 32-bit machine and only have a 64-bit WinFE that won’t be able to boot that machine. This does not make WinFE outdated; in fact, it keeps it useful and flexible.

If you want a full-fledged forensic Windows OS, go for Windows To Go, but be aware of its limitations.

You can use scripting in WinFE for analysis/data acquisition/etc… But test what you are doing first because you can bypass write protection and not know it with untested scripts/tools.

WinFE is signed, so it can boot Windows machines that cannot boot to a Linux forensics media.

WinFE is awesome for ARM.

WinFE is free.
