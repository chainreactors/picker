[EFF’s Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) is now installed on over 4 million web servers, where it’s used to maintain HTTPS certificates for more than 31 million websites. The recent achievement of these milestones helps show the success of the project and the important role it plays in the infrastructure of a secure and encrypted internet.

When EFF helped launch the [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority and released the software that’d become Certbot in 2015, the web was a very different place.

The recent achievement of Certbot exceeding 4 million installations actively maintaining certificates with Let’s Encrypt is just our latest metric showcasing this growth. Additionally, since many servers host more than one website, these installations are responsible for more than 22 million certificates covering more than 31 million domain names. That’s more than 31 million websites that Certbot is helping to offer HTTPS. These benefits extend to...
