The European Union has [sanctioned](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/07/28/information-manipulation-in-russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine-eu-lists-seven-individuals-and-five-entities/) the operators of a Russian disinformation network known as "**RRN**" (*Recent Reliable News*) for spreading fake news and propaganda about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The EU says Russian government bodies participated in creating, running, and disseminating RNN's fakes on social media.

Five organizations and seven individuals managing them, including GRU agents, were [added](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.LI.2023.190.01.0021.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2023%3A190I%3ATOC) to the EU's sanctions list.

* **InfoRos**, a GRU-run news agency that manages more than 270 fake news sites (previously [sanctioned by the US](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0126) as well).
* **Institute of the Russian Diaspora**, a fake "institute" founded by InfoRos' leadership to disseminate their content.
* **ANO Dialog**, a Russian non-profit organization created by the Moscow Department of Information and Technology that posts propaganda via the "War on Fakes" Telegram channel and adjacent website.
* **Social Design Agency** and **Structural National Technologies**, two Russian IT firms supporting the RNN network.

The sanctions come in the aftermath of a [report](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/security-disarmament-and-non-proliferation/news/2023/article/statement-by-ms-catherine-colonna-foreign-digital-interference-france-s) published by the French government in June, exposing the network.

French authorities say the network operated its own websites, where they posted disinformation, but also used typosquatting to create websites that posed as EU government portals and local media outlets.

Articles published on these sites pushed narratives that the Ukrainian government and army were associated with neo-Nazi groups, that Ukrainian refugees were responsible for crimes across Europe, and that sanctions against Russia were damaging European countries.

Articles also claimed that EU countries were guilty of war crimes because they supplied arms to Ukraine, that EU weapons were sold on the black market, that Ukrainian government officials were stealing from EU donations, and that radioactive clouds were heading toward EU cities from the discharge of UK weapons that contained depleted uranium.

In France, the RNN network created a website posing as the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and published an article claiming the country had introduced a "security tax," whose proceeds would go to Ukraine. In another case, RNN created a fake site posing as the French Ministry of Interior that claimed French citizens would be forced to house Ukrainian refugees.

The network published content targeting EU countries but also the Middle East and the Americas.

The French government says RNN disinformation was amplified using bots on social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram.

Stories and narratives were also often boosted by the official accounts of Russian embassies and cultural centers across the world.

> "France condemns these acts, which are not worthy of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. No manipulation attempt will dissuade France from supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's war of aggression."

RNN is also the same disinformation network that was unmasked in September 2022 by [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/09/removing-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-from-china-and-russia/), [Qurium](https://www.qurium.org/alerts/under-the-hood-of-a-doppelganger/), [DFRLab](https://medium.com/dfrlab/russia-based-facebook-operation-targeted-europe-with-anti-ukraine-messaging-389e32324d4b), and the [EU Disinfo Lab](https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/). In a series of joint reports, the four called the network "the largest of its kind" but said that its content was low quality, low effort, and received little interaction.

### **Breaches, hacks, and security incidents**

**Pentagon leak (another one):** The FBI and the Pentagon are investigating a potential compromise of the Air Force's communications system after an engineer took home sensitive government radio equipment. The incident took place at the Arnold Air Force Base in Tennessee, where the engineer was employed. According to court documents, he was reported by government contractors who noticed erratic behavior consistent with insider threats. The FBI says the engineer stole equipment worth more than $90,000, and the breach impacted 17 Air Force facilities and possibly even the FBI's own communications systems.

**eCitizen disruption:** A cyberattack has disrupted Kenya's eCitizen online platform and has brought down access to more than 5,000 government services. The incident impacted passport applications, the issuing of e-visas for foreign travelers, the release of ID cards and driver's licenses, as well as electricity payments. A pro-Kremlin group calling itself Anonymous Sudan has claimed responsibility for the disruption, claiming Kenya meddled in the affairs of the Sudanese government by offering to mediate a peace deal in the country's civil war. However, the attack suspiciously took place shortly after Kenyan officials criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for not renewing a crucial deal that would have allowed Ukrainian grain to flow to African countries.

**DepositFiles leak:** DepositFiles, one of the largest and oldest file-hosting and file-sharing services, exposed a configuration file that could have granted attackers access to its infrastructure. Exposed information included the credentials for the site's database, abuse and support emails, payment systems, and social media accounts.
