# Watch the on-demand webinar: Shift left without the strain

### Shifting security left promises faster, safer software delivery - but for many teams, that promise is undercut by painful scan performance, false positives, and pipeline friction.

In our recent webinar, PortSwigger's Alex and Liam looked at the real-world challenges of integrating [Dynamic Application Security Testing](/burp/application-security-testing/dast) (DAST) into [CI/CD](/developers/ci-cd-security) workflows, and showed how to configure, integrate, and automate DAST effectively with [Burp Suite DAST](/burp/dast).

**Watch the video below** or read on for a full recap:

## The Shift Left Paradox

In theory, “shifting left” brings security into the development process earlier so issues are caught sooner, fixed faster, and resolved before they derail releases.

But in practice? It's not so simple.

Too often, development and security teams are slowed by:

* **False positives**: Noise that wastes time, erodes trust, and slows down delivery.
* **Slow scans**: Delayed feedback disrupts CI/CD flows, leading developers to skip security steps altogether.
* **Workflow friction**: Security feels like a blocker rather than an enabler.

These aren’t just technical annoyances, they're cultural and operational hurdles. Poor performance, noisy results, and lack of developer trust can derail even the best-intentioned shift-left strategies.

## The Cost of Noisy or Lagging Security

More scanning isn’t better scanning. If results aren't fast, reliable, and relevant, they won't get used. DAST can fail teams when it’s not built for modern pipelines in a number of ways:

* **Scans take too long**: developers bypass them to stay on schedule.
* **False positives cause failed builds**: teams spend hours chasing non-issues.
* **Friction grows between dev and security**: trust breaks down and adoption stalls.

This leads to a dangerous perception: that DAST is a burden. And once that mindset takes root, it’s incredibly difficult to reverse.

## Fast, Accurate, Scalable DAST with Burp Suite

PortSwigger’s DAST tooling is built to do things differently, starting with speed and trust.

* **Precision scanning with minimal false positives**: Backed by decades of research and our industry-leading out-of-band testing engine (Burp Collaborator).
* **Fast, CI/CD-ready architecture**: Our Docker-based scan containers are platform agnostic and plug seamlessly into GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, or any other pipeline tooling.
* **Rich, customizable scan configuration**: Use YAML files or runtime environment variables to tailor scanning to each environment or build.

**Want to talk through your DAST challenges with a security specialist?** [Book a call now](https://calendly.com/d/csz8-mj8-dc6) to discuss your [DevSecOps](/solutions/devsecops) goals.

## Dynamic Scanning for the Age of AI-Driven Development

AI is rapidly changing how software is built. Automated agents now write code, open PRs, and run builds. But even in these futuristic workflows, runtime security matters more than ever.

Burp Suite DAST provides:

* **Runtime-aware scanning**: Detect vulnerabilities that static tools miss.
* **Seamless automation**: Integrates with AI-driven pipelines just as easily as traditional ones.
* **Zero-friction operations**: No agents, no slowdowns, no false alarms.

DAST isn’t just about catching bugs - it's your invisible safety net in a world where software is built faster than ever.

## Conclusion: Make DAST a Driver, Not a Drag

To truly shift left and succeed, you need security tools that:

* Developers trust.
* Deliver fast, accurate feedback.
* Fit your pipelines without compromise.

Burp Suite DAST provides:

* Low-noise, high-confidence findings.
* Fast scanning that doesn’t delay releases.
* Flexible integration for any CI/CD setup.
* Full runtime visibility for modern applications.

**Ready to bring seamless, intelligent DAST into your CI/CD workflows?** [Book a call with our enterprise specialists today](https://calendly.com/d/csz8-mj8-dc6) and see how Burp Suite can transform your DevSecOps.
