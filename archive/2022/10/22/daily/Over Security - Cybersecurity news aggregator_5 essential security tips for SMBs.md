## 5 essential security tips for SMBs

October 20, 2022

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

In any business, the security of each computer is intimately connected to the security of every other computer. Interconnectedness allows attackers to turn a breach, a fault, or an oversight on one machine into access on all the machines its connected to. That means any attack on any computer is a potential jumping off point for an attack on the entire business.

Trojans like Emotet and Agent Tesla can infiltrate deep into your organization, silently stealing sensitive information, while ransomware like [LockBit](http://www.threatdown.com/blog/ransomware-review-september-2022) can bring your entire business to a sudden, grinding halt.

To defend against them, organizations need to think about the tools and practices that will pay dividends throughout their network. To help, we’ve compiled five essential security tips for SMBs.

## 1. Have a plan for patching

Criminals often break into computers by exploiting known flaws in the software they’re running (you can think of this like jimmying a broken lock). Security updates remove those flaws, which fixes the broken locks and shuts out the criminals.

Be warned: Patching an organization isn’t like keeping your laptop up to date, and many underestimate the time and planning required to do it properly. Like any complex, ongoing process it requires commitment, planning and prioritization.

Organizations need to know what computers they own, what software they’re running, what updates that software needs, how urgently it needs to happen, who is responsible for applying updates, what schedule they’re working to, and what the rollback plan is if something goes wrong. While it’s technically possible to do this process manually, using an [automated patch management platform](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/vulnerability-patch-managementhttps%3A/www.malwarebytes.com/blog/business/2022/09/vulnerability-response-for-smbs-the-malwarebytes-approach) will make your life infinitely easier.

Some choose to do this themselves, but, for obvious reasons, many prefer to let an experienced [managed service provider (MSP)](http://www.threatdown.com/blog/6-reasons-msps-need-a-patch-management-platform) do it for them.

## 2. Use multi-factor authentication

Getting on top of your patching closes a lot of doors on cybercriminals, but not all of them. There is no need for criminals to jimmy a lock if they can steal a key, and the keys to your kingdom are your users’ passwords.

*In theory*, putting those keys out of reach is easy: You just need all your users to choose strong, unique passwords for every account they use, all the time. In practice, this is an [enormous uphill task](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/10/why-almost-everything-we-told-you-about-passwords-was-wrong) that unnecessarily, and unfairly, transfers the responsibility for a key area of security from your IT specialists to your staff.

That’s where multi-factor authentication (MFA) comes in. There are many different ways to do MFA, but the most common form is asking users to type a one-time code from an app or SMS message next to their password. MFA is armour for your users’ passwords. It is hugely effective: It can protect you from stolen passwords and credential stuffing, shut out online and offline brute-force guessing attacks, and some forms of MFA will even stop phishing attempts.

The gold standard is [MFA based on the FIDO2 standard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/10/google-is-bringing-passkey-support-to-both-android-and-chrome), so we recommend you start there.

## 3. Turn off RDP wherever you can

Of course, you don’t have to worry about criminals jimmying locks or steal...
