# Pigeon Shoots and Hitmen: New Leads in a Texas Oilman's Cold Case

*Bellingcat Investigator Peter Barth, who grew up in Texas, researched and reported this story in collaboration with the [Texas Observer](https://www.texasobserver.org/new-leads-in-an-infamous-cold-case/).*

William “Bill” Asher Richardson Jr. pulled into the driveway of his upscale Corpus Christi home late on a Sunday night at the end of summer. The wealthy Texas oilman was unloading his Winnebago RV as his wife and stepson walked inside. Their housekeeper, watching through the front window, saw them first: two men, armed with sawed-off shotguns and [wearing jumpsuits](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-times-45-pellets-jumpsui/154930965/), running toward Richardson from the shadows.

Without a word, they fired four shells of [No. 4 buckshot](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-caller-times-august-2-197/110622434/), sending [45 pellets](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-times-45-pellets-jumpsui/154930965/) into Richardson’s head, neck, chest, and arms. The shooters were gone as quickly as they arrived, [fleeing in a getaway car](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-caller-times-august-2-197/110622434/). Richardson’s wife tried to call for help, but the phone line had been [cut](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-times-45-pellets-jumpsui/154930965/). Her son ran to fetch a neighbouring doctor. It was too late. Richardson, 40, died sprawled on his driveway.

Richardson’s murder on Aug. 1, 1971, remains unsolved.

The case is one of an overwhelming number of unsolved homicides in the United States. The [Murder Accountability Project (MAP)](https://projectcoldcase.org/cold-case-homicide-stats/) counts almost 346,000 cold cases of homicide between 1965 and 2023—likely an undercount since many homicides from the earlier decades are excluded and not all police departments report to the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program, on which MAP is based.

Clearance rates for US homicides—generally defined as the percentage of cases closed via arrest or the death of a suspect, or ruled to be justifiable—have been [declining for years](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-criminol-022422-122744).

Meanwhile, online crowdsourcing efforts have sprung up to tackle cold cases including [Uncovered](http://uncovered.com), with almost 50,000 unsolved murder and missing persons cases, and [Solve the Case](http://solvethecase.org), a nonprofit founded by Aaron Benzick, a detective with the Plano Police Department. “You highlight these cases, and people come forward,” Benzick told Bellingcat. “Even if that doesn’t happen, just organising these cases helps law enforcement.”

In 2023, the Corpus Christi Police Department (CCPD), with two detectives on its cold case squad, began reviewing 100 unsolved homicide cases dating back to April 1970—including Richardson’s. But the city has refused to release nearly all of its files.

Bellingcat has independently uncovered new information about the murder that’s never been made public. In a years-long open source review of Richardson’s murder conducted in collaboration with the *Texas Observer,* the outlets examined digitised newspapers, online archives, genealogy services, and declassified FBI records. The outlets also filed public record requests with local and state law enforcement agencies, the FBI, and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Two men, including one who did prison time for [a prior murder](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-times-hammond-1962-guilty/167360378/), were charged with Richardson’s death but not convicted. The outlets’ investigation fleshes out the failed case against those two individuals and contributes new details to the public record of what happened the night Richardson was killed—including the possible identity of a getaway driver. The investigation also reveals alleged links between Richardson’s social circle and organised crime and some evidence of another potential participant in the crime.

The findings illuminate violent collisions between jet-setting Southern playboys at the highest rungs of the social ladder and the murky [criminal underworld](https://www.newspapers.com/article/corpus-christi-caller-times-south-texas/156724509/) that gripped Texas in the 1960s and ’70s. Public records shed light on this peculiar clash of worlds, though enormous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request backlogs, the loss of historical documents, and the unwillingness of law enforcement agencies to release all files make the full story elusive. Crucially, many players with firsthand knowledge—the witnesses, the alleged accomplices or killers, victims, police, lawyers, reporters, and family members—are either dead or unwilling to speak.

Richardson’s colourful life in a landed South Texas oil and ranching family was illumi...
