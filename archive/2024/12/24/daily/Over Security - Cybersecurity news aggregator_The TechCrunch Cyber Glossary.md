The cybersecurity world is full of jargon and lingo. At TechCrunch, we have been [writing about cybersecurity for years](https://techcrunch.com/security/), and we frequently use technical terms and expressions to describe the nature of what is happening in the world. That’s why we have created this glossary, which includes some of the most common — and not so common — words and expressions that we use in our articles, and explanations of how, and why, we use them.

This is a developing compendium, and we will update it regularly. If you have any feedback or suggestions for this glossary, get in touch.

## [Advanced persistent threat (APT)](#advanced-persistent-threat-apt)

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is often categorized as a [hacker](#hacker), or group of hackers, which gains and maintains unauthorized access to a targeted system. The main aim of an APT intruder is to remain undetected for long periods of time, often to conduct espionage and surveillance, to steal data, or sabotage critical systems.

APTs are traditionally well-resourced hackers, including the funding to pay for their malicious campaigns, and access to hacking tools typically reserved by governments. As such, many of the long-running APT groups are associated with nation states, like China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In recent years, we’ve seen examples of non-nation state cybercriminal groups that are financially motivated (such as theft and money laundering) carrying out cyberattacks similar in terms of persistence and capabilities as some traditional government-backed APT groups.

(See: [Hacker](#hacker))

## [Adversary-in-the-middle attack](#adversary-in-the-middle)

An adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attack, traditionally known as a “man-in-the-middle” (MitM), is where someone intercepts network traffic at a particular point on the network in an attempt to eavesdrop or modify the data as it travels the internet. This is why encrypting data makes it more difficult for malicious actors to read or understand a person’s network traffic, which could contain personal information or secrets, like passwords. Adversary-in-the-middle attacks can be used legitimately by security researchers to help understand what data goes in and out of an app or web service, a process that can help [identify security bugs and data exposures](https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/docket-vaccine-records-covid-security/).

## [Arbitrary code execution](#arbitrary-code-execution)

The ability to run commands or malicious code on an affected system, often because of a security vulnerability in the system’s software. Arbitrary code execution can be achieved either remotely or with physical access to an affected system (such as someone’s device). In the cases where arbitrary code execution can be achieved over the internet, security researchers typically call this remote code execution.

Often, code execution is used as a way to plant a back door for maintaining long-term and persistent access to that system, or for running malware that can be used to access deeper parts of the system or other devices on the same network.

(See also: [Remote code execution](#remote-code-execution))

## **[Attribution](#attribution)**

Attribution is the process of finding out and identifying who is behind a cyberattack. There is an often repeated mantra, “attribution is hard,” which is to warn cybersecurity professionals and the wider public that definitively establishing who was behind a cyberattack is no simple task. While it is not impossible to attribute, the answer is also dependent on the level of confidence in the assessment.

Threat intelligence companies such as CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, and Mandiant, among others, have for years attributed cyberattacks and data breaches to groups or “clusters” of hackers, often referencing groups by a specific codename, based on a pattern of certain tactics, techniques and procedures as seen in previous attacks. Some threat intelligence firms go as far as publicly linking certain groups of hackers to specific governments or their intelligence agencies when the evidence points to it.

Government agencies, however, have for years publicly accused other governments and countries of being behind cyberattacks, and have gone as far as identifying — and sometimes criminally charging — specific people working for those agencies.

## **[Backdoor](#backdoor)**

A backdoor is a subjective term, but broadly refers to creating the means to gain future access to a system, device, or physical area. Backdoors can be found in software or hardware, such as a mechanism to gain access to a system (or space) in case of accidental lock-out, or for remotely providing technical support over the internet. Backdoors can have legitimate and helpful use cases, but backdoors can also be undocumented, maliciously planted, or otherwise unknown to the user or owner, which can weaken the security of the product and make it more susceptible to hacking or compromise.

## [Black/white hat](#black-white-hat)

Hackers historically have been categorized as either “black hat” or “white hat,” usually depending on the motivations of the hacking activity carried out. A “black hat” hacker may be someone who might break the law and hack for money or personal gain, such...
