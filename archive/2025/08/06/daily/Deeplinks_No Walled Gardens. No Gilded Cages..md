Sometimes technology feels like a gilded cage, and you’re not the one holding the key. Most people can’t live off the grid, so how do we stop data brokers who track and exploit you for money? Tech companies that distort what you see and hear? Governments that restrict, censor, and intimidate? No one can do it alone, but EFF was built to protect your rights. [With your support, we can take back control.](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/VirtualVegas--DL)
