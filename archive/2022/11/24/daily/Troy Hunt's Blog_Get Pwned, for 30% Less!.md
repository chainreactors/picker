# Get Pwned, for 30% Less!

24 November 2022

We've had great feedback from people who have gotten Pwned. Loads of people had told us how much they've enjoyed it and would like to get their friends Pwned too. Personally, I think everyone should get Pwned! Which is why we're making it possible for 30% less ðŸ˜Š

Ok, being more serious for a moment, I'm talking about [Pwned the book which we launched a couple of months ago](https://www.troyhunt.com/pwned-the-book-is-finally-here/) and it's chock full of over 800 pages worth of epic blog posts and more importantly, the stories behind them. Because it's a holiday on the other side of the world right now (still true as I write this as an Aussie about to jump on a plane to Norway), we've smashed 30% off the price over at [book.troyhunt.com](https://book.troyhunt.com/?ref=troyhunt.com)

So, go get Pwned, you'll love it!
