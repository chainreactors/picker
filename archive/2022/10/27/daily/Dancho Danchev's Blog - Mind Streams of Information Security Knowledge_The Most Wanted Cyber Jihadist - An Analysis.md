### The Most Wanted Cyber Jihadist - An Analysis

**NOTE:**

I wrote this post in 2007.

This would have been an important blog post if [cyber jihad](https://ddanchev.blogspot.com/search/label/Cyber%20Terrorism) were to be a issue that can be personalized, however, the reality as always has to do with another perspective, which in cyber jihad's case is diversification, localization of knowledge, and a knowledge-driven cyber jihadist communities itself.

My point is that this guy should not be considered as the public face of cyber jihad, now that he's no longer active as a cyber jihadist, he's a cyber martyr that will be inspiring another generation of wannabe cyber jihadists to come.

[Here's the article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2006/03/26/terrorist-007-exposed/12a2ebfe-b28d-4f7e-89c9-0d0514640015/):

"*In addition, Tsouli Irhabi used countless other web sites as free hosts for material that the jihadists needed to upload and share. The true extent of his material distribution network is still not known. He is credited with the large scale distribution of a film produced by Zarqawi called "All Is for Allah's Religion. His arrest struck a significant blow to al Qaedaâ€™s cyber terrorism weaponry. With cyber weaponry only requiring widely available knowledge and skills and the only equipment required a computer that can be purchased anywhere, cyber weapons proliferation cannot be controlled.*"

My favorite quote - "*With cyber weaponry only requiring widely available knowledge and skills and the only equipment required a computer that can be purchased anywhere, cyber weapons proliferation cannot be controlled. These facts coupled with the recent cyber attacks on utilities that blackout cities and regions show this is a serious threat.*"

Wait a sec. PSYOPS is a practice by itself which in this case aims to increase the investments made into securing the critical infrastructure of a country, one that I bet even the bad guys stopped targeting due to the logical nature of the attack? It is such a practice. Moreover, remember another such PSYOPS practice, namely the desired "media-echo" effect achieved?

Stay tuned!
