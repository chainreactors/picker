Late last year, Bumble finally rolled out its [updated privacy policy](https://bumble.com/privacy-policy) after a coalition of twelve digital rights, LGBTQ+, human rights, and gender justice civil society organizations launched a [campaign](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/eff-and-12-organizations-tell-bumble-dont-sell-user-data-without-opt-consent) demanding stronger data protections.

Unfortunately, the company, like [other dating apps](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/data-hungry-dating-apps-are-worse-than-ever-for-your-privacy/), has not moved far enough, and continues to burden users with the responsibility of navigating misleading privacy settings on the app, as well as absorbing the consequences of infosec gaps, however severe.

This should not be your responsibility—dating apps like Bumble should be prioritizing your privacy by default. This data falling into the wrong hands can come with [unacceptable consequences](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/10/colorado-catholic-group-identify-priests-gay-apps), especially for those seeking reproductive health care, survivors of intimate partner violence, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Laws should require companies to put [our privacy over their profit](https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms), and we’re [fighting hard](https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms) for the introduction of comprehensive data privacy legislation in the U.S. to achieve this.

But in the meantime, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to protect yourself and your most intimate information whilst using the dating service.
