A detailed Bug Bounty Writeup explaining a session hijack vulnerability that was exploited using Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), coupled with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) bypass and Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI). This in-depth analysis explores how these chained vulnerabilities were discovered, earning a $2500 reward.

Session Hijack via Chained Attack

Hello ðŸ‘‹

First of all, Iâ€™d like to thank [Martin Sparre-Enger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mse89/) for sponsoring this Bug Bounty Writeup through my [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/therceman/wishlist) page.

Letâ€™s dive in â€¦

Iâ€™d been exploring a website for some time, uncovering a few bugs here and there, but I was curious to see if there was more to discover.

As usual, this involved navigating through all links and sections while keeping the Logger++ extension of my Burp Suite active.

After a while, I stumbled upon an interesting redirect URL that looked something like this: `https://example.com?redirect=${redirectURL}`

The last part caught my eye. It was clearly some kind of Template Language Expression that hadnâ€™t been executed correctly. After noting this, I switched to the user profile page and began experimenting with the requests responsible for changing my username.

The first thing I tried was a mathematical expression `${2*2}`, to confirm the potential template injection vulnerability.

I changed my name to `John${2*2}`, and when the response output was `John4`, this confirmed the presence of a Server-Side Template Expression Language.

But what was it exactly? And what could I do with it?

After some time, I determined that it was the [JSP Expression Language](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/expression-language-jsp), and I found a few examples to test, thereby confirming its presence.

I think I spent several days, maybe even a week, reading documentation and examples, and trying out different functions and methods. The most interesting expression I found was `${header.cookie}`.By using this payload in your name youâ€™ll receive a list of all cookies, including secured HTTP-only ones.

Upon discovering this SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection) vulnerability with cookies exfiltration payload, I decided to halt further exploration of the documentation and proceed with creating a PoC to demonstrate a Session Hijack vulnerability.

Butâ€¦ Iâ€™d overlooked one aspectâ€¦ How could I perform a Session Hijack on another account without any interaction, or perhaps with at least minimal interaction?

As you might guess, we need a working XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability that could change the victimâ€™s name to `${header.cookie}`, and then exfiltrate (forward) all cookies to a domain under our control, thereby demonstrating the full impact of the vulnerability chain.

So, I started digging through the website for potential XSS vulnerabilitiesâ€¦

I had been inspecting the JS source code on the main page, switching to other pages, and repeating the process, but found nothingâ€¦ until one day.

Accidentally, I clicked on something on the main page (maybe something had changed there, Iâ€™m not sure) and was redirected to a page with videos.

Opening the video, which appeared to be a live stream or a recording of one, I noticed an â€˜idâ€™ parameter in the URL, something like `videoId=w6exeqbemte`

The first, and most common, idea that came to mind was to append my favorite payload to the end of the parameter.

```
https://example.com/videos/?videoId=w6exeqbemteqwe'"<X</
```

After that, no video loaded, and an examination of the source code revealed that the `videoId` parameter was directly injected into the `src` attribute of the <iframe> element. My additional payload, `<x</`, had become an HTML attribute.

```
<iframe src="w6exeqbemteqwe'" <X</">
```

This was a good sign. It appeared that I had found a potential place for an XSS attack.

The next thing I tried was applying the following payload to this parameter.

```
?videoId=qwe"><img src onerror=alert(1)>
```

Andâ€¦ it was blocked by WAF :)

I knew this website had the most robust WAF Iâ€™d ever encountered, butâ€¦ was it truly that strong?

All the classic payloads didnâ€™t work here, Iâ€™ve spent a few days trying every possible trick that I know which turned into nothingâ€¦

Then I switched my approach and told myself â€” letâ€™s try to keep our payload inside of an iframe tag and try experimenting further. We canâ€™t override `src` attribute, all the class events like `onload` , `onmouseover` etc â€¦ are blocked by WAF.

Butâ€¦ the `srcdoc` param was not blocked by WAF.

This is where the battle with the WAF began :D

I knew that the basic XSS payload wouldnâ€™t work within the â€˜`srcdoc`â€™ parameter, just like before, since the WAF detected everything in the same way. I needed to somehow outsmart itâ€¦

I donâ€™t remember exactly which part of the bypass was first, but to create the <script> tag inside an iframe, I utilized this payload:

```
?videoId=qwe"srcdoc="\u003ce<script%26Tab;e>"
```

This payload bypasses the WAF and creates a <script> tag.

The first part of the payload `\u003ce` tricks WAF with the fake opening of a non-existing tag `<e` . The issue with a WAF is that it attempts to decode everything first and then performs checks. In our case, the WAF will convert the Unicode text to a tag `<e` for a check. However, in reality, it remains as a text â€˜`\u003ce`â€™ and doesnâ€™t interfere with the opening of our script tag.

The second part of the paylo...
