Some “stuff” belongs in your possession, no matter how many “apparent” benefits you get from putting it in the cloud. Passwords in the cloud seems like such a handy idea: Log in anywhere with no effort. But your passwords get hacked and you are well and truly pwned.

Never put anything in the cloud that can really hurt you if it’s lost. Use a LOCAL password manager and make sure it uses good encryption.

Quoting Wikipedia (so this is nth-hand and may be false or confused):

> LastPass assured that passwords stored with the service were still secure, as encryption and decryption of passwords takes place on the user’s device.

Which sounds like they may have leaked some encrypted passwords.

I don’t know if LastPass lets you store passwords you have chosen rather than randomly-generated ones. If it does then a great number of them will be ‘password3’ or whatever, and delightfully easy for an attacker to guess, given the encrypted data. Let’s hope the thing the password is for is not also stored with it … oh, don’t be silly, of course it is.

(A good approach would probably be to encrypt the password & what it is for together?)

@John,

And I shudder to think about my mom trying to store her passwords on her own password manager. Her being able to share them with me is helpful, too. I mean, I have to make purchases for her because she’s uncomfortable typing in her own credit card number.

Yes, it’s not the most secure, but there are benefits to it.

@John, @Uther Offline/local password DB here as well. I carry 2 USB sticks (one in pants pocket, one in utility vest aka man purse) with password database and portable copy of the password manager. If there’s a PC around, I can access my passwords.. and I almost always have a laptop around.

IMO works as well as cloud storage.

I have heard bad things about the reliability of USB sticks. They have a habit of failing early.

@Winter

I carry two.. never had any fail in over 20 years of this use case. I replace them every 5 or so years. Now that you mention it though, perhaps I should clip one to my wife’s purse.. and have 3!

I’m sure for some folks cloud storage is more convenient and plenty secure. I’ll give up convenience for security 99% of the time, different risk appetite.

I store my less important passwords (encrypted) locally plus a few backups over there and there and somewhere else still. The important passwords are stored in my brain only. I don’t carry a computer with me so I am not tempted to access anything away from home.

To entrust your passwords to a big organisation which has the security specialists on payroll to defend from all the shady characters from all over the planet?

Or to keep your passwords close to your own chest hoping you’re much smaller an much less significant target, but also relying only on yourself to notice if someone tries to exfiltrate your secrets?

Sounds almost Shakespearean:
“To be, or not to be: that is the question”

@Brenden Walker, glad to read that, I get a bit of mickey-taking from nearest and dearest (and those not so near and dear) for having multiple copies like that. (I’ll add that my Password Safe files are also stored on my regular backup discs).

As for USB sticks and their durability I’m still using one (for non-critical jobs) that accidentally went through the washing machine. Those little ticket/key pockets in a pair of jeans are easily missed when checking kit before putting it in.

The LastPass client encrypts all passwords with a key that is derived from your Primary Password. Then it hashes that key again and uses it to log into the LastPass service. So LastPass only ever has the encrypted data, and the hash of the key, not the key itself.

They don’t encrypt some parts of the data you upload, such as URLs, so that they can provide certain services, e.g. breach notification, but the passwords are pretty safe. Even if you have dumb ones like password1, they shouldn’t be vulnerable.

@Winter
USB stick reliability is much like other hardware: some brands are made more reliable than others. I’ve had rapid failure from el cheapos that I bought in a hurry; and I’m still using (not on a daily basis) some reputable brand devices over 12 years old. BTW cleanly unmounting before unplugging is essential; there is one popular OS that doesn’t always succeed.

@Robin, ditto on the washing machine.

@All
Password storage? Paper, always paper. Yup, fails the washing machine test, but that’s what backups are for.
