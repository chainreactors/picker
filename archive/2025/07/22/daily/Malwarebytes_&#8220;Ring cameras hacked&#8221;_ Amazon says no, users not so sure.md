# “Ring cameras hacked”? Amazon says no, users not so sure

Posted: July 21, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In the last week, countless Amazon Ring users on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/%40sophiawhaley/video/7528354340596092191), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ring/comments/1m2m0f0/may_28_logins/), and [X](https://x.com/search?q=ring%20hacked&src=typed_query) have been saying they believe their Ring cameras were hacked starting May 28.

Many posted screenshots of their accounts, showing multiple unauthorized device logins, making these claims hard to ignore. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/07/20/amazon-ring-doorbell-may-28-mass-hacking-claim-goes-viral/) looked into the issue and even the journalist found several logins on his own device.

However, on Friday Ring [claimed](https://x.com/ring/status/1946108016253911382) it’s just a minor issue with the displayed date:

> “We are aware of a bug that incorrectly displays prior login dates as May 28, 2025.

Visitors who go to [Ring’s site](https://status.ring.com/) are shown the following (correct at the time of writing):

![Ring website ](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Ring_website.png)
> “We are aware of an issue where information is displaying inaccurately in Control Center. This is the result of a backend update, and we’re working to resolve this. We have no reason to believe this is the result of unauthorized access to customer accounts.”

This message was posted on Friday, July 18. We spoke to one user who let us know that, as of Monday morning (July 21), he was unable to log in through the website. He was, however, able to log in through the app and saw no May 28 logins.

So, what’s Ring claiming here? That it did an update and messed up the database? In a later message it claimed:

> “Ring made a backend update that resulted in prior login dates for client devices to be inaccurately displayed as May 28, 2025, and device names to be incorrectly displayed as ‘Device name not found’.“

But if you look at any of the [plethora of screenshots](https://www.tiktok.com/en/trending/detail/ring-users-report-suspicious-may-28-logins), you’ll see that there are plenty of device names displayed.

The [Ring software release notes](https://ring.com/gb/en/support/articles/43rw5/software-release-notes-history) show no updates for the doorbells on or around May 28, so we think it’s safe to assume that Ring is right about it being a backend update that caused this.

There is one other thing that’s interesting in this puzzle. On July 17, [founder and now CEO Jamie Siminoff](https://www.businessinsider.com/ring-founder-jamie-siminoff-life-after-amazon-acquisition-2019-4) announced some drastic changes. Siminoff reinstated Ring’s original mission statement, “Make neighborhoods safer,” which might suggest the business is going back to its founding identity as a crime prevention tool.

Before Siminoff came back as CEO he wasn’t working for Ring, and in that time the company leaned into a more community-focused brand, distancing itself from the surveillance tool image. Last year, the company discontinued “Request for Assistance,” a feature that allowed law enforcement officers to ask people for camera footage through Ring’s Neighbors app. At the time, the company said it would only let police request footage during “emergencies.”

However, in April, Ring announced a partnership with ...
