## 5 must-haves for K-12 cybersecurity

January 12, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Over the years, cyberattacks on K-12 schools and districts have steadily increased, and in 2022 that trend only continued. [In the first half of 2022 alone](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2022/08/09/check-point-research-education-sector-experiencing-more-than-double-monthly-attacks-compared-to-other-industries/), the education sector saw an average of almost 2,000 attacks every week—a 114% increase compared to two years ago.

The tight budgets of many educational institutions forces them to struggle with outdated equipment and limited staff, making them an easy target for cybercriminals. But if their wallets allow for it, there are a few staple cybersecurity safeguards that schools and districts should always consider implementing.

In this post, we’ll look at the 5 must-haves for [K-12 cybersecurity](https://www.threatdown.com/education/).

## 1. Anti-ransomware EDR

It’s no secret that public schools have been experiencing a scourge of ransomware attacks lately. In total, [89 education sector organizations](https://www.emsisoft.com/en/blog/43258/the-state-of-ransomware-in-the-us-report-and-statistics-2022/#:~:text=In%20total%2C%2089%20education%20sector%20organizations%20were%20impacted%20by%20ransomware) were impacted by ransomware in 2022—the number of potentially affected schools doubling from 2021 to 1,981.

The most high profile of these attacks occurred during Labor Day weekend, when a ransomware gang breached the [Los Angeles Unified School District](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/10/public-school-district-has-data-leaked-by-ransomware-gang) and stole roughly 500 gigabytes of data.

In addition to meeting ransomware [best practices as defined by CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide), schools and districts should carefully consider their options when it comes to selecting [an EDR vendor](https://www.threatdown.com/glossary/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response-edr/). In particular, an anti-ransomware EDR should have the following features:

* **Multi-vector Endpoint Protection** (EP) built-in
* Maintains **visibility and patching** regularly
* Has machine learning (ML) to **recognize ‘goodware’ instead of malware**
* Uses **standard reference language** and forensic analysis
* Thorough **containment, eradication, and recovery options**
* Searches for **ransomware indicators across all your managed endpoints**

## 2. Third-party risk management

Data breaches and leaks constituted about 30% of K-12 reported cyber incidents in 2021, according to the K12 Security Information Exchange (K12 SIX). What’s more, [55% of these incidents](https://www.k12six.org/the-report) were directly due to leaks originating from district vendors!

In 2021, schools reported breaches of personal information by [Independent Health](https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/local/private-health-data-of-williamsville-school-employees-inadvertently-leaked-by-independent-health/71-2d476804-2d70-4689-b7c9-d4fb224b54c6), [PCS Revenue](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2021/04/school-nutrition-vendor-sued-for-compromise-of-867209-k-12-student-records/), and the [Student Transportation of America](https://whyy.org/articles/springfield-delco-parents-outraged-after-bus-company-email-reveals-students-information/), just to name a few.

In other words, the majority of school data breaches aren’t the handiwork of cybercriminals, but rather due to school district vendors and other ...
