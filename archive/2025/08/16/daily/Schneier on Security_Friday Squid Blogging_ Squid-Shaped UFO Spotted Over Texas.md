## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid-Shaped UFO Spotted Over Texas

[Here’s](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/dallas-texas-viral-video-of-squid-shaped-ufo-sparks-debate-the-government-is-101754207106756.html) the story. The [commenters](https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1951719327025295456) on X (formerly Twitter) are unimpressed.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Will AI make language dubbing easy for film and TV?

=Finding international films that might appeal to the US market is an important part of the work XYZ Films.

He says the US market has always been tough for foreign language films.

It’s partly a language problem.

“America is not a culture which has grown up with subtitles or dubbing like Europe has,” he points out.

But that language hurdle might be easier to clear with a new AI-driven dubbing system.

> The audio and video of a recent film, Watch the Skies, a Swedish sci-fi film, was fed into a digital tool called DeepEditor.

It manipulates the video to make it look like actors are genuinely speaking the language the film is made into.

DeepEditor was developed by Flawless, which is headquartered in Soho, London.

> “DeepEditor uses a combination of face detection, facial recognition, landmark detection [such as facial features] and 3D face tracking to understand the actor’s appearance, physical actions and emotional performance in every shot,” says Mr Mann.

The tech can preserve actors’ original performances across languages, without reshoots or re-recordings, reducing costs and time, he says.

The tech isn’t here to replace actors, says Mann, who says voice actors are used rather than being replaced with synthetic voices.=

Source code was reportedly stolen in breach of Judiciary’s Case Management/Electronic Case Files System. The CM/ECF platform has been breached many times, including in the 2020 SolarWinds incident. Existing vulnerabilities discovered following the 2020 breach were used in the latest hack. The CM/ECF platform is made up of multiple systems that serve each district, each with its own custom CM/ECF system, accessible by the PACER front-end.

Other actors have piggybacked off the latest breach to also gain access to the system.
The CM/ECF platform has been regularly attacked and breached over the last fifteen years.

The system contains a lot of very sensitive information.

SpaceX may never pay taxes thanks to a loophole signed into law by Trump. According to filings, the company has paid little in tax despite billions in government contracts.

Russian inventor Leon Theremin who was born on August 15, 1896 built “the Thing” spy device for the The Soviet Union.
Was it wise to allow Russia’s leader (a former KGB officer) to ride in the “Beast” presidential vehicle containing top secrets on the same date in 2025?

Maybe like Air Force One, there is a second decoy presidential vehicle to hide its defensive measures.

A friend of mine told me about a pattern he noticed: whenever he uses Signal app on his iPhone, immediately after sending a text message to one of his Signal Contacts, his iPhone switches automagically from 5G to LTE. If there’s no Signal texting, the iPhone stays on 5G ALL DAY – EVERYDAY. So, whenever a Signal Message is fetched a StingRay WILL FORCE IT to go from 5G to LTE. Simple as that?

Another thing he told me is that when there is a Court-Ordered Wiretap COWT/CALEA on a connection/Internet Account, then the Local NIC Adapter will ALWAYS show the Status of ANY WAN IP Address connected to using that Local NIC Adapter – it will ALWAYS show “Preferred IP Address” next to the actual WAN IP Address that is assigned (Leased) by the ISP to that local NIC Adapter (or RATHER The Account, in case one is connecting with more than one NICs/Devices).

Meaning – if your NIC shows you that your WAN IP Address is “Preferred” (even after resetting the NIC Adapter and taking ALL STEPS that would normally make it not “Preferred”, because there is a way to do that – UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET IT UP, UPSTREAM, TO BIND that way, then you WILL BE “Preferred” no matter what you do on your NIC/Device).
Simple as that!!! Gotta LOVE duh Police State – the US of A.
