Above diagram shows the solution architecture summarized as below.

* Payments can be initiated in local systems of the subsidiaries or affiliates or lines of business. These local system can be SAP or non-SAP and can be on-premise or cloud solutions. In the SAP reference architecture, all systems of heterogeneous landscape can submit their payment to a centralized payment factory (S/4HANA Finance for advanced payment management). This can be achieved using web services (APIs), IDocs or even physical files.

* Within advanced payment management the payments are converted to an internal format and are processed based on the configured rules potentially resulting in updates to SAP Cash Management, postings to GL. During processing, the solution leverages the Bank Account Management information to determine the bank to be used and triggers the final approval via Bank Communication Management.

* Once the payment is approved, the external payment format is generated leveraging DMEEX format and gets passed via the standard integration to SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity. The bank integration via SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity is fully API based and therefore adds another layer of security and is removing batch processes for file-based integration.

* The advanced payment management solution provides centralized view on global cash positions or status monitoring and features to handle exceptions and to optimize payment execution including bank determination.
