# Weekly Update 337

03 March 2023

Guns! You know, the things you kinda want to keep pretty well protected and out of the hands of nefarious parties, like the kinds of folks that following their data breach could match firearms to an individual at an address on a phone number of a gender and specific age. But don't worry, no financial information was compromised! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

All that and more in the 337th addition of my weekly update, enjoy!
