A section of the UK government has proposed making the sale or possession of bespoke encrypted phones for crime a criminal offense in its own right. The measure is intended to help the country’s law enforcement agencies tackle organized crime and those who facilitate it, but civil liberties experts tell Motherboard the proposal is overbroad and poorly defined, meaning it could sweep up other forms of secure communication used by the wider population if not adjusted.

The news highlights law enforcement’s continued targeting of the encrypted phone industry. Alongside [technical operations](https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxnnp/crime-boss-or-tech-ceo-sky-global-sues-government-domains), [undercover investigations](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m4pj/the-network-vincent-ramos-phantom-secure), and even [creating their own phone company](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7e733/anom-fbi-andrew-young-encryption-honeypot) to secretly harvest messages, authorities are increasingly exploring legislative options too.

“At the moment the government proposal appears to be vague and overly broad. While it states that the provisions ‘will not apply to commercially available mobile phones nor the encrypted messaging apps available on them’ it is difficult to see how it will not result in targeting devices used on a daily [basis] by human rights defenders, protesters and pretty much all of us who want to keep our data secure,” Ioannis Kouvakas, senior legal officer and assistant general counsel at UK-based activism organization Privacy International, told Motherboard in an email.

The proposal is included in [a document published by the Home Office](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1130978/2023_SOC_Measures_Consultation_Document_-_Final.pdf). In that document, the Home Office proposes two legislative measures that it says could be used to improve law enforcement’s response to serious and organized crime, and is seeking input from law enforcement, businesses, lawyers, civil liberties NGOs, and the wider public.

“I welcome your input on these two proposals for possible future legislation to improve the response to the threat of serious and organised crime, to ensure that our law enforcement agencies remain ahead of the curve and to leave organised crime groups with no place to Hide,” a foreword written by the Home Secretary Suella Braverman reads.

The first measure looks to create new criminal offenses on the “making, modifying, supply, offering to supply and possession of articles for use in serious crime.” The document points to several specific items: vehicle concealments used to hide illicit goods; digital templates for 3D-printing firearms; pill presses used in the drug trade; and “sophisticated encrypted communication devices used to facilitate organised crime.”

In other words, this change would criminalize owning an encrypted phone, selling one, or making one for use in crime, a crime in itself. This is not yet the case in the UK, or many other countries. Typically, law enforcement have found novel workarounds in order to charge people who sell encrypted phones to criminals. In the U.S., prosecutors have turned to RICO, a law traditionally used to target mob bosses, to [treat encrypted phone companies as criminal entities in their own right](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m4pj/the-network-vincent-ramos-phantom-secure). In the Netherlands, authorities have charged encrypted phone sellers [with money laundering offenses](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4xknyq/dutch-cops-bust-another-pgp-blackberry-company-for-alleged-money-laundering), rather than prosecuting the sale of possession of phones themselves. Some countries are much more extreme, such as the United Arab Emirates, where those selling encrypted technologies not approved by the state face penalties.

Specifically, the Home Office points to companies such as Encrocha...
