Can’t get enough of blog posts written by furries?

This post aims to curate some of the other blogs written by furries that are worth sharing with my regular readers.

Many (but not all) of these furry blogs are focused on technology in some way.

## Background Information

Many years ago, I wrote a post titled *[The World Needs More Furry Bloggers](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/15/the-world-needs-more-furry-bloggers/)*. In that post, I suggested I would write a blog post to promote other furry bloggers, so that people that enjoy my work might discover theirs too.

And then *life got really busy*, so I haven’t kept up with it since 2020. Oops.

![Blep Tongue Sticker](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/soatoktelegrams2020-13.png?resize=512%2C512&ssl=1)

So, instead of one post per furry blogger, I thought I would consolidate my effort into a single post that covers multiple. That way, if I don’t update [this category](https://soatok.blog/category/furry-fandom/featured-furries/) for another 4 years, I don’t feel so weird later.

## Featured Furry Blogs

*This list is incomplete. You can help by [expanding it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/18wkldk/how_would_you_approach_starting_a_fresh_blog_in/).*

Each header contains a link to the blog in question. The order is somewhat random (but certainly not cryptographically random).

### **[Fang, Feather, & Fin](https://www.fangfeatherandfin.com/)**

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.fangfeatherandfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-Furry-History-Banner2-XL-1-scaled-1-20240420-205551.jpg?w=768&ssl=1)

> *Fang, Feather, & Fin*, *Inc*. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to tracing and archiving the history of the furry fandom. While furries have been around for a long time, understanding our history means capturing the diverse spaces and media we’ve romped around in through the years: zines, journals, magazines, newspapers, websites, conventions spaces (and on and on). Our goal is to capture that history through interviews, blog posts on specific subjects, and an ever-growing archive of furry materials.

Fang, Feather, & Fin is a project by Chipper Wolf, Gale Frostbane, and Tofte Alpaca. They dive deep into a lot of furry history topics, so it’s definitely worth a read if you’re interested in that at all.

### **[Indigo’s den](https://xaselgio.net/)**

![](https://i0.wp.com/xaselgio.net/stickers/3_hello.png?w=768&ssl=1)

Soblow Xaselgio is an indog dragoness that blogs about various topics that interest her.

She also has [a rich collection of links (including 88×31 buttons!)](https://xaselgio.net/pages/links/) to various critters’ web presences.

If you were curious, mine looks like this:

[![Soatok 88x33 button](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/soatok.png?resize=88%2C31&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/soatok.png)

### **[S-Config](https://www.s-config.com/)**

![](https://i0.wp.com/furry.engineer/system/cache/accounts/avatars/109/565/707/738/995/510/original/1b412f720946ef67.jpeg?w=768&ssl=1)

S-Config has been blogging for over a decade about hardware and other technology topics.

Amazingly, they also publish their blog directly to the Tor and I2P networks.

This is a badass move and I’d love to see more bloggers do the same (if reasonably practical).

Skyler Stardrift has been blogging longer than I have. He covers various topics from furry conventions to streaming to YouTube vlogging.

He also uses a cute protogen in some of his blog posts, like I do with my dhole:
