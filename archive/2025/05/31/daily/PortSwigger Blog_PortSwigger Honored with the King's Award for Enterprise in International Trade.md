### We’re proud to announce that PortSwigger has been awarded the prestigious King’s Award for Enterprise in the category of International Trade - a recognition that reflects our sustained international success and growing global footprint.

PortSwigger is one of just 116 organizations across the UK to receive this honor in 2025. This marks the second time we’ve been recognized with this accolade, following the Queen’s Award in 2019, highlighting our consistent growth and impact on the international cybersecurity market.

Since its founding in 2008 by Dafydd Stuttard, PortSwigger has transformed from a solo project into a leading force in [web application security](/burp/application-security-testing). Our flagship product, Burp Suite, is now used by more than 15,000 organisations in over 150 countries, helping everyone from startups to tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google secure their digital infrastructure

Reflecting this international momentum, we’ve recently expanded our presence with new offices in London and Atlanta, supporting our mission to deliver cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions to organizations worldwide. These strategic locations strengthen our ability to collaborate with partners and customers across key global markets while continuing to attract top-tier talent.

> What began as a hobby has grown into a team of 160 people—and we’re still growing…To receive this award for the second time is a tremendous honour and a testament to the commitment and talent of our entire team.
>
> **Dafydd Stuttard, CEO and founder.**

## What is the King’s Award?

The King’s Awards for Enterprise are the UK’s most esteemed business accolades, celebrating achievements in innovation, sustainable development, social mobility, and international trade. This year’s award acknowledges PortSwigger’s exceptional export performance and strategic expansion into new markets.

## What’s next for PortSwigger?

As we look to the future, we remain focused on our mission to make the digital world safer, investing heavily in research, product innovation, and global talent to stay at the forefront of application security.
