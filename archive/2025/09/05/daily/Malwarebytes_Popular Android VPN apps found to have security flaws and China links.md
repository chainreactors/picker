# Popular Android VPN apps found to have security flaws and China links

Posted: September 4, 2025

People use VPNs for different security and privacy reasons, to access content anonymously, or to bypass content controls and age verification by pretending to be in different places. But not all VPNs are created equal. A recent report has revealed that many of them might allow others to sniff your data—and they’re not being honest about who’s behind them.

The report, called [Hidden Links: Analyzing Secret Families of VPN Apps](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2025/foci-2025-0008.pdf), comes from researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, and Arizona State University. It warns that several Android VPN apps for sale via the Google Play Store have security flaws that allow others to snoop on their traffic. They’re also deceiving users about their ownership, warns the report:

> “The providers appear to be owned and operated by a Chinese company and have gone to great lengths to hide this fact from their 700+ million combined user bases.”

The researchers looked at the 100 most-downloaded VPNs and took the half of them that were not US-based. Then they scanned websites, business filings, and the VPN apps’ source code to try and find links between them. Using a combination of data points found in these resources, they found common software libraries, technical infrastructure, and business details that allowed them to group the VPN apps into three families.

*Family A* contained eight VPN applications linked to providers Innovative Connecting, Autumn Breeze, and Lemon Clove. These apps all shared some common security flaws. These included a hard-coded key used to create a password for Shadowsocks, a service designed to circumnavigate the Chinese government’s digital censorship system. This flaw enables anyone to decrypt communications sent using these apps.

From the report:

> “On many of the VPNs we analyzed, a network eavesdropper between the VPN client and VPN server can use the hard-coded Shadowsocks password to decrypt all communications for all clients using the apps.”

Just as worrying is the undisclosed collection of user location data by these apps, even though the providers’ privacy policies claim that they don’t do this. They request the zip code of the user’s public IP from ip-api.com and upload it to a database, the researchers said.

The Tech Transparency Project has [previously connected](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apple-offers-apps-with-ties-to-chinese-military) three providers responsible for these apps with Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, which the US has [sanctioned](https://web.archive.org/web/20221005182056/https%3A/media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/05/2003091659/-1/-1/0/1260H%20COMPANIES.PDF) for its connections to the Peoples’ Liberation Army.

*Family B* consisted of six providers, who between them are responsible for apps including Global VPN, XY VPN, and Super Z VPN, all of which use the same VPN servers. They had hard-coded passwords for Shadowsocks, too. In general, the researchers warn against using apps that rely on Shadowsocks for anonymity. It was designed for getting around China’s censorship system, not maintaining anonymity, they said:

> “It was counterintuitive to find deprecated ciphers and hard-coded passwords in these apps, given that they are se...
