## Friday Squid Blogging: New Species of Vampire Squid Lives 3,000 Feet below Sea Level

At least, it [seems to be](https://www.newsweek.com/vampire-squid-found-3000-feet-under-sea-1785821) a new species.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Israeli firm inks first UAE deal to help telecom giant crack down on cyberthreats

“Cyberint Technologies Ltd., an Israel-based company specializing in cyber-intelligence, announced on Wednesday that it has inked an agreement with United Arab Emirates-based telecom company etisalat by e& to protect its infrastructure from cybercriminals.

Founded in 2010 by Itay Yanovski and Raz Alon, Cyberint focuses on tracking cyber-mercenaries and threat actors, exposing them and alerting entities both public and private of their presence to provide early warning to thousands of cyberattack attempts.

!!!As part of the three-year agreement estimated at several millions of shekels, etisalat by e&, also known as e&, will deploy Cyberint’s real-time intelligence and attack surface management platform to protect its infrastructure against emerging cyberthreats such as ransomware, leaked credentials, and fraud, and help the telecom firm take proactive steps against targeted attacks or campaigns before they occur.

“No enterprise wants to wait until its information is compromised or its service impacted to take action against cybercriminals, yet many companies remain vulnerable,” stated Cyberint CEO Yochai Corem. “Our agreement with etisalat by e& shows that forward-looking companies, especially those in critical verticals such as telecom, are taking action and turning the tables on cybercriminals.”

Cyberint says its Argos digital risk protection platform provides real-time threat intelligence through the constant analysis of hundreds of millions of data points and ongoing monitoring of external risk exposure.
!!!The platform tracks cybercriminals in the dark and deep web, criminal forums, market places, social media platforms, instant messaging, file sharing repositories and more, to protect businesses from threats such as fraud, phishing, malware, data leakage, vulnerabilities, brand, and social media risks.

“The deal comes at a time when cyber threats to the telecom industry are rapidly increasing due to factors such as legacy technology, large attack surfaces, and the valuable information they handle. In addition, high-profile attacks that resulted in the theft of sensitive personal data have further underscored the dangers faced by the industry,” Cyberint said in a statement.

In December, the heads of the cyber agencies from Morocco, Bahrain, the UAE and Israel gathered in Bahrain for the first time to discuss the establishment of a joint cyber defense platform to share and conduct regional investigations amid increased threats from Iranian hackers.”

Phages – an alternative to antibiotics?
<https://www.dw.com/en/phages-an-alternative-to-antibiotics/video-63219388>

“Growing levels of antibiotic resistance worldwide have led to an increase in research in bacteriophages as a possible substitute for antibiotics. Swiss researchers are even engineering phages in the lab to fight a broader range of bacteria.”

Repair set for bone fractures
<https://www.dw.com/en/repair-set-for-bone-fractures/video-63219324>

“Even complex bone fractures can be treated these days without a problem. And research is continuing into a substance that stimulates the growth of new bone tissue. It’s designed for multifragmentary fractures where entire pieces of bone are missing.”

Good short videos.

@ vas pup,

Re : Phages are alternatives to antibiotics.

I first heard about the use of phages back in the 1970’s when anti-biotics wwre still not that good especially if you had an alergy to penicillin as many do.

The research had “leaked out” across the “iron curtain” where anti-biotics were even less well developed and instead they had gone down the phage route. Why I can not remember precisely (I was quite young) however I do remember the Vietnam war was still hitting the news almost every night and it was clear that the meds available were not sufficient to meet the needs of those hurt.

The research on phages had progressed quite well into the 1980’s and as a therapy it was being used fairly widely behind the then Iron Curtain.

The problem from the West and Big Phama perspective back then is what it still is today. No matter how good something is unless Big Phama can make inordinate amounts of money out of it they won’t touch it. So Big Phama in the West chose to go down the streptomyces family of bacterium and produced quite a number of DNA interfering antibiotics and one or two that interfere with RNA (some of which were looked at for C19 treatment).

Worse if it’s a quick cure Big Phama won’t want to touch it either. As was seen a decade o...
