# macOS Privilege Escalation Exploit :computer:

I wrote this PoC based on this article  : https://www.alter-solutions.fr/blog/local-privilege-escalating-my-way-to-root-throught-apple-macos-filesystems

This repository contains an exploit script targeting a critical privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2023-42931) affecting macOS versions Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma. ðŸš¨

## Vulnerability Description :warning:

The vulnerability allows unprivileged users to gain full root control over the system by exploiting the "diskutil" command line utility. This poses a significant security risk to affected macOS systems. :lock:

## Exploit Overview :rocket:

The exploit script leverages the "diskutil" command to mount filesystems with specific options, enabling the attacker to escalate their privileges. It involves creating a setuid shell payload, modifying filesystem permissions, copying the payload to a placeholder file, setting permissions and setuid bit, and executing the payload to gain root access. :boom:

## Usage :hammer_and_wrench:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute the exploit script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Disclaimer :warning:
