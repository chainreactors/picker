As security technology and threat awareness among organizations improves so do the adversaries who are adopting and relying on new techniques to maximize speed and impact while evading detection.

Ransomware and malware continue to be the method of choice by big game hunting (BGH) cyber criminals, and the increased use of hands-on or "interactive intrusion" techniques is especially alarming. Unlike malware attacks that rely on automated malicious tools and scripts, human-driven intrusions use the creativity and problem-solving abilities of attackers. These individuals can imitate normal user or administrative behaviors, making it challenging to distinguish between legitimate activities and cyber-attacks.

The goal of most security practitioners today is to manage risk at scale. Gaining visibility, reducing the noise, and securing the attack surface across the enterprise requires the right people, processes, and security solutions.

With the use of [penetration testing services](https://www.breachlock.com/penetration-testing-service/), organizations can proactively combat these new and evolving threats helping security practitioners identify and validate what is normal and what is potential malicious activity. Penetration testing consists of varied technologies, both human-led and automated, and the use of certified pentesting experts, or ethical hackers, to emulate a cyber-attack against a network and its asset(s). Pentesters will use real-world tactics and techniques like those of attackers with the goal of discovering and exploiting a known or unknown vulnerability before a breach occurs.

This type of proactive offensive security approach requires planning and preparation by security leaders to maximize the effectiveness of penetration testing, including choosing the right security provider to meet your security and business objectives.

## **The Steps to Successful Penetration Testing**

The following steps are necessary to properly prepare and plan for penetration testing, all of which will be outlined in further detail:

1. **Establish team:** Determine the security leaders that will be involved in the penetration testing initiative, including establishing a main POC or central organizer. Outline roles and responsibilities and provide clear objectives.
2. **Stakeholders:**  Identify the key stakeholders and decision-makers. What are their roles and when will their approvals be needed and at what stage of the penetration testing.
3. **Create a project plan:** Ensure that a clear project plan is created that outlines the scope of the testing, specific systems and assets to be tested, timeline, objectives, and expected outcomes.
4. **Choose a testing methodology:** Select the right testing methodology to fit the scope. Common methodologies include Black Box, White Box, and Gray Box testing. Also consider the specific techniques your organization would like to deploy whether it is social engineering, API Fuzzing, external-facing web app testing, etc.
5. **Support for the security team:** Consider what support the security team will need and whether the organization has the right expertise, resources, and budget. Determine whether the project will be handled internally or if an external pentesting service provider is needed. If selecting an external service provider, ask about the type of support and expertise that they offer.
6. **Engaging with the vendor:** After doing some investigating, be sure to ask the right questions when choosing a vendor. Questions may include, but are not limited to:
   * Is penetration testing part of your core business?
   * Do you hold professional liability insurance?
   * Can you provide references or testimonials?
   * Do you hold the right pentesting certifications such as ISO 9001 or CREST?
   * What are the qualifications of your pentesters?
   * How do you stay current with the latest vulnerabilities and exploits?
   * What is your pentesting methodology and pricing structures?
7. **Debrief of Report:**  Preparing a comprehensive report of the pentesting findings and recommendations for remediation will be important. Debrief with your team, and pentesting service provider if using one, to analyze the findings and potential risk associated with them. Collaborate closely with stakeholders to ensure the results are properly understood and a timeline is agreed upon for timely remediation.
8. **Remediation action steps:**  Prepare a report of detailed findings and provide clear guidance on the prioritization of vulnerabilities based on severity, identifying action steps to mitigate these risks. Maintain effective communication, accountability, and quick resolution.
9. **Retest and validate:** Additional retesting may be needed to validate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts, and they have been successfully addressed. Ensure that no new issues have arisen during the pentesting process.

### **Understand Your Attack Surface**

To understand your attack surface, it is important to have complete visibility of your cyber assets. There are three main considerations to understanding your attack surface:

**1. Visibility of Your Attack Surface:** Identify hidden and unmanaged cyber assets

Attackers are increasingly taking advantage of the attack surface as an organization's digital footprint grows. This expanded attack surface makes it easier for bad actors to find weaknesses while making it hard...
