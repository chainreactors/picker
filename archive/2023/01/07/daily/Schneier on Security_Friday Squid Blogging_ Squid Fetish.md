## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Fetish

[Seems that](https://aella.substack.com/p/fetish-tabooness-vs-popularity) about 1.5% of people have a squid fetish.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ Bruce,

> “Seems that about 1.5% of people have a squid fetish.”

It’s been a while since fetish and squid have appeared on this page…

Last time I remember it was about a fetish that was mainly Japanese expressed in some what graphic art…

Any way, enough on that.

Every so often we need something with the “ahhh” factor in it. This has it in spade loads,

<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-64172621>

It is frankly quite amazing, not only that it lived, but how well adapted it has become.

Oh and of course “cute” by quite some measure.

> AI legal assistant will help defendant fight a speeding case in court

> In February, an AI from DoNotPay is set to tell a defendant exactly what to say and when during an entire court case. It is likely to be the first ever case defended by an artificial intelligence.

I dislike this action if for no other reason that I dislike context free race to the end decision making. I see a lot of this behaviour especially off men. It’s also yet another “technical” solution peddled by someone who wants to monitize the potential of a technology and get some marketing out of it in the process. What’s really really bothering me isn’t the technology or end run of legal questions about doing this but the mentality of people.

And so you will end up with “AI” lawyers defending clients who were passengers of “AI” driven cars designed by companies using “AI” CAD systems and nobody was held responsible when someone died.

It’s also not a first as such. Clients who are advised by lawyers may have lawyers who use “AI” or more likely expert systems.

Law in practice is already worrying in the sense that money can buy a result simply by the fact huge amounts of money sloshing around employs not just one overworked lawyer but entire teams of lawyers all of whom can conduct sometimes time consuming legal searches or legal archaeology. This technology reeks a bit of creating a yet another corporate walled garden. Yet another arms race. Yet another inequity. Yet another ” inevitability…. Mr Anderson”.

Thinking of science fiction Frank Herbert’s “Dune” novels explored the idea of a civilisation where computers were banned. Ian M. Banks explored the idea in “The Player of Games” that while an AI could outperform a human without effort there were nuances and incalculables that a human could process an AI couldn’t.

Law is a process and there is a process the client and lawyer go through and also go through between themselves. It is a process of discovery. This is why sometimes, not always, it’s important for both a lawyer and client to pay attention. One can spot something the other has missed sometimes when building a case and sometimes when in the court. There will also be nuances and a beat to the court. A moment to push something. A moment to take a break. You won’t find any of that in an AI.

This case also reeks of a limited dataset and very likely a “golden path”. As long as the case remains within those parameters and nothing unusual happens it is possible the case may be won by the “AI”.

It’s really difficult to say who is the greatest ever chess player because chess players are products of their time. Chess evolves over time as new games are played and new things are discovered about the game. It’s now almost completely a “solved problem”. This is why Magnus Carslen plays to get other players “out of book”. He is then able to rely on his natural talent to win rather than historical analysis or AI assistance during practice. Yes even he will be crushed by the top AI chess computers but against another human he is one of the best ever. Some have argued he is the greatest ever although he himself eschews this description at least in part for the reasons already stated.

On a technical legal point I don’t believe a win for the “AI” will actually count as a win by the court. The client is effectively represented themself assisted by an AI. An AI’s decision cannot stand unless there is a human being in the loop who grants ultimate authorisation and they are held to account for the advice given by the AI. If they have missed something not covered by the AI that’s their problem and they will be held account for that too.

And what if you have an AI defending an AI which just happens to be a war robot which went on a killing spree? Then what?? Are we going to cut out the middle and have AI judges?

All crime is committed by humans. The crime is life. The sentence is DEATH.

Happy new year.

@echo:

I’m less concerned about AI liability than some people are. You can sue a carpenter for bad carpentry that injured you, even though the carpenter used a hammer; you don’t have to worry about suing the hammer, or even the hammer manufacturer. That’s because the carpenter chose to use the hammer and so the carpenter is liable. If the hammer was (somehow) at fault, you could still sue the carpenter and then the carpenter could sue the hammer manufacturer in a third-party suit. The same is true of computers as tools. If you sue a company for wrongdoing and their only defense is that their computer made them do it, the company generally will lose. AI is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.

At DoNotPay, the AI is not anywhere near human skill levels of attorneys. According to <https://donotpay.com/learn/terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy/> (as accessed today):
