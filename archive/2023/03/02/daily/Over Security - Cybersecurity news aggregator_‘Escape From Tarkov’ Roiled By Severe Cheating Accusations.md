In the popular extraction shooter *Escape from Tarkov*, you may never know where that bullet came from. Unlike other shooters like *Call of Duty: Warzone*, Tarkov does not have killcams, which show who killed you and how from the enemy’s perspective. Instead, you’re left to wonder: how did that player know I was coming? And, were they a cheater?

Many more players will now be asking that second question. On Friday, Tarkov YouTuber g0at [published their own dive into the cheating world of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LfGcDB7Ek) *[Tarkov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LfGcDB7Ek)*, and claimed that something like 60 percent of matches may contain a cheater. Although certainly not a perfect investigation with perfect data, g0at’s work still provides a snapshot of the cheating problem on a shooter that prides itself on its uncompromising difficulty and need to outsmart your opponents.

“The community cannot solve the issue of cheating in *Escape from Tarkov* or gaming in general. However, we can be educated consumers and judge the validity of their attempts,” g0at, whose real name is Tim Kyle, told Motherboard in an email. “I don’t fault McDonalds if they put up yellow cones and a customer slips and falls. But I will judge them for mopping the entrance without any signage and causing an elderly person to slip and break their hip.”

In his video, g0at installed his own set of Tarkov cheats which allowed him to see players through walls, a type of cheat that is generally known across the underground industry as extra-sensory perception (ESP) or wallhacks. G0at now had insight into whether an opposing player appeared to look at him through opaque objects, something that would be exceptionally unlikely without cheats.

G0at went a step further, and introduced something called the “wiggle.” When g0at peered at an enemy across the map, one ordinarily blocked by buildings, trees, or obstacles, he rapidly shimmied his character left to right. In some cases, the other player wiggled back. The implication: this player was *also* using cheats, and could see g0at as well.

In all, g0at said that across 125 matches he found what he believed were “obvious” cheaters in 60 percent of the games.

Detecting cheaters in competitive games has been a difficult problem for as long as they’ve existed, and one that even the biggest video game companies in the world still don’t have a perfect solution for. G0at’s research method and claim that 60 percent of players are cheating is far from fact, but simply highlighting the cheating issue has caused the *Tarkov* community to react with despair, anger, and dismay.

“I want to love tarkov. It’s right up my alley as far as games go. But, man this sucks,” [one member of the Tarkov subreddit wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/11e8d2b/comment/jacr4hh/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Moderators [have removed links](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/11bhgy1/60_percent/) to g0at’s video from the Tarkov subreddit. On Monday, g0at [uploaded a second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdyHnvZyQYo) in which he mentioned he is banned from the subreddit.

Zavodskoy, a moderator of the Tarkov subreddit, confirmed to Motherboard that moderators have been removing g0at’s video from posts. They said the moderators had since changed that decision. They also said that although g0at is banned from the subreddit, it is because of rule violation around how many times he was allowed to promote his videos, and that he was banned in July 2022. Zavodskoy said g0at has not contacted moderators to be unbanned. G0at disputes this, and told Motherboard he continuously contacted the moderators more than a year ago.

Nikita Buyanov, the COO of Tarkov developer Battlestate Games, [posted their own thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/11c7wi1/hackers_cheaters_and_other_related_scum_of_the/) to the subreddit too.
