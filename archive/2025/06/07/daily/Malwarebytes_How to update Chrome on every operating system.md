# How to update Chrome on every operating system

Posted: June 6, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

We [often write about important updates](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog?s=update+Chrome) for the most popular browser, Google Chrome. Since it would be out of scope to post elaborate update instructions for every possible platform and operating system (OS)—like iOS, macOS, Windows, [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus), etc.—we decided to turn this topic into a separate post that is easy to find (and link to). Also, keep in mind that not every update will be available for every platform or at the same time. You can find when the latest update for your operating system was released on this [Google Chrome releases website](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com).

Keeping your Google Chrome browser up to date is essential for security, performance, and access to the latest features. Whether you’re on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, or iOS, updating Chrome is straightforward, if you know where to look.

But first a few words about the version numbers, because they can be confusing at times.

The Chrome version number consists of four parts separated by dots, like this:

**MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD.PATCH**

Each part has a specific meaning. In order of relevance they are:

* **MAJOR**: This number increases with significant releases that may include major new features or changes. It usually raises in increments about 7 – 8 times per year, roughly every 6 weeks, reflecting Chrome’s release cycle.
* **MINOR**: This number is typically zero and rarely changes. It mainly supports the versioning scheme but doesn’t usually affect how users track updates.
* **BUILD**: This number increases steadily and represents a specific snapshot of Chrome’s source code at a given time. It advances with each new build candidate and is the key indicator of how recent the core code is.
* **PATCH**: This number changes in increments for smaller fixes and security patches applied to a particular build. It resets with each new build and helps identify minor updates within the same build.

For example, a version like **137.0.7151.56** means:

* Major version 137 (the milestone release)
* Minor version 0 (standard)
* Build number 7151 (the code snapshot)
* Patch number 56 (the latest fix on that build)

### Why does the version number matter?

The **BUILD** and **PATCH** numbers together uniquely identify the exact code you are running. Even if two versions share the same major number, a higher build or patch number means you have a newer, more up-to-date Chrome version.

Sometimes you might see slightly different patch numbers on the same major build, for example, **118.0.5993.117** vs. **118.0.5993.118**. This usually happens because Google released a quick fix or minor patch shortly after the initial release. Both are part of the same major update, but the higher patch number is newer.

## How to check if you have the latest version

To verify your Chrome version:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.
3. Go to **Help** > **About Google Chrome**.

Chrome will display your current version and automatically check for updates. If a newer version is available, it will download and prompt you to relaunch once it’s ready updating.
