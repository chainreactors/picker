## Introduction

Bug bounty hunting in 2025 has become a wild mix of flashy recon tools, infinite browser tabs, and people posting `$20K P1 RCE on Login Page` writeups that make you question your entire existence. But here’s the truth no one tweets about: **recon alone won’t carry you**. In this write-up, I’m sharing what I learned the hard way — that understanding the app beats out running 10 tools overnight. Let’s cut the noise and get real about what actually helped me grow as a bug hunter.

## Whoami?

Name’s Harsh — aka **cyberhrsh**. I break stuff on the internet (legally, unless Company ghosting me counts as a crime). I specialize in logic bugs — the kind where you poke something with a dumb idea… and suddenly you’re inside someone’s account. Or their wallet. Or their therapist’s notes (true story, NDA tho).

I’m not a recon machine. I don’t spend 8 hours watching gau spit out 9000 URLs just to realize 8500 of them are `robots.txt`. If you vibe with that, you’re gonna like this post.

This isn’t a guide. It’s a **reality check**.

## The Recon Obsession Phase (We’ve All Been There)

Let’s rewind.

It’s Nov 2024. I’m “serious” about bug hunting. I’ve got the tools, the Discord tags, and a Notion doc titled **“$2K Bugs Incoming”**.

The plan? Run **Subfinder**, **Amass**, **gau**, **waybackurls**, **httpx**, **ffuf**, **katana**, and maybe even **shuffle DNS** until the server cries.

I thought recon *was* hacking.

I even had a tmux window showing a cool recon dashboard like:
 `[+] Discovered 2,134 subdomains in 17.04 seconds`
 *“WOW. THIS IS IT.”*

No bro. That was just **foreplay**.

## Recon ≠ Reward

Here’s the plot twist.

Despite all those tools, all those wordlists, all those “juicy subdomains” — I had **zero valid bugs** to show. Not even a duplicate. Just screenshots of 403 pages and a `/dev` folder with one HTML file that said *"test lol"*.

And then I did something wild.

I stopped automating.
I opened the site in a browser.
I clicked things.
I signed up. Reset my password. Looked at what the app *actually* did.

And boom.
Within a week, I had my first triaged bug — not from recon, but from **understanding**.

## Bugs Hide in the App — Not in Your Recon Folder

Look, recon is cool. It makes you feel like Batman with a terminal.

But the truth is, most impactful bugs aren’t hiding behind some `test-vault-qa-staging4.internal.blabla.io`.

They’re sitting right there on the main app, sipping coffee, waiting for someone to click the “Change Email” button and wonder,
 **“What if I change it to someone else’s email?”**

Recon can’t ask that question.

Only **curiosity + logic** can.

## The Mindset Shift That Changed Everything

When I stopped treating bug hunting like digital mining and started treating it like problem-solving, things clicked.

* Instead of brute-forcing URLs, I asked: “What’s the business logic here?”
* Instead of fuzzing 500 parameters, I asked: “Which 3 are actually sensitive?”
* Instead of chasing deep recon, I watched how the app *handled users*.

That’s when I found:

* Account takeover without verifying email
* Token issues in GraphQL
* Shopping cart abuse through logic skips
* Pre-hijack scenarios *with zero interaction*

None of these came from recon. They came from slowing down and using **brain > Burp**.

## Let’s Talk Human

You know what recon doesn’t prepare you for?

* The **anxiety** of waiting 27 days for a triage update
* Getting a **“Won’t Fix”** for an actual working bug
* Debugging your PoC like it’s an OSCP exam
* The **dopamine crash** after a duplicate
* Forgetting what day it is because your tabs say `POST /api/v1/register`

But that’s what real bug hunting looks like.

Not cool dashboards.
Not 0-day flexes.
 Just persistence, curiosity, and lots of *“wait… what if?”*

## The Point

Recon is a *tool*, not a religion.

It should **support** your thought process, not **replace** it.

If you’re spending 90% of your time finding hosts and 10% thinking about how they work — flip that.

Some of my best bugs came from:

* Clicking around like a normal user
* Testing weird input flows
* Assuming devs make mistakes (they do. they *really* do.)
* Asking dumb questions… and following through

Forget recon glory. Aim for bug **clarity**.

**So here’s my take:**

Recon is like Tinder. It helps you discover new options.
 But if you never talk, observe, or understand what you’re dealing with — you’re not going anywhere.

This year taught me that mindset beats methodology.

When I shifted from “find everything” to “understand something,” things finally started to click.

So if you’ve been stuck in recon loops, constantly scanning but rarely reporting — maybe it’s time to step back and ask:

> What am I really looking for?

Because most of the time, bugs aren’t hiding in your recon results.
They’re hiding in plain sight — inside the app, waiting for someone curious enough to poke the right edge.

This writeup isn’t some secret recipe. It’s just what worked for me — and maybe, if you’re feeling stuck, it might work for you too.

**A perspective from someone still learning, still messing up, and still showing up.**
