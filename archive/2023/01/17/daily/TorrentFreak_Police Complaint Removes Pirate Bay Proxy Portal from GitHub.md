# Police Complaint Removes Pirate Bay Proxy Portal from GitHub

GitHub has taken down a popular Pirate Bay proxy information portal from Github.io. The developer platform took action in response to a takedown request sent by City of London Police's Intellectual Property Crime Unit. The takedown notice concludes that the site, which did not link to any infringing content directly, is illegal.

In response to various court orders over the years, the notorious torrent site was blocked by dozens of ISPs all around the world. That’s also the case in the UK, where The Pirate Bay was added to the local piracy blocklist [over a decade ago](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-isps-must-censor-the-pirates-bay-high-court-rules-120430/).

These blocking efforts triggered the rise of hundreds of Pirate Bay proxy sites. While many of these were subsequently blocked, new ones continue to pop up, as do sites that provide an overview of the latest working proxies.

“The Proxy Bay” falls in the latter category. It provides links to the latest Pirate Bay proxies and also shares information on how people can start a proxy of their own. While rightsholders don’t like this type of information being shared, there are no links to copyrighted material on the site.

## Proxy Blocking

The lack of infringing content hasn’t stopped local music group BPI from pursuing legal action. As part of the original Pirate Bay blockade, thepirateproxybay.com and many similar sites are blocked by UK ISPs. Voluntarily complying with the same ruling, [Google followed suit](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/27615507?access_token=LeKjDKnVnTk_5QFa582GSA) by deindexing whole domains.

One domain managed to escape these blocking actions; proxybay.github.com. This GitHub subdomain is a copy of thepirateproxybay.com and appears to be operated by the same people, but it’s not blocked by UK ISPs.

Interestingly, we did spot the site on an [advertising blacklist](https://torrentfreak.com/github-domain-listed-on-police-piracy-blacklist-for-the-last-four-months-221112/) maintained by City of London Police’s Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU). In our article from a few months ago, we questioned why the police couldn’t have taken an easier route by sending a DMCA notice.

## ‘Criminal’ GitHub Subdomain

Fast forward to 2023 and PIPCU has decided to take up the matter on behalf of music group BPI. Police [sent a takedown request](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/01/2023-01-11-piratebay.md) to the Microsoft-owned company, alerting it to the alleged criminal activity taking place on its domain.

“This site is in breach of UK law, namely Copyright, Design & Patents Act 1988, Offences under the Fraud Act 2006 and Conspiracy to Defraud,” PIPCU writes.

“Suspension of the domain(s) is intended to prevent further crime. Where possible we request that domain suspension(s) are made within 48 hours of receipt of this Alert,” the notice adds.

This takedown request was honored by GitHub, meaning that people who try to access the domain now get a [404 error](http://proxybay.github.io/) instead.

## Muddying the Waters

While GitHub’s swift response is understandable, it’s worth pointing out how these blocking efforts are evolving and expanding, far beyond blocking the original Pirate Bay site.

The Proxy Bay doesn’t link to infringing content directly. The site links to other proxy sites which serve up the Pirate Bay homepage. From there, users may search for or browse torrent links that, once loaded, can download infringing content.

Does this mean that simply linking to The Pirate Bay can be considered a crime in itself? If that’s the case, other sites such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay#External_links) and [Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=pirate+bay) are in trouble too.

A more reasonable middle ground would be to consider the intent of a site. The Proxy Bay was launched to facilitate access to The Pirate Bay, which makes court orders less effective. In 2015 UK ISPs began [blocking proxy and proxy indexing](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-isps-quietly-block-lists-of-pirate-bay-proxies-150310/) sites, so that explains why thepirateproxybay.com and others are regularly blocked.

Whether this constitutes criminal activity is ultimately for the court to decide, not the police. In this regard, it’s worth noting that City of London Police previously [arrested](https://torrentfreak.com/police-arrest-operator-torrent-site-proxies-140806/) the alleged operator of a range of torrent site proxies.

The then 20-year-old defendant, who also developed censorship circumvention tool Immunicity, was threatened with a hefty prison sentence but the court disagreed and [dismissed the case](https://torrentfreak.com/uk-court-dismisses-case-against-torrent-site-proxy-operator-170307/).
