[with one comment](https://krypt3ia.wordpress.com/2024/12/31/threat-brief-global-disinformation-campaigns-and-emerging-trends-2024/#comments)

**Executive Summary**

Disinformation has emerged as a powerful weapon in the arsenal of state and non-state actors, targeting democracies and leveraging the interconnectedness of the digital age. Key global players such as Russia, China, and Iran are employing advanced technologies and social engineering tactics to disrupt democratic processes, shape public opinion, and further geopolitical aims.

### **Country-Specific Disinformation Campaigns**

#### **Russia**

* **Strategic Goals**: Russia’s disinformation campaigns are primarily focused on destabilizing Western democracies, undermining public trust in institutions, and exploiting existing societal divisions. These efforts are designed to weaken adversaries while maintaining plausible deniability.

* **Key Tactics**:
* Use of **deepfakes**: Highly realistic fake videos to target political figures and erode their credibility.
* Deployment of AI-driven content farms to produce vast quantities of misleading information at scale.
* Exploitation of social media algorithms to amplify divisive narratives.

* **Notable Campaigns**:
* Election Interference: Russian operatives have disseminated false information about the U.S. electoral system, particularly around mail-in voting, to create confusion and lower voter turnout.
* Targeting of Individuals: Fake videos purporting to show U.S. officials engaging in compromising activities have surfaced, designed to discredit public figures and sway public opinion.

#### **China**

* **Strategic Goals**: China’s disinformation efforts aim to project a positive image of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), discredit critics, and promote narratives that align with its strategic interests, particularly concerning Taiwan and global trade policies.

* **Key Tactics**:
* **“Spamouflage” campaigns**: Networks of fake accounts disseminating content designed to appear organic while promoting pro-China messages.
* Amplification of divisive issues in Western democracies to distract from China’s actions and policies.

* **Notable Campaigns**:
* Chinese actors have targeted political candidates critical of the CCP, spreading inflammatory and often racist messages to tarnish their reputations.
* Efforts to influence public discourse around Taiwan by spreading misleading information about U.S. military involvement and regional tensions.

#### **Iran**

* **Strategic Goals**: Iran leverages disinformation to exacerbate divisions within the United States and influence public opinion in a way that aligns with its ideological and political goals.

* **Key Tactics**:
* Use of **AI-generated content** to impersonate trusted sources or create divisive content targeting specific communities.
* Exploiting cultural and religious sensitivities to deepen societal rifts.

* **Notable Campaigns**:
* Iranian operatives have created content targeting minority groups, particularly Black and Muslim Americans, to exploit grievances and reduce trust in the political system.
* Preparations for U.S. election influence operations, as evidenced by reconnaissance of election-related websites and systems.

### **Emerging Trends in Disinformation Tactics**

#### **Artificial Intelligence and Deepfakes**

The rapid evolution of generative AI tools has introduced new dimensions to disinformation. While fears of large-scale AI-driven campaigns in 2024 elections have not yet been fully realized, the technology’s potential is evident:

* **Deepfake Videos**: Used to fabricate speeches or actions of public figures, creating confusion and mistrust.
* **Synthetic Narratives**: Automated generation of tailored stories designed to appeal to specific audiences.

#### **Targeted Disinformation Campaigns**

A notable trend is the hyper-targeting of disinformation to specific demographic groups. This method increases the likelihood of resonance and amplifies societal divisions:

* Russia has amplified Spanish-language disinformation targeting Latino communities in the U.S.
* Iran has tailored campaigns to Muslims and Black Americans in battleground states, often using culturally sensitive narratives.

#### **Exploitation of Social Media Platforms**

Social media continues to serve as the primary battleground for disinformation:

* Platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram face criticism for their inconsistent moderation policies.
* Conspiracy theories and false narratives, such as those related to vaccine safety or election fraud, have gained traction due to algorithmic amplification.

#### **Disinformation-for-Hire**

The commercialization of disinformation has led to an increase in private entities offering “disinformation-as-a-service,” enabling smaller actors to influence public discourse at a fraction of the cost of state-led campaigns.

### **Criminal Use of Disinformation**

#### **Financial Fraud and Scams**

* **Pump-and-Dump Schemes**: Disinformation is spread via social media to inflate the value of stocks or cryptocurrencies. After prices rise, the perpetrators sell their assets at a profit, leaving others with losses.
* **Phishing and Social Engineering**: Cybercriminals use fake information or misleading content to impersonate trusted entities (e.g., banks, governments) to extract sensitive information such as passwords or financial details.

#### **Ransomware Operations**

* **Reputational Blackmail**: Criminal groups spread false narratives about victims to coerce them into paying ransoms. For example, attackers might claim a company has experienced a larger data breach than it has to pressure them into compliance.
* **Data Leak Threats**: To add credibility to threats, ransomware groups often disseminate exaggerated or false claims about the extent of stolen data.

#### **Fake News and Misinformation Campaigns**

* **Undermining Competitors**: Criminal organizations sometimes spread fake news to disrupt competitors or manipulate markets in their favor.
* **Discrediting Authorities**: Disinformation campaigns can target law enforcement or regulatory agencies to erode public trust, allowing criminal enterprises to operate with reduced scrutiny.

#### **Deepfake Technology**

* **Identity Theft and Fraud**: Criminals use AI-generated deepfake videos and voices to impersonate high-ranking officials or executives in a tactic called “business email compromise” (BEC) scams. These scams have resulted in substantial financial losses.
* **Manipulated Evidence**: Deepfakes are also used to produce false evidence in legal disputes or to blackmail individuals with fabricated compromising content.

#### **Recruitment and Radicalization**

* Criminal groups, including drug cartels and terrorist organizations, employ disinformation to recruit members by glamorizing their activities or misrepresenting their causes.

#### **Election Interference for Profit**

* Criminal entities have been implicated in selling disinformation services to the highest bidder, including “disinformation-for-hire” schemes where political candidates or corporate entities pay to spread false narratives.

### **Emerging Trends in Criminal Disinformation**

**Collaboration with State Actors**: In some cases, criminal groups collaborate with state actors to amplify disinformation campaigns in exchange for protection or financial gain.

**Use of Bots and Automation**: Automation tools are increasingly used to amplify fraudulent schemes or disinformation campaigns at scale.

**Marketplace for Disinformation Services**: Dark web marketplaces now offer tools and services for spreading disinformation, including botnets, fake news creation kits, and reputation-smearing campaigns.
