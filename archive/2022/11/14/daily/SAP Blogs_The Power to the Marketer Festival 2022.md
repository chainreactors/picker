The Emarsys Festival started back in 2020, with the primary aim of bringing together leading marketing professionals from all over the globe, on a virtual landscape.

With the festival now being a yearly tradition here, with each iteration we have attempted to build it bigger and better.That's why this year, we decided to expand it to another level, by not only creating a virtual environment to host content in, but to also host live - in person events all across the globe.

We had live events staged in 4 major cities, including two that were hosted by Vogue Business in London and New York, as well events in Paris and Sydney.

The theme for this years event was all about bringing [Power to the Marketer.](https://emarsys.com/power-to-the-marketer-festival-2022/)

We wanted to celebrate the impact that marketers make every single day, raising a toast to past successes and hearing how industry leaders are paving the way in their Omnichannel Marketing journeys.

We put marketers centre stage with keynote presentations, panel discussions and a whole host of other content including best practice sessions, live training and more.

Here is a recap:

* [Day 1](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/day-1-recap-leading-the-way-to-better-customer-engagement/) was all about Leading the Way to Better Customer Engagement. We went live from New York, hearing how brands like Columbia, Innovasport, and Disney Theatrical all ensure their customer experiences are personalized and relevant, and that they meet their customersâ€™ high expectations.

* On [day 2](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/power-to-the-marketer-day-2-recap-gibson-guitars-forrester-emarsys-keynote/), we talked Omnichannel Marketing, CX, and Revenue. In the Emarsys Product Keynote: Striking the Chord between CX and Revenue, we premiered all the latest innovations coming to the Platform, including a demo with Gibson Guitars.

* Then finally on [day 3](https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/day-3-recap-reaching-new-audiences-with-constant-innovation/), we broadcast live from London, giving you the lowdown on how to reach new audiences with constant innovation. Highlights included the session with Eva Kruse, Group SVP, Global Engagement and Impact of Pangaia who taught us how to navigate the difficult decisions in a digital world.
