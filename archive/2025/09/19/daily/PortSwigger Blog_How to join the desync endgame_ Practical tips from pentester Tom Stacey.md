***Note:** This is a guest post by pentester and researcher, Tom Stacey ([@t0xodile](https://x.com/t0xodile))*.

You'd think that after almost 21 years since its initial public discovery, [HTTP Request Smuggling](/web-security/request-smuggling) would be barely exploitable on even the most outdated backend servers and proxies. Sadly, despite the industry's best efforts, it would seem that the days of desynchronising response queues and taking control of entire applications are far from over. With the release of [HTTP/1.1 must die: the desync endgame](https://http1mustdie.com/), Portswigger Research have shown the world the truth, **HTTP/1.1 is inherently insecure** and as a result, must die.

To kick-start the desync endgame and provide evidence of this claim, [James Kettle](https://portswigger.net/research/james-kettle) and a team of bug bounty hunters and researchers have compromised 3 major CDNs through the introduction of 2 new desync vulnerability classes raking in **over $350,000 in payouts**.

Despite the enormous success of these novel techniques, the impact of the techniques shared in the paper have really only just begun. HTTP/1.1 must die serves not only as a demonstration to the industry that HTTP Request Smuggling is still a prevalent and critical issue, but first and foremost, as a call to arms for all of us to join the desync endgame.

Whether you're new to desync vulnerabilities, a seasoned [penetration testing](/solutions/penetration-testing) professional or a bug bounty hunter hoping to capitalise on one of the largest public opportunities for critical payouts you've ever seen, the following will provide you with everything you need to join in with the destruction of HTTP/1.1.

## HTTP/1.1 must die: a review

I had the absolute privilege of heading out to DEF CON with some help from Portswigger this year in order to see the talk live, chat to the research team and absorb as much information as I could in order to produce this very post.

The research covers two novel desync vulnerability classes that yet again, highlight both the complexity of implementing HTTP/1.1 and critically its fatal flaw, the challenge of **identifying the boundaries between individual requests**. I believe that identifying this "challenge" as an actual vulnerability in itself, represents the biggest shift in mentality that you'll need in order to understand why HTTP/1.1 must die.

While historically, we've focused on band-aid patching of parser discrepancies between intermediary components, the last 9 years of research should tell you, this approach has utterly failed. By ditching canned exploit probes and identifying a new scanning technique (already integrated into the latest version of [HTTP Request Smuggler](https://github.com/PortSwigger/http-request-smuggler)) to focus instead on detection of inconsistent parsing of HTTP headers, James has revealed an avalanche of desync leads that with a little manual effort can, more often than not, completely compromise any given target that implements HTTP/1.1 **anywhere** upstream.

As always, all tools and techniques have been released open source, allowing the community to grab these new methodologies and start hunting for critical desync vulnerabilities.

In short the research is phenomenally presented, powerful and as usual, absolutely terrifying.

## Getting up to speed with the latest research

Something many bug bounty hunters will be acutely aware of, is how important it is to jump on the latest research as fast as possible. That is, if you want to secure the largest bounties. For newer testers and hunters, this might seem a little daunting, and for good reason. HTTP Request Smuggling has been around for so long now, that understanding the topic in its entirety has become a significant challenge, especially for newer testers and bug bounty hunters. Before you dive into hunting, let's list the resources you need in order to get up to speed as quickly as possible.

### 1. Get to grips with HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 is itself a humungous topic. However, [Martin](http://portswigger.net/research/martin-doyhenard) from the Portswigger Research team has summarized it beautifully, (with a specific focus on desync vulnerabilities) in his talk *Surfing through the stream: Advanced HTTP Desync exploitation in the wild*. Sadly I imagine that a recording for this talk will not be released at the time of this post's release. As an alternative I'd take a look at the "Core concepts" sections of James's papers [HTTP Desync Attacks: ...
