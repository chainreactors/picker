Gone are the days when “crypto” and “blockchain” were new buzzwords in the market. In 2024, exhibitions, conferences, and several other events dedicated to digital assets are common across the globe.

I attended such an event in Brussels from July 8 to July 11 – The Ethereum Community Conference 2024 (EthCC 2024). It discussed the evolution of Ethereum as well as its scope in the future. Thanks to all the tech workshops, keynotes, and side events, this was an interesting event to attend as a crypto enthusiast. It was no less than a melting pot of a plethora of attendees from all corners of the world! The attendees gave their opinions and shared their knowledge about the global blockchain ecosystem.

Keeping a few hassles like violent robberies aside, EthCC 2024 was organized impeccably and seamlessly. It did not bore the attendees with jargon and technical talks about things you can find on Google with a few simple clicks! The event balanced valuable technical information with an engaging atmosphere that fostered meaningful conversations.

Blockchain is already a part of many people’s everyday lives and this was also the theme of EthCC 2024 – Onchain Everywhere. The theme was all about seamlessly incorporating blockchain into our day-to-day activities. Such activities include everything from authenticating products to tracking supply chains and much more. Also, the event had more than 500 side events, making my experience at the event pretty enriching. Getting down to the brass tacks, here are five of my most important takeaways from EthCC 2024:

1. **Taking Big Strides In Gaming**

The experts at EthCC 2024 discussed **[a new frontier for crypto gaming](https://hackernoon.com/a-new-frontier-for-crypto-gaming-what-to-expect?ref=hackernoon.com)**, making it the event's hot topic. We have always associated gaming to be an integral part of blockchain and crypto. Discussions about gaming highlighted the potential of blockchain to revolutionize the industry of gaming across the globe.

Speakers and panelists talked about designing permissionless games, nurturing inclusive communities, and creating new streams of revenue for young gamers.

These discussions helped me understand the impact of decentralized game development on the global gaming industry. This can really help people own genuine in-game assets. The discussions also gave me valuable insights into the mainstream adoption of blockchain in the world of gaming, sticking to the event’s central theme.

2. **AI And Blockchain Integration**

Believe it or not, we live in a world dominated by AI innovations. Within a few years, artificial intelligence has entered almost every task we perform every single day. Thanks to the need to leverage this technology, experts discussed the scope of **[integrating AI and blockchain](https://hackernoon.com/the-convergence-of-ai-and-blockchain-a-game-changer-in-the-tech-industry?ref=hackernoon.com)**.

There were discussions around how a seamless blend of these two technologies will improve existing blockchain applications, leading to smarter and more efficient systems for every user worldwide.

3. **Web3 User Experience (UX): Progress And Challenges**

People worldwide have welcomed and appreciated Web3 as a valuable addition to cryptocurrencies. While there is significant progress in the field, **[Web3 is not devoid of challenges](https://hackernoon.com/how-poor-user-experience-is-holding-back-web3-adoption?ref=hackernoon.com)**.

EthCC 2024 acknowledged the progress made in this domain and the challenges the community needs to face head-on. For example, the community’s focus in 2023 was on account abstraction. This made Web3 more accessible with the development of smart contract account offerings. Talking about the key challenges, user onboarding and the general Web3 user experience need improvement. The discussions at the event helped me understand the issues that should be resolved in the Web3 space to ensure mass adoption. An insightful keynote by Vitalik Buterin (which I'll discuss later in detail) addressed the same concerns.

4. **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)**

This has to be the most valuable and strikingly hot concept discussed at EthCC 2024! **[Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)](https://hackernoon.com/depin-explained-what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks?ref=hackernoon.com)** are infrastructure models that employ tokenization to organize and incentivize orgnization’s progress.

A consortium, the **[DePIN Association](https://www.depinassociation.com/?ref=hackernoon.com)**, focused on fostering innovation, setting industry standards, and promoting the development DePIN was formed at EthCC 2024. It brought together ten pioneering organizations dedicated to advancing the DePIN ecosystem. The founding members—Acurast, peaq, DePINHub, PowerLedger, U2U Network, Impossible Cloud Network, POKT Network, SafeJunction, IoTeX, and Geodnet—are at the forefront of innovation in their respective fields, contributing to a collective vision for a more connected, decentralized world.

At the event in Brussels, DePIN experts spoke about how DePINs hold immense promise for reshaping how we build and manage infrastructure. By harnessing blockchain technology and decentralization principles, DePINs can revolutionize various sectors, from telecommunications and energy to data storage and compute power.

5. **Vitalik Buterin’s Visionary Keynote**

Undoubtedly, Vitalik Buterin’s keynote at EthCC 2024 was a highlight every attendee will remember. Combining his impeccable knowledge and the ability to convey the most complicated things in the simplest ways, Vitalik offered his insights into the blockchain network’s evolution. He talked about Ethereum’s quantum resistance, resilience, protocol simplification, and a lot more that inspired every attendee listening to him. I’m sure this keynote will spark many discussions in the days to come!

**The Final Word**

EthCC 2024 in Brussels was a memorable event, indeed. The company of like-minded professionals and listening to experts talk about the domains they know like the back of their hands was inspiring to say the least! From gaming and AI to DePIN and Web3, every area of discussion gave us a comprehensive look at how far technology has come and how far we can take it!
