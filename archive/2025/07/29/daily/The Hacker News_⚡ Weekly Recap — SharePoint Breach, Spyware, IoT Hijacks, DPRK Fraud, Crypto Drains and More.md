Some risks don't breach the perimeter‚Äîthey arrive through signed software, clean resumes, or sanctioned vendors still hiding in plain sight.

This week, the clearest threats weren't the loudest‚Äîthey were the most legitimate-looking. In an environment where identity, trust, and tooling are all interlinked, the strongest attack path is often the one that looks like it belongs. Security teams are now challenged to defend systems not just from intrusions‚Äîbut from trust itself being turned into a weapon.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Microsoft SharePoint Attacks Traced to China](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/storm-2603-exploits-sharepoint-flaws-to.html)** ‚Äî The fallout from an attack spree targeting defects in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers continues to spread a week after the discovery of the zero-day exploits, with more than 400 organizations globally compromised. The attacks have been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/microsoft-links-ongoing-sharepoint.html) to two known [Chinese hacking groups](https://css.ethz.ch/en/center/CSS-news/2025/07/before-vegas-the-red-hackers-who-shaped-chinas-cyber-ecosystem.html) tracked as Linen Typhoon (aka APT27), Violet Typhoon (aka APT31), and a suspected China-based threat actor codenamed Storm-2603 that has leveraged the access to deploy Warlock ransomware. The attacks leverage CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution bug, collectively called [ToolShell](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/sharepoint-toolshell/). Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-25/microsoft-sharepoint-hack-probe-on-whether-chinese-hackers-found-flaw-via-alert) that Microsoft is investigating whether a leak from Microsoft Active Protections Program ([MAPP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/mapp)), which provides early access to vulnerability information to security software providers, may have led to the zero-day exploitation. China has denied allegations it was behind the campaign.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[U.S. Treasury Sanctions N. Korean Company for IT Worker Scheme](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/us-sanctions-firm-behind-n-korean-it.html)** ‚Äî The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned a North Korean front company and three associated individuals for their involvement in the fraudulent remote information technology (IT) worker scheme designed to generate illicit revenues for Pyongyang. In a related move, Christina Marie Chapman, a laptop farmer in Arizona responsible for facilitating the scheme, was sentenced to jail for eight-and-a-half years, after raising $17 million in illicit funds for the regime. In these schemes, IT workers from North Korea use well-crafted, carefully curated portfolios, complete with full social media profiles, AI-enhanced photos and deepfakes, and stolen identities to pass background checks and land jobs at various U.S. companies. Once hired, they take the help of facilitators to receive company-issued laptops and other equipment, which they can then connect to remotely, thereby giving the impression that they are within the country where the company is located. The ongoing efforts operate with the twin goals of generating revenue for the Hermit Kingdom's nuclear program and other efforts via regular salaries, as well as gaining a foothold inside corporate networks for the purpose of planting malware for stealing secrets and extorting their employers. "DPRK's cyber operations challenge the traditional nation-state playbook ‚Äì merging cryptocurrency theft, espionage, and nuclear ambition within a self-funded system driven by profit, loyalty, and survival," [said](https://www.dtexsystems.com/newsroom/press-releases/dtex-exposes-north-koreas-cybercrime-syndicate/) Sue Gordon, a member of DTEX's Advisory Board and former principal deputy director of U.S. National Intelligence. "Recognizing it as a family-run mafia syndicate unblurs the lines between cybercrime and statecraft. This report pulls back the curtain on their inner workings and psychology, revealing how deeply embedded they already are within our workforce ‚Äì providing the context needed to anticipate their next move."
* **[Soco404 and Koske Target Misconfigured Cloud Instances to Drop Miners](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/soco404-and-koske-malware-target-cloud.html)** ‚Äî Two different malware campaigns have targeted vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across cloud environments to deliver cryptocurrency miners. These activity clusters have been codenamed Soco404 and Koske. While Soco404 targets both Linux and Windows systems to deploy platform-specific malware, Koske is a Linux-focused threat. There is also evidence to suggest that Koske has been developed using a large language model (LLM), given the presence of well-structured comments, best-practice logic flow with defensive scripting habits, and synthetic panda-related imagery to host the...
