Ransomware doesn‚Äôt just freeze computers ‚Äì it can silence alarms too. And when the Natural History Museum in Paris went dark, thieves helped themselves to ‚Ç¨600,000 worth of gold in a daring late-night heist. Meanwhile, developers have a new headache: a worm dubbed ‚ÄúShai Hulud‚Äù has wriggled its way through more than 180 npm packages, quietly stealing secrets.

But it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom ‚Äì unless you count your kitchen appliances turning into ad billboards.

All this and more is discussed in episode 436 of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast with cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, and his special guest Zo√´ Rose.
