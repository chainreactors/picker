Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a malicious campaign that leverages search engine optimization ([SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)) poisoning techniques to deliver a known malware loader called [Oyster](https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/oyster-backdoor-spreading-via.html) (aka Broomstick or CleanUpLoader).

The malvertising activity, per Arctic Wolf, promotes fake websites hosting trojanized versions of legitimate tools like PuTTY and WinSCP, aiming to trick software professionals searching for these programs into installing them instead.

"Upon execution, a backdoor known as Oyster/Broomstick is installed," the company [said](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog-uk/malvertising-campaign-delivers-oyster-broomstick-backdoor-via-seo-poisoning-and-trojanized-tools/) in a brief published last week.

"Persistence is established by creating a scheduled task that runs every three minutes, executing a malicious DLL (twain\_96.dll) via rundll32.exe using the DllRegisterServer export, indicating the use of DLL registration as part of the persistence mechanism."

The names of some of the bogus websites are listed below -

* updaterputty[.]com
* zephyrhype[.]com
* putty[.]run
* putty[.]bet, and
* puttyy[.]org

It's suspected that the threat actors behind the campaign may also be targeting other IT tools to deliver the malware, making it imperative that users stick to trusted sources and official vendor sites to download the necessary software.

The disclosure comes as black hat SEO poisoning techniques are being used to game search results associated with artificial intelligence (AI)-related keywords to spread [Vidar](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/hackers-use-tiktok-videos-to-distribute.html), [Lumma](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fbi-and-europol-disrupt-lumma-stealer.html), and [Legion Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/europol-arrests-five-smokeloader.html).

These websites come fitted with JavaScript code that checks for the presence of ad blockers and gathers information from the victim's browser, before initiating a redirection chain that ultimately takes the victim to a phishing page hosting a ZIP archive.

"The final download pages in this campaign deliver Vidar Stealer and Lumma Stealer as password-protected ZIP archives, with the password provided on the final downloading page," Zscaler ThreatLabz [said](https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/black-hat-seo-poisoning-search-engine-results-ai-distribute-malware). "Once extracted, they contain an 800MB NSIS installer, a deceptively large size intended to appear legitimate and bypass detection systems with file size limitations."

The NSIS installer is then used to execute an AutoIt script that's ultimately responsible for launching the stealer payloads. The delivery mechanism for Legion Loader, in contrast, leverages an MSI installer to deploy the malware via a batch script.

A similar SEO poisoning campaign has been [observed](https://sec.okta.com/articles/2025/07/how-this-clickfix-campaign-leads-to-redline-stealer/) to elevate phishing pages when users search for the names of popular web applications to direct users to fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA check pages that make use of the infamous [ClickFix](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-filefix-method-emerges-as-threat.html) strategy to drop [RedLine Stealer](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/dutch-police-disrupt-major-info.html) via [Hijack Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/new-malware-loaders-use-call-stack.html).

According to data compiled by Kaspersky, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are being increasingly targeted by cyber attacks that deliver malware disguised as popular AI and collaboration tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Cisco AnyConnect, Google Drive, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, and Zoom.

"Between January and April 2025 alone, around 8,500 small and medium-sized business users were targeted by cyber attacks in which malware or potentially unwanted software was disguised as these popular tools," the Russian cybersecurity company [said](https://securelist.ru/smb-threat-report-2025/112924/).

Zoom accounted for about 41% of the total number of unique files, followed by Outlook and PowerPoint at 16% each, Excel at 12%, Word at 9%, and Teams at 5%. The number of unique malicious files mimicking ChatGPT increased by 115% to 177 in the first four months of 2025.

While the trend of abusing fake search engine listings to take advantage of users' implicit in popular brands is a well-known tactic, recent campaigns have hijacked searches for tech support pages linked to Apple, Bank of America, Facebook, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal to serve legitimate pages through sponsored results in Google – but with an ingenious twist.

"Visitors are taken to the help/support section of the brand's website, but instead of the genuine phone number, the hijackers display their scammy number instead," Malwarebytes [said](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/06/scammers-hijack-websites-of-bank-of-america-netflix-microsoft...
