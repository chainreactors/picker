Whether you've been following EFF for years or just discovered us (hello!), you've probably noticed that our team is kind of obsessed with the ✨future✨.

From people [soaring through the sky](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/effs-def-con-27-t-shirt-puzzle), to [space cats](https://shop.eff.org/products/space-cat-pride-socks), [geometric unicorns](https://supporters.eff.org/files/unicorn-shirt-500b_0.png), and ([so many](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/04/screen-printing-101-effs-spring-speakeasy-babylon-burning)) [mechas](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/flex-your-power-own-your-tech)—we're always imagining what the future could look like when we get things right.

That same spirit inspired [EFF's 35th anniversary celebration](https://www.eff.org/35). And this year, members can get our new *EFF 35 Cityscape*t-shirt plus a limited-edition challenge coin with a [monthly](https://eff.org/r.d98c) or [annual](https://eff.org/r.13hk) Sustaining Donation!

[Join eFF!](https://eff.org/r.d98c)

Start a Convenient recurring donation Today!

The *EFF 35 Cityscape* proposes a future where users are empowered to

* Repair and tinker with their devices
* Move freely without being tracked
* Innovate with bold new ideas

And this future isn't far off—we're building it now.

EFF is pushing for right to repair laws across the country, exposing shady data brokers, and ensuring new technologies—like AI—have your rights in mind. EFF is determined and [with your help](https://eff.org/r.d98c), we're not backing down.
