# Adult sites trick users into Liking Facebook posts using a clickjack Trojan

Posted: August 7, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

As the use of [age verification](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/vpn-use-rises-following-online-safety-acts-age-verification-controls) to access adult websites increases in various countries around the world, shady websites with adult content have started a timely malware-fueled campaign to promote links to their own websites.

During our daily rounds on Facebook, looking for the latest scams, we noticed something odd about some posts pointing to adult websites. We found that several of the sites promoted in this way were hosted on blogspot[.]com, and that these sites linked to other similar sites.

Here’s one example:

![Example of blogspot page](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/website.png)

Most of these sites promise the visitor explicit pictures of celebrities, most of which will undoubtedly turn out to be generated by [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)).

This in itself is not uncommon. However, what did stand out was that a few of the Facebook posts had a lot of Likes. Most people don’t like that type of content on Facebook since everyone can see who the Likes are from.

![201 likes and loves](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Sir_likes_a_lot.png)

A high number of Likes for a post is great for the accounts posting these links, because when a Facebook profile or post gets more Likes it is more likely to show up in people’s feeds, which is basically more advertising for the same money.

So, how do the posts get these Likes?

It turns out the criminals use a [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) to promote their posts and profiles. When clicking through links displayed on the adult sites some—selected–visitors will download a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file. So while surfing from one of these sites to the next one, sometimes, not always, it triggers a download.

Now, the cybercriminals are banking on the fact that SVG is not a filetype that will set off an alarm for most people, given that most people see it as an image file. But SVG files are not always [simply image files](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/criminals-smuggle-phishing-code-in-svg-images).They are written in XML, and this allows them to contain HTML and Javascript code, which means that the cybercriminals can use them to get up to no good.

Here is the one provided by the adult sites:

![The code in the SVG file](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/svg_code.png?w=1024)

Despite the heavy obfuscation of the second part of the script, for anyone able to read the code it is pretty clear this file is up to no good. In fact, it actually downloads another malicious javascript file, but it was hard to figure out which one.

Because the code in the SVG file uses a technique called “hybrid JSFuck” (how fitting) to hide its intentions we immediately assumed that it was malicious. From the easier to read parts of the script we can deduct that the script downloads and executes a malicious script from the domain crhammerstein[.]de, which was blocked by Malwarebytes.
