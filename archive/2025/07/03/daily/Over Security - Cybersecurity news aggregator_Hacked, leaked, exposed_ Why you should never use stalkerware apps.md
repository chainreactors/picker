# Hacked, leaked, exposed: Why you should never use stalkerware apps

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

7:00 AM PDT · July 2, 2025

There is a whole shady industry for people who want to monitor and spy on their families. Multiple app makers promote and advertise their software — often referred to as [stalkerware](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#stalkerware) — to jealous partners who can use these apps to access their victims’ phones remotely.

Yet, despite how sensitive this personal data is, an increasing number of these companies are losing huge amounts of it.

According to TechCrunch’s tally, counting [the latest data exposure of Catwatchful](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/data-breach-reveals-catwatchful-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-android-phones/), there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies since 2017 that are known to have been hacked, or leaked customer and victims’ data online. That’s not a typo: At least 26 stalkerware companies have either been hacked or had a significant data exposure in recent years. And four stalkerware companies were hacked multiple times.

Catwatchful is the latest stalkerware provider reported this year to have been breached, with its banks of user data going back to 2018. The breach reveals that Catwatchful compromised the private phone data of almost 26,000 victims at the time of its data spill.

The Catwatchful data leak comes after [this year’s data breach of SpyX](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/data-breach-at-stalkerware-spyx-affects-close-to-2-million-including-thousands-of-apple-users/), and the data exposures of [Cocospy, Spyic](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/stalkerware-apps-cocospy-spyic-exposing-phone-data-of-millions-of-people/), and [Spyzie](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/spyzie-stalkerware-spying-on-thousands-of-android-and-iphone-users/) surveillance operations that left messages, photos, call logs, and other personal and sensitive data of millions of victims exposed online, according to a security researcher who found a bug that allowed them to access that data.

Prior to this year, there were at least four massive stalkerware hacks in 2024. The last stalkerware breach in 2024 affected [Spytech, a little-known spyware maker based in Minnesota](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/25/spytech-data-breach-windows-mac-android-chromebook-spyware/), which exposed activity logs from the phones, tablets, and computers monitored with its spyware. Before that, there was a breach at mSpy, one of the longest-running stalkerware apps, which exposed [millions of customer support tickets](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/11/mspy-spyware-millions-customers-data-breach/), which included the personal data of millions of its customers.

Previously, an unknown hacker [broke into the servers of the U.S.-based stalkerware maker pcTattletale](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/25/spyware-app-pctattletale-was-hacked-and-its-website-defaced/). The hacker then stole and leaked the company’s internal data. They also defaced pcTattletale’s official website with the goal of embarrassing the company. The hacker referred to a recent TechCrunch article where we reported [pcTattletale was used to monitor several front desk check-in computers](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/spyware-found-on-hotel-check-in-computers/) at a U.S. hotel chain.

As a result of this hack, leak and shame operation, pcTattletale founder Bryan Fleming [said he was shutting down](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/28/pctattletale-spyware-shutters-data-breach/) his company.

Consumer spyware apps like Catwatchful, SpyX, Cocospy, mSpy and pcTattletale are commonly referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) because jealous spouses and partners use them to surreptitiously monitor and surveil their loved ones.

These companies often explicitly market their products as solutions to catch cheating partners by encouraging illegal and unethical behavior. There have been [multiple court cases](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/30/emma-cline-countersues-after-ex-claims-she-used-spyware-to-plagiarise-his-work), [media investigations](https://techcrunch.com/tag/stalkerware/) and [surveys of domestic abuse shelters](https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/09/15/346149979/smartphones-are-used-to-stalk-control-domestic-abuse-victims) that show that online stalking and monitoring can lead to cases of real-world harm and violence.

That’s in part why hackers have repeatedly targeted some of these companies.

Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a leading researcher and activist who has investigated and fought stalkerware for years, said the stalkerware industry is a “soft target.”

“The people who run these companies are perhaps not the most scrupulous or really concerned about the quality of their product,” Galperin told TechCrunch.

Given the history of stalkerware compromises, that may be an understatement. And because of the lack of care for protecting their own customers — and consequently the personal data of tens of thousands of unwitting victims — using these apps is doubly irresponsible. The stalkerware customers may be breaking the law, abusing their partners by illegally spying on them, and, on top of that, putting everyone’s data in danger.

## A history of stalkerware hacks

The flurry of stalkerware breaches began in 2017 when a group of hackers [breached the U.S.-based Retina-X](https://www.vice.com/en/article/53vm7n/inside-s...
