# YouTube is testing ad blocker detection

Posted: May 12, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

YouTube is dipping a toe into the muddy waters of ad-blocker blocking, with ad-blocker using [Redditors complaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/13cfdbi/apparently_ad_blockers_are_not_allowed_on_youtube/) about a popup that warns “Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube,” when they visit the site.

![An adblock warning popup on YouTube](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/easset_upload_file84079_266043_e.jpg)

The popup message explains that “Ads allow YouTube to stay free for billions of users worldwide,” and invites users who want to be ad-free to take out a YouTube Premium subscription.

Despite the “Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube” claim, only a select group of individuals currently see this messaging. A YouTube spokesperson confirmed this is currently just a test, though there’s no information with regard to how many people are seeing it or which regions its being seen in:

They also note that ad detection isn’t a new thing, and publishers often ask site visitors to disable ad-blocking tools. Everyone reading this very blog has almost certainly experienced a “Please turn off your ad blocker to view this site” notification on a website at some time.

The big problem is that these messages tend to be unpopular, and can turn visitors away from a site. If the content you want to see or read is available elsewhere, why go to the hassle of altering your settings?

In recent years, many sites have adopted a more cautious popup method in an effort to not aggravate visitors. A typical example might say “Support our content, funded by adverts which are used to pay the writers”. Underneath you’ll be given the option to turn off the blocker, or visit the site without doing so this time around. Whether repeat visitors actually do turn off the blocker on the next visit is something only the site owners could know.

In terms of how this is going down with YouTube users, it’s not great. Here’s a [typical reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/13cfdbi/comment/jjpsu4k/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from the Reddit post where this test was first revealed:

Ouch.

A big issue for YouTube users is frequency of adverts, but also length. Users are tired of rapid fire short ads which require a constant supply of clicking to skip. They’re also not fans of the long format adverts, which can hit 30 minutes, an hour, or in one extreme case [4 whole hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/9ygvdz/4_hour_ad_on_a_5_minute_youtube_video/)!

If you stray into the wacky world of content for children, other types of ad are a problem too. The 20 minute+ adverts which are essentially glorified toy adverts dressed up as cartoons can be a pain to have to keep skipping on a television.

As you’d expect, people have [already figured out](https://twitter.com/Aeyga_X/status/1656419258866212864) how to bypass or skip the YouTube ad-block testing in the form of tools such as uBlock origin.
