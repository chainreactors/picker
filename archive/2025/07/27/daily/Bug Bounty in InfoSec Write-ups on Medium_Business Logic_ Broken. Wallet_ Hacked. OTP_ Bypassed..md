üìå **Special thanks to**

[**Shah kaif**](https://medium.com/u/10f677056bcd?source=post_page---user_mention--d82e6591a63a---------------------------------------)

 **‚Äî** my dedicated learning partner ‚Äî for collaborating on this research and finding.

![]()

During a recent security assessment of **redacted.ai**, a virtual assistance platform that connects clients with remote talent including engineers, mentors, and co-founders, I uncovered several critical vulnerabilities that could compromise user accounts, financial data, and platform integrity.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This post is for **educational purposes only**. I follow responsible disclosure. The name `redacted.ai` replaces the real domain for confidentiality.

## üß† What‚Äôs redacted.ai?

`redacted.ai` is an AI-based job-matching platform that:

* Lets users sign up using email, Verify their account using Digilocker services for KYC,
* Rewards actions with wallet coins,
* Provided Virtual assistance and Job matching,
* Helped with Mock interviews,

Also they were hiring for Remote Cybersecurity Specialist, and that was the main reason I had visited the site. Everything seemed to be perfect.

![]()

Simple idea. Good UX.
 ‚Äî But one weekend, I got curious and poked around.

Let‚Äôs just say‚Ä¶ **things fell apart fast.**

## Vulnerabilities at a Glance

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ OTP? Nah, Who Needs That!

![]()

redacted.ai used **4-digit OTPs** for login and forgot-password flows ‚Äî with **no rate limiting**, no CAPTCHA, and **no timeouts**.

I could easily bruteforce OTPs as they were only of 4 digits and Rate limits were not enforced.

### **Screenshot of The Attack:**

![]()

**This confirmed Pre-Account Takeover + Account Takeover of any user using forgot-otp feature.**

üìâ **Impact**:

* Any user account can be hijacked.
* OTP system is meaningless.
* Attacker doesn‚Äôt need the password, just the email address.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Flaw ‚Äî Wallet Be Like ‚ÄúMake It Rain üí∏‚Äù

![]()

After creating a new account, I explored the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù feature. A popup appeared allowing me to request an amount ‚Äî in **dollars** ‚Äî despite my wallet balance being exactly **$0**. ü´†

Press enter or click to view image in full size

![]()

I sent request of some dollars and naturally, I intercepted the request using **Burp Suite**. When I sent a payment request for some random amount, the response was:

![]()

```
{
  "error':"Insufficient wallet balance for this request."
}
```

Here, I changed the 400 Bad Request to 200 OK and removed the body of request and forwarded the request. To my surprise, The frontend accepted this and sent:

![]()

```
{
  "userId':"6872b......",
  "amount":1000000,
  "type":"debited"
}
```

Here, All I had to do is changed the ‚Äútype‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúdebited‚Äù to ‚Äúcredited‚Äù.

So, Here‚Äôs what I did,

```
{
  "userId':"6872b......",
  "amount":10000000000......,
  "type":"credited"
}
```

And this is what I got:

![]()

And the frontend:

![]()

### üí° Why This Is Critical:

* **No server-side validation** for wallet transactions.
* **Trusting frontend logic** for financial operations is a **massive red flag**.
* I was able to **manipulate the wallet balance** to any amount without any authentication or verification.

### üõ°Ô∏è Impact:

* Unauthorized wallet crediting
* Leads to potential purchase abuse, gift card fraud, or platform exploitation
* Possible **financial loss** to the platform

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Stored XSS in Resume Upload (PDF) and SVG Upload**

![]()

The platform allowed users to upload their **resumes as PDFs** and **profile pictures as SVGs** ‚Äî both of which were vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

### **PDF Upload: Stored XSS ü™ì**

I crafted a malicious PDF file containing JavaScript payloads and uploaded it via the resume upload section. When any admin or HR opened this document **in-browser**, the JavaScript executed silently in their context.

This led to **persistent XSS**, as the PDF was stored and retrievable via a direct link ‚Äî no sanitization or validation of file contents!

### **SVG Upload: Stored XSS Again!** üß†

All I had to do is update :

```
filename="example2.jpg" --> "example2.svg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg --> image/svg+xml

Remove the jpeg content and replace it by js script.
```

![]()

SVG images are actually **XML files** ‚Äî and JavaScript can be embedded directly in them. I uploaded an SVG with the following payload:

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <script>alert('Hello from SVG script');</script>
</svg>
```

**Boom!** ‚ö†Ô∏è Whenever someone visited the profile or page rendering this SVG, the script fired.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Number Verification Bypass

![]()

While updating the profile, the platform sends an OTP to verify the mobile number. However, this mechanism was flawed due to **poor frontend-side validation and lack of backend enforcement**.

I entered invalid mobile number and requested for OTP.

![]()

And also did provided false OTP. As expected the response was:

![]()

**SAME!!!** Again I tried changing bad request to ‚Üí 200 OK and changed the body content to:

```
{
  "success":true,
  "error":"Invalid...."
}
```

And this fired an another POST request at an /api/update-user-data:

![]()

![]()

And that returned with:
