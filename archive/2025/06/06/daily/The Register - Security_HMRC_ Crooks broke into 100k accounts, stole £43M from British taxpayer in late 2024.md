## It’s definitely not a cyberattack though! Really!

The UK's tax collections agency says cyberbaddies defrauded it of £47 million ($63 million) late last year, but insists the criminal case was not a cyberattack.

Representatives for His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) disclosed the theft, which occurred in late 2024, to Parliament's Treasury Select Committee for the first time on Wednesday.

HMRC's chief executive John-Paul Marks explained that 0.22 percent of the UK population who are paid via the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) automatic income tax collection system, which applies to most employed people in the UK, were being contacted about unauthorized access to their accounts.
