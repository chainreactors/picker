I’m sure we would all feel more secure if cancer rates could be reduced.

“It’s a wound that our adversaries are going to try to spread salt on because they can.”

“The more we fight amongst ourselves, the easier their life is and the more they can get away with.”

“For the first time we have also found Spamouflage accounts posing convincingly as Americans.”

Now, they are interacting with predominantly genuine American users.

APT28 actors had utilized compromised EdgeRouters to facilitate covert cyber operations against governments, militaries, and organizations around the world.

“Czech institutions have been the target of cyber attacks exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook from 2023. The mode of operation and the focus of these attacks matched the profile of the actor APT28. The actor APT28 has also been the subject to active measures in Czechia as part of the global operation Dying Ember.”

‘https://mzv.gov.cz/jnp/en/issues\_and\_press/press\_releases/statement\_of\_the\_mfa\_on\_the\_cyberattacks.html

APT28 targeted various government authorities and companies in the spheres of logistics, armaments, the air and space industry, and IT services, as well as foundations and associations. It was directed at entities in Germany, other European countries and targets in Ukraine.

APT28 leveraged default credentials and trojanized OpenSSH server processes to gain root access to compromised Ubiquiti EdgeRouters.

APT28 actors also exploited CVE-2023-23397 to collect NTLMv2 digests from targeted Outlook accounts. This includes Python scripts to upload account credentials belonging to specifically targeted webmail users, which are collected via cross-site scripting and browser-in-the-browser (BitB) spear-phishing campaigns.

APT28 used the botnet to carry out “vast spearphishing and similar credential-harvesting campaigns against targets of intelligence interest to the Russian government, such as U.S. and foreign governments and military, security, and corporate organizations.”

@Winter, @Echo of past arising, All

re: *Where is the evidence trans women [human] have biological advantages over cis women athletes?*

WADA has such data.

* WADA is responsible for the World Anti-Doping Code, adopted by more than 650 sports organisations, including international sports federations, national anti-doping organisations, the IOC, and the International Paralympic Committee.

However, in this shyte storm of a topic, it depends on the age and state of transition.

There are Blood Doping (1) levels of hormones or lack of hormones that are required depending on the competition and the rules of that sports federation. These rules vary by country and by sport but filter up into the international standards used.

There are anecdotal reports, which cause the biggest issues, of elite or near elite born males that transition to female and rising in the female ranks. (women’s swimming, women’s weightlifting).

* Caster Semenya is born female but naturally has high levels of male hormones (2)
* Renée Richards played professionally from 1977 to 1981 when she retired at age 47. She was ranked as high as 20th overall (in February 1979), and her highest ranking at the end of a year was 22nd (in 1977). Her first professional event as a female was the 1977 U.S. Open. (3)

Governments use the 3 Dopes to enhance their prestige. The outcomes of such doping schemes vary with the level of “clever use” to get the same outcome without crossing a specific testing threshold. (4).

It’s a shyte storm of a topic, so expect stuff to fly from the fan.

* Mokgadi Caster Semenya OIB (born 7 January 1991) is a South African middle-distance runner and winner of two Olympic gold medals[4] and three World Championships in the women’s 800 metres. She first won gold at the World Championships in 2009 and went on to win at the 2016 Olympics and the 2017 World Championships, where she also won a bronze medal in the 1500 metres. After the doping disqualification of Mariya Savinova, she was also awarded gold medals for the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Olympics.
* Following Semenya’s victory at the 2009 World Championships, she was made to undergo sex testing, and cleared to return to competition the following year. The decision to perform sex testing sparked controversy in the sporting world and in Semenya’s home country of South Africa. Later reports disclosed that Semenya has the intersex condition 5α-Reductase 2 deficiency and natural testosterone levels in the typical male range.

* Renée Richards (born August 19, 1934) is an American ophthalmologist and former tennis player who competed on the professional circuit in the 1970s, and became widely known following male-to-female sex reassignment surgery, when she fought to compete as a woman in the 1976 US Open.
