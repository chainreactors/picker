# How to Make Gmail HIPAA-Compliant

November 1st, 2024

For healthcare providers and organizations required to handle sensitive protected health information (PHI), ensuring HIPAA compliance in digital communications is critical. While Gmail is widely used due to its simplicity and accessibility, to the surprise of many, it doesn’t meet HIPAA requirements straight out of the box.

With this challenge in mind, this post will walk you through why Gmail isn’t inherently HIPAA-compliant, the steps required to make it make Gmail HIPAA-compliant, and how email delivery services like LuxSci’s Secure Email Gateway offer a seamless, trusted solution for Gmail HIPAA compliance.

### **Why Gmail Is** ***Not*** **HIPAA-Compliant By Default**

At its core, Gmail lacks several essential components required for HIPAA compliance, and using it without additional safeguards puts your organization at risk:

**1. Limited Encryption**: While Gmail *does* provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, which is acceptable as per the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html), this only secures emails in transit if the recipient’s email server also supports TLS.

Consequently, this basic level of encryption does not ensure the security of emails containing PHI – especially when sent to recipients outside Google’s network.

**2. No Built-In HIPAA Compliance Features**: Gmail on its own does not provide the necessary controls required by HIPAA, such as end-to-end encryption, audit trails, or automatic security policies for managing sensitive patient data.

**3. No Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for Free Accounts**: A business associate agreement (BAA) is mandatory for HIPAA compliance when a third-party provider, i.e., a business associate, handles PHI.

However, Google only offers a BAA with its paid Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) accounts, not with free Gmail accounts. Unfortunately, many healthcare organizations are unaware of this fact and fall out of HIPAA compliance if they use free Gmail accounts to send PHI.

**4. Lack of Control Over User Access and Security Policies**: another key HIPAA compliance requirement is strict access control, which ensures that only authorized personnel handle sensitive data.

Gmail’s standard settings are not designed with healthcare-specific compliance in mind, which makes it challenging to maintain the level of access control that the secure handling of patient data demands.

### **Key Considerations for Gmail and HIPAA Compliance**

If you intend to use Gmail without risking the consequences of HIPAA non-compliance, here are the main steps that you need to take:

* **Upgrade to Google Workspace**: This will grant you access to the enterprise-level tools and features necessary for Gmail HIPAA compliance that the free Gmail option lacks.
* **Sign a BAA with Google**: Once upgraded, you can sign a BAA with Google. However, while this is an essential requirement, it does not make Gmail fully HIPAA-compliant on its own.
* **Add a Secure Email Gateway for End-to-End Encryption**: You’ll need an additional layer of security on top of Google Workspace’s TLS encryption, such as a secure email gateway. This provides the end-to-end encryption required to comprehensively protect PHI in emails – when it’s at rest, as well as in transit.
* **Implement Staff Training and Security Policies**: compliance isn’t just about technology, it’s about competence too. With this in mind, make sure any employees with your company who are required to handle patient data understand HIPAA regulations and PHI best practices, such as refraining from including it in email subject lines, which are not encrypted in Gmail.
