CVE ID: CVE-2024-30926

Description:
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in DerbyNet version 9.0, affecting the `./inc/kiosks.inc` component. This vulnerability permits remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the `address_for_current_kiosk()` function. The issue stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input via the URL parameters `id` and `address`, which are directly utilized without validation. This oversight allows the execution of malicious JavaScript code through crafted URLs.

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Vendor of Product: DerbyNet - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base: DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component: ./inc/kiosks.inc

Attack Type: Remote

Impact: Code execution

Attack Vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating URL parameters to inject malicious scripts. Examples include:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/kiosk.php?id=<script>alert(1)</script>`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/kiosk.php?address=<script>alert(1)</script>`

These manipulations demonstrate how an attacker could leverage unsanitized input to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's session.
