A [survey](https://www.argonautnews.com/news/studying-colossal-squid/article_b3fc33b6-981a-11ed-b021-9be893dcf32c.html) of giant squid science.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Israeli startup Gem Security nabs $11m in seed round led by Team8

<https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-startup-gem-security-nabs-11m-in-seed-round-led-by-team8/>

“Israeli startup Gem Security has raised $11 million from a seed funding round as it rolls out its integrated technology platform to help businesses and large organizations detect and respond swiftly to cyberattacks on their cloud-based services.

The startup says it has built an automated cloud threat detection, investigation and response (TDIR) platform, which can identify activity from malicious actors, unauthorized access and attacks, data breaches and other cyber incidents in real time, and has a fast response system to threats to mitigate damage.

!!!“Most cloud security solutions focus on building a wall that is as tall as possible to make sure the bad guys stay out. That sounds good in theory. In practice, however, no wall is ever going to be tall enough,” Zilberstein said. “We offer a more realistic approach, starting from the fact that cloud environments are and will remain imperfect. If it’s perfect, it’s only for five minutes, and then it’s going to be imperfect again.”

Zilberstein said Gem’s platform provides security teams with a comprehensive tool to find and stop the intruder, automating the incident response and ensuring there is no escalation.

“Where others end, we begin,” he said.

“Gem’s unique platform offers a first-of-its-kind solution to deal with the inevitable attacks on cloud environments, and is based on an intuitive, automatic and efficient approach that allows organizations to identify cloud security events in real time…and enable isolation of the threat.”

Gem, which has 20 employees spread across its two offices in Tel Aviv and New York, expects to double the size of its staff to about 40 employees by the end of 2023.”

Have we fallen out of love with voice assistants?
<https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64371426>

“The Internet of Things (IoT) – the ever-growing network of physical objects connected to the internet – is increasingly becoming embedded in our lives.

There is a wide range of smart devices on the market from light bulbs, ovens and washing machines, to speakers, fitness trackers, toothbrushes and baby changing mats.

Voice assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri, enable users to control IoT devices by voice command.

“A number of factors have fed into this, including concerns about privacy.”
!!!According to a 2020 survey, 82% of people are worried about monitoring by phone microphones, laptop webcams and voice assistants.
Reports of Amazon Alexa sending voice recordings to the wrong person and employees listening to private conversations only add to this concern.

In its defence, Amazon says it reviews only a tiny fraction of Alexa requests to help improve the service.

Nevertheless, “voice assistants have never shaken connotations of invasion and intrusion,” says Ms Jambunathan. “There have also been several high-profile instances of voice assistants being creepy, racist and giving dangerous advice – further eroding consumer trust.”

Joke for good weekend mood and related to the blog subject:

“You have been arrested on charges of publicly calling for the overthrow of the existing government! -But… Pardon me, what kind of public appeals are these? All this was in a personal, private correspondence in WhatsApp! –

Suspect, your correspondence is read by employees of five departments of three special services – and you call this private correspondence?..”

Has anyone else noticed that cryptome.org has been down for like a week? Does this mean what I think it might mean?

@GenZ: It might just be down for you. Here’s the first paragraph from there from about 18:22 EST on 2023-02-03 in the USA:

“Cryptome welcomes documents for publication that are prohibited by governments worldwide, in particular material on freedom of expression, privacy, cryptology, dual-use technologies, national security, intelligence, and secret governance — open, secret and classified documents — but not limited to those. Documents are removed from this site only by order served directly by a US court having jurisdiction. No court order has ever been served; any order served will be published here — or elsewhere if gagged by order. Bluffs will be published if comical but otherwise ignored.”

@GenZ: It works for me.

Discussions of “AI” ethical challenges often focus on *highly speculative* matters, like whether a self-driving car will run over an old man instead of a lady pushing a baby carriage (if those are the only two options) … when self-driving tech is thousands of times too stupid to even distinguish such categories.

Here’s a *real* ethics problem (my emphasis added) from a Slate article:

> OpenAI paid outsourcing partner Sama $200,000 to teach ChatGPT how not to be violent, racist, or sexist. Sama’s workers were compensated **between $1.50 and $2 an hour** to keep ChatGPT from mimicking the worst kinds of human behavior. Kenya-based workers intervie...
