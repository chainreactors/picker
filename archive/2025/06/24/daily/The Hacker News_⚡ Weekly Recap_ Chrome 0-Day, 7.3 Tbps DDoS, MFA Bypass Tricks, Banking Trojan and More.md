Not every risk looks like an attack. Some problems start as small glitches, strange logs, or quiet delays that don't seem urgent‚Äîuntil they are. What if your environment is already being tested, just not in ways you expected?

Some of the most dangerous moves are hidden in plain sight. It's worth asking: what patterns are we missing, and what signals are we ignoring because they don't match old playbooks?

This week's reports bring those quiet signals into focus‚Äîfrom attacks that bypassed MFA using trusted tools, to supply chain compromises hiding behind everyday interfaces. Here's what stood out across the cybersecurity landscape:

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Cloudflare Blocks Massive 7.3 Tbps DDoS Attack](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/massive-73-tbps-ddos-attack-delivers.html)** ‚Äî Cloudflare said it autonomously blocked the largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack ever recorded, which hit a peak of 7.3 terabits per second (Tbps). The attack, the company said, targeted an unnamed hosting provider and delivered 37.4 terabytes in 45 seconds. It originated from over 122,145 source IP addresses spanning 5,433 Autonomous Systems (AS) across 161 countries. The top sources of attack traffic included Brazil, Vietnam, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Ukraine, Ecuador, Thailand, the United States, and Saudi Arabia.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Patched Google Chrome Flaw Exploited by TaxOff](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/google-chrome-zero-day-cve-2025-2783.html)** ‚Äî A threat actor known as TaxOff exploited CVE-2025-2783, a now-patched security flaw in Google Chrome, as a zero-day in mid-March 2025 to target Russian organizations with a backdoor codenamed Trinper. The attacks share overlaps with another threat activity cluster dubbed Team46, which is believed to have been active since early 2024 and has leveraged another zero-day vulnerability in Yandex Browser for Windows in the past to deliver unspecified payloads.
* **[North Korea Employs Deepfakes in New Fake Zoom Scam](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/bluenoroff-deepfake-zoom-scam-hits.html)** ‚Äî Threat actors with ties to North Korea targeted an unnamed employee of a cryptocurrency foundation with deceptive Zoom calls featuring deepfaked company executives to trick them into downloading malware. Cybersecurity company Huntress, which responded to the incident, said it discovered eight distinct malicious binaries on the victim host that are capable of running commands, dropping additional payloads, logging keystrokes, and stealing cryptocurrency-related files.
* **[Russian Threat Actors Use App Passwords to Bypass MFA](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/russian-apt29-exploits-gmail-app.html)** ‚Äî Russian threat actors tracked as UNC6293 have been found to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and access Gmail accounts of targeted individuals by leveraging app-specific passwords in skilfully-crafted social engineering attacks that impersonate U.S. Department of State officials. The attacks, which started in at least April and continued through the beginning of June, are notable for their efforts to build trust with victims over weeks, instead of inducing a false sense of urgency and rushing them into taking unintended actions. The end goal of the attacks is to persuade the recipients to create and share app-specific passwords that would provide access to their Gmail accounts.
* **[Godfather Trojan Creates Sandbox on Infected Android Devices](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/new-android-malware-surge-hits-devices.html)** ‚Äî A new version of the Godfather banking trojan has been found to create isolated virtual environments on Android devices to steal account data and transactions from legitimate banking apps. While the malware has been active since June 2021, the latest iteration takes its information-stealing capabilities to a whole new level through the deployment of a malicious app containing an embedded virtualization framework on infected devices, which is used to run copies of the targeted applications. Thus, when a user launches a banking app, they are redirected to the virtualized instance, from where sensitive data is stolen. The malware also displays a fake lock screen overlay to trick the victim into entering their PIN.
* **[Israel-Iran Conflict Sparks Surge in Cyber Warfare](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/irans-state-tv-hijacked-mid-broadcast.html)** ‚Äî The Israel-Iran conflict that started with Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear and military targets on June 13 has triggered a wider cyber conflict in the region, with hacktivist groups and ideologically motivated actors targeting both nations. Notable among them, the pro-Israel threat group known as [Predatory Sparrow](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/iranian-hackers-using-muddyc2go-in-new.html) breached Bank Sepah and Nobitex, claiming they have been used to circumvent international sanctions. Predatory Sparrow has been publicly linked to attack...
