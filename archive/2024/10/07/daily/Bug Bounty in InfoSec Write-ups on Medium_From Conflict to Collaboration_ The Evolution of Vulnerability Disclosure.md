In this post, we’ll break down two important terms that are often used interchangeably: **Vulnerability Disclosure Programs** (VDP) and **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure** (CVD). While both relate to how vulnerabilities are reported, they evolved in different ways and serve distinct roles in modern cybersecurity.

## The Origins of Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDP)

Vulnerability Disclosure Programs (VDPs) aren’t new. In fact, they were introduced in the 1990s as a structured way for security researchers to report vulnerabilities to organizations without fear of retaliation. Before VDPs, the landscape for vulnerability reporting was murky at best, with researchers unsure of how to share security flaws without facing legal consequences. This was especially true in the late 90s and early 2000s, when the general perception of hackers was overwhelmingly negative.

### A Safe Harbor for White-Hat Hackers: The Role of disclose.io

Before VDPs were common, many researchers feared legal repercussions for reporting vulnerabilities. It wasn’t uncommon for organizations to sue or prosecute researchers who were trying to help improve security. This created a chilling effect, discouraging researchers from reporting vulnerabilities altogether.

This is where [**disclose.io**](https://disclose.io/), an open-source, cross-industry initiative, led by **Casey Ellis**, **Amit Elazari**,

, and others, comes into play. The disclose.io framework provides legal **safe harbor** for researchers, ensuring they can report vulnerabilities without fear of prosecution. This project has helped standardize legal protections and promote ethical hacking as a positive force in cybersecurity.

**VDPs** and frameworks like disclose.io have helped redefine vulnerability reporting by creating a more structured and collaborative environment for researchers and organizations to work together without fear of retaliation.

## CVD vs. VDP: Clearing Up the Terminology

While a **VDP** provides a formal framework for vulnerability reporting, **CVD** refers specifically to how vulnerabilities are disclosed and coordinated between researchers and vendors. **VDP** is the broader term, encompassing everything from how vulnerabilities are reported to how they are triaged, patched, and communicated. **CVD** focuses primarily on the disclosure aspect, ensuring both parties (researchers and vendors) collaborate effectively.

**Why does this distinction matter?** Because the way vulnerabilities are disclosed can vary dramatically, and not all disclosure practices are created equal. Let’s explore the three main types of vulnerability disclosures:

### 1. Private Disclosure

In the **private disclosure** model, the vulnerability is reported directly to the organization, and the organization decides whether to make the details public. This model is common in **bug bounty programs**, where researchers are compensated for reporting vulnerabilities but may never see the issue publicly disclosed. While this approach can work well, its main flaw is that it leaves the decision in the hands of the vendor — if they choose not to fix or publicize the issue, the vulnerability could remain hidden.

This model became a source of frustration for many researchers, as vendors sometimes ignored or downplayed the vulnerabilities. As a result, some researchers began pushing for a more transparent approach.

### 2. Full Disclosure

In response to uncooperative vendors, some researchers adopted the **full disclosure** approach, where the details of a vulnerability are made public immediately — sometimes including proof-of-concept exploit code — without giving the vendor time to fix the issue. While this can force organizations to act quickly, it also risks leaving users exposed, as attackers may exploit the vulnerability before a patch is available.

### 3. Responsible Disclosure (Now CVD)

In 2001, Scott Culp from Microsoft introduced the concept of **Responsible Disclosure** in his post “[*It’s Time to End Information Anarchy*](https://web.archive.org/web/20011109045330if_/http%3A//www.microsoft.com%3A80/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=%2Ftechnet%2Fcolumns%2Fsecurity%2Fnoarch.asp)” stating that:

> “It’s high time the security community stopped providing blueprints for building these weapons [computer worms]. And it’s high time computer users insisted that the security community live up to its obligation to protect them. We can and should discuss security vulnerabilities, but we should be smart, prudent, and responsible in the way we do it.”

Responsible Disclosure aimed to balance the protection of users with the need to give vendors enough time to fix vulnerabilities.
Researchers would report vulnerabilities privately but agree to delay public disclosure until a fix was in place. Often, a timeline was set (e.g., 90 days), after which, if the vendor didn’t respond or act, the researcher could disclose the vulnera...
