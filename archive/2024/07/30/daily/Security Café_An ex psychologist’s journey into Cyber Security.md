### **How it all started**

What if I told you that the machines with 99 percentage fail chance wouldn’t do it… but a human with 1 percent chance of achieving it? The idea obsessed me and after some time I realised that was about my chance. You don’t usually see the struggle, only the results, but let me tell you how it all went.

It was my last last year in college, psychology, top grades, learning scholarship, head of the class, had it all, but felt like I had nothing. Something must’ve been wrong, right? You’re right. Something was terribly wrong. College, you must have a degree to do what you want, to be who you want. Well, no. Not if it’s the wrong thing you’re after, at least. Thoughts, night after night, the obsessive idea kept on going, what could’ve stopped it? Nothing was good enough, nothing!

But, then, one day, after hearing a college professor talking about her interviewing a hacker in the penitentiary who turned himself up because of paranoia, made me remember that once I wanted to be a hacker myself, but reading about script kiddies made me back off. Foolish, I know. Everyone is a script kiddie in the beginning, but it was not a matter of backing off anymore. Hell, even now I have thoughts of being a script kiddie and it makes me laugh. Anyway, the night I got home I opened the laptop and downloaded a python course for offensive hacking. I do not know what happened, for the first time in years hours passed like minutes. I was all there, no thoughts, nothing. Just absorbing. Well, if that’s not the thing I should go for I do not know what else would make me feel that good. Starting with that day I decided to switch. Leaving all behind. The shock on my parents face should’ve been priceless upon hearing that I want to drop out to be a hacker, but we were talking over the phone.

A few days passed, reading all over the internet on how to get into the industry, how to succeed. Networking, networking and more networking, like being a hacker meant to be a networking guru. No. You had to know the basics, yea, but more than that you’ll learn on the way. Anyway, I started reading about networking until I came upon Network+ Certification, which had it all and is not vendor specific which meant you’ll do good in all environments, right? That’s what we are after, to have a good methodology, to go on any attack surface. Well, I went over the course 2 times, trying to understand all it had to teach, even signed up for the exam but never took it, it was still too theoretical for me.

### **Planning, deciding, taking action**

After that and some more days of reading I discovered CEH ( Certified Ethical Hacker ) and right after OSCP ( OffSec Certified Professional ). I still had this problem, I knew too much theory wouldn’t do it for me and after more reading I decided to go after OSCP as it met all the qualities, good basics, gives you the hacker’s mindset, makes you understand how to move on any surface and more important than all, IT IS PRACTICAL! Too much theory doesn’t do it, at least not for me. Well, after a quick negotiation with my father I ended up in debt to him and was ready to tackle OSCP. READY? Omg, That was so wrong. Had the motivation, ambition and the nerves necessary, but ready? Not even close. Good thing I was living alone but you will understand why a little bit later.

The computer ready, VMware Workstation installed, Kali. Processed the payment, received the course and it began. F\*\*K ( as in FUCK ). How many pages were there? 800 and something? Faint. Never mind, go on. Started reading the introductory part, the “welcoming”. Excitement, anxiety, mixed feelings just like a relationship. From there on I had the luck I could do it for 15 hours a day, every day. Every single day with the luxury of not being disturbed. It didn’t matter if it was Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Every single day, from the moment I had my eyes open I was learning. As the days, nights, weeks passed by I was just doing it, nothing else, no time to complain, nothing.

As the first month went by, I did half of the course and exercises when I felt I was moving too slow and didn’t have enough time to go over the lab so from there I decided to start learning more practical, read and understand what’s in the course, leave the 10 points you got then for reporting the exercises and accelerate the learning. The course provided everything you needed, so after going through the manual, watching videos only on the topics that I didn’t understand well it was time to tackle the labs. Beginning with the easier ones, I was looking for hints and clues all day long on how to do them and still get a proper methodology.

Wait, wasn’t the course enough? It would’ve been to a technical person with a background of ethical hacking. But still, doing non-stop, trying to understand the “whys” and “wheres” and going further. IT WAS SO MUCH INFORMATION. NOT A SINGLE THING REPEATING, everything was new, every technology that I came upon was new, it was intense. As the time was passing, I bought a time extension and prolonged the lab time with one more month. But as I was doing the labs, learning, studying every day, the 4 months were coming to an end and I completed somewhere near to 51 lab machines, so I decided to schedule the exam. WHAT? I knew I wasn’t ready, but had to know where I’m placed and what I need to improve. So I scheduled it. The day of exam came, nerves, tension, I still had hope that maybe I will be lucky.

This is no place for luck. Failed. Miserably.

For me, it wasn’t enough. The very next day I had to step up my game. Took TJ NULL’s list for OSCP-like machines and here the real fun began. My target, complete as many machines as possible to get the methodology right. HackTheBox, Vulnhub, Proving Grounds all day long. I was still not able to complete a machine without reading hints about it. Still nothing was repeating. Still pushed further.

### **The path becomes clearer**

After 6 months of daily struggle since starting the OSCP journey something happened, so...
