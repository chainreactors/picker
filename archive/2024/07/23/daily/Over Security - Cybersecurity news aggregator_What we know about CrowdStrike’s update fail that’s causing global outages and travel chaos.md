# What we know about CrowdStrike’s update fail that’s causing global outages and travel chaos

A faulty software update issued by security giant [CrowdStrike has resulted in a massive overnight outage that’s affected Windows computers around the world](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/banks-airlines-brokerage-houses-report-widespread-outages-across-the-globe/), disrupting businesses, airports, train stations, banks, broadcasters and the healthcare sector.

CrowdStrike said the outage was not caused by a cyberattack, but was the result of a “defect” in a software update for its flagship security product, Falcon Sensor. The defect caused any Windows computers that Falcon is installed on to crash without fully loading.

“The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,” said [CrowdStrike in a statement on Friday](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-windows-sensor-update/). Some businesses and organizations are beginning to recover, but many expect the outages to drag on into the weekend or next week given the complexity of the fix. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz [told NBC News](https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726) that it may take “some time for some systems that just automatically won’t recover.” In [a later tweet](https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814316045185822981), Kurtz apologized for the disruption.

Here’s everything you need to know about the outages.

## What happened?

Late Thursday into Friday, reports began to emerge of IT problems wherein Windows computers were getting stuck with the infamous “blue screen of death” — a bright blue error screen with a message that displays when Windows encounters a critical failure, crashes or cannot load.

The outages were first noticed in Australia early on Friday, and reports quickly came in from the rest of Asia and Europe as the regions began their day, as well as the United States.

Within a short time, CrowdStrike confirmed that a software update for Falcon had malfunctioned and was causing Windows computers that had the software installed to crash. Falcon lets CrowdStrike remotely analyze and check for malicious threats and malware on installed computers.

At around the same time, Microsoft reported a significant outage at one of its most used Azure cloud regions covering much of the central United States. A spokesperson for Microsoft told TechCrunch that [its outage was unrelated to CrowdStrike’s incident](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/banks-airlines-brokerage-houses-report-widespread-outages-across-the-globe/).

Around Friday noon (Eastern time), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella [posted on X](https://x.com/satyanadella/status/1814329337451344250) saying the company is aware of the CrowdStrike botched update and is “working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.”

## What is CrowdStrike and what does Falcon Sensor do?

CrowdStrike, founded in 2011, has quickly grown into a cybersecurity giant. Today the company provides software and services to 29,000 corporate customers, including around half of Fortune 500 companies, 43 out of 50 U.S. states and eight out of the top 10 tech firms, [according to its website](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/).

The company’s cybersecurity software, Falcon, is used by enterprises to manage security on millions of computers around the world. These businesses include large corporations, hospitals, transportation hubs and government departments. Most consumer devices do not run Falcon and are unaffected by this outage.

One of the company’s biggest recent claims to fame was [when it caught a group of Russian government hackers](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/dnc-discovers-russian-hackers-yearlong-access-to-data/) breaking into the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. CrowdStrike is also known for using memorable animal-themed names for the hacking groups it tracks based on their nationality, such as: [Fancy Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007), believed to be part of Russia’s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU; [Cozy Bear](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016), believed to be part of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR; [Gothic Panda](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022), believed to be a Chinese government group; and [Charming Kitten](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059), believed to be an Iranian state-backed group. The company even makes action figures to represent these groups, [which it sells as swag](https://www.google.com/search?q=crowdstrike+action+figures&rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS1041US1041&oq=crowdstrike+action&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBggBEEUYOTIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB7SAQgyNjk4ajBqNKgCALACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

CrowdStrike is so big it’s one of the [sponsors of the Mercedes F1 team](https://www.mercedesamgf1.com/partners/crowd-strike), and this year even [aired a Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEkziTXz9Js) — a first for a cybersecurity company.

## Who are the outages affecting?

Practically anyone who during their everyday life interacts with a computer system running software from CrowdStrike is affected, even if the comp...
