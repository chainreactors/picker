In the world of tech merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions, timing is everything. It’s important for prospective buyers and investors to understand as much of the target’s software assets’ security, quality, and legal posture as possible in a brief amount of time. This drives the need to conduct multiple assessments on a target’s code simultaneously. [Penetration testing](https://www.blackduck.com/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing.html) and static application security testing are two types of analyses that deliver time to value extremely well, and when performed together, offer a coordinated, comprehensive view with a better quality of results than either provide individually. In this case, 1+1=3.

## Areas of coverage

Penetration testing (PT) analyzes application security from the outside in. It involves [an authorized tester using automated and manual techniques to attack an application as a hacker would](https://www.blackduck.com/blog/top-10-free-hacking-tools-for-penetration-testers.html). A skilled tester will use knowledge of the application and software in general to attempt to bypass security controls, and abuse business logic and user authorization to demonstrate how bad actors could gain access and cause damage.

Static application security testing ([SAST](/static-analysis-tools-sast.html)) is examination of the software asset from the inside out. This is done by combining comprehensive analysis via an automated tool with expert review of the results and source code to find critical software security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflows, and the rest of the OWASP top 10.

## The value of Static Analysis + Pentesting in a due diligence sprint

Both PT and SAST techniques can be used in the development of a company’s own code or during M&A d...
