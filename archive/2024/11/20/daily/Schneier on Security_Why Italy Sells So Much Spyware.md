## Why Italy Sells So Much Spyware

Interesting [analysis](https://therecord.media/how-italy-became-an-unexpected-spyware-hub):

> Although much attention is given to sophisticated, zero-click spyware developed by companies like Israel’s NSO Group, the Italian spyware marketplace has been able to operate relatively under the radar by specializing in cheaper tools. According to an Italian Ministry of Justice [document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260169-mod-bp-22-071-232_5622_1-4), as of December 2022 law enforcement in the country could rent spyware for €150 a day, regardless of which vendor they used, and without the large acquisition costs which would normally be prohibitive.
>
> As a result, thousands of spyware operations have been carried out by Italian authorities in recent years, according to a [report](https://irpimedia.irpi.eu/en-italian-spyware-on-the-international-market/) from Riccardo Coluccini, a respected Italian journalist who specializes in covering spyware and hacking.

Italian spyware is cheaper and easier to use, which makes it more widely used. And Italian companies have been in this market for a long time.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Something to consider with regards Italy.

I was surprised to be informed yesterday that Italy in a number of respects has a bigger capability in terms of economic MIC than Russia…

Yup it surprised me as well as Italy are not the biggest EU nation by MIC economics… Germany and France both spend big, and France appears to get the best values for it’s Euros of all European Nations. Which might have something to do with it’s continued aim to have full MIC Sovereignty as does apparently Italy.

So yes the Italian MIC has “productive investment” in two ways,

1, Direct Government spend.

That is the Italian like the Israeli governments get their Spyware research and production very heavily subsidised by not just “other nations” but many NGO’s in the world.

Some “known history” suggests these Spyware companies thus the Governments use Bulgaria as a front to do the evasion of sanctions and other arms length sales thus avoiding embarrassment etc.

This is not exactly on topic, but related and points to the motivation behind the rise in spy and malware. And picks up a theme our host has trying to bring to the world’s attention for a long time.

The title says it all:
**Data is the new uranium – incredibly powerful and amazingly dangerous**
*CISOs are quietly wishing they had less data, because the cost of management sometimes exceeds its value*

> The mantra at the start of this debate – “data is the new oil” – looks to be replaced by another, more accurate assessment: “data is the new yellowcake.” For the unfamiliar, yellowcake is a radioactive, toxic, uranium oxide that can be further refined into a range of both very helpful and apocalyptically terrifying products.

Law enforcement often breaches the conditions of warrants. Outside of metropolitan areas police stations are not even required to log the details of surveillance requests and activities. Without any paper trail there is nothing of substance to audit.

When Russia was in the process of stealing the schematics for hyper-sonic systems, the follow up was laughable. The two investigators spent only one day investigating and were unqualified. But that they even bothered to drive to a regional area was remarkable. No one figured out how Russian intelligence obtained the details of the projects employees, as that was supposed to be highly restricted SCI, unknown to even their own family members.

A proposed bill would have given consumers the right to take legal action.

But corporate lobbyists gutted it…
