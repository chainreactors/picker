   Without looking up any chips, I see six RJ-style plugs, each with a number of power electronics by them, but I don’t see magnetics that I’d expect if they were intended for telephones and networks. I imagine a user is supposed to plug in relatively simple devices into them. I am thinking motorized valves.
   I don’t see high voltage stuff, so not a TENS machine…
   There’s three capacitive buttons, three LEDs. Not a lot of direct user interfaces, but there does seem to be some EIA-232 supporting devices there. There’s a barrel jack for power, but also big pads that seem like they’d mate with a battery. It seems to be mostly hand-held-sized, but the plugs are not going to be comfortable to use.
   It really doesn’t seem to have much water protection, so my first guess of irrigation controller seems unlikely.
   It sure seems like there’s a lot of audio equipment on that board, which might make it some kind of ringdown system. But there’s usually more magnetics on the ports that I just don’t see.
   Maybe I’ll have a better guess once I identify some of those chips.

   I notice that those RJ ports are abbreviated “CH”, perhaps for channel. And I see a multichannel ADC, and an RS-232 Drivers. Which makes me think that the 6 RJ ports are sensors of some kind, and it’s got a USB interface.

   Something like temperature or moisture or similar

   That looks like it could be a TI CBL2, for connecting Vernier sensors to a graphing calculator.

     Totally spot on.

     This is a Vernier Lab Pro as CBL2 only have 3 analog connector and 1 digital connector.

       That’s exact.

       I’ve found an image of it, where you can see the circuit.

       You could even see the 3 pushbuttons on the left, that you can see in the pcb.

     Totally spot on. But this is not CBL2 as CBL2 only have 3 digital connector on the side.

     This is the Vernier LabPro. here is the user manual.

     Fun fact.

     The connector is actually not RJ-11 but BT Plug connector, (631A and 630A), The difference is the right latch or the left latch version which LabPro use it for analog and digital connector.

   Is that the sound card from the 2006 season of Mongyver?

   Very spot on. Love that you were able to get the piece from FETguy.
