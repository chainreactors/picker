# Top 5 Healthcare Email Data Breaches of 2024

December 30th, 2024

In 2024, email and communication vulnerabilities continued to plague the healthcare industry. Phishing, ransomware, and email misconfigurations were at the center of several high-profile healthcare data breaches. This article highlights five of the most significant U.S. healthcare data breaches tied to communication failures, the fallout from these incidents, and actionable steps to bolster email security and maintain HIPAA compliance.

**1. Change Healthcare Ransomware Attack:** In February 2024, Change Healthcare fell victim to a ransomware attack that disrupted healthcare and billing systems nationwide. Cybercriminals exploited an email phishing scheme, gaining access to critical systems and compromising the personal health information (PHI) of over 12 million patients. This breach caused significant service disruptions and highlighted the urgent need for robust email monitoring systems.

**2. Ascension Health Ransomware Incident:** In May 2024, Ascension Health experienced a ransomware attack following an employee’s accidental download of a malicious email attachment. The breach affected nearly 2 million patient records, making electronic health data inaccessible for weeks. This incident underlines the importance of phishing-resistant email security practices and employee awareness training.

**3. Kaiser Permanente Phishing Attack:** Kaiser Permanente encountered a devastating phishing attack in June 2024. Cybercriminals targeted employees with deceptive emails, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data for over 8 million patients. The attackers demanded a ransom after encrypting critical files, causing widespread operational delays. This event emphasized the need for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and ongoing phishing training.

**4. SAG-AFTRA Health Plan Phishing Attack**

In September 2024, the SAG-AFTRA Health Plan suffered a data breach following an email phishing attack. Unauthorized access to an employee’s email account led to the exposure of sensitive information, including names, Social Security numbers, and health insurance details. The breach affected numerous members, highlighting the need for robust email security measures.

**5. Community Health Systems Business Email Compromise:** In October 2024, a business email compromise (BEC) attack targeted Community Health Systems. Cybercriminals masqueraded as trusted vendors, convincing finance and IT staff to transfer funds and data. This breach impacted 4 million patients, exposing PHI and highlighting the importance of email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF, and DKIM.

### **Prevention Strategies for Healthcare Data Breaches**

These breaches highlight the vulnerabilities in email systems and the devastating effects on healthcare organizations. To minimize risks, healthcare entities must prioritize email security and HIPAA compliance with these strategies:

1. **Deploy End-to-End Email Encryption**
   All emails containing PHI should be encrypted at rest and in transit. LuxSci’s SecureLine technology helps ensure compliance and prevent unintentional data exposure.
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   Adding MFA for email access reduces the risk of credential-based attacks like phishing and credential harvesting.
3. **Regular Employee Training**
   Simulated phishing campaigns and ongoing security education empower employees to detect and avoid malicious emails.
4. **Conduct Security Audits**
   Regularly audit email configurations, ensuring that encryption and authentication protocols such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are properly set up.
5. **Use Spam Filtering and Threat Monitoring**
   Sophisticated spam filters and monitoring tools can identify phishing attempts before they reach employees’ inboxes.

### **Conclusion**

The healthcare industry must recognize email as a critical vector for attacks and act decisively to protect sensitive data. By adopting strong security measures and fostering a culture of compliance, healthcare organizations can prevent breaches, safeguard PHI, and effectively communicate with patients and customers.
