# Twitter Suspends Copyright Holder as Musk Outlaws ‘Weaponization’ of DMCA (Updated)

In the midst of a fierce copyright dispute last evening, Twitter CEO Elon Musk intervened. He declared that accounts engaging in "repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter" will receive temporary suspensions. The problems began when a popular user tweeted a stunning video owned by a professional photographer, who responded by sending a DMCA takedown notice. That sounds straightforward, but this dispute is a lot more complex than that.

[![pirate twitter](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-twitter-1.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-twitter-1.png)In May 2022, Elon Musk [declared](https://torrentfreak.com/elon-musk-overzealous-dmca-is-a-plague-on-humanity-220513/) overzealous use of the DMCA a “plague on humanity.”

As CEO of Twitter, Musk understands that his platform has certain obligations if it wishes to maintain protection from liability under copyright law. On receipt of a properly formatted and submitted takedown notice, allegedly infringing content must be taken down.

A dispute that boiled over yesterday began with these two steps but ended up with the copyright holder having his account suspended, presumably by Musk himself or on his instructions.

*The two people at the heart of the original dispute are both Twitter users. Since most tweets relating to the initial dispute have since been deleted or disabled, here we rely on archived and cached copies for evidence. Since one user’s account has been suspended, links to the account and its tweets are included but are likely to fail.*

## Adrien Mauduit (@NightLights\_AM)

Adrien Mauduit ([@NightLights\_AM](https://twitter.com/NightLights_AM), Norway) operates the currently-suspended Night Lights account. He describes himself as a professional nature cinematographer, astrophotographer, and an “Aurora chasing specialist.”

A review of Mauduit’s recent posts suggests that his Twitter account is mainly used to post content he creates himself, usually videos or photographs.

Mauduit’s [pinned tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/NightLights_AM/status/1631351094713409542) is/was a stunning short video dated March 4, 2023. It’s described as a “double solar storm punch that created a G3 (max) geomagnetic storm.” This video sits at the heart of the dispute.

Posted on March 3, the video was well received. [Comments](https://twitter.com/NightLights_AM/status/1631542865905025024) under the original tweet include: “INCREDIBLE! Feast for the eyes and spirit,” “This one is off the charts!” and “Wow Adrien! Absolutely killing it! Thanks for sharing!”

## Massimo (@Rainmaker1973)

Massimo (Italy) operates the [@Rainmaker1973](https://twitter.com/rainmaker1973) account. He describes himself as an engineer who uses his account to “build the big picture of #science via selected & curated pics, videos & links.”

A review of Massimo’s recent posts suggests that his Twitter account is mainly used to post content created by third parties. The usual format is the inclusion of a photograph or image, a description of the image, a hyperlink to the original source, and sometimes a link to a secondary source with additional information on the current topic.

## Dispute Between Mauduit and Massimo

On March 6, Massimo posted the now-deleted tweet seen below. The format detailed above is maintained; a description of the third-party content (this time owned by Mauduit), the content itself (the clip) and two links – one linking to Mauduit’s original tweet ([here](https://twitter.com/NightLights_AM/status/1631542865905025024)) and another linking to a secondary information source ([here](http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211.fall2000.web.projects/Christina%20Shaw/AuroraColors.html)).

[![massimo-tweets-night-lights](https://torrentfreak.com/images/massimo-tweets-night-lights.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/massimo-tweets-night-lights.png)

Massimo also cited the source of the clip: “This beautiful display was filmed by @NightLights\_AM on Feb 26th in Swedish Lapland.”

According to a now-deleted tweet published by Massimo, this is what happened next.

## Mauduit Filed DMCA Notice to Have Massimo’s tweet Removed

“Yesterday I posted this tweet, tagging the author @NightLights\_AM and embedding his clip, without uploading anything,” Massimo’s tweet begins.

“He sent a DMCA report which blocked my account: this means I’m on the brink of the permanent suspension. I contacted him and he asked for money.”

Massimo claims that Mauduit had yet “to set the price” but said he would let Massimo know when he’d decided. Copies of these communications have not been made public, so their nature remains unknown. Whether this was a simple request for cash or a business discussion about the cost of licensing the video is unknown.

“I run this account since 2014 without earning any money from it for pure educational purposes. On the other hand he has a business. He was also a follower of mine, until yesterday. But he said ‘I’m the one who breaks Twitter’s rule’,” he continues.

## Massimo Alleges Blackmail

According to Massimo, such requests for payment are not uncommon on Twitter. To keep his account open he has paid off multiple ‘blackmailers’ over the years, he says.

“I’ve been blackmailed like this so many times, and I honestly thought this was over,” he reveals.

“I was hit by DMCA tens of times since 2014 and I was suspended once for 3 weeks. I paid more than $1,500 to keep this account open, I’ve paid all those have blackmailed me. I’ve been blocked in error several times and I’m struggling going on like this.”

Massimo then reveals that he received a cash demand from another alleged rightsholder in late 2022.

“I may pay for keeping this account open, but I had another DMCA on Dec 30: it was a virtually resolved case as the author said he would send a retraction, but the case was never formally resolved after more than 2 months,” he [says](https://web.archive.org/web/20230306185216/https%3A//twitter.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1632722544435273730).

“This is not stability, this is not peace of mind for me. This account helped me a lot, I’m still in hospital for a severe post-transplant complication and this is really hurting me.”

After writing in hope that “a solution can be found”, an unexpected third-party suddenly chimed in.

## Elon Musk – Weaponization of DMCA Won’t Be Tolerated

In a tweet posted last evening, Musk warned that anyone found to be repeat abusers of the DMCA takedown system faces being sanctioned by Twitter.

“Accounts engaging in repeated, egregious weaponization of DMCA on Twitter or encouraging weaponization of DMCA will receive temporary suspensions. That said, reasonable media ta...
