![Forrester Wave Leader 2024, Enterprise Firewall Solutions badge](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024Q4_Enterprise-Firewall-Solutions_181412_L.png)As businesses adopt AI and face increasingly advanced threats, organizations must rethink their security infrastructure to address the complexities caused by fragmented tool sets and consoles. Palo Alto Networks has long recognized these challenges, which is why we’ve built a [network security platform](/network-security) that not only protects but also fosters business growth and innovation in today’s complex environment.

"Palo Alto Networks pioneered the Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and continues to adapt in the evolving network security space."

*— [The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewall Solutions, Q4 2024](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/forrester-wave-firewall-2024.html)*

Today we’re excited to share that Palo Alto Networks has been named a Leader in the Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewall Solutions, Q4 2024 report. In Forrester’s evaluation of enterprise firewall vendors, Palo Alto Networks received the top score in the Current Offering category, and second highest in the Strategy category. We believe this recognition affirms our commitment to providing cutting-edge, secure and manageable network security solutions that effectively counter modern cyberthreats. [Get the 2024 Forrester Wave report.](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/forrester-wave-firewall-2024.html)

Our holistic approach – from Precision AI™to next-generation firewalls and centralized management – positions us uniquely in the enterprise security market. Here are key areas where we believe Palo Alto Networks solutions excel:

### Precision AI — Elevating Cybersecurity to the Next Level

> Precision AI, Palo Alto Networks’ proprietary AI system, automates tasks with data from ML, deep learning and AI
> models to enhance platform experience.

*– [The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewall Solutions, Q4 2024](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/forrester-wave-firewall-2024.html)*

One of the ways Palo Alto Networks excels is through our proprietary AI system, Precision AI.

Precision AI uses machine learning (ML), deep learning and AI models, using rich data and security-specific models to automate detection, prevention, and remediation with accuracy. The result? Our customers are able to detect and mitigate threats faster and more effectively. Our products don't just react. Because they are powered by Precision AI, they learn, evolve and adapt to threats in real-time, ensuring that your network is always one step ahead of bad actors.

Our customers appreciate this advantage. As the Director of Network Security Engineering at a financial services company stated:

> Palo Alto Networks is a cornerstone of our security program. If we didn’t have it, we would have trouble managing different consoles and having feature limitations…

### Next-Generation Firewalls — The Heart of Your Security Stack

We pioneered the ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) and have continued to innovate, ensuring our solutions evolve alongside emerging threats. Palo Alto Networks NGFWs integrate AI and machine learning to provide a level of security that traditional firewalls simply can’t match. It’s no wonder our NGFW customers experienced $14.11 million in benefits realized over three years, as reported by Forrester Consulting.

Our NGFWs aren’t just about better security; they also boost efficiency. Our customers have seen a 50% reduction in the likelihood of a data breach and 60% time savings when handling security incidents. Imagine reallocating 50% of your security professionals to higher-value initiatives thanks to the productivity gains provided by a more efficient firewall.

### Decryption and Quantum Security Readiness — Future-Proofing Your Network

The future of cryptographic algorithms is here, and Palo Alto Networks is ready for it. PAN-OS, the software powering our industry-leading NGFWs, is the backbone of our network security platform. [Our latest updates to PAN-OS](/blog/network-security/quasarlaunch/) include advanced decryption capabilities that intercept post-quantum cryptography (PQC) traffic and downgrade risky QUIC sessions. These features allow our customers to not only protect their data today but also prepare for the quantum security challenges of tomorrow.

### Centralized Management Across the Entire Network

> Palo Alto Networks differentiates with Strata Cloud Manager for centralized management.

*— [The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewall Solutions, Q4 2024](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/forrester-wave-firewall-2024.html)*

Managing a diverse and fragmented security stack can complicate a security team’s ability to detect and respond to threats, as well as create operational inefficiencies. Palo Alto Networks [Strata Cloud Manager](/network-security/strata-cloud-manager) offers feature-rich centralized management for all our hardware and software firewalls, as well as Prisma SASE, across hybrid enterprises. This level of integration provides unparalleled visibility and control over your network, allowing you to streamline operations and enhance security.

### Delivering More Value Through Bundled Solutions

> [Palo Alto Networks’] “platformization” initiative aims to deliver greater value to customers by bundling and integrating its products, services and features.

*— [The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Firewall Solutions, Q4 2024](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/forrester-wave-firewall-2024.html)*

The Forrester report cites our "premium security features," which we believe is a testament to the unparalleled value of our platformization strategy. Our comprehensive security platform delivers more than just protection – it offers operational efficiency, productivity gains and peace of mind. Our customers experience a true return on investment that extends beyond cost savings, with reduced risk and enhanced network performance.

Customers leveraging PAN-OS gain substantial operational benefits, including $2.5 million in security and IT operations efficiency and $5.2 million in end-user productivity improvements. By bundling our advanced software with products and services, we aim to deliver greater value to our customers, enabling them to focus more on driving innovation and less on managing cybersecurity complexity.

## Stay Ahead of Threats with Palo Alto Networks

As AI adoption accelerates and cyberthreats grow more sophisticated, businesses need a comprehensive and adaptive network security platform. We believe the recognition of Palo Alto Networks as a Leader in the 2024 Forrester Wave report is a testament to our continued innovation and our commitment to ensuring each day is more secure than the last.
