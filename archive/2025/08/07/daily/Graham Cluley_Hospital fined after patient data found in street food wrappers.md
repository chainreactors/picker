I‚Äôm a big fan of recycling. But what about recycling our private data? Like medical records?

Well, according to [local media reports](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/3080090/hospital-fined-after-patient-files-used-as-snack-bags "Link to the Bangkok Post"), a hospital in Thailand has been fined after patient‚Äôs printed records were recycled as snack bags to hold crispy crepes!

An investigation by Thailand‚Äôs Personal Data Protection Committee (PDPC) found that over 1,000 protected records were leaked by the unnamed hospital after being sent for supposed destruction.

The ‚Äúsecure disposal‚Äù business contracted by the hospital offered as an explanation that the documents had been stored at their home, and somehow leaked. Which doesn‚Äôt really feel like a satisfactory explanation at all to me.

Authorities in Thailand fined the hospital 1.21 million baht (approx US $37,000). The disposal business owner was fined 16,940 baht (approx US $520).
