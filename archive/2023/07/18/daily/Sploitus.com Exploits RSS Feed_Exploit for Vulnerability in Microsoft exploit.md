```
Add the following application names to this registry key as values of type REG_DWORD with data 1.:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION

    Excel.exe
    Graph.exe
    MSAccess.exe
    MSPub.exe
    Powerpnt.exe
    Visio.exe
    WinProj.exe
    WinWord.exe
    Wordpad.exe
```

### How to use

Simply execute the `cve-2023-36884-checker.ps1` code and you will see the results as shown below.

To run the script once downloaded:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\cve-2023-36884-checker.ps1
```

/!\ This script does NOT require admin rights /!\

Note : you can also use this excellent script which has more options if needed https://github.com/myusefulrepo/Tips/blob/master/CVE-2023-36884-Check%26Mitigation.ps1 (thanks to Olivier @Rapidhands)

### Apply or remove mitigations for CVE-2023-36884

```
# To apply mitigations
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\mitigate-cve-2023-36884.ps1
# To remove mitigations
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\remove-mitigations-cve-2023-36884.ps1
