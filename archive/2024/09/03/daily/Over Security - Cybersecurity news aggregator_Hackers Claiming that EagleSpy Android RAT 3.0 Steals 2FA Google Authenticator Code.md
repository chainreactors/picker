## **Key Features of EagleSpy Android RAT 3.0**

* **Bypassing Banking Applications:** The [malware](https://gbhackers.com/strelastealer-malware-attacks-eu-us/) can circumvent security measures of banking apps, potentially allowing hackers to access users’ financial information.
* **Skipping the Black Screen:** It can operate without triggering the black screen that signals another service is using an app, making its activities less detectable.
* **Bypassing Google Play Protection:** EagleSpy can evade Google Play’s security checks, enabling the installation of malicious apps without detection.
* **Stealing Cookies and Login Credentials:** The RAT can access and exfiltrate cookies and login details from all registered websites on the infected device, compromising users’ online accounts.
* **FUD (Fully Undetectable) Stub:** It includes a feature to keep the APK (Android Package Kit) hidden from antivirus software, making it harder to detect and remove.
* **Stealing 2FA Google Authenticator Codes:** Perhaps most alarmingly, it claims to be able to steal codes from Google’s [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://gbhackers.com/twitter-limits-two-factor-authentication/) app, which is widely used as an additional security measure.

EagleSpy Android RAT 3.0’s capabilities pose a significant threat to users, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive personal and financial information.

The ability to bypass 2FA, a cornerstone of modern online security practices, is particularly concerning. This could lead to unauthorized account access, financial theft, and [identity fraud.](https://gbhackers.com/what-different-kinds-of-identity-theft-are-there/)

The emergence of EagleSpy Android RAT 3.0 underscores the evolving threat landscape facing Android users.

By staying informed about these threats and taking proactive security measures, users can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to such [malicious software.](https://gbhackers.com/malicious-software-protection-with-the-microsoft-365-security-service/)
