Two individuals are in cuffs and facing serious charges in connection to a major theft of cryptocurrency worth more than $230 million from a single victim.

Malone Lam, 20, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, of Miami and Los Angeles respectively, are alleged to have carried out a scam between August and September and used the stolen funds, which were laundered sloppily, to buy luxury cars, watches, jewelry, international travel, VIP nightclub services, rental homes, and designer handbags.

The [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1369661/dl?inline) [PDF], unsealed on Thursday, doesn't go into any great detail about the criminal incident at the heart of the case, other than claiming the pair allegedly contacted the victim directly and stole more than 4,100 [Bitcoins](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/17/craig_wright_isnt_bitcoins_satoshi_nakamoto/) from them.
