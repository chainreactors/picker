I’m curious, what are the chances of Meta actually having to pay any significant portion of that money, as opposed to negotiating it down to 1-10% of that, if not a full release?

$700m is peanuts for a $100+ bn revenue company and yet, somehow, I have the nagging feeling that they will not pay most of it, if any at all.

I am rather surprised the Ireland’s Data Protection Commission actually did *anything* to punish META. The IDPC is well known for working against the GDPR, mostly by stalling all procedures indefinitely.

If META goes to the European Court to get it overturned, they might find a bench of much less lenient judges.

Btw, repeat offenses get higher fines. The maximum is 2% of world turnover, for regular mistakes. It rises to 4% for criminal negligence or intent.

@ ALL,

Remember imposing a fine and collecting it are two seperate and mostly unrelated processes.

The question to ask is “What method of compelling does the EU DPC have if Meta say ‘Foxtrot Oscar’?”.

Further how will the fines be payed, it’s not as though Meta actually pays taxes anyway.

One trick is to write a fine off against tax. So whilst the fine is large the cost is small.

Worse perhaps is if the Fine is payed into Europe, where will the tax write off land?

But the sensible way to deal with Meta is to “pull the plug” on them in one of many ways.

One such would be to block their entire IP address range and DNS resolution in Europe.

As Meta income is “ad based” that would cut into their income at a time when the company value has fallen to about a quater of what it was a year ago. In fact Meta’s official value is oh about 200-300billion so the fine is a fraction of a percent of that… But what would it be if Meta were nolonger available in Europe?

Rather more noticeably smaller I suspect. Remember part of the 75% loss in value from 1Trillion down so ~250billion was due to investors not being happy about the money being spent on those darn VR goggles…

Along with the fact that life is not a happy place in the Social Networking world with Twitter under Hell-on Rusk doing the imploding thing and another similar company has laid of 31% of staff,

Life is looking a little less than rosey in certain corners of the industry. Especially as I suspect news will start to come out that Twitter staff that have left have found new and potentially better jobs.

That would be a popcorn worthy spectacle. I do not think I have seen that before.

Even MS had to pay up $1B or so (not GDPR).

Only my ISP can prevent me accessing Meta’s IP adresses; and my DNS resolver is right here, in my living room. To prevent me resolving Meta, you’d have to block the DNS roots. Well, OK; just being Meta is enough to prevent me accessing Meta, but you know what I mean.

How long will society keep pretending that monetary “punishment” is sufficient to force companies to do the right thing first, rather then after the fact?

Meta gets its income from advertising. If companies cannot advertise in the EU because Meta is labeled criminal in some way, that would hurt.

It’s the cost of doing business.

This result seems entirely related to data storage and processing. What about collection? Dates of birth and full/”real” names seem way too personal to be collected without a very good reason, which the GDPR requires. Has any Commission officially investigated or issued rulings relating to this?

@ Aaron:

A US Supreme Court ruling declared that corporations are “Individuals.” In that case, throw them in jail for violating the law.

What would that look like? Perhaps

. no communications with other parties

@Bill

Back in the ’80s a whole lot of otherwise decent Companies declared themselves to be Corporations with “the rights and privileges of a natural person.” I wondered at the time how they were allowed to do that without also assuming the duties and obligations of natural persons.
