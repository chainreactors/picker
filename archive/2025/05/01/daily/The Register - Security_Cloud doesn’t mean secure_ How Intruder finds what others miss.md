# Cloud doesn’t mean secure: How Intruder finds what others miss

Sponsored post You’d be naïve to believe that the cloud is secure by default, and while most hosting services provide basic defenses, it’s not always clear what level of protection these provide.

Weak identity and access controls, inadequate encryption, insecure application programming interfaces (APIs), application and service misconfigurations, denial of service (DoS) attacks and insider threats – they can all lead to sensitive information stored in the cloud being lost or stolen.

The results of Dark Reading’s [2024 Strategic Security Survey](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud-security/managing-cloud-risks-big-headache-2024) indicate most enterprise IT and security managers are painfully aware of the problem. Almost half (49.6 percent) of those taking part reported they were worried about exploits targeting cloud service providers and a similar number (47.8 percent) expressed themselves wary about cloud services breaches and intrusions.

Additional defenses can provide some peace of mind though, which is what Intruder’s [Cloud Security](https://www.intruder.io/cloud-security) provides with its agentless cloud security scans. Intruder combines external vulnerability scanning with info from AWS accounts to find risks that oth...
