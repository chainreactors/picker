What do a source code editor, a smart billboard, and a web server have in common? They've all become launchpads for attacks‚Äîbecause cybercriminals are rethinking what counts as "infrastructure." Instead of chasing high-value targets directly, threat actors are now quietly taking over the overlooked: outdated software, unpatched IoT devices, and open-source packages. It's not just clever‚Äîit's reshaping how intrusion, persistence, and evasion happen at scale.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**5Socks Proxy Using IoT, EoL Systems Dismantled in Law Enforcement Operation** ‚Äî A joint law enforcement operation undertaken by Dutch and U.S. authorities [dismantled](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/breaking-7000-device-proxy-botnet-using.html) a criminal proxy network, known as anyproxy[.]net and 5socks[.]net, that was powered by thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) and end-of-life (EoL) devices, enlisting them into a botnet for providing anonymity to malicious actors. The illicit platform, active since 2004, advertised more than 7,000 online proxies daily, with infected devices mainly located in the U.S., Canada and Ecuador. The attacks targeted IoT devices susceptible to known security flaws to deploy a malware called TheMoon. The development comes as two other law enforcement operations have felled the [eXch](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/germany-shuts-down-exch-over-19b.html) cryptocurrency exchange for facilitating money laundering and [six DDoS-for-hire services](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/europol-shuts-down-six-ddos-for-hire.html) that were used to launch thousands of cyber-attacks across the world.

## **üîî Top News**

* **COLDRIVER Uses ClickFix to Distribute LOSTKEYS Malware** ‚Äî The Russia-linked threat actor known as COLDRIVER has been observed distributing a new malware called [LOSTKEYS](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/russian-hackers-using-clickfix-fake.html) as part of an espionage-focused campaign using ClickFix-like social engineering lures. The attacks, detected in January, March, and April 2025, targeted current and former advisors to Western governments and militaries, as well as journalists, think tanks, and NGOs, as well as individuals connected to Ukraine. LOSTKEYS is designed to steal files from a hard-coded list of extensions and directories, along with sending system information and running processes to the attacker.
* **Play Ransomware Attack Exploited CVE-2025-29824 as a 0-Day** ‚Äî Threat actors with links to the Play ransomware family [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/play-ransomware-exploited-windows-cve.html) a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows as a zero-day as part of an attack targeting an unnamed organization in the United States. The attack leveraged CVE-2025-29824, a privilege escalation flaw in the Common Log File System (CLFS) driver that was patched by Microsoft last month. That said, no ransomware was actually deployed in the attack. However, Grixba, a custom information stealer known to be used by the Play ransomware operation, was put to use.
* **NSO Group Ordered to Pay $168 Million in Damages to WhatsApp** ‚Äî Israeli company NSO Group was [ordered](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/nso-group-fined-168m-for-targeting-1400.html) by a federal jury in the U.S. to pay Meta-owned WhatsApp WhatsApp approximately $168 million in monetary damages, more than four months after a federal judge ruled that the Israeli company violated U.S. laws by exploiting WhatsApp servers to deploy Pegasus spyware targeting more than 1,400 individuals globally. In addition, the jury determined that NSO Group must pay WhatsApp $444,719 in compensatory damages for the significant efforts WhatsApp engineers made to block the attack vectors. WhatsApp originally filed the lawsuit against NSO Group in 2019, accusing NSO Group of exploiting WhatsApp using a then-zero-day vulnerability in the messaging app to target journalists, human rights activists, and political dissidents. NSO Group said it will appeal the ruling.
* **3 Malicious npm Packages Target Cursor Users** ‚Äî Three malicious npm packages named sw-cur, sw-cur1, and aiide-cur have been [flagged](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/malicious-npm-packages-infect-3200.html) in the npm registry as designed to target the Apple macOS version of Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI)-powered source code editor. The packages claim to be offering "the cheapest Cursor API," but contain functionality to modify legitimate files associated with the software to execute arbitrary code in the compromised system. The packages continue to be available for download from npm, and have been downloaded over 3,200 times to date. The discovery heralds a new trend where threat actors are using rogue npm packages as a way to introduce malicious modifications to other legitimate libraries or software already installed on developer systems.
