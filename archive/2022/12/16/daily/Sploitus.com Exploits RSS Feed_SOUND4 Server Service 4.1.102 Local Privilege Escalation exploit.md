SOUND4 Server Service 4.1.102 Local Privilege Escalation

Vendor: SOUND4 Ltd.
Product web page: https://www.sound4.com | https://www.sound4.biz
Affected version: 4.1.102

Summary: SOUND4 Windows Server Service.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'SOUND4 Server' for Windows. This could potentially allow an
authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with
elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the
local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected
by the OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed
during application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user's code
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Windows 10 Home 64 bit (build 9200)
SOUND4 Server v4.1.102
SOUND4 Remote Control v4.3.17
