[![Chrome Zero-Day](data:image/png;base64... "Chrome Zero-Day")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPhSx8fwDELvWKGNqNBlu-6Ndi0sPJb5p7SWiIt3zy9vzwPZSe7riuvdLHazxW6fjyi7S27qv4kzvcF9xE_ftF8djTvTvdEzg1Oh4XMApFiK4rwg7xw_hB5QuQ5S7y76OVPdl2zVCKaS0gHR54fTN805N7NUzdgw-Ivg3EOYBvCPBwOlveakXMpHVZXvAY/s790-rw-e365/chrome.png)

Google on Thursday released security updates to address a zero-day flaw in Chrome that it said has been actively exploited in the wild.

Tracked as **CVE-2024-4671**, the high-severity vulnerability has been described as a case of use-after-free in the Visuals component. It was reported by an anonymous researcher on May 7, 2024.

[Use-after-free bugs](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html), which arise when a program references a memory location after it has been deallocated, can lead to any number of consequences, ranging from a crash to arbitrary code execution.

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2024-4671 exists in the wild," the company [said](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_9.html) in a terse advisory without revealing additional specifics of how the flaw is being weaponized in real-world attacks or the identity of the threat actors behind them.

With the latest development, Google has addressed two actively exploited zero-days in Chrome since the start of the year.

Earlier this January, the tech giant patched an out-of-bounds memory access issue in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine ([CVE-2024-0519](https://thehackernews.com/2024/01/zero-day-alert-update-chrome-now-to-fix.html), CVSS score: 8.8) that could result in a crash.

Google also addressed three other zero-days that were disclosed during the Pwn2Own hacking contest in Vancouver in March -

* [**CVE-2024-2886**](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html) - Use-after-free in WebCodecs
* [**CVE-2024-2887**](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html) - Type confusion in WebAssembly
* [**CVE-2024-3159**](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) - Out-of-bounds memory access in V8

Users are recommended to upgrade to Chrome version 124.0.6367.201/.202 for Windows and macOS, and version 124.0.6367.201 for Linux to mitigate potential threats.

Users of Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available.
