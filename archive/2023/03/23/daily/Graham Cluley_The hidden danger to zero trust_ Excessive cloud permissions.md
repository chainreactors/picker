# The hidden danger to zero trust: Excessive cloud permissions

What is one of the leading causes of breaches in the cloud?

OMG, it‚Äôs still phishing! It‚Äôs no wonder CISOs push zero trust as a top priority. Identities are a top cloud target.

However, the reality is, least privilege access rights are still not properly enforced. As a matter of fact, in the recent [Sysdig 2023 Cloud-Native Security and Usage report](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report/) found that **90% of granted permissions are not used**, making it a lot easier to move laterally and take the keys to the kingdom once they get in.

The [report](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report/) also found that **non-admin users only utilized 10% of granted permissions over a 90-day window**. DevOps teams tend to grant more permissions ‚Äì for both humans and non humans ‚Äì than needed, increasing the risk of attack.

Excessive cloud permissions erode zero trust efforts and open your organization to further breach. Read [more key takeaways](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report-overview/) from Sysdig‚Äôs report.
