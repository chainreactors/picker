# Putting on the Red Hat

## Keeping on top of Linux enterprise security requirements

[Elizabeth Coles](/Author/Elizabeth-Coles "Read more by this author")

Webinar If there was a tablet of stone inscribed with ten commandments for the fundamental requirements of an operating environment, the first would almost certainly be 'thou shalt have security and stability.'

Many companies, and as many as 90 percent of Fortune 500s, rely on Red Hat. Linux has become an operating system of choice for developing cloud-native workloads, an evolution built on the trust that it will deliver the security, data protection, and compliance that hybrid cloud environments require.

Join the Register's Tim Phillips on [26 October at 10am BST/11pm CEST/5am EDT/2am PDT to find out more](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/17251/secure-linux-deployment). Tim will be hearing from Red Hat's Hervé Lemaitre and Chris Jenkins about how Red Hat Enterprise Linux has been hardened to meet the constantly changing demands of modern IT infrastructure.

The trio will discuss the processes that ensure the delivery of consistent security management across every possible deployment and set out how Red Hat Enterprise Linux meets the challenge of delivering the tools and services required to maintain compliant enterprise software environments.

Register for our [Secure Linux deployment webinar](https://whitepapers.theregister.com/paper/view/17251/secure-linux-deployment) here and we will send you a reminder.
