# Fake PayPal invoice from Geek Squad is a tech support scam

Posted: October 30, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

One of our employees received this suspicious email and showed it to me. Although it’s a pretty straightforward attempt to lure targets into calling the scammers, it’s worth writing up because it looks like it was sent out in bulk.

Let’s look at the red flags.

Firstly, the **sender address**:

![Email comes from tinapal83638@gmail.com and is sent to undisclosed recipients, with the target in BCC](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/sender_info.png)

PayPal doesn’t use Gmail addresses to send invoices, and they also don’t put your address in the blind carbon copy (BCC) field. BCC hides the list of recipients, which is often a sign the email was sent to a large group.

And “Tina Pal” must be Pay’s evil twin—one who doesn’t know it’s customary to address your customers by name rather than “PayPal customer.”

Because the message came from a genuine Gmail address, the authentication results (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC) all pass. That only proves the email wasn’t [spoofed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2016/06/email-spoofing) and was sent from a legitimate Gmail server, not that it’s actually from PayPal.

The red flag here is that PayPal emails will not come from random Gmail addresses. Official communications come from addresses like `service@paypal.com`.

The email body itself was empty but came with a randomly named attachment—two red flags in one. PayPal would at least use some branding in the email and never expect their customers to open an attachment.

Here’s what the invoice in the attachment looked like:

![PayPal branded invoice](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/invoice.png)
> “PayPal Notification:
>
> Your account has been billed $823.00. The payment will be processed in the next 24 hours. Didn’t make this purchase? Contact PayPal Support right now.”

More red flags:

* **Urgency:** “The payment will be processed in the next 24 hours” or else the rather large amount of $823 is gone.
* **Phone number only:** This isn’t how you normally dispute PayPal charges. Genuine PayPal emails direct you to log in to your account or use their [online Resolution Center](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-the-resolution-center-help246), not to call a number.
* **Unverified number:** Reverse lookup tools don’t show it as PayPal’s. Scammers often spoof phone numbers or register them under unrelated businesses. An official PayPal support number will appear on PayPal’s website and be recognized by lookup tools.
* **Brand mismatch:** An invoice comes from the company charging you, not from the payment provider. So, this one should have been branded for Geek Squad or be titled something like “payment notification.”

## What tech support scammers do

In this type of [tech support scam,](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/05/how-to-spot-and-avoid-a-tech-support-scam) the target calls the listed number, and the “tech” on the other end asks to remotely log in to their computer to check for “viruses.” They might run a short program to open command prompts and folders, just to scare and distract the victim. Then they’ll ask to install another tool to “fix” things, which will search the computer for anything they can turn into money. Others will sell you fake protection...
