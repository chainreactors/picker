# Matthew Green

I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

*This is the second part of a [~~two~~ ~~three~~ four-part series](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/04/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-1/), which covers some recent results on “verifiable computation” and possible pitfalls that could occur there. This post won’t make much sense on its own, so I urge you to [start with the first part](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/04/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-1/).*

In the previous post we introduced a handful of concepts, including (1) the notion of “verifiable computation” proof systems (sometimes inaccurately called “ZK” by the [Ethereum community](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)), (2) [hash functions,](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) and (3) some ideal models that we use for our security proofs, and (4) the idea that these “ideal models” are bogus — and sometimes they can make us confident in schemes that are totally insecure in the real world.

Today I want to move forward and (get closer) to actually talking about the recent result alluded to in the title: the recent paper by Khovratovich, Rothblum and Soukhanov entitled “[How to Prove False Statements: Practical Attacks on Fiat-Shamir](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/118)” (henceforth: *KRS*.) This paper shows that a proving scheme that *appears* to be secure in one setting, might not actually be secure.

One approach to discussing this paper would be to start at the beginning of the paper and then move towards the end. *We will not do that.* Instead, I plan to pursue an approach that involves a lot of jumping around. There is a method to my madness.

Before we can get there, we need to cover a bit more essential background.

### Background Part One: Interactive proof systems

I have introduced these posts by reiterating a critique of something called the [random oracle model](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2011/09/29/what-is-random-oracle-model-and-why-3/) paradigm, in which we pretend that [hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) are actually [random functions](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2023/05/08/prfs-prps-and-other-fantastic-things/). Thoughtful cryptographers will no doubt be upset with me about this, since in fact the KRS paper is not about random oracles at all! Instead it demonstrates a problem with a different “heuristic” that cryptographers use everywhere: this is called the [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic).

While Fiat-Shamir is not the same as the random oracle model, the two live in the same neighborhood and send their kids to the same school. What I mean is: Fiat-Shamir can (in some very limited theoretical senses) live without the random oracle model, but in practice the two are usually interdependent.

To explain this new result I therefore need to explain what Fiat-Shamir does. And before I can do that, I need to explain what interactive proofs are. (Feel free to skip forward if you already know this part.)

Many of the verifiable computation “proof systems” we use today are members of a class of prot...
