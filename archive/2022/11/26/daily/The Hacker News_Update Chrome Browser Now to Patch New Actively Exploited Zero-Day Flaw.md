[![Update Chrome Browser](data:image/png;base64... "Update Chrome Browser")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikPLibtmTn8N2H14UEsCbQi0mXDkp7d4sxfUThlf9SHApnBVQaXlzTa5_Y_GROcH_HN9A8cDTE0iaRtCHiFqthOucxRIZyrjEzXxqkiX0DQPciOOULFnJ0I4aob50-m5id5elUHNKFtdF-5Ep-jdQVcYtFgUVENLsQkZIYWjXsuoDDYF_UBh0lc0o2/s790-rw-e365/chrome-update.png)

Google on Thursday released software updates to address yet another zero-day flaw in its Chrome web browser.

Tracked as **CVE-2022-4135**, the high-severity vulnerability has been described as a heap buffer overflow in the GPU component. Clement Lecigne of Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been credited with reporting the flaw on November 22, 2022.

Heap-based buffer overflow bugs can be [weaponized](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html) by threat actors to crash a program or execute arbitrary code, leading to unintended behavior.

According to the NIST's National Vulnerability Database, the flaw [could](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4135) permit a "remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page."

"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2022-4135 exists in the wild," the tech giant [acknowledged](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_24.html) in an advisory.

But like other actively exploited issues, technical specifics have been withheld until a majority of the users are updated with a fix and to prevent further abuse.

With the latest update, Google has resolved eight zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome since the start of the year -

* [**CVE-2022-0609**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/new-chrome-0-day-bug-under-active.html) - Use-after-free in Animation
* [**CVE-2022-1096**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/google-issues-urgent-chrome-update-to.html) - Type confusion in V8
* [**CVE-2022-1364**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/04/google-releases-urgent-chrome-update-to.html) - Type confusion in V8
* [**CVE-2022-2294**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/update-google-chrome-browser-to-patch.html) - Heap buffer overflow in WebRTC
* [**CVE-2022-2856**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/new-google-chrome-zero-day.html) - Insufficient validation of untrusted input in Intents
* [**CVE-2022-3075**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/google-release-urgent-chrome-update-to.html) - Insufficient data validation in Mojo
* [**CVE-2022-3723**](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/google-issues-urgent-chrome-update-to.html) - Type confusion in V8

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 107.0.5304.121 for macOS and Linux and 107.0.5304.121/.122 for Windows to mitigate potential threats.

Users of Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available.
