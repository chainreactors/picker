In episode 21 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, Mark and Graham comfort themselves with a limbless AI pet as they learn about a terrifying robot dog with a flamethrower, fission-powered data centres, AI suicide pods, and a multi-limbed robot with a passion for classical music.

Graham finds out what happens if you sellotape an Alexa to a Chihuahua, and Mark asks AI Trump and AI Harris how many Rs there are in ‚Äústrawberry‚Äù.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
