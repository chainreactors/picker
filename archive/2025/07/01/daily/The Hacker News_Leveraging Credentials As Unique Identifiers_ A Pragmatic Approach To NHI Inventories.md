Identity-based attacks are on the rise. Attacks in which malicious actors assume the identity of an entity to easily gain access to resources and sensitive data have been increasing in number and frequency over the last few years. Some recent reports estimate that [83% of attacks involve compromised secrets](https://www.silverfort.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Osterman_Research_Identity_Attack_Surface_Silverfort.pdf). According to reports such as the [Verizon DBIR](https://blog.gitguardian.com/verizon-dbir-2025/), attackers are more commonly using stolen credentials to gain their initial foothold, rather than exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration.

Attackers are not just after human identities that they can assume, though. More commonly, they are after Non-Human Identities (NHIs), which [outnumber human identities in the enterprise by at least 50 to one](https://blog.gitguardian.com/role-of-cisos-iam-nhi/). Unlike humans, machines have no good way to achieve multi-factor authentication, and we, for the most part, have been relying on credentials alone, in the form of API keys, bearer tokens, and JWTs.

Traditionally, identity and access management (IAM) has been built on the idea of persistent human traits over time. It is rare for a person to change their name, fingerprints, or DNA. We can assume that if you went through an identity verification process, you are confirmed to be the human you claim to be. Based on this, you can obtain certain permissions dependent on your role within the organization and your level of trust.

Securing machine identities means getting a handle on the unique trait that bad actors actually care about, namely, their access keys. **If we treat these highly valued secrets as the way to uniquely identify the identities we are protecting, then we can leverage that into true observability around how access is granted and used throughout your enterprise.**

## Accounting For NHIs Through A Fractured Lens

Before we take a deeper look at secrets as unique identifiers, let's first consider how we currently talk about NHIs in the enterprise.

Most teams struggle with defining NHIs. The canonical definition is simply "anything that is not a human," which is necessarily a wide set of concerns. NHIs manifest differently across cloud providers, container orchestrators, legacy systems, and edge deployments. A Kubernetes service account tied to a pod has distinct characteristics compared to an Azure managed identity or a Windows service account. Every team has historically managed these as separate concerns. This patchwork approach makes it nearly impossible to create a consistent policy, let alone automate governance across environments.

The exponential growth of NHIs has left a gap in traditional asset inventory tools, and access reviewers can't keep pace. Enforcement of consistent permissions or security controls across such a wildly varied set of identities seems near impossible. This is on top of aging legacy systems that have not had their passwords rotated or audited in years.

Compounding this issue is the lack of metadata and ownership around NHIs. Questions like "What is this identity for?" or "Who owns this token?" frequently go unanswered, as the person who created and released that identity into the system has moved on. This vacuum of accountability makes it difficult to apply basic lifecycle practices such as rotation or decommissioning. NHIs that were created for testing purposes often persist long after the systems they were tied to are discontinued, accumulating risk silently.

## The UUIDs Of Your Zero Trust Protect Surface

No matter what form or shape an NHI takes, in order to do work as part of an application or system, it needs to authenticate to access data and resources and do its work.

Most commonly, this takes the form of secrets, which look like API keys, certificates, or tokens. These are all inherently unique and can act as cryptographic fingerprints across distributed systems. **When used in this way, secrets used for authentication become traceable artifacts tied directly to the systems that generated them.** This allows for a level of attribution and auditing that's difficult to achieve with traditional service accounts. For example, a short-lived token can be directly linked to a specific CI job, Git commit, or workload, allowing teams to answer not just what is acting, but why, where, and on whose behalf.

This access-as-the-identifier model can bring clarity to your inventory, offering a unified view of all your machines, workloads, task runners, and even agent-based AI systems. Secrets offer a consistent and machine-verifiable method of indexing NHIs, letting teams centralize visibility into what exists, who owns it, and what it can access, regardless of whether it's running on Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, or a public cloud.

Critically, this model also supports lifecycle management and Zero Trust principles more naturally than legacy identity frameworks. A secret is only valid when it can be used, which is a provable state, which means unused or expired secrets can be automatically flagged for cleanup. This can stop identity sprawl and ghost accounts, which are endemic in NHI-heavy environments.
