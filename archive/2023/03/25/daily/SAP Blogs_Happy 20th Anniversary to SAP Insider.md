Back in 2003 (at least I think it was 2003) I attended a very helpful SAP Insider conference on reporting with my previous employer.  b8fddc9004e246c393c39f7b5e1b3b13 presented about SAP Query, a tool I still use today.

Back then, the presentations were available on a CD and they were so valuable.  Fast forward 20 years, and some things about SAP Insider haven't changed:

1. High quality content on the slides - SAP Insider reviews all slides, and ensures they are top quality

2. The snack breaks provide awesome food

3. High quality presentations

In 2005 or 2006, I attended a SAP Finance SAP Insider conference and there I attended nathan.genez session on SAP Asset Accounting.  He would ask the audience questions to keep us on our toes.  I was amazed I could answer one of his questions.

So this past week it was great to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of SAP Insider in Las Vegas at the Bellagio.

When I checked in, the front desk said "we'll give you a room with the fountain view, at no extra charge, because after all, you are a speaker".

I didn't appreciate it until this:

Bellagio Fountains, Las Vegas, NV

The first day, prior to pre-conference day, SAP's ingo.hilgefort and I checked out his room to set up for the preconference:

So Ingo presented 2 sessions on SAP DataSphere the first day:

The morning session was full, and afternoon session was about 80% full.

The next day it was a full house for SAP Analytics Cloud Beginner hands-on:

It was great to see everyone in person again and special thanks to Ingo for allowing me to help.  katryn.cheng also assisted and it was great catching up with her.

A special shout-out to Riz Ahmed, SAP Insider, who has worked for them a long time.  When I first saw him this week he said "the gang's all back together".  What a great sentiment.  Happy Anniversary to SAP Insider and hope to see at least 20 more years of great, outstanding events and content.
