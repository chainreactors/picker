A collection of resources to study Solana smart contract security, auditing, and exploits.

## Foundations ðŸ“š

* [Armani Sealevel Attacks and How to avoid them in Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/sealevel-attacks)
  + [Summary Thread](https://twitter.com/pencilflip/status/1483880018858201090) by pencilflip - use Anchor attributes, constraints and types, it will make your life easier!
* [Armani Tips on Developing Secure Solana Programs](https://twitter.com/armaniferrante/status/1411589629384355840)
  + Be wary of `UncheckedAccount` and `AccountInfo` - check them properly!
* [CMichel How to become a smart contract auditor](https://cmichel.io/how-to-become-a-smart-contract-auditor/)
  + Targeted at ETH folks but contains general advice
* [DeFi MOOC samczsun Practical Smart Contract Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJKy5HWuFK8)

* [Kudelski Solana Program Security](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2021/09/15/solana-program-security-part1/)
  + A high-level overview of ownership and data validation
* [Neodyme Common Pitfalls](https://blog.neodyme.io/posts/solana_common_pitfalls)
  + Check owner, check signer, check account data, be careful of integer over/underflow...
