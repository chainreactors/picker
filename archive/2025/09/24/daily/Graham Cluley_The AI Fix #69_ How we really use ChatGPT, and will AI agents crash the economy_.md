In episode 69 of The AI Fix, our hosts discover brain rot, a shark wears trainers on its fins, an AI writes a terrible J-Pop song, Graham learns that ants don‚Äôt care about AI, Mark predicts the precise date of Graham‚Äôs demise, Norway trusts $1.9 trillion to an AI investor, and Florida thins out its dumbest pythons using laughably bad robot rabbits.

Also in this episode, the first AI Fix ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt trust a pigeon‚Äù mug is spotted in the wild, and the show gets its first bit of feedback from an AI listener.

Plus, Graham learns that more people have used ChatGPT than have ever owned a ferret, and Mark finally finds a use for cryptocurrency.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
