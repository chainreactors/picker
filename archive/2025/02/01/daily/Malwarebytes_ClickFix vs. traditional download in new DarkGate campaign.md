# ClickFix vs. traditional download in new DarkGate campaign

Posted: January 31, 2025
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

During the past several months there have been numerous [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) campaigns that use a technique something referred to as “ClickFix”. It often consists of a fake CAPTCHA or similar traffic validation page where visitors are instructed to paste and execute code in order to proceed.

We have started to see ClickFix attacks more and more via malicious Google ads as well. This is in contrast to typical [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) pages where victims download a so-called installer that contains malware.

In a recent [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) campaign targeting the Notion brand, we observed these two techniques used at play. It’s quite possible the threat actors were collecting metrics to determine which one of the two gave them the most conversions via malware installs.

This blog post details this campaign that ultimately delivered the [DarkGate](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-darkgate) malware loader.

## Overview

## Web traffic view

## Delivery #1: PowerShell code via “ClickFix”

### Malicious ad and social engineering

Threat actors created a Google ad for the popular utility application Notion. The first time we clicked on the ad, we were redirected to a site showing a “Verify you are human” page, also known as [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/application-services/products/turnstile/). Except this was not the real Cloudflare, and merely a social engineering trick.

The HTML source code was obfuscated to only show gibberish interlaced with Russian comments, which we later determined was Rot13, a letter substitution cipher. This was likely used to hide the offending code from prying eyes and network rules:

After checking the box to verify we are human, we see new instructions, “Verification steps”, that involve pressing a number of key combinations. *Windows and R* launches the run dialog while *Ctrl and V* will paste whatever is in the clipboard. Supposedly this code is part of the verification process, but instead when pressing Enter, the victim will run a malicious command:

### PowerShell and payload

The code copied into the clipboard is actually a command line that runs PowerShell:

The Base64 encoded string retrieves the following code from *hxxps[:]//s2notion[.]com/in.php?action=1*:
