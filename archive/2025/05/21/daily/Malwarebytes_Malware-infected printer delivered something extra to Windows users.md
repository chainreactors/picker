# Malware-infected printer delivered something extra to Windows users

Posted: May 20, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

You’d hope that spending $6,000 on a printer would give you a secure experience, free from [viruses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer-virus) and other [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware). However, in the case of Procolored printers, you’d be wrong.

The Shenzen-based company sells UV printers, which are able to print on a variety of materials including wood, acrylic, tile, and plastic. They come with all kinds of attractive features. However as reviewer Cameron Coward found out, they also [came with malware](https://www.hackster.io/news/the-maker-s-toolbox-procolored-v11-pro-dto-uv-printer-review-680d491e17e3) (at least, until recently).

Coward received a review model of the Procolored V11 pro DTO UC printer that came with software on a USB thumb drive. “One of those was the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable in a zip folder,” he said in a review of the product. “But as soon as I unzipped it, Windows Defender quarantined the files and informed me that it found a Floxif virus.”

[Floxif](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/virus-floxif) is a family of malware that infects a computer and installs a [backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor), giving the attacker control of the machine and allowing them to download other malware onto the system.

Coward also tried to download the control software for the printer from Procolored’s website, which linked to the mega.nz file sharing site. When he tried to download it, Google Chrome detected a virus and blocked it.

He checked in with the vendor, who denied that there was any malware and said the virus software was spotting a false positive (when it mistakenly identifies legitimate software as malicious).

## Getting a second opinion

Coward asked for help on Reddit, and Karsten Hahn, principal malware researcher for cybersecurity company G Data CyberDefense, investigated the issue. After scanning 8 GB of software files for the Procolored products, all maintained on mega.nz, Hahn found no evidence of Floxif, he reported in an [account](https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/05/38200-printer-infected-software-downloads) of the investigation.

He did find two malware strains in the files, though. Win32.Backdoor.XRedRAT.A is a backdoor that first cropped up in other analyses last year. It gives the attacker complete control over the victim’s PC, including letting them enter command-line instructions, log keystrokes, and download or delete files.

The second, MSIL.Trojan-Stealer.CoinStealer.H, steals [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) from victims’ machines. It replaces cryptocurrency addresses in the clipboard with the attacker’s own, which has already received around $100,000 in presumably ill-gotten funds.

Both malware files were detected by Malwarebytes’  [Machine Learning](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-machine-learning) component DDS as [Generic.Malware.AI.DDS](http://generic.malware.ai/), so Malwarebytes/ThreatDown customers were protected against these threats.

After confronting Procolored with the evidence, the company responded to Hahn:

> “The software hosted on our website was initially transferred via USB drives. It is possible that a virus was introduced during this process.”

The organization ...
