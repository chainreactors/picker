## Friday Squid Blogging: Emotional Support Squid

When asked what makes [this](https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecuddlefishes/) [an](http://thecuddlefishes.com/) “emotional support squid” and not just another stuffed animal, its creator says:

> They’re emotional support squid because they’re large, and cuddly, but also cheerfully bright and derpy. They make great neck pillows (and you can fidget with the arms and tentacles) for travelling, and, on a more personal note, when my mum was sick in the hospital I gave her one and she said it brought her “great comfort” to have her squid tucked up beside her and not be a nuisance while she was sleeping.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Such cute emotional support squid!!

I like all the names, but personally, I would probably rename my squid Squidy

Could one make squid from anything better than: “upcycled fabric”, “love”, “but also A LOT of snark” (in any order of course) 😄

Feeling creepy deepy •

@ALL

On the top left of the Etsy page there is a golden yellow square with googly eyes and a smaller odd golden thing behind it.

I’m left with a deep down creepy feeling It is a Bart Simpson hiding behind a SpongeBob SquarePants.

I guess it’s time to catch some nightmares 🙁

@JonKnowsNothing

> A recent Federated Farmers survey highlighted that 52% of respondents still have a landline and 17% still rely on the copper network for their internet connection. [1]

At the privatisation of the telecomms side of the old Post Office, the wires and network hardware remained in the hands of a single entity, now known as Chorus. Maintenance costs are rising on the old parts, mostly in remote rural areas, and Chorus is keen to move users off copper by 2026 where there is an alternative available, and completely by 2033. The two favored alternatives are: wireless within cellphone tower range. or satellite, although who pays how much for satellite is an interesting question.

Mention in the article of Cyclone Gabrielle refers to the widespread failure of cell towers. Nobody mentions that cellphones had been chosen to replace the old Civil Defence HF Radio system, which always worked when needed. Its big problem was it was run by old men who knew what they were doing, with equipment from Dad’s Army, that youngsters wouldn’t dare touch or learn about. Now local Civil Defence organizations are rushing to fill Mr Musk’s pockets with subscriptions to Starlink.

Or as Perun calls it *“Emotional Support Armour”* which makes this post strangely on topic. (Yes, I know. Don’t all shout at once.) He does have a turn of words doesn’t he? Oh Lord oh Mighty. I find tech and security and all that po-faced stuff a bit too serious for me. You have to squeeze a laugh in there otherwise you go potty.

Judith Butler invented “gender as a technology” and for those following the discussion the whole topic is caught up in geopolitics and national security, and combating bad actors who include nation states and organisations with deep pockets and their disinformation campaigns, and combating domestic terrorism and threats against democracy.

Philosophy is a long standing casual hobby of mine, and gender studies is a new hobby horse which slots neatly into public policy so gives me something to do. This video is just a mainstream primer for those new to the topic.

This video covers subjects which touch on governance and how “think tanks” (gloried lobby and marketing organisations) and dark money can influence public policy in harmful ways. I have a short comment planned which goes into the public policy issues including abuse of public office and the cost of not listening to experts which has knock on effects with child safety and policing.

I may have another comment also on bad governance, and border security, and profiteering which is caught up in this too. I don’t know if the post-Brexit import processing system which crashed this week and border checks will make the cut. It’s just yet one more thing on the pile with a heap of things.

> Fay Presto The Legend Of Magic Speaks Out And Does Not Hold Back! | Talk Magic With Craig Petty #41

Magic doesn’t spring to mind very often when discussing security. It appeals to me because of the show element and slight of hand which are subsets of disguise and other sneakery. People don’t see they perceive and it’s not what you’re up to it’s what they don’t know you’re up to which appeals to me.

It’s been an embarrassing numbers of years since I was school age. I had so many interests back then. One of them was magic. I did my first magic performance maybe when I was 12-ish. It was a bit of a dud I’m ashamed to remember. When I was older I saw this interview on live broadcast television of the day and was completely amazed by Fay Presto. Something clicked on an emotional and personal level and the magic? Everything just went together.

The reason why I looked up and watched these videos is I’ve been taking up magic again. This time it’s focused on...
