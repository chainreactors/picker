![WordPress Hacked: WHat to do when your site is compromised](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blog-Post-Tips-to-Prevent-a-WordPress-Hack-820x385.png)

User enumeration is a technique used by attackers to discover valid usernames associated with a CMS or website. By exploiting certain features, bad actors can compile a list of usernames, which can then be used to launch brute force attacks. These attacks systematically try various password combinations to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on your WordPress site. The consequences can be severe, including unauthorized modifications to website content, data breaches, and even complete site takeovers.

Of course, [strong passwords](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/how-to-make-strong-password.html) are essential to mitigating risk. They’re your first line of defense against [brute force attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-brute-force-attack/). A strong password makes it significantly harder for attackers to get in, protecting your website from potential security breaches. But in many cases, strong passwords alone aren’t enough. You need a comprehensive security strategy to tackle user enumeration head-on and keep your site safe.

In this post, we’re diving deep into WordPress user enumeration. We’ll break down what it is, why it’s a problem, and most importantly — how to prevent a compromise. By getting a handle on these risks and taking proactive steps, you can beef up your WordPress security and keep your valuable data safe from those pesky threats. Let’s get started!

## What is WordPress user enumeration?

User enumeration is a technique used by attackers to discover valid usernames associated with a WordPress site. By exploiting certain features, malicious actors can compile a list of usernames.

This information serves as a foundation for launching brute force attacks, where attackers systematically try various password combinations to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Common user enumeration methods

There are a few methods attackers used to enumerate users in WordPress:

### Author archives

WordPress automatically generates author archives for each user, displaying their posts and other information. Attackers can access these archives to collect usernames, essentially allowing anybody to coax WordPress into spitting out the admin users on a website.

This is primarily due to the existence of **permalinks**. The way it works is actually quite simple. WordPress allows you to navigate to the posts of a particular author like so:

```
https://example.com/author/name
```

However, WordPress also allows us to do the same thing by specifying their user **identification number** instead*.* To access this, all you have to do is navigate to the number ID associated with a particular user (ie. target Administrator).

For example:

```
https://example.com/?author=1
```

Navigating to this URL will display a page of all posts published by the user in question. But, it also tells you the username used to log into the WordPress environment.

Tools like [WPScan](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/04/how-to-install-wpscan-wordpress-vulnerability-scan.html) make this process even easier. Here is an example output of the following command:

```
wpscan --url example.com --enumerate u
```

As we can see below, this coaxes the primary admin user out of the website.

At this point, an attacker would have all the necessary information required to launch a [brute force attack](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-brute-force-attack/).

### Login error messages

When attempting to log in, WordPress might provide different error messages for invalid usernames and incorrect passwords. Attackers can observe these messages to determine which usernames are valid.
