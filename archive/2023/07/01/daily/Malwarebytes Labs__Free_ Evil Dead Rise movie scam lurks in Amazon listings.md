# “Free” Evil Dead Rise movie scam lurks in Amazon listings

Posted: June 30, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Scammers are using a novel technique with Amazon listings to trick fans of Evil Dead into downloads they may not want, and expensive rolling payments they have no interest in. Evil Dead Rise, the breakout horror film of 2023, started with [big cinema numbers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2023/06/24/inside-evil-dead-rise-scaring-up-acclaim-and-box-office-success/) and has moved on to a victory lap in streaming land for good measure. In fact, it’s doing *so* well that the original film from 1981 has crept into the charts too:

A good time to be a Deadite. Not so good if you’re unable to catch a legitimate stream or the movie isn’t out in your region yet. If you decide to pre-order it from Amazon, you’ll see something odd nestled in the physical media section which we’ve highlighted in red. Bizarrely, there’s a podcast claiming to offer up a free version of Evil Dead Rise via streaming.

The full movie, in podcast form? I know Amazon has some pretty impressive technology but I don’t think we’re at that level *just* yet. The full text reads as follows:

> !Streaming Evil Dead Rise 2023 Movie Evil Dead Rise 2023 Movie Warner Evil Dead Rise 2023 Pictures! Are you looking to download or watch the new Evil Dead Rise 2023 online?
>
> If you are looking for Watch Evil Dead Rise (2023) : Full Movie Online Free, Watch Evil Dead Rise Streaming Full Movie Online Free ||Prime.

Playing the audio clip reveals about 24 seconds of generic soft rock music, presumably only present because the “podcaster” has to upload something to create a listing. To even access the audio file, you’d need to open it via an Audible account or Amazon Music.

Clicking the link redirects you through several URLs before settling on what looks like it’s about to offer you a stream of the film.

Evil Dead Rise for download or streaming, with a “Subscribe to watch: $0.00” message underneath? You can add this to the “Too good to be true” pile.

No matter what you click, on a mobile device you may be offered a download. In testing, we saw a program claiming to offer all manner of media downloads:

In another test, we were directed to an odd payment page:

![Mobile sign up](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/easset_upload_file39339_270974_e.jpg)

I say odd, because the URL contains the word “antivirus”, which would suggest you’re potentially signing up for a security service of some kind. Despite this, there’s no clear indication of what exact...
