# What I’ve learned in my first 7-ish years in cybersecurity

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

When I first interviewed with Joel Esler for my position at Cisco Talos, I remember when the time came for me to ask questions, one thing stood out. I asked what resources were available to me to learn about cybersecurity, because I was totally new to the space.

His answer: The people. When I asked that question, Joel told me that the entire office was a library for me. He told me to just ask as many questions as I could.

Coming from journalism, where I was reporting on a range of topics from local government, finance and banking, art and culture, and sports, cybersecurity was totally new to me. Now almost seven years later, I’ve been able to host a podcast that went nearly 200 episodes, relaunch a cybersecurity newsletter, researched malicious Facebook groups trading stolen personal information, and I’ve even learned how to write a ClamAV signature.

Unfortunately, this week is my last at Talos, but far from my last in cybersecurity. I’m off to a new adventure, but I wanted to take the space here to talk about what I’ve learned in my career at Talos.

I think that this is a good lesson for anyone reading this: If you want to work in cybersecurity, you can, no matter what your background or education is. I’ve met colleagues across Talos who previously [studied counterterrorism operations](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/researcher-spotlight-james-nutland/), [German and Russian history](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/researcher-spotlight-gergana-talos-ir/), and [political science](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/researcher-spotlight-jacob-finn/). And I walked into my first day on the job knowing next to nothing about cybersecurity. I knew I could write, and I knew I could help Talos tell their story (and clean up the occasional passive voice in their blog posts). But I had never heard of a remote access trojan before.

I hope these lessons resonate with you, your team, or the next person you think about hiring into the cybersecurity industry.

1. **You can’t do any of this without people.** This has become extraordinarily relevant this year with the advent of AI. I personally have beef with the term “AI” anyway because we’ve been using machine learning in cybersecurity for years now, which is essentially what we’re using the “AI” buzzword to mean now. But at the end of the day, people are what makes cybersecurity detection work in the first place. If you don’t have a team that’s ready to put in the work necessary to write, test and improve the intelligence that goes into security products (AI or not), you’re doomed. Any of these tools are only as good as the people who put the information into them. I’ve been beyond impressed with the experience, work ethic, and knowledge that everyone in Talos has. They are what makes the engine run, and none of this would work without them.
2. **You can carve out your own niche in cybersecurity.** That said, you don’t have to know how to code to work in cybersecurity if you don’t want to. Anyone can carve out their own niche in the space with their own skillset. I still barely know how to write Python, but I’ve been able to use the skills that I do have (research, writing, storytelling, audio editing, etc.) to carve out my space in cybersecurity. I can speak intelligently about security problems and solutions with my colleagues without needing to know how to reverse-engineer a piece of malware. And even on the technical side of things, everyone can carve out their own specialty. Talos has experts on email spam, and even specific types of email spam, that their colleagues may not know anything about. Others specialize in certain geographic areas because they can speak the language there and can peel back an additional layer that non-native speakers can’t.
3. **Be a sponge.** Going back to the opening of this week’s newsletter, I needed to ask hundreds of questions in my first few months at Talos. It took me a good amount of time to get over my fear of looking stupid, and that held me back early on from having more intelligent conversations with my teammates because I would keep questions inside or just assume that Google had the right answers. No matter how many years you’ve been in the security space, there is always something new to learn. Never assume you know everything there is to know on a given topic. If you are a sponge for information, you never know what new skills you can pick up along the way. When I graduated from college with a journalism degree, I never would have believed you if you told me at the time that I’d be needing to understand [how atomic clocks keep power grids running](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/project-powerup-ukraine-grid/). But here we are.

The Threat Source newsletter will be off for a few weeks while it undergoes a revamp, and it’ll be back with a new look.

I want to thank everyone who has enabled me to grow and shape this newsletter over the years, growing it to thousands of subscribers. And, of course, thanks to the readers who have engaged, read and shared over the years.

## The one big thing

Cisco Talos has observed a new wave of attacks active since at least late 2023, from a Russian-speaking [group we track as “UAT-5647”](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uat-5647-romcom/) against Ukrainian government entities and unknown Polish entities. The latest series of attacks deploys an updated version of the RomCom malware we track as “SingleCamper.” This version is loaded directly from the registry into memory and uses a loopback address to communicate with its loader.
