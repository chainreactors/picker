# Lumma information stealer infrastructure disrupted

Posted: May 22, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The [US Department of Justice (DOJ)](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-domains-behind-major-information-stealing-malware-operation) and [Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/21/microsoft-leads-global-action-against-favored-cybercrime-tool/) have disrupted the infrastructure of the Lumma information stealer (infostealer).

Lumma Stealer, also known as LummaC or LummaC2, first emerged in late 2022 and quickly established itself as one of the most prolific infostealers. Infostealers is the name we use for a group of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that collects [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from infected devices and sends the data to an operator. Depending on the type of infostealer and the goals of the operator, infostealers can be interested in taking anything from usernames and passwords to credit card details, and [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) wallets.

Lumma operates under a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model, meaning its creators sell access to the malware on underground marketplaces and platforms like Telegram. This model allows hundreds of cybercriminals worldwide to deploy Lumma for their own malicious campaigns.

What makes Lumma particularly dangerous is its wide range of targets and its evolving sophistication. It doesn’t just grab browser-stored passwords or [cookies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies). It’s also capable of extracting autofill data, email credentials, FTP client data, and even two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) tokens and backup codes, which enables attackers to bypass additional security layers.

As Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division put it:

> “Malware like LummaC2 is deployed to steal sensitive information such as user login credentials from millions of victims in order to facilitate a host of crimes, including fraudulent bank transfers and cryptocurrency theft.”

Over the last few months alone, Microsoft identified over 394,000 Windows computers infected with Lumma worldwide. The FBI estimates that Lumma has been involved in around 10 million infections globally.

Using a court order from the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Microsoft’s DCU seized and facilitated a takedown, suspension, and blocking of approximately 2,300 malicious domains that were part of the infostealer’s backbone.

Most of the seized domains served as user panels, where Lumma customers are able to access and deploy the infostealer, so this will stop the criminals from being able to to access Lumma in order to compromise computers and steal victim information.

Government agencies and researchers sometimes alter DNS addresses to lead the traffic to their own servers (called sinkholes). By redirecting the seized domains to Microsoft-controlled sinkholes, investigators can now monitor ongoing attacks and provide intelligence to help defend against similar threats in the future. This takedown slows down cybercriminals, disrupts their revenue streams, and buys time and knowledge for defenders...
