## Threat Report: Risks and Considerations of Storing Corporate Security Telemetry in EDR Vendor Cloud¬†Instances

## **Executive Summary**

As cybersecurity vendors like CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender, and SentinelOne integrate AI-driven Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities into their cloud-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, organizations must weigh the benefits against potential risks. Storing sensitive corporate security telemetry in vendor-managed cloud instances introduces attack surface expansion, data sovereignty concerns, and AI-related risks.

This report examines the security implications of housing corporate security data‚Äîincluding SIEM and EDR telemetry‚Äîwithin vendor cloud instances and how AI integration affects cyber threat intelligence processing.

## **Key Risks and Considerations**

### **1. Data Exposure & Cloud Breach Risks**

By centralizing security telemetry in vendor-operated cloud environments, enterprises rely on third-party security measures. While providers like CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Sentinel, and Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR implement robust security controls, the risks of cloud misconfigurations, supply chain attacks, and insider threats remain.

#### **Threat Scenarios:**

* **Cloud Data Breach:** A successful compromise of an EDR provider‚Äôs cloud infrastructure (e.g., a zero-day exploit in their storage service) could expose vast amounts of security telemetry.
* **Insider Threats:** Employees at the EDR provider with privileged access could intentionally or unintentionally expose sensitive data.
* **Supply Chain Risks:** If the EDR provider integrates third-party services (e.g., AI models or analytics tools), vulnerabilities in those dependencies could lead to data leaks.

**Case Study:** The 2023 **Microsoft AI Data Leak** incident, where 38TB of internal data was inadvertently exposed via a misconfigured Azure Blob Storage instance, highlights the risks of cloud storage misconfigurations in AI-enhanced security environments.

### **2. Data Sovereignty & Compliance Issues**

Housing SIEM and EDR telemetry in third-party clouds may violate regulatory requirements like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or industry-specific frameworks (e.g., PCI DSS for financial data).

#### **Threat Scenarios:**

* **Regulatory Non-Compliance:** Organizations operating in jurisdictions with strict data localization laws (e.g., the EU‚Äôs GDPR or China‚Äôs CSL) may face legal consequences if sensitive security data is processed in foreign cloud environments.
* **Legal Access by Foreign Governments:** Cloud-hosted security data may be subject to legal requests under laws like the **U.S. CLOUD Act**, allowing authorities to demand access to data stored by American cloud providers.
* **Third-Party Sharing Concerns:** Vendors may use security telemetry for AI training or threat intelligence sharing, potentially exposing metadata or behavioral analytics that adversaries could exploit.

### **3. AI Model Risks in Threat Intelligence Processing**

EDR vendors increasingly deploy AI models to analyze security telemetry, detect threats, and enhance CTI. While AI-driven security analytics improve detection, they introduce new risks:

#### **Threat Scenarios:**

* **AI Model Poisoning:** Adversaries could manipulate security telemetry to introduce false positives or negatives, degrading AI detection models.
* **Bias & Hallucinations in CTI Processing:** AI-generated threat intelligence may misclassify benign activity as malicious or fail to detect novel attack techniques.
* **AI Model Theft:** If an EDR vendor suffers a data breach, attackers could steal AI training models, gaining insights into how detections work and crafting evasive techniques.

**Example:** Researchers at MITRE have demonstrated **AI adversarial attacks** that trick AI-based security models into misidentifying malicious activity as benign.

### **4. Vendor Lock-in & Incident Response Limitations**

Relying on a single vendor‚Äôs cloud instance for SIEM and EDR telemetry can reduce flexibility during incident response and forensics.

#### **Threat Scenarios:**

* **Restricted Data Access:** Some EDR vendors limit raw log access, making it difficult to conduct independent investigations.
* **Vendor Outages & Service Interruptions:** If an EDR vendor experiences downtime (e.g., AWS or Azure outages), security teams may lose real-time visibility into threats.
* **Migration Complexity:** Moving telemetry to another provider or on-prem infrastructure can be complex and costly.

## **Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Implement Multi-Layered Security Controls**

* Encrypt telemetry before it leaves the corporate environment.
* Use **Zero Trust principles** to ensure data access is strictly controlled.
* Regularly audit permissions and vendor security controls.

1. **Ensure Compliance with Data Protection Laws**

* Verify where security data is stored and processed.
* Negotiate **data sovereignty guarantees** with EDR providers.
* Implement **data retention policies** to avoid excessive data storage.

1. **Monitor Vendor & AI Model Security**

* Evaluate EDR vendors for **AI transparency and adversarial testing**.
* Use **independent threat intelligence** sources to validate AI-generated alerts.
* Conduct red teaming exercises against AI-driven security controls.

1. **Reduce Vendor Lock-in Risks**

* Store security logs in a **separate, vendor-agnostic SIEM** (e.g., OpenSearch, Splunk).
* Ensure security teams can retrieve **full raw telemetry** from the EDR platform.
* Have an **on-premise backup of critical security logs** for resilience.

## **Conclusion**

While cloud-hosted EDR and SIEM solutions offer scalability, AI-driven intelligence, and advanced threat detection, they also introduce risks related to data exposure, regulatory compliance, AI vulnerabilities, and vendor dependencies. Organizations must assess the trade-offs and implement **strong security governance** to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of their security telemetry.

üîπ **Recommended Action:** Security leaders should conduct **a risk assessment** of their EDR provider‚Äôs cloud security posture, ensure regulatory compliance, and explore hybrid models where critical telemetry remains on-premise while benefiting from AI analytics in the cloud.
