### **üö® Top Headlines**

### **Fragmented cybersecurity is costing businesses billions, and putting them at risk**

**Summary:** Businesses are losing an average of 5% of their annual revenue simply due to fragmented cybersecurity solutions, new research has claimed. A report by IBM and Palo Alto Networks found more than half (52%) of execs now state fragmented solutions are preventing them from innovating and managing cyber threats efficiently, highlighting a major challenge which stands in the way of increased security and financial efficiency.

### **FBI takes down Cracked.to and Nulled.to in a global law enforcement operation**

**Summary:** FBI has taken down Cracked.to, Nulled.to, and a few other hack sites cybercriminals use for dropping stolen credentials, software cracks, and remote desktop hacks in a coordinated law enforcement operation. In Operation Talent, several domains suspected of facilitating hacking activities have been busted with a law-enforcement ‚Äúseizure‚Äù notice now showing up on their landing. ‚ÄúThis website, as well as the information on the customers and victims of the websites, has been seized by international law enforcement partners,‚Äù reads the notice.

### **CISOs‚Äô top 12 cybersecurity priorities for 2025**

**Summary:** Security chief Andrew Obadiaru‚Äôs to-do list for the upcoming year will be familiar to CISOs everywhere: advance a zero-trust architecture in the organization; strengthen identity and access controls as part of that drive; increase monitoring of third-party risks; and expand the use of artificial intelligence in security operations. ‚ÄúNothing is particularly new ‚Äî maybe AI is newer, and the pace at which it‚Äôs all going keeps increasing ‚Äî but we need to do better at all of it in 2025,‚Äù says Obadiaru, CISO at Cobalt, which offers penetration testing as a service.

### **üîç Emerging Threats and Indicators**

### **Malware Campaigns**

### **New SystemBC RAT Attack Linux Systems to Hack Corporate Infrastructure**

**Summary:** A new variant of the SystemBC Remote Access Trojan (RAT) has emerged, explicitly targeting Linux-based systems. Known for its stealth capabilities, this malware is designed to infiltrate corporate networks, cloud servers, and IoT devices, posing a significant threat to internal corporate services and overall cybersecurity.

### **Lumma Stealer‚Äôs GitHub-Based Delivery Explored via Managed Detection and Response**

**Summary:** [Trend Micro‚Ñ¢ Managed XDR](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/services/managed-xdr.html)¬† uncovered a sophisticated campaign involving Lumma Stealer, an [information-stealing malware](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/j/beware-lumma-stealer-distributed-via-discord-cdn-.html), that was being distributed through GitHub‚Äôs release infrastructure. The investigation revealed that malicious actors exploited GitHub as a trusted platform to deliver the stealer, which subsequently initiated additional malicious activities. It then downloaded and executed other threats, including SectopRAT (a remote access trojan), [Vidar](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/23/i/redline-vidar-first-abuses-ev-certificates.html), [Cobeacon](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/tracking_cobalt_strike_a_vision_one_investigation.html), and another Lumma Stealer variant.

### **New Mirai botnet fires off DDoS attacks via compromised Mitel phones, notifies command & control when detected**

**Summary:** A third variant of the Mirai-based Aquabot malware is apparently taking over Mitel phones to create a remote-controlled botnet that can fire off distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Dubbed Aquabotv3, the malware is actively exploiting a known vulnerability in the devices to¬† access their session initiation protocol (SIP) function, according to Akamai‚Äôs [Security Intelligence and Response Team](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/2025-january-new-aquabot-mirai-variant-exploiting-mitel-phones).

### **Phishing Campaigns**

### **New SMS-Based Phishing Tool ‚ÄòDevilTraff‚Äô Enables Mass Cyber Attacks**

**Summary:** A new SMS phishing tool, DevilTraff, is emerging as a major threat in the cybersecurity landscape, enabling cybercriminals to launch large-scale smishing campaigns with unprecedented ease and efficiency. This platform‚Äôs advanced features, including sender ID spoofing and API automation, make it a potent weapon for orchestrating [phishing attacks](https://cybersecuritynews.com/top-five-industries-targeted-by-phishing-attacks/) globally.

### **Threat Actors Exploit Government Website Vulnerabilities For Phishing Attacks**

**Summary:** Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in government websites to carry out phishing campaigns, leveraging the inherent trust users place in official domains. A recent report by Cofense Intelligence shows that how attackers are weaponizing .gov top-level domains (TLDs) across multiple countries for malicious purposes, including credential phishing, malware delivery, and command-and-control (C2) operations.

### **How Threat Actors are Using Artificial Intelligence**

**Summary:** Artificial intelligence is a red-hot mess, filled with contradicting predictions over whether it will bring vast benefits. From a cybercriminal perspective, AI is already providing productivity gains, from reconnaissance to drafting phishing emails to help in creating scripts and code. Ashley Jess, senior intelligence analyst with Intel 471, says threat actors in 2024 developed AI tools for specific tasks, such as data exfiltration and analysis tools designed for ransomware and data extortion groups. The cost of these tools has fallen significantly since 2022, increasing their diversity as well as their availability. Threat actors are using a combination of open-source models such as Meta‚Äôs [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) and API access to others. In this Studio 471, Jess shares her insight into how AI will shape the threat landscape.
