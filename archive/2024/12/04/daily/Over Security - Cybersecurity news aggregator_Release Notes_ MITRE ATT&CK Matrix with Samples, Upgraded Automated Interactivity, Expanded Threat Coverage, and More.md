Release Notes: MITRE ATT&CK Matrix with Samples, Upgraded Automated Interactivity, Expanded Threat Coverage, and More

Welcome to [ANY.RUN](?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_nov_24&utm_term=031224&utm_content=linktolanding)’s [monthly updates](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/?s=release+notes), where we give you all the details on our latest features and enhancements.

November has been a month of innovation at ANY.RUN, with major upgrades. We’ve launched **[Smart Content Analysis](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity-stage-two/)** as part of Automated Interactivity, updated the home screen of **TI Lookup** featuring an [**interactive MITRE ATT&CK matrix**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/) connected with real-world samples, and expanded our detection capabilities with **new YARA rules, signatures, and Suricata rules** for even more comprehensive threat coverage.

Here’s everything you need to know about our November updates!

## Product Updates

### Automated Interactivity: Stage 2

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image4-1024x576.png)

Last year, we introduced [Automated Interactivity](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity/), a feature that simulates user behavior inside the ANY.RUN sandbox to automatically trigger cyberattacks. It was a game-changer, helping analysts streamline tasks like clicking buttons or solving CAPTCHA challenges.

Now, we’re thrilled to unveil Stage 2 of this feature: [Smart Content Analysis](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/automated-interactivity-stage-two/), a major upgrade that offers better detection and execution of complex threats.

This update makes your security workflow more efficient by enhancing detection capabilities, automating time-consuming tasks, and simplifying complex analyses. It saves analysts valuable time, provides deeper insights, and helps teams respond to threats faster and more effectively.

**What is Smart Content Analysis?**

Smart Content Analysis enhances Automated Interactivity by analyzing and detonating malware and phishing attacks at every step of the kill chain. Here’s how it works:

* **Identifying content**: It scans for URLs, email attachments, or hidden malicious components.

* **Extracting key data**: This includes extracting URLs from QR codes or bypassing rewritten links from security filters.

* **Simulating actions**: It interacts with extracted content, such as opening links, solving CAPTCHA challenges, or launching payloads.

Automated Interactivity is available to Hunter and Enterprise-plan users and can be manually enabled in any sandbox session.

### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques with Real-World Samples inside TI Lookup

We’re thrilled to announce a major update to [TI Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/), now featuring a redesigned home screen integrated with the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/). This upgrade turns the matrix into an interactive tool, bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical, real-world threat analysis.
