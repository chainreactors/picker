Python is everywhere in modern software. From machine learning models to production microservices, chances are your code‚Äîand your business‚Äîdepends on Python packages you didn't write.

But in 2025, that trust comes with a serious risk.

Every few weeks, we're seeing fresh headlines about malicious packages uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI)‚Äîmany going undetected until after they've caused real harm. One of the most dangerous recent examples? In December 2024, attackers quietly compromised the Ultralytics YOLO package, widely used in computer vision applications. It was downloaded thousands of times before anyone noticed.

This wasn't an isolated event. This is the new normal.

Python supply chain attacks are rising fast‚Äîand your next pip install could be the weakest link. Join our webinar to learn what's really happening, what's coming next, and how to secure your code with confidence. Don't wait for a breach. [Watch this webinar now and take control.](https://thehacker.news/safeguarding-python-supply-chain?source=article).

### What's Really Going On?

Attackers are exploiting weak links in the open-source supply chain. They're using tricks like:

* **Typo-squatting:** Uploading fake packages with names like requessts or urlib.
* **Repojacking:** Hijacking abandoned GitHub repos once linked to trusted packages.
* **Slop-squatting:** Publishing popular misspellings *before* a legit maintainer claims them.

Once a developer installs one of these packages‚Äîintentionally or not‚Äîit's game over.

And it's not just rogue packages. Even the official Python container image ships with critical vulnerabilities. At the time of writing, there are over 100 high and critical CVEs in the standard Python base image. Fixing them isn't easy, either. That's the "my boss told me to fix Ubuntu" problem‚Äîwhen your app team inherits infra problems no one wants to own.

### It's Time to Treat Python Supply Chain Security Like a First-Class Problem

The traditional approach‚Äî"just pip install and move on"‚Äîwon't cut it anymore. Whether you're a developer, a security engineer, or running production systems, you need visibility and control over what you're pulling in.

And here's the good news: you can secure your Python environment without breaking your workflow. You just need the right tools, and a clear playbook.

That's where this webinar comes in.

In this session, we'll walk through:

* **The Anatomy of Modern Python Supply Chain Attacks:** What happened in recent PyPI incidents‚Äîand why they keep happening.
* **What You Can Do Today:** From pip install hygiene to using tools like pip-audit, Sigstore, and SBOMs.
* **Behind the Scenes: Sigstore & SLSA:** How modern signing and provenance frameworks are changing how we trust code.
* **How PyPI is Responding:** The latest ecosystem-wide changes and what they mean for package consumers.
* **Zero-Trust for Your Python Stack:** Using Chainguard Containers and Chainguard Libraries to ship secure, CVE-free code out of the box.

The threats are getting smarter. The tooling is getting better. But most teams are stuck somewhere in the middle‚Äîrelying on default images, no validation, and hoping their dependencies don't betray them.

You don't have to become a security expert overnight‚Äîbut you do need a roadmap. Whether you're early in your journey or already doing audits and signing, this session will help you take your Python supply chain to the next level.
