[Talos 10](/category/talos-10-anniversary/)
[Announcements](/category/announcements/)

With Black Hat just a week away, Cisco Talos is gearing up for another year of heading to Las Vegas to share in some of the latest major cybersecurity announcements, research and news.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Cisco Talos, as the Talos brand was officially launched in August 2014 at Black Hat.

We’re celebrating 10 years of pissing off the bad guys by highlighting Talos moments from the archives and recognizing the folks that make Talos, Talos. Be sure to swing by the Cisco booth in the business hall to celebrate 10 years with us!

We know the week of Black Hat is a busy one, so we’ve pulled together our highlights, so you don’t miss anything:

### Wednesday, Aug. 7

**On the show floor:** Talos will have a demo within the Cisco booth where members of Talos will be available all day long. Talos folks will also be presenting in-booth talks every half hour on their latest research and findings. You can also catch a Talos overview in the Splunk booth.

**Lunch & Learn:** Engage with Cisco Talos Incident Response over "Backdoors & Breaches." Join Joe Marshall and other Talosian game masters from 12:05 to 1:30 p.m. local time in Lagoon KL, Level 2 as they walk attendees through incident response tabletop exercises and learn attack tactics, tools and methods.

**Sponsored Session:** Nick Biasini will be giving a Cisco Talos threat briefing on identity attacks, zero-days, ransomware and infostealers. Join the session in Mandalay Bay I from 3 - 3:50 p.m. local time.

### Thursday, Aug. 8

**On the show floor:** Talos will have a demo within the Cisco booth where members of Talos will be available all day long. Talos folks will also be presenting in-booth talks every half hour on their latest research and findings. In the Splunk booth, Brad Garnett will cover how Talos IR integrates with Splunk.
