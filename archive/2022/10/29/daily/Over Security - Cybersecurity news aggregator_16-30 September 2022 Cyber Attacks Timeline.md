Unsurprisingly, the level of cyber activity continued to be quite sustained even during the second half of September. In this timeline I have collected 140 events, corresponding to 9.33 events per day, a number in line with the previous weeks.

At least one indicator seems to be slowing down, and it is the impact of ransomware that in this timeline accounted for 19.3% of events (corresponding to 27 out of 140). A sharp decrease compared to 27.7% of the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/10/12/1-15-september-2022-cyber-attacks-timeline/).

The impact of vulnerabilities continues to be stable around 11% (precisely 11.4% corresponding to 16 out of 140 events) in line with the previous timeline when it was 10.9%.

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

One of the trends that are characterizing this year from an infosec perspsective is the resurgence of massive hacks against fintech platform, and this timeline was no exception: unfortunately this time it was the turn of the Wintermute platform, which lost the equivalent of $162.2 million.

The situation in Ukraine continues to characterize the cyber space, despite the impact of the events (at least the ones that were discovered) seems to have taken a decreasing trend: Ukraine continued to be the target of multiple operations driven by hacktivism and cyber espionage (for example UAC-0113, linked to Sandworm) but even the pro-Ukraine hacktivists stroke back, for example allegedly breaching a website belonging to the infamous mercenary Wagner group.

And once again, but this is not a novelty at all, the cyber espionage front continued to be pretty crowded, with multiple operations carried out by well-known threat actors such as APT41, APT37, APT28, TA413, and the Lazarus Group, and new groups, such as the mysterious Metador, Witchetty, and UNC3886.

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community.
