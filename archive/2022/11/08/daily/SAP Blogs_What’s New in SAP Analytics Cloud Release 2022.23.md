To learn more about Optimized Story Experience, check out this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/23/optimized-story-experience-in-sap-analytics-cloud-what-you-need-to-know/).

This means thresholds can be added to multiple cells, but cannot be added for both multiple accounts and multiple measures at the same time. Thresholds on a measure with multiple accounts can only be defined via the table.
