# The Fall of Sheikh Hasina: Footage from the Streets of Bangladesh

Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country on Monday, landing by helicopter in India just after lunchtime.

Her dramatic fall from power comes after tens of thousands of protesters gathered on the streets of Dhaka throughout Sunday and early Monday, in defiance of a nationwide curfew, calling on Hasina to resign.

The protests had been building throughout July over plans to reinstate a quota that would have reserved a percentage of government jobs for veterans of Bangladesh’s war of independence.

On Monday morning a near-total internet shutdown was imposed, a tactic that has frequently been used to [try to quell protests](https://www.accessnow.org/press-release/keepiton-restore-internet-during-student-protests-bangladesh/) in the country. Footage revealing how the protests escalated is still emerging as a result.

Yet videos analysed by Bellingcat from the final hours of Hasina’s rule reveal police being outnumbered on the streets of the Bangladeshi capital as protesters took control, with police resorting to firing from the rooftops of several police stations.

We also identified incidents of police [violence against unarmed protesters](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/22/bangladesh-security-forces-target-unarmed-students) and attacks against buildings affiliated with Hasina’s Awami League political party.

## How Hasina’s Control Unraveled

On Friday, August 2, [Netblocks reported](https://x.com/netblocks/status/1820352762871255200) that Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram had been restricted, continuing a pattern of blockages that occurred during earlier protests in July.

Several incidents of violence were reported in northern Dhaka’s Uttara neighbourhood in Sector 11.

Bellingcat identified [protesters running away](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1490096994945769) from police apparently firing tear gas towards them in Sector 11, here: [23.8781591,90.3907882](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6J5g66RXnmEagruF6).

Another video, shot on the same day in the same area, shows police [firing](https://twitter.com/saidul_shogir24/status/1819645728555200634) down the street, less than 200m away from Shaheed Monsur Ali Medical College Hospital.

A third video taken on the same street shows police [thrashing an unarmed civilian](https://twitter.com/moahmed420/status/1819626271392858194). The man is then carried away by two other people.

Bangladesh’s largest national newspaper Prothom Alo reported that [clashes broke out](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/capital/py9syv2xel) after police attempted to break up a planned student march starting from Milestone College in Uttara Sector 11 about 5pm on Friday. Police fired sound grenades, tear gas canisters and rubber bullets at protesters, injuring at least six people.

How it Started: Anti-Quota Protests

Protests began in late July with students taking to the streets to demand an end to the government job quota which reserved 30 percent of jobs for the relatives of veterans who took part in Bangladesh’s war of independence.

The quota made competitive government jobs even more inaccessible to the wider population and students [argued](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/whats-behind-bangladeshs-violent-quota-protests) it favoured supporters of the ruling party.

This policy was previously scrapped in 2018 following widespread [protests](https://www.dawn.com/news/1400659) but was reinstated in [June](https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-student-protests-curfew-government-jobs-quota-107847b2c1bdf4e52dfa0c82f51f3d4a), sparking the latest wave of dissent.

Despite the mostly peaceful nature of the protests, [more than 200](https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-student-protests-hasina-quota-arrests-mourning-e30fc4d7603edad5acacde1c97efbdc0) people, mostly students, were reportedly killed, with [local counts](https://shohid.info/?lang=en) putting the figures much higher.

The use of lethal force by police in response drew widespread [condemnation](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/22/bangladesh-security-forces-target-unarmed-students) from human rights groups, and it marked the most deadly violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.

Despite the [scaling back](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bangladesh-top-court-scales-back-government-jobs-quota-deadly-unrest/) of the quota on July 21, protests continued over police violence and students called for Hasina to resign.

Earlier Incidents of Police Violence

Bellingcat verified footage from a number of incidents of police violence during the July protests, showing unarmed protesters being attacked.

In [footage](https://x.com/ZulkarnainSaer/status/1815815527698153811) (Warning: Graphic content) from Dhaka’s Jatrabari neighbourhood, coordinates [23.705481,90.4448897](https://www.google.com/maps/place/23%C2%B042%2719.7%22N%2B90%C2%B026%2741.6%22E/%4023.705481%2C90.4423201%2C17z/data%3D%213m1%214b1%214m4%213m3%218m2%213d23.705481%214d90.4448897?entry=ttu), a police officer can be seen shooting pellets at an injured student being carried. The protester is left immobile causing the man carrying him to abandon him and flee.

Some posts on social media identify the protester as [Eman Hasan Taim](https://twitter.com/SifayatSamim/status/1816563704273748431), although Bellingcat was not able to independently verify this. Taim, 17, is listed as among the dead by [Shohid](https://shohid.info/), a website compiling a list of those who died in the violence.

Several videos show a vehicle owned by Bangladesh’s elite paramilitary force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), [ramming](https://x.com/towislamm...
