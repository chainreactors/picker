Streamline Your SOC: All-in-One Threat Detection with ANY.RUN

Running a SOC means living in a world of alerts. Every day, thousands of signals pour in; some urgent, many irrelevant. Analysts need to separate noise from real threats, investigate quickly, and keep the organization safe without letting cases pile up.

The challenge isn’t only about detecting threats but doing it fast enough to reduce escalations, avoid burnout, and keep operations efficient.

That’s where an all-in-one detection workflow changes everything. [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=unified_threat_detection&utm_term=020925&utm_content=linktolanding) brings together the tools analysts rely on most; live threat feeds, interactive sandboxing, and instant lookups, into a single, streamlined process. The result: faster answers, fewer escalations, and more confidence in every decision.

## Why Fragmented Workflows Slow SOCs Down

It’s not the flood of alerts alone that puts SOCs under pressure but the fractured way they’re handled. One tool for threat feeds, another for detonation, a third for enrichment. Every time an analyst switches context, minutes are lost. Multiply that across hundreds of alerts, and the delays add up fast.

The bigger problem is what those delays cause: escalations that didn’t need to happen, senior staff tied up with routine checks, and threats that linger longer than they should. Instead of building momentum, investigations stall.

This is the hidden cost of disconnected tools. They don’t only slow analysts down but also create more work for everyone and open the door to mistakes.

## From Chaos to Clarity: The Power of Unified Workflow

When detection runs as one continuous workflow, every step strengthens the next. Instead of losing time hopping between tools, analysts work with a steady flow:

* **Noise gets filtered early:** Live feeds rule out known threats, reducing case load by **up to 20%** and cutting unnecessary escalations by **30%**.

* **Investigations move faster:** The sandbox reveals hidden behavior in real time, lowering MTTR by as much as **21 minutes per case**.

* **Decisions are backed by context:** Lookups provide history from millions of past analyses contributed by **15,000+ organizations**, giving analysts 24× more IOCs to work with and ensuring every case is backed by evidence.

| The result is measurable: |
| --- |
|  |
| --- |
| +62.7% more threats detected overall |
| 94% of surveyed users report faster triage |
| 63% year-over-year user growth, driven by analyst efficiency |
| 30% fewer alerts require escalation to senior analysts |

The outcome of this unified workflow is speed, clarity and confidence. Analysts know what to act on, what to ignore, and when a case can be closed without doubt.

## Threat Feed: Cut Through the Noise

The first challenge in any SOC is deciding which alerts deserve attention. With live IOC streams collected from thousands of users worldwide, [ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=unified_threat_detection&utm_term=020925&utm_content=linktofeeds) works as your early filter. Analysts see instantly whether an IP, domain, or hash has already been confirmed as malicious and can rule out duplicates on the spot. That means less time wasted on “non-issues” and more focus on real threats that matter.

Every IOC in the feed is **actionable and connected to sandbox analyses**, giving analysts not just a red flag but the full context behind it. This means faster triage, more confident decisions, and the ability to trace threats back to their behavior in real-world samples.

The numbers speak for themselves: with [Threat Feed](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-in-ti-feeds/) and Lookup combined, analysts gain access to **24× ...
