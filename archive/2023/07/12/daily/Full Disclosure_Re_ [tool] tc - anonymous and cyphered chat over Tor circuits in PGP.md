```
I didnt see worst than this app to use for anonymity like this one:

- PGP is old bad stuff:

https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/OpenPGP#Issues_with_PGP
```

- RSA/DSA old as well and has tons of security issues like side channel
and timing attacks..etc (the researches about them everywhere)

```
use Post-Quantum cryptography or at least ECC.
```

- C code is again old and insecure (memory issues..etc), should be
replaced with Rust

```
so yeah nice idea but trash work.
```

Alternatively the concept already exist check Ricochet v2 (Ricochet
Refresh):

```

Thx!
