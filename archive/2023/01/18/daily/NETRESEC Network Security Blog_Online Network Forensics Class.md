## [Online Network Forensics Class](/?page=Blog&month=2023-01&post=Online-Network-Forensics-Class)

I will be teaching two live online network forensics classes this spring,
one in March and one in April.
The March class is adapted to American time
and the April one is adapted to European time.
Both classes focus on doing network forensics in an incident response context.

The training is split into four interactive morning sessions,
so that you have the afternoon free to either practice what you learned in class or do your “normal” day job.
The number of attendees will be limited in order to enable attendees to ask questions
or even cover short ad-hoc side tracks.
We plan to accept 10 to 15 attendees per class.
The class registration will be closed once we reach this attendee limit.

* **🇺🇸 March 20-23, 2023: PCAP in the Morning US**

  ⏲️ Time: 9:30 AM to 1:30 PM EDT
  💸 Price: $1,000 USD per student
* **🇪🇺 April 17-20, 2023: PCAP in the Morning Europe**

  ⏲️ Time: 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM CEST
  💸 Price: € 950 EUR per student

We will be analyzing a unique 30GB PCAP data set captured during June 2020
on an Internet connected network with multiple clients, an AD server, a web server,
an android tablet and some embedded devices.
As you’ve probably guessed, the capture files contain traffic
from multiple intrusions by various attackers, including APT style attackers and botnet operators.
The initial attack vectors are using techniques like exploitation of web vulnerabilities,
spear phishing, a supply chain attack and a man-on-the-side attack!

See our [training page](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Training) for more info about the “PCAP in the Morning” classes.

To sign up for a class, simply send an email to sales@netresec.com with the class dates,
your name and invoice address.
We will then send you a PayPal payment link that you can use to complete your training registration.

Hope to see you there!
