# Meet Burp Suite DAST: A clearer name for the industry's leading DAST solution

**[Burp Suite Enterprise Edition](/burp/enterprise) has a new name: [Burp Suite DAST](/burp/dast)**.

This new name better reflects what the product truly is: the most accurate, scalable solution for automated [dynamic application security testing](/burp/application-security-testing/dast), trusted by thousands of enterprises across the globe. And while the name has changed, everything that makes it the industry's leading DAST solution remains the same.

We announced this change to over 7000 AppSec professionals at a recent webinar, along with our broader vision for the future of application security.

## Why the rename?

If you've ever seen the name Burp Suite Enterprise Edition and thought it was just a different license tier for [Burp Suite Professional](/burp/pro), you're not alone. We repeatedly found that organizations evaluating DAST solutions were unaware that we offered one. In some cases, customers began the procurement process thinking they were buying a multi-user, enterprise-scale package for Burp Suite Professional.

The new name, **Burp Suite DAST**, makes it immediately clear what the product does, and where it fits into the modern AppSec stack. Whether you're evaluating DAST solutions to bolster your broader security strategy, or looking to expand your existing automation into your [CI/CD](/developers/ci-cd-security) pipelines, Burp Suite DAST has you covered.

## Already a customer? Nothing changes.

If you're already using Burp Suite Enterprise Edition, your experience will continue uninterrupted:

* Your license and user experience remains unchanged.
* You still have access to the same expert support channels.
* Burp Suite DAST is still powered by the same best-in-class scanning engine as Burp Suite Professional, the gold-standard toolkit for web app and API security testing, trusted by over 17,000 organizations, including SAP, Microsoft, and Mastercard.

## Evaluating DAST solutions? Time to take a fresh look.

While this is just a name change for now, it marks the beginning of a big year for Burp Suite DAST and the wider Burp Suite ecosystem. This has already seen major enhancements to API scanning, including support for Postman Collections and dynamic authentication, as well as improved scalability and issue management capabilities. We've got more on the horizon that will take these capabilities even further.

If you're evaluating DAST solutions in 2025, now's the perfect time to take a fresh look at what Burp Suite DAST has to offer.

## Built for scale. Trusted for accuracy.

The scanner is the most critical component of any DAST solution, and Burp Suite's scanner is second to none.

Other vendors offer DAST as part of a vast portfolio of AST solutions. It's a minor part of their offering, and prioritized as such. In fact, it's often just a subpar, open-source scanning engine repackaged with a new logo.

At PortSwigger, we specialize in DAST.

This isn't a checkbox solution. We believe that, when it comes to security, depth and accuracy matter. Burp Suite DAST is built on the same industry-leading scanner that we've refined over decades. It's also been battle-hardened through real-world feedback from thousands of AppSec professionals across the globe. We built it ourselves, maintain it ourselves, and will continue to ensure it remains the best possible DAST scanner for the modern web, at any scale.

That means:

* **Results you can genuinely trust**, with unmatched accuracy and exceptionally low false positives.
* **Deep support for modern web technologies**, including reliable handling of HTTP/2, WebSockets, and JavaScript-heavy SPAs, as well as native support for scanning REST and SOAP APIs.
* **Scanning at scale for vulnerabilities others miss**, developed in collaboration with the world-renowned PortSwigger Research team.

## Seamless synergy with your manual testing workflows

Your manual testers are almost certainly using Burp Suite Professional already, so adopting Burp Suite DAST is frictionless.

The two products speak the same language; scan configurations, issue categories, and authentication flows are consistent across both. That means you can scale your testing without retraining your team or mapping outputs between tools.

## Integrates everywhere you need it

With flexible deployment options, includi...
