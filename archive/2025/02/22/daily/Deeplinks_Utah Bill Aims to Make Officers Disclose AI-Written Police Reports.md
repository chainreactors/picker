A bill headed to the Senate floor in Utah would [require officers](https://www.popsci.com/technology/utah-ai-police-bill/) to disclose if a [police report was written by generative AI](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports). The bill, [S.B. 180](https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0180.html), requires a department to have a policy governing the use of AI. This policy would mandate that police reports created in whole or in part by generative AI have a disclaimer that the report contains content generated by AI and requires officers to legally certify that the report was checked for accuracy.

S.B. 180 is unfortunately a necessary step in the right direction when it comes to regulating the rapid spread of police using generative AI to write their narrative reports for them. EFF will continue to monitor this bill in hopes that it will be part of a larger conversation about more robust regulations. Specifically, Axon, the makers of tasers and the salespeople behind a [shocking amount of police and surveillance tech](https://www.vice.com/en/article/axon-acquires-fusus-ai-surveillance-retail-healthcare/), has recently rolled out a new product, [Draft One](https://www.police1.com/police-products/police-technology/software/report-writing/revolutionizing-police-report-writing-axons-draft-one-transforms-the-tediou...
