Updated A trio of men have pleaded guilty to running a multifactor authentication (MFA) bypass ring in the UK, which authorities estimate has raked in millions in less than two years.

Callum Picari, Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan, and Aza Siddeeque have each [admitted](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/website-operators-promised-fraudsters-profit-within-minutes-if-they-subscribed-to-illegal-service) to responsibility for running OTP.agency, an underground operation that provided cybercriminals with access to tools to help them socially engineer targets, bypass MFA, and ultimately steal money from victims' bank accounts, according to the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA).

For as little as £30 ($39) a week, the crew offered MFA bypass tools for banks like HSBC, Monzo and Lloyds, while an elite-level plan for £380 ($498) per week also "granted access to Visa and Mastercard verification sites," NCA noted. That said, the agency stressed in a note to *The Register* that in "no way were Mastercard or Visa’s systems compromised as a result of this criminality."
