# Minecraft fans beware: Players and servers at risk from BleedingPipe vulnerability

Posted: August 2, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Minecraft players interested in [modding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding) are [potentially at risk of compromise](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-exploit-bleedingpipe-rce-to-target-minecraft-servers-players/). A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in certain Minecraft mods allows for malicious commands on both servers and clients. The vulnerability, named [BleedingPipe](https://blog.mmpa.info/posts/bleeding-pipe/), allows attackers to take over a targeted server.

Minecraft modding is immensely popular, with a potentially huge number of servers in the wild doing their own thing. There’s a custom game type or world state for everybody.

The problem is that so many of them have been set up in a way which allows for this vulnerability to take hold. As Bleeping Computer notes, the compromised servers are only the first link in the chain. With the server taken over, attackers can then turn their attention to the players inhabiting those servers.

They [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) the issues residing in the mods used by the people playing, which permits them to make malicious installations on their PCs. Given that Minecraft has [around 140 million monthly active players](https://www.searchlogistics.com/learn/statistics/minecraft-user-statistics/#:~:text=Minecraft%20Key%20Statistics,-Minecraft's%20growth%20made&text=Minecraft%20has%20over%20140%20million,revenue%20in-game%20sales%20alone), this isn’t great news. While a lot of them are playing on console and so not susceptible to Windows [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), a huge modding base exists in PC land.

From the Minecraft security (MMPA) article [highlighting details of the attack](https://blog.mmpa.info/posts/bleeding-pipe/):

> BleedingPipe is an exploit being used in the wild allowing FULL remote code execution on clients and servers running popular Minecraft mods on 1.7.10/1.12.2 Forge (other versions could also be affected), alongside some other mods.
>
> This is a vulnerability in mods using unsafe deserialization code, not in Forge itself.

The article goes on to list some of the affected mods, and it’s worth noting that this list is by no means exhaustive:

> EnderCore (dependency of EnderIO). The GT New Horizons fork has been fixed, and the original has been as well, but EnderIO’s minimum versions has not yet been updated.
>
> LogisticsPipes. This has once again been fixed in GT New Horizons version as of July 25, 2023, and the original is fixed since version 0.10.0.71. MC 1.12 versions are not affected. If you have played on a server with a vulnerable version, assume you are infected.
>
> The 1.7-1.12 versions of BDLib. Once again, GTNH fork has this fixed, but the developer of the original currently does not plan to fix it. Assume you are infected if you have played on a server and are not on the GTNH fork.
>
> Smart Moving 1.12
>
> Brazier
>
> DankNull
>
> Gadomancy

The article also claims a similar issue was [first reported back in 2022](https://github.com/bdew-minecraft/bdlib/issues/57). After having been addressed, this problem has resurfaced in various forms and impacting several mods along the way. The individuals behind the attack have “scanned all Minecraft servers...
