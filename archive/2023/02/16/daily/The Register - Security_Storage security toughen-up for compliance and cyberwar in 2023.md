Sponsored Feature Cybercriminals tend not to discriminate when it comes to the type of data they steal. Structured or unstructured, both formats contain valuable information that will bring them a profit. From a cybersecurity practitioner's perspective, however, structural state presents specific challenges when it comes to storing and moving sensitive data assets around.

Generally speaking, structured â€“ quantitative â€“ data is stored in an organized model, like a database, and easily read and manipulated by a standard application.

Unstructured â€“ qualitative â€“ data can be harder to manipulate and analyze using standard data processing tools. Typically, it's stored in orderly but unorganized ways, sliced across silos, applications, and access control systems, without formalized information about its state or location.
