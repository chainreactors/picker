## 2020

Back in 2020 I started getting [emails from NASA](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/17/curl-supports-nasa/) asking for details and specifics about curl’s origins and in particular about where contributors to the project works, and I first replied eagerly trying to be helpful, but over time I kept receiving very similar emails from other NASA departments.

## 2021

It puzzled me, and out of frustration I posted this tweet in April 2021. A tweet that received a lot of attention and more than 3,000 likes.

## 2023

In a closing keynote at the FOSDEM 2023 conference, Dr. Steve Crawford did a talk titled NASA and Open Source Software ([video](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2023/Janson/nasa.mp4), [slides](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/nasa/attachments/slides/5829/export/events/attachments/nasa/slides/5829/FOSEM_NASA_OSS.pdf)).

Some 24 minutes in, on slide 28, Dr Crawford shows a screenshot of the above tweet and talks about NASA’s use of curl, and says that piece I quoted at the top.

I *was* at the FOSDEM 2023 conference, but unfortunately I had to skip the last hour of presentations so I had *just* left the campus when this talk was held.

It would have been a blast to have been present in the room at that time. Now I instead got an avalanche of messages from friends and acquaintances who notified me about this talk and mention of me, which was of course also fun.

## Takeaway

I’m glad NASA is aware of some of their problems and that they listen. It is a comfort that my text was taken with the right attitude. It also feels good that I used the correct tone in that Tweet: I figure it is rarely someone’s actual desire to appear clumsy or bureaucratic, but organizations and companies can easily get trapped in processes that still make them act that way.

## Credit

As a celebration of NASA, [the top image](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2023/106/01GQ2TJ92FQK45MY7JEYKWS834?Type=Observations) is taken by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and features the central region of the Chamaeleon I dark molecular cloud, which resides 630 light years away.

Of course, I use a lame downscaled version.
