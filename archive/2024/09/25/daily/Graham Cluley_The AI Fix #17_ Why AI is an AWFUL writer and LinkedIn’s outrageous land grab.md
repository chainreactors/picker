In episode 17 of The AI Fix, our hosts meet the worst newsreaders in the world, Graham learns about Big Trak and is shocked by a food delivery robot, Mark explains why he won‚Äôt be dressing as a pirate, ChatGPT angelically removes a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR, and everyone thinks they‚Äôve got Ebola.

Graham explains how his career in fashion came to an end, LinkedIn morphs into a feather-duster-wielding polyphase avatron with an insatiable appetite for B2B sales, and Mark delves into the intricate tapestry of terrible AI writing.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
