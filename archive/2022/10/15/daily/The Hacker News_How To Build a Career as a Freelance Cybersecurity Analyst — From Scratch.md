With each passing year, the cybersecurity threat landscape continues to worsen. That reality makes cybersecurity analysts some of the most sought-after technology professionals in the world. And there are nowhere near enough of them to meet the demand. At last count, there were over [3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs](https://fortune.com/education/business/articles/2022/06/30/companies-are-desperate-for-cybersecurity-workers-more-than-700k-positions-need-to-be-filled/) worldwide — and that number is still growing.

The situation means that it's a great time to become a cybersecurity analyst. What's more, the skyrocketing demand means it's possible to start a lucrative freelance career in the field and take complete control over your professional future. Here's a start-to-finish guide on how to do exactly that.

## Start With the Right Training

The first step on the path to becoming a freelance cybersecurity analyst is to acquire the necessary skills. For those without an existing technology background, the best place to start is with a cybersecurity bootcamp. They're designed to get newcomers up to speed with basic cybersecurity concepts and skills in the shortest possible time.

A great place to start your search for the right course is [Bootcamps.org](https://bootcamps.org/). They maintain an active directory of both free and paid bootcamp programs in a variety of technology fields, including cybersecurity. Depending on your preexisting familiarity with computing concepts, you may also wish to enroll in a more generalized computing bootcamp to get started.

Your goal is to emerge from these programs with a working knowledge of the following concepts:

* Networking architecture and design
* Networking, routing and switching hardware and systems
* Firewalls and packet sniffing systems
* Threat detection and analysis methods
* Common network and software vulnerability types

## Earn One or More Cybersecurity Certifications

The next thing you'll need to do is to earn one or more cybersecurity certifications to demonstrate your abilities to would-be employers. The best approach is to begin with a general cybersecurity certification. You can always earn a more specialized certification later in your career after you gain experience and figure out which aspects of the job you excel at. The most popular general cybersecurity certifications include:

* [Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP)
* [Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa)
* [Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism)
* [CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security)
* [Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/)

Earning any one of the above certifications will give you the credentials you need to qualify for thousands of already-existing open positions. At the time of this writing, there are over 200,000 active job listings for holders of the above certifications on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Simply Hired alone. In other words — you'll be ready to join the ranks of professional cybersecurity analysts the moment you've earned one of them.

## Gameplan to Gain Experience

Even though it's possible to get some cybersecurity analyst jobs with nothing but the right certifications and an artfully-worded resume — that will only get you so far. Although it's reasonable to take on an entry-level cybersecurity position to gain some experience at this stage, there are also some other strategies you can use to speed up the process.

One of them is to explore resources like TryHackMe.com. It's a site with real-world hacking simulations that you can use to get some hands-on experience with the kinds of situations you'll face as a cybersecurity analyst. It's an excellent way to build some experience without any risk.

Another strategy you should consider is to attend as many [hackathons](https://www.hackerearth.com/hackathon/) as you can. Those will give you a front-row seat to see how the best of the best in cybersecurity approach their work. And, they make for excellent networking opportunities that you'll need to prepare yourself to go freelance later.

At this stage, you should also set yourself up with accounts on all of the major cloud providers like Google, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure. This will allow you to build technology stacks on each platform and familiarize yourself with their settings and features. The majority of businesses in the world today have at least some exposure to one or more of those platforms. Understanding them from a cybersecurity perspective will improve your marketability as a freelance cybersecurity analyst.

## Take On Small Paid Jobs

When you feel comfortable enough in your skill set and experience level to consider transitioning into freelance roles, you should start small. This means taking on some paid cybersecurity jobs through sites like Fiverr and Upwork. You should begin by offering your services in specific areas that your existing experience supports. So, if you feel comfortable conducting penetration testing of a particular app or platform, start there.

The idea is for you to establish yourself as a reliable service provider on those sites. Although it may not seem like you're getting far — after all, freelance sites aren't where the real money is — you'll be building up a reputatio...
