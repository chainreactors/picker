## Top Malware Types in Q3 2024

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Malware-types-Q3-2024-2-1024x576.jpg)

Let’s take a closer look at the most common malware types identified by ANY.RUN’s sandbox.

* [Stealer](https://any.run/malware-trends/Stealer): 16,511
* [Loader](https://any.run/malware-trends/loader): 8,197
* [RAT](https://any.run/malware-trends/rat): 7,191
* [Ransomware](https://any.run/malware-trends/Ransomware): 5,967
* [Miner](https://any.run/malware-trends/miner): 3,880
* [Keylogger](https://any.run/malware-trends/keylogger): 3,172
* [Backdoor](https://any.run/malware-trends/backdoor): 811
* Installer: 640
* [Trojan](https://any.run/malware-trends/trojan): 507

Compared to [Q1](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-q1-2024/) and [Q2](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-q2-2024/) of 2024, the ANY.RUN sandbox saw a significant increase in the detection of malware in Q3. A major reason for this is the growing number of [public samples](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=q3_2024_report&utm_term=221024&utm_content=linktoservice) being uploaded by our 500,000-strong community of security analysts. Our team is also continuously [improving](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/release-notes-september-2024/) the service’s capabilities, resulting in broader threat coverage.

### Top malware types: highlights

In Q3, Stealers were the most common malware type detected, returning to the first spot since the [start of the year](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-trends-q1-2024/) after falling to the fourth place in Q2. They saw a serious rise in detections, reaching 16,511 in Q3.

Loaders maintained a strong presence, securing the second position for another quarter in a row. Their detections have seen a 49% rise from 5,492 to 8,197.

After leading in Q2, RATs dropped to the third spot, with 7,191 detections.

Trojan and Installer malware experienced a substantial decrease, shedding 3,704 and 2,466 detections correspondingly. Ransomware increased by 3,021, indicating a rise in this type of threat.
