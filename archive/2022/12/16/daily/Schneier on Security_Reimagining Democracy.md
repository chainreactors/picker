## Recreating Democracy

Last week, I hosted a two-day [workshop on recreating democracy](https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022).

The idea was to bring together people from a variety of disciplines who are all thinking about different aspects of democracy, less from a “what we need to do today” perspective and more from a blue-sky future perspective. My remit to the participants was this:

> The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today? Would it even be democracy­—what comes after democracy?
>
> Some questions to think about:
>
> * Representative democracies were built under the assumption that travel and communications were difficult. Does it still make sense to organize our representative units by geography? Or to send representatives far away to create laws in our name? Is there a better way for people to choose collective representatives?
> * Indeed, the very idea of representative government is due to technological limitations. If an AI system could find the optimal solution for balancing every voter’s preferences, would it still make sense to have representatives­—or should we vote for ideas and goals instead?
> * With today’s technology, we can vote anywhere and any time. How should we organize the temporal pattern of voting—­and of other forms of participation?
> * Starting from scratch, what is today’s ideal government structure? Does it make sense to have a singular leader “in charge” of everything? How should we constrain power­—is there something better than the legislative/judicial/executive set of checks and balances?
> * The size of contemporary political units ranges from a few people in a room to vast nation-states and alliances. Within one country, what might the smaller units be­—and how do they relate to one another?
> * Who has a voice in the government? What does “citizen” mean? What about children? Animals? Future people (and animals)? Corporations? The land?
> * And much more: What about the justice system? Is the twelfth-century jury form still relevant? How do we define fairness? Limit financial and military power? Keep our system robust to psychological manipulation?

My perspective, of course, is security. I want to create a system that is [resilient against hacking](https://www.schneier.com/books/a-hackers-mind/): one that can evolve as both technologies and threats evolve.

The format was one that I have [used before](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/05/security-and-human-behavior-shb-2022.html). [Forty-eight people](https://www.schneier.com/iword/guestbook/) meet over two days. There are [four ninety-minute panels](https://www.schneier.com/iword/agenda/) per day, with six people on each. Everyone speaks for ten minutes, and the rest of the time is devoted to questions and comments. Ten minutes means that no one gets bogged down in jargon or details. Long breaks between sessions and evening dinners allow people to talk more informally. The result is a very dense, idea-rich environment that I find extremely valuable. (See the first ten comments below for details of the conversations.)

It was amazing event. Everyone participated. Everyone was interesting. (Details of the event—emerging themes, notes from the speakers—are in the comments.) It’s a week later and I am still buzzing with ideas. I hope this is only the first of an ongoing series of similar workshops.

**(International Workshop on Reinventing Democracy) IWORD 2022 Notes**

**Convened by Bruce Schneier at HKS, Dec 7–8, 2022**

**Themes**

* Barriers to more effective democratic systems
  + Larry Lessig: People do not have confidence in the wisdom of
  + Nick Couldry: lack of resonance (ie common horizons) caused by deep inequality and polarizing digital spaces
  + Information disorder and polarization
    - Ryan Calo on the distinction between misinformation
      (incorrect information) and disinformation (a strategy to combine
      information and misinformation toward engaging people in a project
      with a desired outcome).
    - Cory Doctorow: Divisiveness is downstream from
      institutional failure; it’s harder to sow division among
      people who are safe, secure, and prosperous than in people
      clinging to the rung above homelessness.
    - Cory Doctorow: Reject that there’s something magic
      about these platforms. We’ve had massive institutional
      failures that make people not believe anything. We focus a lot on
      the technical mechanics of why people don’t believe
      anything. Ten years ago, my pain specialist wanted me to go on
      opioids. I did my own research and determined that big Pharma was
      conspiring to kill people like me and I was right. The fact that I
      have the same epistemological basis for my healthcare
      decision-making as anti-vaxxers is undertheorized in rooms like
      this one. We leave people in an epistemological void.
  + Language failures
    - Zoe Hitzig: Experts corrupt the language we use to describe
      our social goals.
    - Judith Donath: What kind of relationship do we want to be
      building with the technologies that we have? What is the role of
      truth and lies in how we form groups? Not much human communication
      is in the form of costly signals, but we spend a lot of effort
      establishing trust through individual and tribal/group
      connections. Every word you say comes framed in the context of
      your tribe.
    - Josh Fairfield: Law is the sharpened end of the language we
      use to talk about the world we want to live in together….
      Language evolves between us when we are speaking to another human
      as a function of context. we’re not developing language in
      the way we have been
    - Nils Gilman: Even if fungus cannot speak, we still need
      ways to include their voice—we need experts who are
      equipped, like the Lorax, to speak for the trees. Not necessarily
      scientific experts, could be in...
