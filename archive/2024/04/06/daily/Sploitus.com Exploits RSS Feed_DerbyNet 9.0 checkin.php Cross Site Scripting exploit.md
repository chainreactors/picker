CVE ID: CVE-2024-30924

Description:
A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in DerbyNet version 9.0, specifically within the `checkin.php` component. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to improper handling of the `order` URL parameter. The flaw lies in the way the `order` parameter is embedded directly into a JavaScript variable assignment without adequate sanitization or encoding, making it possible to inject scripts.

Vulnerability Type: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Vendor of Product: DerbyNet - Available on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffpiazza/derbynet

Affected Product Code Base: DerbyNet - v9.0

Affected Component: checkin.php

Attack Type: Remote

Impact: Code execution is possible as a result of this vulnerability.

Attack Vectors:
The XSS vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `order` parameter in the URL. For example:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/checkin.php?order=</script><script>alert(1)</script>`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/checkin.php?order=';alert(1);//`

These attack vectors demonstrate how an attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the user's browser session.
