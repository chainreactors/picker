### Monitoring the Cloud Landscape

Our mission with this project is to provide an always up-to-date and freely accessible map of the cloud landscape for every major cloud service provider.

We've decided to kick things off with collecting SSL certificate data of AWS EC2 and GCP machines, considering the value of this data to security researchers. However, we plan to expand the project to include more data and providers in the near future. Your input and suggestions are incredibly valuable to us, so please don't hesitate to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trick3st) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/7HZmFYTGcQ) and let us know what areas you think we should prioritize next!
