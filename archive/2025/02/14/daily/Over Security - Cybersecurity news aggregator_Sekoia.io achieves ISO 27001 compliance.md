Today, we are pleased to celebrate a major achievement for Sekoia.io with the attainment of the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification.

In this blog post, we’ll explain the journey to this high-end certification.

## **What is ISO/IEC 27001 Certification?**

The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the global benchmark for information security management. It establishes a rigorous framework for the implementation, management, and continuous improvement of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). This certification covers various aspects, including the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, thus ensuring that companies adopt best practices to manage data security risks.:

## **Why is this certification so important to us?**

As a provider of security solutions, we understand the importance of the trust our partners and customers place in us.

For Sekoia.io, this certification materializes our commitment to protecting the sensitive information of our clients while ensuring the robustness of our solutions and the reliability of our procedures.

## **The certification process**

Obtaining such certification is a long-term commitment. At Sekoia.io, it involved a comprehensive review of our information security policies and procedures, training our personnel, a strong commitment from company management, and a rigorous audit carried out by an independent organization.

Our audit approach led us to integrate two scopes into the certification:

Firstly, the Sekoia **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**, which allows us to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of client data entrusted to Sekoia, our internal data, and data exchanged with our suppliers.

Secondly, the **hosting, maintenance, and operation of the Sekoia SOC platform in our PCI-DSS / SecNumCloud qualified region hosted on OVHCloud** [(more information about our regions here](https://www.sekoia.io/en/product/where-your-data-is-hosted/)).

## **Looking to the future**

Obtaining this certification is undoubtedly a significant collective success for Sekoia.io, but it is just another step in our pursuit of excellence in information security. We strive to continuously improve our stance to adapt to emerging threats and maintain relevant information security standards.

For more information on our approach to security and compliance, and to view our official ISO certificate, please visit our [Trust Center](http://trust.sekoia.io).

Sekoia.io thanks all the teams for the hard work that made this possible! We also thank our clients and partners for their trust and support; it helps us grow and obliges us to do better. Together, let’s move towards a more secure future!
