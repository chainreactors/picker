# Violence in the Name of Cows: The 'Animal Welfare' Groups That Beat Up Truck Drivers in India

*This article is a collaboration with Alt News, a non-profit fact-checking website in India. Read the article on Alt News’ website [here](https://www.altnews.in/violence-in-the-name-of-cows-the-animal-welfare-groups-that-beat-up-truck-drivers-in-india/).*

They describe themselves as “cow protectors” or “gau rakshaks” in Hindi. On social media, they often post about carrying out charitable work such as operating [ambulances](https://www.facebook.com/reel/2145921192559883/?s=single_unit&__cft__[0]=AZVbfbd-Ke2n9xHDo4yO5rx4UFoFKJJQ-GgRxW40ttgomIMwc0Qg3anHI1Qs97bJYcxvx4xHL2UidvH_N1_uiklxDbJ6ERIiHXY9t96xpn0gXDqbHf0zB-pxiewFLis4gBuuh8n0wBlX-yHeLAVsxiGqAeny0gtVRu_0B6_aHiAmzlHW-k8_gBlW1jjDVJbEqG37bwKIRlmuUOqgACqbnFA2&__tn__=H-R) for sick or injured cows, [feeding](https://www.facebook.com/reel/717127174240342/?s=single_unit&__cft__[0]=AZX8HgDOaXTo5DJo6_kjJ2klDcViGKZxitsmJbqtIXbxKtfjZcAlV8DEXH6qqSMwUUXckln-kuATnzGKSNob-VCR05UcAaINvFYTqVNlkWeeUbY4rVN4CIflBJdr3SJkHMH0STA3iPdzo1_xeRfz374dQtW_th2yddmE3IiMcwb6SNrCzMh6_iO88KldAH9kcrQm5hiQgIGkjmyEa_TfUqBk&__tn__=H-R) stray animals and distributing food to [people](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1227391602442802).

But in the dark of the night, their work takes on a more [violent edge](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/world/asia/india-religious-violence-muslims-modi.html). Multiple photos and videos show members of “cow protection” groups chasing, shooting at and beating up truck drivers they claim are “smuggling” cows for slaughter.

Cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, the [dominant religion](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/09/21/key-findings-about-the-religious-composition-of-india/) in India. Many states in the country prohibit the slaughter of cows and [have strict laws](https://cjp.org.in/cow-slaughter-prevention-laws-in-india/) on the transportation, sale and purchase of cattle. These laws have become more stringent since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came into power in 2014.

The vigilantes attacking truck drivers tend to be closely [aligned with](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-66380406) hardline Hindu nationalist organisations, and a [majority](https://www.wired.com/story/cow-vigilantes-india-instagram/) of their victims are Muslims. And while they claim to be doing this for the sake of the cows, in some of the videos the animals can also be seen injured from vehicles overturning during aggressive chases.

Elaine Pearson, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, told Bellingcat that cow protection has become part of the political agenda of leaders of the BJP and in some cases they have backed the alleged actions of the suspects “while the police have failed to take action against them”.

Bellingcat and our partners at the Indian outlet Alt News found videos on social media showing violent assaults by members of five self-described animal welfare groups, mainly operating in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana where incidents involving [cow-related violence](https://www.firstpost.com/india/uttar-pradesh-records-69-of-cow-related-violence-cases-since-yogi-adityanath-took-charge-situation-has-deteriorated-across-india-5674771.html) have frequently been [reported](https://cjp.org.in/november-2024-surge-in-cow-vigilantism-rising-violence-and-legal-apathy-in-north-india/).

*(Editor’s note: We are not sharing links to these videos to avoid amplifying content depicting violent attacks seemingly targeting minority groups. However, if you are a journalist or researcher interested in obtaining this dataset, please email* [*[email protected]*](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f89196898d918a919d8bb89a9d949491969f9b998cd69b9795)*.)*

Some of the leaders of these vigilante groups, when we reached out to them, claimed that they were working closely with the local police. One even received an [award](https://www.facebook.com/bharat.gautam.3388/posts/pfbid0xKRTUfGd1uE4m9aDi5DoV3gM6XbERVCkuSQF5HGWHKiyn2zJfAkrYh3BY7vsMDFSl) for “cow and social service” from a cabinet minister, alongside police officers. Senior police officers from the districts that these groups operate in did not answer questions about alleged police support for the cow vigilantes when we could reach them.

While these groups most likely only represent a small fraction of the “cow vigilantes” in India, who have been reported on by the [media](https://www.dw.com/en/india-vegetarian-nationalist-hindu-fundamentalists-wage-campaign-against-butchers/a-65249032) and [human rights groups](https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/02/19/violent-cow-protection-india/vigilante-groups-attack-minorities) in the country [for years](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/in-the-name-of-the-mother), our investigation sheds more light on how they informally work together to carry out mob violence against truck drivers.

## Akhil Bharatiya Gau Seva Samiti (ABGS)

In a video uploaded in February this year, several men in cars are seen chasing a truck down a highway at night. A man from one of the cars pulls out a shotgun and fires at the truck. Police sirens can be heard in the background but law enforcement does not appear to interfere.
