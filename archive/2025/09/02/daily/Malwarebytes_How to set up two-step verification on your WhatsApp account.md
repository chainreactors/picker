# How to set up two-step verification on your WhatsApp account

Posted: September 1, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Two step verification is the name Meta uses for what is generally referred to as [Two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa). 2FA is not fool-proof, but it is one of the best ways to protect your accounts from hackers.

It adds an extra step when logging in, which is a small extra effort for you, but it dramatically boosts your security. WhatsApp 2FA, called Two-Step Verification, requires you to enter a PIN code when registering your phone number on a new device, stopping hackers even if they have your SMS code.

Here’s how to enable 2FA on WhatsApp for Android and iOS.

## How to set up two-step verification for WhatsApp on **Android**

1. Open WhatsApp.
2. Go to **Settings** (you’ll see it if you tap the three dots, usually located in the upper right corner).
3. Tap **Account**.
4. Select **Two-step verification**.
5. Tap **Enable**.
6. Create a unique 6-digit PIN and confirm it.
7. Optionally, you can add your email address to recover your PIN if you forget it.
8. Tap **Save**.

Now, whenever you verify your phone number on WhatsApp and every so often when you open the app, you’ll need the 6-digit PIN.

## How to set up two-step verification for WhatsApp on iPhone or iPad

1. Open the WhatsApp app on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Tap on **Settings** (the gear icon)
3. Tap on **Account**.
4. Select **Two-step verification**.
5. Tap on **Turn on** or **Set up PIN** to begin.
6. Enter a six-digit PIN of your choice, then enter it again to confirm it.
7. Optionally, you can add your email address to recover your PIN if you forget it.
8. Tap **Save** or **Done**.
9. If you added an email, enter the verification code sent to that email to complete the process.

Now, whenever you verify your phone number on WhatsApp and every so often when you open the app, you’ll need the 6-digit PIN.

## **Enable it today if you can**

Even the strongest password isn’t enough on its own. 2FA means a thief must have access to your an additional factor to be able to log in to your account, whether that’s a code on a physical device or a security key. In addition to your password, this makes an account takeover much harder.

We recommend you set up 2FA on all your important accounts, including messaging and social media accounts. Do it today if you get a chance: It only takes a few minutes but can save you from hours or even days of headaches later. It’s currently the [best password advice we have](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/05/the-one-and-only-password-tip-you-need).
