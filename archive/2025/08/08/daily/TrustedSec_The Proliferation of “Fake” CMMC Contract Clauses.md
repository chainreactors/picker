Defense subcontractors may already be seeing CMMC clauses in their contracts, even though the CMMC contracting procedures and contract clause have yet to be finalized (as of this post in August 2025). However, the Department of Defense (DoD) is not currently putting CMMC requirements in contracts, and the clauses that are showing up in contracts today are not legitimate CMMC clauses from the government.

**September 10, 2025 update:** The start date of the CMMC rollout has been announced. Legitimate CMMC contract clauses will start appearing in government contracts on November 10, 2025. See our other post [*A Big Step on the CMMC Rollout Timeline*](https://trustedsec.com/blog/a-big-step-on-the-cmmc-rollout-timeline "https://trustedsec.com/blog/a-big-step-on-the-cmmc-rollout-timeline") for more information on the phases of the CMMC rollout to understand when certain requirements will show up in contracts.

The problem seems to stem from the legal departments within some large defense contractors that decided to get an early start and write their own CMMC compliance clauses to push on their subcontractors. This is not how the CMMC program is supposed to operate and has led to much confusion about CMMC obligations among defense subcontractors.

Legitimate CMMC contract clauses will use very specific language that, once finalized, will be shown in [48 CFR 252.204-7021](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-48/chapter-2/subchapter-H/part-252/subpart-252.2/section-252.204-7021) (better known as [DFARS 7021](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7021-cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-requirements.)). These links currently show the old CMMC 1.0 contract clauses, but the content will be updated when the CMMC 2.0 contract clause is finalized. The proposed new language can be seen in the [DFARS 7021 CMMC contract clause draft](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-18110/page-66338). The full CMMC contract clause text, level, and assessment requirements are only supposed to flow down from the DoD to prime contractors and then down to subcontractors as per [paragraph (d)(1)](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-18110/p-232) of the draft DFARS 7021 clause. Any CMMC contract clause that does not use the final language is not an official DoD requirement.

Illegitimate CMMC clauses often do not define the CMMC level and assessment type required for the contract. Vague statements like “the subcontractor must be CMMC-compliant” are common. A subcontractor that receives a CMMC contract clause without the critical level and assessment type information will have no idea what information (FCI or CUI) they are expected to handle, which set of requirements apply to them ([FAR 52.204-21](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.204-21) Basic Safeguards, [NIST SP 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r2/upd1/final), or [NIST SP 800-172](https://csrc.nist.gov/Pubs/sp/800/172/Final)), and how they are expected to assess their compliance with those requirements (self-assessment, C3PAO assessment, or DIBCAC a...
