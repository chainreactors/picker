Application security testing is a critical component of modern software development, ensuring that applications are robust and resilient against malicious attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and frequency, the need to integrate comprehensive security measures throughout the SDLC has never been more essential. Traditional pentesting provides a crucial snapshot of an application's security posture, but when integrated across the SDLC, it allows for early detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of costly post-deployment fixes and enhancing overall security.

While the specifics for security testing vary for applications, web applications, and APIs, a holistic and proactive applications security strategy is essential for all three types. There are six core types of testing that every security professional should know about to secure their applications, regardless of what phase they are in in development or deployment.

In this article, we will explore these six types of application security testing methods essential to keep your software secure from potential threats while meeting your business and operational requirements. These include:

1. Penetration testing for the SDLC
2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
3. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
4. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
5. Fuzz Testing for APIs
6. Application Security Posture Management (APSM)

## Application Security Testing Methods

There is no doubt that pentesting is a crucial aspect of security testing, but often is a point-in-time assessment that simulates attacks to identify vulnerabilities. In contrast, the other pentesting methods are more integrated into the application development and maintenance processes, providing continuous or more frequent pentesting and scanning assessments, focusing on different aspects of the application lifecycle, and using various automated and manual techniques.

Before we review the six main types of application security testing, organizations often want to understand the difference between these methods and penetration testing. Each of these methods has distinct characteristics and objectives, differing from traditional pentesting in various ways. Here's a quick breakdown of each method compared to pentesting; however, these methods are often integrated or overlap with penetration testing, and all are part of a proactive approach to application security testing at different stages of the development lifecycle.

### 1. Penetration Testing for the SDLC:

Penetration integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) involves conducting security assessments at various stages of the development process. This ensures vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated early, before the application is deployed. Pentesting can be done during design, coding, testing, and deployment phases to continuously assess the security posture of the application.

* Integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to identify vulnerabilities throughout development
* Conducted at various stages (e.g., design, development, testing, deployment)
* Aims to catch and fix vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, reducing the cost and effort of remediation
* Should be an automated, continuous, and iterative assessment compared to traditional pentesting (periodic)

#### Top Three Benefits:

* Early Detection and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities: Identifying security issues early in the SDLC prevents them from progressing to later stages, where they become more costly and difficult to fix.
* Cost Efficiency: Fixing vulnerabilities early in development is less expensive than addressing them post-deployment, saving resources and reducing remediation costs.
* Continuous Improvement and Compliance: Regular pentesting throughout the SDLC promotes continuous security improvements and ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations, building customer trust.

### 2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a type of security testing that analyzes a running application from the outside to identify vulnerabilities. It simulates external attacks to discover security flaws in the application's runtime environment without accessing the source code.

* Tests applications from the outside in, simulating an external attack.
* Performed on running applications without access to source code.
* Focuses on identifying runtime vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
* Provides immediate feedback on security issues during the testing phase.

#### Pentesting:

* May involve both external and internal assessments, including source code reviews
* Can encompass a broader range of attack vectors and techniques
* Less automated and more reliant on the skills and creativity of the human tester

#### Top 3 Benefits:

* Runtime Vulnerability Detection: DAST identifies vulnerabilities that manifest during the application's execution, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* Immediate Feedback: Provides real-time feedback on security issues...
