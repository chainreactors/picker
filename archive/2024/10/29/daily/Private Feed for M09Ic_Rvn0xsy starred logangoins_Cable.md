# Cable

Cable is a post-exploitation tool used for reconnaissance and Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) focused exploitation of an Active Directory environment. This tool was primarily created to learn more about .NET offensive development in an Active Directory context, while hoping to expand my current knowledge and understanding of Active Directory focused offensive security.
