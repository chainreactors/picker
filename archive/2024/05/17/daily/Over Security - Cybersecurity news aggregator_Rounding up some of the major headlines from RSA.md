# Rounding up some of the major headlines from RSA

[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

While I one day wish to make it to the RSA Conference in person, I’ve never had the pleasure of making the trek to San Francisco for one of the largest security conferences in the U.S.

Instead, I had to watch from afar and catch up on the internet every day like the common folk. This at least gives me the advantage of not having my day totally slip away from me on the conference floor, so at least I felt like I didn’t miss much in the way of talks, announcements and buzz. So, I wanted to use this space to recap what I felt like the top stories and trends were coming out of RSA last week.

Here’s a rundown of some things you may have missed if you weren’t able to stay on top of the things coming out of the conference.

**AI is the talk of the town**

This is unsurprising given how every other tech-focused conference and talk has gone since the start of the year, but [everyone had something to say about AI](https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/rsa-2024-ais-growing-influence-amplifies-global-cyber-impact) at RSA.

AI and its associated tools were part of [all sorts of](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-google-threat-intelligence-actionable-threat-intelligence-at-google-scale-at-rsa) [product announcements](https://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-hypershield-our-vision-to-combat-unknown-vulnerabilities) (either to be used as a marketing buzzword or something that is truly adding to the security landscape).

Cisco’s own Jeetu Patel [gave a keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znrX0B6ucqw) on how Cisco Secure is using AI in its newly announced Hypershield product. In the talk, he argued that AI needs to be used natively on networking infrastructure and not as a “bolt-on” to compete with attackers.

U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was the [headliner of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kewgNe8q260), delivering a talk outlining the U.S.’ global cybersecurity policies. He spent a decent chunk of his half hour in the spotlight also talking about AI, in which he warned that the U.S. needed to maintain its edge when it comes to AI and quantum computing — and that losing that race to a geopolitical rival (like China) would have devastating consequences to our national security and economy.

Individual talks ran the gamut from “AI is the best thing ever for security!” to “Oh boy AI is going to ruin everything.” The reality of how this trend shakes out, like most things, is likely going to be somewhere in between those two schools of thought.

An IBM study released at RSA highlighted how headstrong many executives can be when embracing AI. They found that security [is generally an afterthought](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366583496/IBM-study-shows-security-for-GenAI-projects-is-an-afterthought) when creating generative AI models and tools, with only 24 percent of responding C-suite executives saying they have a security component built into their most recent GenAI project.

**Vendors vow to build security into product designs**

[Sixty-eight new tech companies](https://www.ciodive.com/news/secure-by-design-CISA-pledge-/715707/) signed onto a pledge from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, vowing to build security into their products from earliest stages of the design process.

The list of signees now includes Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services and IBM, among other large tech companies. The pledge states that the signees will work over the next 12 months to build new security safeguards for their products, including increasing the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and reducing the presence of default passwords.

However, there’s [looming speculation](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/rsa-2024-cisa-secure-design-pledge-necessary-toothless) about how enforceable the [Secure By Design](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge) pledge is and what the potential downside here is for any company that doesn’t live up to these promises.

**New technologies countering deepfakes**

Deepfake images and videos are rapidly spreading online and pose a grave threat to the [already fading faith many of us had in the internet](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/threat-source-newsletter-sept-14-2023/).

It can be difficult to detect when users are looking at a digitally manipulated image or video unless they’re educated on common red flags to look for, or if they’re particularly knowledgeable on the subject in question. They’re getting so good now that even [targets’ parents are falling for fake videos of their loved ones](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/katy-perry-mom-ai-deepfake-met-gala-photos-1235016526/).

Some potential solutions discussed at RSA include [digital “watermarks”](https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cybersecurity-in-a-race-to-unmask-a-new-wave-of-ai-borne-deepfakes) in things like virtual meetings and video recordings with immutable metadata.

A deep fake-detecting startup was also [named RSA’s “Most Innovative Startup 2024”](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/press-release/reality-defender-named-most-innovative-startup) for its multi-modal software that can detect and alert users of AI-generated and manipulated content. McAfee also has its own [Deepfake Detector](https://www.mcafee.com/el-gr/consumer-corporate/newsroom/press-releases/press-release.html) that it says, “utilizes advanced AI detection models to identify AI-generated audio within videos, helping people understand their digital world and assess the authent...
