Welcome to the first day of Pwn2Own Toronto for 2022. We’ll be updating this blog in real time as results become available. Even though we have an unprecedented number of entries this year, we are going to buy all additional rounds that have entered the competition.  The first winner on each target will receive the full cash award and the devices under test. For the second and subsequent rounds on each target, all other winners will receive 50% of the prize package, however, they will still earn the full Master of Pwn points.

*Results current as of 1030 Eastern*

**SUCCESS** - To start off the competition with a bang, Nettitude was able to execute their Stack-based Buffer Overflow attack against the Canon imageCLASS MF743Cdw in the Printer category. They earn $20K and 2 Master of Pwn points.

**SUCCESS** - Qrious Secure was able to execute 2 bugs (authentication bypass and command injectiong) attack against the WAN interface of TP-Link AX1800 in the Router category. They earn $20K and 2 Master of Pwn points.
