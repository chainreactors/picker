More than a month after 1inch Network [disclosed](https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c) a severe vulnerability in [Profanity](https://github.com/johguse/profanity), a tool to generate vanity (customized) Ethereum addresses, cryptocurrency platforms are still getting hacked and losing funds to a vulnerability everyone told them to take seriously.

The latest platform to add its name to the list of Profanity victims is DeFi platform [FriesDAO](https://twitter.com/friesdao/status/1586455466833739776), which confirmed on Friday that it lost $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency tokens after an attacker took control over one of its smart contracts through "[a profanity attack vector](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKZmj1aeM9iFrdQ7sieUNvh0_UI60worl1lfs5ImXk0/edit)."

FriesDAO joins the likes of [Wintermute](https://metaschool.so/articles/wintermute-hack-profanity/) (which lost $160 million), [QANplatform](https://medium.com/qanplatform/qanx-bridge-wallet-disclosure-analysis-continuously-updated-724121bbbf9a) (lost $2 million), [Indexed Finance](https://www.scorechain.com/blog/profanity-exploit) (lost $3.3 million), and [REFI](https://reimaginedfi.medium.com/refi-security-compromise-post-mortem-b33621272c5a) (lost $300,000).

The Profanity tool allows users to generate Ethereum addresses that contain custom text in the public address. The tool was typically used for branding purposes, to generate addresses that contained a person or company's name, either at the start, middle, or end of the address.

Profanity did this by rotating and computing through millions of private encryption keys until it found one that generated a public Ethereum address of a user's liking.

The user would then take this public address and use it to store funds or smart contracts and use the private key to authenticate themselves as the owner of that address or smart contract.

Explained in layman terms, the Profanity vulnerability allows a threat actor to reproduce this process and determine the private key of a vanity Ethereum address that was generated in the past through the app.

This entire process is pretty fast and simple, [according to reports](https://cryptoslate.com/wintermute-hack-replicated-on-simple-laptop-in-under-48-hours-by-exploiting-profanity-flaw/), and all an attacker has to do is identify vanity addresses on the Ethereum blockchain.

For cryptocurrency platforms, scanning their own infrastructure for vanity addresses should be pretty simple since, well, it's their own infrastructure, and they should know what exactly they are running. But as new hacks come to light, it's apparently something that the cryptocurrency community can't be bothered with these days.

1/ We confirmed that both @paraswap deployer address (0x490ce4616672e93b1c8f5e43aa80312fd73dee8c) and @Curve deployer address(0x07a3458ad662fbcdd4fca0b1b37be6a5b1bcd7ac) are vulnerable to the profanity vulnerability. The private keys can be recovered.

1/ Hi @paraswap ,I heard that you want to see this? your deployer address private key may have been compromised (possibly due to Profanity vulnerability) and funds have been stolen on multiple chains.

### Breaches and hacks

**Amazon server leak:** Amazon said there was a "deployment error" with one of its Amazon Prime analytics servers that was left exposed online without a password for more than two weeks and leaked 215 million entries containing pseudonymized user data. According to [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/amazon-prime-video-server-exposed/), which first reported on the leak, the leaked data contained the name of the show or movie that a user was streaming, on what device it was streamed, Prime subscription details, and network quality.

**Aurubis attack:** Aurubis, the second-largest copper producer in the world, disclosed a [cybersecurity incident](https://www.aurubis.com/en/media/press-releases/press-releases-2022/update-on-cyber-attack-at-aurubis) on Friday in what the company described as "apparently part of a larger attack on the metals and mining industry." The company said the incident didn't impact its production or environmental protection systems at smelter sites.

### General tech and privacy

**Telegram gets a one-day block in Russia:** Russia's telecommunications watchdog, the Roskomnadzor, [blocked Telegram's t.me short URL](https://t.me/kommersant/42174) on Saturday after a copy of a video was uploaded on the platform containing instructions on how Russian soldiers could surrender to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, once deployed in Ukraine. The URL was not in [Roskomnadzor's blocklist](https://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru/) on Sunday, suggesting the block was lifted after only one day.

### Government, politics, and policy

**Liz Truss phone compromised:** The personal smartphone of Liz Truss, the former UK Prime Minister, was compromised by Russian state hackers. According to a [Daily Mail repor](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11368619/Liz-Trusss-personal-phone-hacked-Putins-spies-secret-details-negotiations.html)t, the hack took place over the summer while Truss was still Foreign Secretary, and the incident was suppressed by Boris Johnson's cabinet to maintain her chances at becoming the next Prime Minister. According to the newspaper, the incident was considered so severe that UK security services took Truss' phone and locked it in a secure location. Truss was also forced to change the number she had been using for the last ten years.

**CIA agent under investigation:** The [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-technology-sports-soccer-religion-5af544d34cded38ff4093587d2efa0de) that the FBI started an investigation of Kevin Chalker, a former CIA agent who worked for the Qatar government and allegedly orchestrated a hacking and spying operation against officials from rival soccer federations bidding for the 2022 World Cup.

**Poland and Slovakia:** In a series of DDOS attacks, Pro-Russian hacktivist groups have targeted the IT networks of the Parliaments of Poland and Slovakia....
