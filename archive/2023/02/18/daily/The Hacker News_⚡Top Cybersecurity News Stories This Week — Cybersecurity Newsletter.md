Hey üëã there, cyber friends!

Welcome to **this week's cybersecurity newsletter**, where we aim to keep you informed and empowered in the ever-changing world of cyber threats.

In today's edition, we will cover some interesting developments in the cybersecurity landscape and share some insightful analysis of each to help you protect yourself against potential attacks.

### **1. [Apple üì± Devices Hacked with New Zero-Day Bug - Update ASAP!](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/patch-now-apples-ios-ipados-macos-and.html)**

Have you updated your Apple devices lately? If not, it's time to do so, as the tech giant just released security updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Safari. The update is to fix a zero-day vulnerability that hackers have been exploiting.

This vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-23529, is related to a type confusion bug in the WebKit browser engine. What does this mean? Well, it means that if you visit a website with malicious code, the bug can be activated, leading to arbitrary code execution. In other words, hackers can take control of your device and access all your data.

It's scary to think that simply visiting a website could lead to a security breach. This is why it's essential to keep your devices updated with the latest security patches.

### **2. [Don't Be the Next Victim: ESXiArgs Ransomware üí• Strikes 500+ New European Targets](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/esxiargs-ransomware-hits-over-500-new.html)**

Another expertly-crafted comprehensive coverage by Ravie Lakshmanan.

In a recent discovery by cybersecurity firm Censys, more than 500 hosts have fallen victim to the ESXiArgs ransomware strain. Most of these compromised hosts are located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K., and Ukraine. What's particularly concerning is that Censys found two hosts with ransom notes dating back to mid-October 2022, shortly after ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 reached their end of life.

This means that the attackers behind ESXiArgs have been active for several months, and were able to gain a foothold in these hosts during a time when they were no longer receiving security updates or patches. It also shows that ransomware attacks can take a while to gain traction, and can often go undetected for months before they are discovered.

[![ESXiArgs Ransomware](data:image/png;base64... "ESXiArgs Ransomware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWHcdNdO03x7iDmIqG1kN2pdYwSz-tpg9prFF73IZs19_ylwqtZNo0WLdhpoCGtEhq18Tebv1kWL2DP6c_bIXAe3HpBb6T_ffYaOE6ruyMwZyZL0SZ7-0PJOnaksUWqmF0D4n3cg5v7ucHXC11338i3OerbF1UM-r05-GrHsdXX1GosLI6y9uKUWJH/s790-rw-e365/ransomwaer.png)

What's even more alarming is that the ransom notes on the two hosts were updated on January 31, 2023, with a revised version that matches the ones used in the current wave of attacks. This suggests that the attackers have been refining their tactics and improving their ransomware strain to make it more effective.

Ransomware attacks like ESXiArgs can be devastating for organizations, causing data loss, financial losses, and reputational damage. It's important for organizations to stay vigilant and ensure that their systems are always up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Additionally, having a solid backup and disaster recovery plan can help organizations quickly recover from an attack and minimize its impact.

### **3. [DDoS Attack Breaks Record - 71 Million üòÆ Requests Per Second!](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/massive-http-ddos-attack-hits-record.html)**

Cloudflare, a web infrastructure company, has reported that they have successfully stopped a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. This attack, which peaked at over 71 million requests per second, is the largest HTTP DDoS attack that has been recorded so far, breaking the previous record of 46 million requests per second.

The attack was so large that Cloudflare has dubbed it a "hyper-volumetric" DDoS attack. The attack was targeted at websites that were secured by Cloudflare's platform, and it is believed that the attack originated from a botnet that was made up of more than 30,000 IP addresses from various cloud providers.

This attack is a reminder that DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to websites and online services, and it is crucial for companies to have robust security measures in place to protect against such attacks.
