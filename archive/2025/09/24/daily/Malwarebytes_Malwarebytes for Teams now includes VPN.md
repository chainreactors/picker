# Malwarebytes for Teams now includes VPN

Posted: September 23, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

Running a small business today can hardly be done from a single device, a single location, or a single network.

Staying cybersecure is quite the same.

To extend the security and privacy of small business owners, no matter where you are, Malwarebytes for Teams now includes personal VPN access, for no additional cost, for all registered devices. Whether you’re typing up a draft on your tablet at a café, answering urgent emails from your smartphone at the airport, or just protecting your browsing activity on your laptop, connecting to a personal VPN provides that extra comfort that what you’re doing online is your business and your business only.

With a personal VPN you can:

* Guard your online activity from prying eyes, whether on your laptop, smartphone, or tablet.
* Access information, content, and resources that are typically restricted by location.
* Maintain high speed connections for everything you do.

[VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-vpn) have a bit of a dual reputation right now: They’re either IT tools that help multinational enterprises connect to corporate networks, or they’re covert programs that help paranoid privacy hawks slip by undetected online. The truth is that VPNs are for everyone, and that’s because what they offer is a benefit to all.

VPNs encrypt and protect your online traffic so that eavesdroppers can’t spy on your browsing behavior. This is useful both at public locations and in your office or home, because not all cyber snoops are hackers or criminals. In fact, some of the most active eavesdroppers are Internet Service Providers themselves, that sell consumer data for profit.

VPNs also provide a simple way to connect to an increasingly segmented internet. Despite the name, “the world wide web” can appear quite different when you travel to another country. The streaming platforms you enjoy at home can be blocked, their digital libraries can differ, and [entirely benign resources](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/americans-be-warned-lessons-reddits-chaotic-uk-age-verification-rollout) can be gated behind separate laws. By connecting to any variety of servers through a VPN, you can access the internet you know and rely on, no matter your physical location.

It’s important to remember, however, that a VPN is just one part of a larger cybersecurity strategy. You still need to protect your small business’s devices from malware infections, rogue viruses, shady websites, and online scams.

For those threats, Malwarebytes for Teams also keeps you safe, especially when you’re mobile.
