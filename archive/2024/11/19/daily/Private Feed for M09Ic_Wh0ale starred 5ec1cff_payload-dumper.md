# payload dumper of online

[中文](/5ec1cff/payload-dumper/blob/master/docs/README.zh-CN.md)

This is a modified version of payload dumper that supports the following features in addition to the original features:

1. Extract partitions directly from a zip archive containing payload.bin without unzipping it.
2. Extract partitions directly from a URL (such as an OTA update URL) containing payload.bin from the network without downloading the entire file.
3. Multithreaded downloading and extraction.

With this script, you only need a small amount of time and storage space to extract the partitions you want from the OTA update package ...
