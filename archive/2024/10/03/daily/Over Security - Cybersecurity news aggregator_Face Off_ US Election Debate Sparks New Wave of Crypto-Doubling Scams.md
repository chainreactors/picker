In the wake of the second US presidential election debate between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump (September 10), Netcraft identified a series of crypto investment scams monopolizing on the publicity around this key event.

Our research uncovered 24 crypto-doubling scam domains related to the debate, including 14 phishing websites using the word âdebateâ in their domain, e.g. debatetrump[.]io, tesladebate[.]com, and debate[.]money.

All the examples exploit the image of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, tech entrepreneur and billionaire, Elon Musk, or a blend of both. Criminals likely use these personas to add legitimacy to their crypto investment themeâone political leader, one policy influencer, both conveying the perception of wealth and authority.

Netcraft observed [similar tactics being used in attacks](https://www.netcraft.com/blog/linustechtips-youtube-channels-hacked-to-promote-cryptoscams/) in March, during some of the earlier primary elections. In July, following the assassination attempt of Donald Trump, [others were also discovered](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2520612/trumps-assassination-attempt-exploited-in-new-crypto-doubling-scams.html).

In the lead up to the US presidential election on November 5, we expect to see these kinds of attacks continue. To help brands and internet users act with greater caution during that time, this article analyzes the different variants from this latest, debate-themed scam. It also includes guidance for organizations at risk from similar impersonation of their brand, intellectual property (IP), and executive personas.

## What is crypto-doubling?

Crypto-doubling scams lure victims into transferring cryptocurrency under the false pretence that their investments will be doubled. The perpetrators of these scams commonly use social engineering tactics via email, social media platforms, and messaging apps to coax victims into visiting a phishing website where the fraudulent transaction then takes place.

**Crypto-doubling scams use the following tactics:**

* Promises of **quick returns**, which often emphasize a rapid doubling of the victimâs investment.
* A **sense of urgency** to encourage immediate action.
* **Fake endorsements** that falsely claim support from public figures.
* A **lack of transparency** that withholds any real detail about the scheme.

Crypto doubling leaves harms victims financially and emotionally and impacts customer/voter trust in the brands and personas being imitated.

## Variants

The three crypto-doubling variants identified through our research use similar tactics, but their variances reflect how criminalsâ resource and time investment differs scam to scam. Individually and together, they help us understand the mindset behind this kind of malicious activity in greater depth.

### Variant 1: âElon Musk X Donald Trump Crypto Giveawayâ

![](https://framerusercontent.com/images/wPNr9imfgkj1Aff4zn8EHWN2Ec.png?width=1024&height=523)

*Fig. 1. Above the fold screenshot from the variant 1 website*

In this first example, custom copy (see fig. 2.) and trusted brand logos are used to legitimize the website. The page content is rich, incorporating graphs and diagrams with step-by-step instructions and QR codes linking victims to a payment page.

Although the content itself doesnât directly reference the debate it does use the domain debatetrump[.]io.

Off-brand language and grammatical errorsâcommon telltale signs of fake contentâstill occur across the site, such as, âDonald Trump immersing himself in the world of cryptocurrency to offer a nice gift to cryptoinvestorsâ or simply âCheck instructionâ.

*Fig. 4. (Fig. 2* â *4. Below the fold screenshots from the variant 1 website)*

### Variant 2: âHuge giveaway during Trump and Kamala Debate"

*Fig. 5. Above the fold screenshot from the variant 2 website*

Variant 2 utilizes content assets like those in variant 1. However, it calls out the US presidential election debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris directly in the text (see fig. 5 and fig. 7). It also uses an image featuring Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee.

The page features Elon Muskâs Tesla logo instead of Trumpâs campaign logo, demonstrating how criminals tailor their content to appeal to different audiences, i.e., politically engaged vs cryptocurrency minded.

Unlike variant 1 (and variant 3), variant 2 includes an extra âWhatâs Happeningâ section, providing context on the cryptocurrency âgiveawayâ (see fig. 6).

### Variant 3: âBiggest Crypto Giveawayâ

Variant 3 appears to hot swap personas while retaining the same core content, i.e., a new persona is used, while the other webpage assets remain the same. Netcraft has identified many examples using this approach, which is distinguished by its use of the distinctive hexagonal image frame and stock copy. The only variances in these examples are the target personas (different headshots) and in some cases the page colour and/or appearance (see fig. 10).

In variants both 1 and 2, we observe extra, custom assets (logos, text, diagrams, etc.) being used to provide a theme to the web content....
