## Introduction Part 2b

In this post, we dive deeper into the HOW of vulnerability management. This post is dedicated to the processes to provide a comprehensive overview.

## 1. Processes

Figure 1: Levels [86]

In this chapter, we will have a look at the processes of vulnerability management. The Center for Internet Security defines separate controls for the management process and the remediation process [1, p. 41]. However, this can be even further divided into governance, management and operations. With this view in mind, we will look at the cascade from the WHAT and WHY to the HOW.

The focus is set to the operational processes. However, as governance and management lay the foundation, we will look at them first.

### 1.1 Governance

The governance processes, framed by COBIT‚Äôs Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor (EDM) approach, serve crucial roles in organizational oversight.

**Directing**: The direct aspect involves setting requirements and determining the scope, as well as establishing targets. In my previous post in [part 2a](https://blog.nviso.eu/2025/10/09/vulnerability-management-requirements-scoping-target-setting/), we explored the topics of requirements and scoping, although not from a procedural viewpoint. Moreover, we identified regulatory and legal requirements in [part 1](https://blog.nviso.eu/2025/09/11/vulnerability-management-common-understanding-and-language-enable-teamwork/). A significant focus is on the EDM03 process, which ensures risk optimization concerning the organization‚Äôs holistic risk management approach. This indirectly involves managing vulnerabilities.

**Defining Scope**: Beyond understanding the rationale behind actions, determining the precise scope of work is essential [2, pp. 4-5] . Clear distinctions between in-scope and out-of-scope items must be made to prevent misunderstandings.

**Evaluation and Monitoring**: Evaluation and monitoring processes focus on metrics and reporting [2, pp. 9-10], which were previously covered in [part 2a](https://blog.nviso.eu/2025/10/09/vulnerability-management-requirements-scoping-target-setting/) and align with target-setting strategies. Metrics establish measurable targets and help assess current conditions. Effective communication of ongoing progress, trends, and necessary actions involves reports, dashboards, and meetings.

**Command Chain and Escalation:** Clear definitions of command hierarchy and escalation triggers are essential. While the organisational aspects (including an organisational chart) are addressed in the next blog post, the reporting and alerting aspects are defined in the operational process in this blog post, as it starts there and escalates upwards.

**Defining Roles and Interfaces:** Responsibilities, accountabilities, and interaction with other IT service management disciplines must be explicitly defined.

Typically, these components are documented in policies and standards, with the governance level holding accountability [3, p. 2].

### 1.2 Management

Translating strategic direction into operational procedures involves several key processes: planning and implementing necessary changes via projects, and continuously monitoring operations. According to COBIT, this spans major areas such as Align, Plan, and Organise (APO), Build, Acquire, and Implement (BAI), and Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA). These processes are addressed by area rather than detailed sub-processes.

**Management‚Äôs Role in Operationalizing Strategy:** The management layer must further refine and translate strategic directives from the governance level into actionable tasks to ensure alignment with organizational goals. This includes ensuring all components necessary for successful vulnerability management are planned, prepared, and ready [4] [5].

**Guiding Questions for Refinement:**

* **Actionable Tasks:**¬†What needs to be done to execute the strategy effectively?
* **Detection Approaches:**¬†Should we employ active detection like scanning, utilize passive methods such as source code analysis, tracking third-party libraries for vulnerabilities, or apply penetration testing, and under what circumstances? [6, p. 92]
* **Intelligence Sources:**¬†What sources of vulnerability and threat intelligence should form the basis of our activities and which are essential? [6, p. 92]
* **Disclosure Channels:**¬†How should we facilitate third-party reporting of system vulnerabilities, possibly through Responsible Disclosure [6, pp. 92-93] or Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure programs disclosure [7] [8] [9]? Consider whether establishing a Bug Bounty program is advantageous. [6, p. 92]
* **Intelligence Sharing:**¬†What strategies should be employed for sharing intelligence [6, p. 93] while managing exposure risks?

While, of course, roles, processes and tools depend on what is covered, these need to be defined next.

**Roles:** Depending on the required activities, roles need to be defined, including accountabilities and responsibilities and a hierarchy for reporting and escalations, as well as the required skills and knowledge. Furthermore, it needs to be estimated how many FTE (full time equivalent) are needed for these roles. There is no need for a one-to-one relationship, as one person can have multiple roles, provided they do not conflict with each other. [6, p. 92]

**Processes and Interfaces:**

While the general flow of processes is known, they need to be adjusted to the organisation‚Äôs environment, as they might be different departments, roles and hierarchies.

Furthermore, the interface towards other management disciplines needs to be defined and the required input or support needs to be ensure, e.g. the asset groups with impact assessments [2, pp. 8-9] and/or further details for the risk assessment, and the enrichment [5, p. 2].¬† This also include to analyse potential (inter)dependencies with other parts of performed management disciplines in your organisation.

**Tools and Automation:**

After defining the scope of action a...
