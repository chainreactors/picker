# Weekly Update 459

08 July 2025

New week, different end of the world! After a fleeting stop at home, we're in Japan for a proper holiday (yet somehow I'm still here writing this...) with the first stop in Tokyo. It's like nowhere else here, and this is now probably my 10th trip to Japan over a period of more than three decades. What I think has changed the most in terms of my perceptions of Japan is that back in the 90s, it was just *so* high tech here because we hadn't seen a lot of the stuff that was on the main streets of Tokyo. Now, the world is much more global; we're all using the same phones and watching the same TVs and nobody is talking about the Walkman any more. Same epic food though, and we've been smashing through some amazing dishes ([full pics on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/troyahunt)). The next update will come from Kyoto before we head back to the sunny Aussie winter.
