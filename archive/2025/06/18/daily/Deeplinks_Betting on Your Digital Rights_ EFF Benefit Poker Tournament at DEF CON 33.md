Hacker Summer Camp is almost here... and with it comes the Third Annual EFF Benefit Poker Tournament at [DEF CON 33](https://www.eff.org/event/eff-def-con-33) hosted by security expert [Tarah Wheeler](https://infosec.exchange/%40Tarah).

Please join us on Friday, August 8th, at high noon at our new location: Planet Hollywood Poker Room. The fees haven’t changed; it’s still $250 to register plus $100 the day of the tournament with unlimited rebuys. (AND all players will receive a complimentary EFF Titanium Level Membership for the year.)

Tarah Wheeler—EFF board member and resident poker expert—has been working hard on the tournament since last year! We will have Lintile as emcee this year and there's going to be bug bounties! When you take someone out of the tournament, they will give you a pin. Prizes—and major bragging rights—go to the player with the most bounty pins. Be sure to [register today](https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/event/register?id=497&reset=1) and see lintile in action!

Did we mention there will be Celebrity Bounties? Knock out Wendy Nather, Chris “WeldPond” Wysopal, Jake “MalwareJake” Williams, Bryson Bort, Allan Friedman and get neat EFF swag and the respect of your peers! Plus, as always, knock out Tarah's dad Mike, and she donates $250 to the EFF in your name!
