[Fantastic footage](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-69016403) of a Dana squid attacking a camera at a depth of about a kilometer.

We had a few Cybershow pieces this week, with varing degrees of

An arts related discussion about how AI is changing music. (warning:
long audio 90 mins)

then copied malware to other machines in the family network.

Search is dead (again). My screed on the arrogance of Google thinking
it can just announce thw WWW is over. With some links given by Winter
when I posted this earlier.

**Not the only one**

About gaslighting users. It‚Äôs become almost *de rigueur* to
insult users‚Äô intelligence by gaslighting and isolating them with
claims that they‚Äôre ‚ÄúThe only one‚Äù. Just wait until trecherous
‚Äúpersonalised AI‚Äù gets into this.

And a piece here on how a somewhere I love feels like it‚Äôs been
destroyed by a hostile, giant tech corporation.

Ex-Google CEO says the US and China‚Äôs most powerful AI systems may one day be stored in military bases and surrounded by machine guns
<https://news.yahoo.com/tech/ex-google-ceo-says-us-081234627.html>

‚ÄúFormer Google CEO and chairman, Eric Schmidt thinks that ‚Äúextremely powerful‚Äù AI systems will be heavily guarded by governments in the future.

‚ÄúEventually, in both the U.S. and China, I suspect there will be a small number of extremely powerful computers with the capability for autonomous invention that will exceed what we want to give either to our own citizens without permission or to our competitors,‚Äù Schmidt told Noema Magazine in an interview published Tuesday.

‚ÄúThey will be housed in an army base, powered by some nuclear power source and surrounded by barbed wire and machine guns,‚Äù he added.

Though it may seem far-fetched today, Schmidt‚Äôs prediction could materialize given how competitive countries already are when it comes to maintaining their lead in the AI race.

For instance, the US has exerted a tighter grip on its technology exports to China, limiting the sales of AI chips made by companies like Nvidia.

Likewise for China, which has been working to minimize its reliance on US-made chips. Chinese officials have asked domestic tech giants like Alibaba and TikTok parent company ByteDance to buy locally-made AI chips instead, per The Information.‚Äù

Action Stations! Action Stations! The UK general election was called this week.

Sunak delivered his speech in his expensive bespoke suit outside in the rain. He looked drenched. As he delivered his speech well known EU rejoin campaigner Steve Bray played ‚ÄúThings Can Only Get Better‚Äù at the gates to Downing Street. It doesn‚Äôt come over loudly on the news clip but according to journalists who were outside Number 10 it was very loud.

While ‚ÄúThings Can Only Get Better‚Äù was used by Labour as a campaign track it‚Äôs become more of a national theme tune any time Tories get kicked out. Personally, I‚Äôm voting for a progressive party but I will confess when I heard Sunak was calling the General Election I put the tune on and danced around the room. Like many I don‚Äôt feel elated. I feel exhausted. I also cried a little thinking of all the people the Tories have harmed and lives they have ruined so needlessly.

On an earlier occasion Steve Bray played the Benny Hill theme tune when politicians were giving interviews on College Green near parliament. It really does help to reveal how much BS some of the politicians talk.

This election is expected to be the dirtiest ever. Expect a lot of disinformation and social engineering especially off the Tories. For people on the receiving end of Tory ‚Äúculture wars‚Äù campaigning expect to be a punchbag for the next month. Don‚Äôt forget to look after your mental health!!

Get your champagne in to celebrate the Tories being kicked out and to drown your sorrows if they don‚Äôt.
