  ![Ukraine claims to have hacked secrets from Russia's newest nuclear submarine](https://blogapp.bitdefender.com/hotforsecurity/content/images/size/w600/2025/08/submarine.jpeg "Ukraine claims to have hacked secrets from Russia's newest nuclear submarine")

Ukraine's Defence Intelligence agency (HUR) claims that its hackers have successfully stolen secret files and classified data on a state-of-the-art Russian nuclear submarine, the “Knyaz Pozharsky."

The “Knyaz Pozharsky” is nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine, that was [commissioned into the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet](https://united24media.com/latest-news/russia-deploys-the-knyaz-pozharsky-a-new-nuclear-submarine-built-to-slip-past-nato-defenses-10176) at a shipyard in Severodvinsk during a ceremony overseen by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 24 July 2025.

The submarine features advanced stealth facilities, designed to allow it to slip past NATO defences, as well as significant strike capability.

However, what should have been a show of Russia's naval might has seemingly turned into a major intelligence embarrassment, with HUR sharing images in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/DIUkraine/6547) of it what it claimed were images of sensitive information exfiltrated by the hackers, including comprehensive technical, personnel-related, and operational materials.

The leaked documents reportedly include:

* Combat manuals and daily operational schedules.
* Schematics of the submarine's combat systems, survivability infrastructure, and internal crew hierarchy.
* Protocols for evacuating wounded on-board personnel, cargo transfers, and towing procedures.
* Full lists of crew names, including their positions, qualifications, and physical fitness levels.

One leaked report included images of a damaged communications buoy, complete with comments and signatures from engineers and naval contractors.

According to [media reports](http://thetimes.com/world/russia-ukraine-war/article/ukraine-hacks-russian-submarine-as-moscow-expands-arctic-presence-2tmwc8dn5), the "Knyaz Pozharsky" is a Project 955A Borei‑A class submarine, and one of the most advanced elements of Russia's capability to launch nuclear missiles from land, air, and sea.

According to Ukraine's officials, the leaked information does not just provide intelligence of one vessel, but exposes broader vulnerabilities across the entire fleet with "critical technical shortcomings" revealed of the Borei-A (Project 955A) class submarine.

The implication of the alleged hack is that Ukraine - and potentially its allies - could now have access to sensitive information about Russia's latest nuclear submarines. In addition, Russia will be concerned about its ability to safeguard its most valuable military secrets.

Russian authorities have not issued any statements regarding the alleged security breach, and no Western intelligence agencies or cybersecurity experts have confirmed Ukraine's claims.

But, if true, the alleged hack is the latest in a string of operations that Ukraine has carried out against Russia's strategic assets, including June's ["Operation Spiderweb"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spiderweb), which saw a major drone strike against Russian airfields that succeeding in destroying several aircraft.

News of the submarine leak has come just days after President Donald Trump [ordered two US nuclear submarines to be repositioned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93dgr2dd53o) in response to what he describes as "highly provocative" remarks from Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev.
