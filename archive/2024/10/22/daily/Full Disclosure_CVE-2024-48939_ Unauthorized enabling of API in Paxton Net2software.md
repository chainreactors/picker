CloudAware Security Advisory

CVE-2024-48939: Unauthorized enabling of API in Paxton Net2 software

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
```

Bypass of Paxton Net2 API license. Possible leaking of PII and access to
admin functionality.

```
No physical access to computer running Paxton Net2 is required.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Paxton Net2  (version < 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4))

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================
```

Paxton Net2 software offers an API. This API offers the user access to
sensitive data such as access logs and other

```
user data.[2]
```

In order to enable the API a license file is needed. The license file is
trivial to generate as demonstrated in POC in ref [1].
This is possible while the signature checks in the Net2 software were
not functional for the license file.
Additionally to the license file user credentials are needed to
authenticate against the API.
The vendor has fixed this in version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4) of the Net2
software.

```
========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
Upgrade Paxton Net2 to version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4)

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================
```

1) If an upgrade is not an option - as `anyone' can create valid license
files; ensure that the filesystem of

```
computers running Paxton Net2 are not reachable by unauthorised entities.
```

2) Evaluate the impact of the disclosure of any configurations rolled
out prior to these mitigation steps
