In today‚Äôs world, organizations are increasingly depending on their third-party vendors, suppliers, and partners to support their operations.

This way of working, in addition to the digitalization era we‚Äôre in, can have great advantages such as being able to offer new services quickly while relying on other‚Äôs expertise or cutting costs on already existing processes. However, by opening their (digital) doors to third-parties or by sending them their precious data, organizations are exposing themselves to a broader range of risks. From data breaches caused by third-parties and unauthorized accesses through third-parties to regulatory compliance failures, the organization‚Äôs risk exposure should also factor in third-party security risks.

Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) evolves around the ability for organizations to identify, and remain in control of, the risks that emanate from working with their third-parties. In fact, relying on third-parties comes with a shared responsibility between you and your third-party of which you ultimately bear the end responsibility.

In this very first blogpost, within a series dedicated to TPRM, we‚Äôll introduce TPRM and its key components. In the next blogposts, we will tackle specific topics and address questions you might have on TPRM.

**So, what is Third-Party Risk Management?**

TPRM is the process of identifying, minimizing, and keeping a control on the risks that come from working with third-parties or service providers. In very simple terms, we‚Äôre assessing the maturity of third-parties (e.g. suppliers), in terms of cybersecurity, before signing the contract with them. By ‚Äúthird-parties‚Äù & ‚Äúservice providers‚Äù we aim at any organization which either:

1. Manages any of your sensitive information (e.g. has access to, collects, processes, stores or archives). As example: cloud providers (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), business service providers, etc.
2. Is connected to, or has access to, your internal network or systems. As example: IT services providers, etc.
3. Can impact the reputation of your organization in any other way based on the context of the relationship. As example: A business partner whose services you recommend to your own customers, or a business partner which hosts an internet facing website which is branded with your organization‚Äôs logo.

In building strong TPRM foundations, organizations can minimize risks before they even exist by identifying them before having signed any contract, and by asking the third-party to remediate some of the findings. Through TPRM, an organization can ensure, to some extent, the alignment of their own security requirements across the entire supply chain (whether internal or outsourced). Organizations with a mature TPRM process will also monitor the activities of their third-parties, and regularly reassess the risks.

**Why should we give TPRM the right level of importance?**

![News coverage about third party risk management](https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-30-160244-1024x441.png)

Our introduction so far already provides you with ideas on the importance of Third-Party Risk Management. As we said, organizations become more and more digitally interconnected and reliant on their third-parties Let us stress here the key reasons of the importance of TPRM in your security program:

1. Ensuring Operational Resilience: Whether a third-party has access to your internal systems in order to assist with your organization‚Äôs operation, or whether part of your operations is entirely outsourced to a third-party; an **incident emanating from third-parties can heavily disrupt your activities** and your ability to deliver services.
2. Protecting Sensitive Data: As the exchange of sensitive customer data & intellectual property between organizations increases, so does the risk of **data disclosure**.
3. Managing Reputational Risk: Data disclosures & operational continuity issues, even caused by the mistakes of a third-party, can **impact the reputation** of an organization; leading to loss of business opportunities & customers.
4. Meeting Regulatory Compliance: Many industries are subject to strict regulations and compliance requirements such as the well-known GDPR, the feared NIS2 or DORA. Engaging with non-compliant third-parties can expose organizations to **compliance violations**, fines, and reputational damage. Furthermore, for some industries performing Third-Party Risk Management can be a regulatory requirement on its own.
5. Strengthening Competitive Advantage: As customers‚Äô and partners‚Äô expectations on security are more & more a priority; **organizations which can demonstrate a mature approach to information security**, including third-party risk management, can gain the trust of their customers and stakeholders ‚Äì giving them a **competitive advantage**.

A mature and well maintained TPRM program will make it easy to demonstrate to higher management that this is all under control.

According to [ENISA‚Äôs Threat Landscape (2023)](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2023), Supply Chain Attack/Third-Party Security breaches is one of the top threats to be considered. Does your organization consider it?

**How to build your TPRM framework?**

Based on our experience, we propose a couple of building blocks to structure your TPRM activities.

1. Obtain visibility on all your third-parties.

To start your TPRM efforts, you first need to have an eye on all the third-parties your organization is involved with. A central inventory of your third-parties is a must.

If your organization has a procurement team, they‚Äôll typically alre...
