## An open and shut case, but the perps remain at large – whoever they are

Justice is served… or should that be saved now that audio-visual software deployed in more than 10,000 courtrooms is once again secure after researchers uncovered evidence that it had been backdoored for weeks.

The incident is being treated as a suspected supply chain attack at Justice AV Solutions (JAVS) by researchers at security shop Rapid7, which launched an investigation following an alert in a customer's MDR solution.

JAVS is a Kentucky-based software vendor that specializes in developing apps for use in courtrooms, prisons, and lecture theaters, among others. One of its installers is believed to have been poisoned by an unknown attacker and anyone running JAVS Viewer v8.3.7 should probably spring into action right away.
