Cyberattacks documented throughout this year have shown an increasing interest in targeting global governments and agencies. Fraught with hit after hit, governing bodies were not spared by [ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransoms-without-ransomware-data-corruption-and-other-new-tactics-in-cyber-extortion/) operators in 2022 even though, out of all other sectors, they are least likely to pay out ransom demands.

Threat actors are typically driven by financial gain, but with many states considering no-ransom bills and official directives from the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/ransomware) reminding governments to refrain from paying ransom demands, what could be the motives behind the rise in public sector-focused attacks?

This blog post explores why more cyber [attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/from-the-front-lines-3-new-and-emerging-ransomware-threats-striking-businesses-in-2022/) are directed at the public sector and what defenses government agencies can implement to protect against them.

## Attacks on the Rise | Government Is Amongst Top-Targeted Sectors

Government agencies are responsible for mass amounts of sensitive data ranging from personal information about citizens to classified information pertaining to national security. In our data-centric world, information remains a hot commodity in dark marketplaces and thus paints a target on its custodians.

While attacks on businesses, [healthcare](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/my-hospital-caught-a-virus-how-healthcare-is-sick-with-cyber/) providers, and [educational](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cyber-risks-in-the-education-sector-why-cybersecurity-needs-to-be-top-of-the-class/) and financial institutions make news headlines regularly, governments and their agencies have risen to the top as one of the most targeted sectors. [Research](https://blog.checkpoint.com/2022/10/26/third-quarter-of-2022-reveals-increase-in-cyberattacks/) in Q3 said that the government was the second most attacked industry with an attack average sitting at 1564 cases each week. This marks a 20% increase compared to the same period last year.

### Some of the top cyberattacks on governments have occurred throughout 2022.

* **January** – In a cyberattack targeting the Ukrainian government, malicious software was deployed to damage dozens of computers in government-run agencies. The Informatic Directorate of the Greek Parliament identified an attempt to compromise 60 parliamentary email accounts. Threat actors breached the Canadian Foreign Ministry, disrupting the operation of some internet-connected services.
* **February** – Cybercriminals [breached](https://thestack.technology/foreign-office-hacked-fcdo-cyber-attack/) the networks of the U.K. Foreign Office and an Iranian-linked group conducted cyber operations, including espionage against local and federal governments. A Pakistani-linked group deployed a remote access trojan (RAT) to spy on the Indian military and diplomatic persons of interest. As a precursor to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the latter’s Defense Ministry suffered [DDoS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/look-whos-back-its-ddos/) attacks and the websites of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Infrastructure, and Education experienced major disruptions.
* **March** – Governing entities of at least six U.S. states were hacked by a Chinese-backed group. In Canada, the country’s largest state-funded research agency declared it suffered a data breach. Greenland’s parliamentary authority reported an apparent espionage operation, which slowed social benefit payments. Actors linked to the Pakistani government targeted Indian government employees using fake websites to deliver malware.
* **April** – Ukrainian government officials were targeted on their Telegram accounts through a [phishing](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing-scams/) campaign. Websites belonging to the Finnish Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs were hit with a [DDoS](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/anatomy-ddos-attack/) attack and the U.S. announced sanctions against a DPRK-based hacking group after it attacked their Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Cyber researchers discovered a new Russian-linked campaign using phishing emails to deliver malware to diplomats and embassy officials from Portugal, Poland, France, and more.
* **May** – A phishing campaign launched against the Jordan Ministry of Foreign Affairs was attributed to an Iranian cyber espionage actor. Russian-linked threat actors hit Italian websites with a DDoS attack, which included the sites for the Senate, Ministry of Defense, and the National Health Institute.
* **June** – A DDoS attack hit Norwegian public institutions with the specific intent to disrupt government websites. Actors breached Chinese government networks to find and leak evidence of human rights abuse committed against the Uyghur population. Isreali officials, military personnel, and a former U.S. Ambassador to Israel were targeted by attackers through phishing emails. A Russian-based group claimed responsibility for attacking Lithuania’s government ministries and state-run airport, railway, and media companies.

DDoS attacks temporarily took down the Taiwanese presidential website and attempted the same on the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry’s main portal. Threat actors targeted the Ukrainian government’s state energy agency responsible for the country’s nuclear power plants.
* **September** – ‘Anonymous’ group claimed responsibility for a series of cyberattacks against the Iranian government. The Mexican Defense Ministry reported that six terabytes of internal communications, criminal data, and citizens’ personal health information was accessed in an attack. Main state websites and government information platforms in Montenegro were targeted as was the state-level parliamentary website of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
* **October** – Government websites across Colorado, Kentucky, and Mississippi were taken offline by pro-Russian hackers. Another Russian-linked hacking group claimed responsibility for targeting Bulgarian sites belonging to its presidential administration, Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, Justice Ministry, and Constitutional Court.
