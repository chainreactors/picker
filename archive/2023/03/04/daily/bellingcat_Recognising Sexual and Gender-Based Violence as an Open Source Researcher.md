# Recognising Sexual and Gender-Based Violence as an Open Source Researcher

March 3, 2023

* [SGBV](/tag/sgbv)

*\*This article contains descriptions of sexual and gender-based violence that some readers may find distressing\**

Open source methods are increasingly used to document and report on conflicts around the world. From verifying secretive troop movements to identifying potential war crimes, open source investigations have often been the first to uncover important developments. Yet one aspect of this emerging field that remains ethically complex and practically challenging for researchers is sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).

Human rights investigators have long known that sexual and gender-based violence is a regular occurance in armed conflict and amounts to recognised crimes under [international law](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf).

But online investigators, many of whom do not conduct research as their full-time job or do not  come from a human rights background, might not realise exactly what they are witnessing when they come across content that depicts [sexual violence in war zones](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/five-things-know-about-sexual-violence-conflict-zones). If they do recognise it, they may not know how to treat it or realise that failure to do so thoughtfully can cause further harm to the victims and survivors.

Even if not actively seeking out content related to SGBV or planning to investigate it directly, its presence in armed conflict means it’s likely to appear in open source materials at some point. There have been several recent instances of SGBV being reported via open sources in recent years, including in the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and in the Tigray conflict in Ethiopia.

Alexa Koenig – the co-executive director of the Human Rights Center at UC Berkeley and Ulic Egan – the program manager at the Institute for International Criminal Investigations – explore the challenges for researchers in this field, [outlining](https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/19/1/55/6276591) how “effectively and ethically researching sexual violence online requires heightened sensitivities to those issues and an expanded set of strategies on the part of investigators.”

Bellingcat reviewed the existing literature on SGBV and open source research and spoke to four people with expertise in related fields to understand some of the strategies to deal with this content.

## What is Sexual and Gender-Based Violence?

The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR) [defines](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Sexual_and_gender-based_violence.pdf) gender-based violence as “any harmful act directed against individuals or groups of individuals on the basis of their gender.” It [describes](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Sexual_and_gender-based_violence.pdf) sexual violence, meanwhile, as “a form of gender-based violence and encompasses any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting.”

It’s important to note that sexual violence can be committed by anyone against any other person, regardless of sex or age. An [essentialist understanding](https://www.ipinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Expanding-Conceptions-of-CRSV-Web.pdf) of sexual violence may reduce it to the rape of a woman by a man. According to the UN OHCHR while women and girls are [disproportionally affected](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Women/WRGS/OnePagers/Sexual_and_gender-based_violence.pdf) by sexual violence, these acts can also affect men, children.  [LGBTQI+](https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020.08-UN-CRSV-Handbook.pdf) persons can also be victims of SGBV.  One common thread seen in armed conflict, and which has been highlighted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, is that of [sexual violence against men and boys](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/never-happens-here-sexual-and-gender-based-violence-against-men-boys-andincluding).

Unsurprisingly, knowing the definition of what is considered sexual and gender-based violence is critical to identifying it, when carrying out online investigations.

Yet definitions of SGBV in [international criminal law](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) are broadly defined to include a wide scope of potential crimes. Some crimes may be both SGBV and another crime such as torture; there are also [stand alone crimes](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf) of rape other forms of sexual violence and gender-based persecution.

In 2019, however, [The Hague Principles on Sexual Violence](https://4genderjustice.org/ftp-files/publications/The-Hague-Principles-on-Sexual-Violence.pdf) were released, demonstrating how comprehensive sexual violence can be.

As the principles outlined: “Meaningfully addressing sexual violence starts with understanding all forms of sexual violence.”

The Hague Principles on Sexual Violence

1. The act involved exposing a ‘sexual body part’ or physical contact with such a body part, including over clothing;

2. The act was intended to be sexual by the perpetrator or was perceived as such by the affected person or their community as being sexual in nature;

3. The perpetrator or a third party derived sexual gratification from the act, or intended to do so;

4. The act, while not necessarily sexual in itself, was intended to impact:
a. The affected person’s sexual autonomy or sexual integrity, including their capacity to engage in sexual activity, feel sexual desire, or have intimate relationships;
b. the affected person’s sexual orientation or gender identity; or
c. the affected person’s reproductive capacity or reproductive autonomy;

5. The act involved sexual innuendos or language with implicit or explicit sexual connotations for the affected person, the community, or the perpetrator

6. The act involved use, interference, control, or degradation of fluids or tissue associated with sexual and reproductive capacity, including semen, vaginal fluids, menstrual blood, breast milk, or placenta.
