Despite the opposition of 38 civil society groups, the French National Assembly has approved the use of algorithmic video surveillance during the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Endorsed by French senators in January, the [proposed law](https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/dossiers/DLR5L16N46918) for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games cleared a committee vote earlier this month. On Thursday, the French National Assembly adopted Article 7 of the pending bill, which authorizes automated analysis of surveillance video from fixed and drone cameras.

Specifically, it allows such surveillance "On an experimental basis and until June 30, 2025, for the sole purpose of ensuring the security of sporting, recreational or cultural events which, by their scale or their circumstances, are particularly exposed to the risk of acts of terrorism or serious threats to the safety of persons, the images collected by means of video protection systems … and cameras installed on aircraft … in the places hosting these events and in their surroundings, as well as in vehicles and public transport rights-of-way." It probably sounds more romantic in French.
