These are abstract ideas. More research and tests will be needed to determine the effectiveness of this project.

### **The problem?**

* SOCs analysts spend time analyzing the “Unknowns.”
* Lack of sufficient intelligence about new files causes slow response and can lead to other higher risks; compromise, post-exploitation, and other malicious activities.

### File WatchTower — The Early radar

A tool continuously monitors newly created/modified and downloaded files on the OS and reports detailed logs to other security systems/tools such as SIEM.

The intelligence produced by the File WatchTower helps the SOC team to create new SIEM use cases that can detect a wide range of malicious activities and stop it at their initial phases.

With the intelligence produced by FWT, the SOC analysts spend less time analyzing the “Unknowns.”

### **Information collected by the File WatchTower**

* File attributes: Size, type, hash, signer, creation & modification time.
* Entropy level -> (Encrypted? Obfuscated?)
* Compiler information, PDB
* Compilation time
* If a document: Contains Macros? Parse it. Domains? IPs…Full Macro?
* If ISO Packer? Get some insights
* IMPHASH
* More..

### **Sample usage scenarios**

* Detection of potential malicious documents resulting from targeted phishing.
* Detection of potentially malicious activity in early phases: Watch for IMPHASH, Documents with Macros, ISO packed..
* An executable with the same/specific attributes is being noticed on multiple endpoints… A ransomware deployment?
