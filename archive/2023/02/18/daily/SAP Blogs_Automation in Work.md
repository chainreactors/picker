## **History – The Rise of Automation in the Workplace**

Automation has been a driving force in the evolution of work for centuries. From the earliest use of simple machines to the development of complex robotics and artificial intelligence, automation has continually transformed the way we produce goods and services, and has had a significant impact on the economy and society.

Robots at a charging station

The history of workforce automation can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where simple machines such as the wheel and lever were used to improve efficiency and reduce the physical labor required for tasks. In the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, steam power and machinery revolutionized manufacturing, leading to the widespread use of machine tools and assembly lines. This marked the beginning of the mechanization of work, which greatly increased the productivity of factories and allowed for the mass production of goods.

### **Automation Economy**

As technology advanced, workforce automation became more sophisticated and began to include the use of computers and electronics. In the 20th century, the development of programmable controllers and robotics led to the automation of many manufacturing processes, further increasing productivity and reducing the need for human labor.

Today, workforce automation is prevalent in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and finance. Robotics and artificial intelligence are being used to perform tasks that were previously done by humans, such as assembling products, driving vehicles, and analyzing data. While automation has brought many benefits, including increased efficiency and productivity, it has also raised concerns about job displacement and the potential for widespread unemployment. In response to these concerns, there have been efforts to retrain workers and provide education and training in fields that are less likely to be automated.

Overall, the history of automation is a complex and ongoing process, with both positive and negative impacts on society. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that automation will continue to play a major role in the way we work and live.

## **Empowering Business Efficiency through Low Code, RPA and AI: Transforming the Future of Work in the Automation Economy**

##

[Low code](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/no-code-app-builder.html), [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.sap.com/insights/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html), and [robotic process automation (RPA)](https://www.sap.com/insights/what-is-rpa.html) are three technologies that are transforming the way work is automated. These technologies allow businesses to automate repetitive tasks and processes, freeing up employees to focus on more value-added activities. Low code refers to the use of graphical user interfaces and pre-built modules to create software applications and automation workflows, without the need for extensive coding knowledge. Low code platforms allow businesses to quickly develop and deploy custom solutions, reducing the time and cost associated with traditional software development.

AI is a broad term that refers to the use of algorithms and machine learning to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. AI can be used to automate tasks such as data analysis, customer service, and decision making.

RPA is a type of software that is designed to automate routine, repetitive tasks. RPA robots can be programmed to mimic human actions, such as logging into systems, filling out forms, and extracting data. By automating these types of tasks, businesses can improve efficiency and reduce errors.

***One key benefit of low code, AI, and RPA is the ability to automate tasks that are time-consuming or error-prone for humans.***

For example, a low code platform can be used to automate the process of onboarding new employees, while an RPA robot can handle the task of reconciling accounts payable. By automating these tasks, businesses can fr...
