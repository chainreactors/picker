2fa is a two-factor authentication agent.

Usage:

```
go install rsc.io/2fa@latest

2fa -add [-7] [-8] [-hotp] name
2fa -list
2fa name
```

`2fa -add name` adds a new key to the 2fa keychain with the given name. It
prints a prompt to standard error and reads a two-factor key from standard
input. Two-factor keys are short case-insensitive strings of letters A-Z and
digits 2-7.

By default the new key generates time-based (TOTP) authentication codes; the
`-hotp` flag makes the new key generate counter-based (HOTP) codes instead.

By default the new key generates 6-digit codes; the `-7` and `-8` flags select
7- and 8-digit codes instead.

`2fa -list` lists the names of all the keys in the keychain.

`2fa name` prints a two-factor authentication code from the key with the
given name. If `-clip` is specified...
