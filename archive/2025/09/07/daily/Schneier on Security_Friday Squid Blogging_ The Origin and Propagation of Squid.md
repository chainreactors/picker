## Friday Squid Blogging: The Origin and Propagation of Squid

New [research](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu6248) (paywalled):

> **Editor’s summary:**
>
> Cephalopods are one of the most successful marine invertebrates in modern oceans, and they have a 500-million-year-old history. However, we know very little about their evolution because soft-bodied animals rarely fossilize. Ikegami et al. developed an approach to reveal squid fossils, focusing on their beaks, the sole hard component of their bodies. They found that squids radiated rapidly after shedding their shells, reaching high levels of diversity by 100 million years ago. This finding shows both that squid body forms led to early success and that their radiation was not due to the end-Cretaceous extinction event.

The DoD is trying to figure out how their stuff is getting nicked.

‘https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/28/how\_does\_china\_keep\_stealing/

DHS once had a group of advisory committees that assisted with critical risks. Amongst them was the *Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB)* which investigated supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities including Log4j, the intrusion into Microsoft Exchange, LAPSUS$ and China’s Salt Typhoon compromise of American telecommunications companies. Australia legislated its own version named the *Cyber Incident Review Board* following the success of the CSRB. Despite the valuable insights **CSRB** provided, it was **dissolved by the DHS**, along with the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board, the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council, and the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.

Hey look! Did a vulnerability scan and found one. Better fire everyone in security.

Kristi Noem fired two dozen FEMA employees following DHS cyber incident. It is a bad time to be laid off with the US jobs market rapidly weakening despite the replacement of the head of the Department of Labor and Statistics. But you can’t blame yourself can you?

DHS headquarters, DHS agencies and HHS were penetrated during the SharePoint attack.

.defense will become .war

Military/defense websites and networks have long been exposed to **physical** and virtual weaknesses. The Trump-Hesgeth duo have a plan to rename things and add AI to secure the Department of Defense. This is now called the Department of War, bringing with it an automatic security upgrade, which by virtue will harden all .defense sites to .war sites.

Websites are being rerouted and the names of official positions are being changed. This will provide a more powerful message that projects the strength of banners and headings.

Using magic, AI may find and fix all the software vulnerabilities.

A recent Inspector Generals report stated the Departments of Navy and Airforce could not provide documentation of vulnerabilities or a timeline to mitigate old [REDACTED] issues.

That is the timeframe Ichtyosaurs died out and Plesiosaur took over. Good ol’ times. Wonder what changed.

startup/

=Aim Security, founded by two graduates of IDF intelligence’s Unit 8200, says its
platform enables enterprises to adopt AI tools in a secure and controlled manner.

Israeli cyber unicorn Cato Networks on Wednesday announced a deal to buy Tel Aviv-based startup Aim Security, in order to be better equipped to help businesses address the rapidly evolving risks posed by the adoption of artificial intelligence-based
applications.

Cato, a maker of cloud-based secured networks for large enterprises that lets workers
connect to applications regardless of where they are, did not disclose the value of the
acquisition, but it is estimated at around $350 million.

> The startup has developed an AI security platform designed to help businesses and
> organizations protect their sensitive data against cyber threats and attacks as they
> increasingly introduce large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI applications
> into their private network systems. To date, Aim Security has raised $28 million from
> investors.=

attention after announcing she is engaged to her AI chatbot boyfriend.

A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she’s engaged to her AI
chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual
companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.

The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time...
