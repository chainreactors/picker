In this episode, Graham unravels Operation Endgame ‚Äì the surprisingly stylish police crackdown that is seizing botnets, mocking malware authors with anime videos, and taunting cybercriminals via Telegram.

Meanwhile, Carole exposes the AI-generated remote hiring threat. Could your next coworker be a North Korean hacker with a perfect LinkedIn?

And BBC cyber correspondent Joe Tidy joins us to talk about ‚ÄúCtrl-Alt-Chaos‚Äù, his new book diving into the murky world of teenage hackers, ransomware gangs, and the strange motivations that lie behind digital mayhem.

Plus: competitive pond husbandry, dead slugs, Hitster the board game, and a shoutout to the AI startup that hijacked Graham‚Äôs SEO.

All this and more is discussed in episode 423 of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault ‚Äì it‚Äôs like a cauldron of life‚Ä¶ but for cybersecurity.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
