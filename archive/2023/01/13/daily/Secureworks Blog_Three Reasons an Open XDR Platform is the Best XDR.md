# Three Reasons an Open XDR Platform is the Best XDR

Open XDR is designed to help SecOps teams become more efficient, with lower investment and better visibility.

For organizations that have already made significant security investments, the idea of ripping and replacing existing solutions can be unthinkable. On the other hand, organizations want to avoid vendor lock-in where they are essentially forced to continue using a product or service regardless of quality or performance. It’s the security conundrum of our age: how can organizations achieve a best-of-breed SecOps experience where teams can integrate tools as they see fit? The answer is found in an open, vendor-inclusive extended detection and response (XDR) solution.

According to a recent [Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/security-chiefs-warn-bloated-cyber-market-must-learn-to-work-together-11658314800) more than three-quarters of cybersecurity professionals want their vendors to deliver open, interoperable solutions. And, this is an important distinction to make, because XDR platforms come in two forms: open and native. Native XDR is designed as an all-in-one platform from a single vendor. This means that all the integrations and telemetry sources are part of the solution itself, which may lead to faster deployment and shorter time to value. Sounds great, right?

Here’s the challenge: As organizations grow, they often want to invest in multiple third-party and best-of-breed solutions. If your goal is to achieve better visibility and integrate an XDR solution with all the security intelligence and telemetry sources in your environment, regardless of the vendor, you will need an open XDR platform.

Open XDR ingests telemetry from a wide array of endpoint, cloud, network, and other business systems to empower customers to respond to threats quickly.  Unlike native XDR, open XDR platforms integrate extensively across vendors. With an open XDR platform, there is no need to rip and replace existing solutions, and you don’t have to rely exclusively on one vendor in your effort to detect and stop cyberattacks. Open solutions bridge the gap between different security technologies and maximize existing investments. Below are three other important reasons to choose an open XDR platform:

1. **As organizations grow their security operations and tools, an open platform will scale seamlessly.**
   Most organizations have already made significant investments in a variety of technologies and require tight integration to be effective. An extensible, vendor-inclusive approach to threat detection provides better visibility across your entire attack surface by integrating threat information from your existing and future security investments. Yes, even the investments you won’t make for years to come.

   This ensures the platform will scale with your business and offers more flexibility to change and optimize your telemetry sources for more efficient tools and processes.

2. **Third-party integrations and automated playbooks accelerate response actions.**
   Open XDR solutions help SecOps team respond to and remediate security issues faster and more efficiently with automated actions and proven playbooks. A quick response can reduce dwell time and contain an intruder quickly, limiting the impact in your environment.

   Organizations should look for an open XDR vendor with an extensive library of playbooks and integrations that can be used right out of the box. Even better, look for one that also offers custom automations and integrations.

   Customization capabilities allow you to ingest a wider variety of data sources and create countless powerful automated response actions to match your required workflow, use cases and available integration sources.

3. **Open platforms offer unified detection and response and impressive cost savings.**
   With open XDR you can integrate multiple security tools, vendors, and telemetry types, all in a single detection and response platform. This centralizes security data collection, correlation, and analysis.

   The single view allows teams to collaborate on investigations and respond within one platform, leveraging integrated security tools. This enables you to lower your overhead costs by reducing tool sprawl and saving
   valuable time.

   Overall, open XDR is designed to help SecOps teams become more efficient, with lower investment and better visibility than any other solution on the market. This allows you to select tools based on your own preferences regarding features, functions, and price.
