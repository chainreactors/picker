Practical exercises will help you develop stronger proficiency and apply knowledge.

For instance, learn how the MITRE ATT&CK® framework can help defenders understand attackers in the SOC-200 Challenge labs. When simulated attacks occur in real-time, you’ll investigate while dealing with network noise and decoy machines.

## The Student Experience

Here’s what students had to share about their learning experience:

SOC-200

![](https://www.offensive-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image4-200x200.jpg)

“The SOC-200 course strongly complemented the offensive skills I gained in PEN-200. I explored the kinds of footprints that various network-based attacks left behind, which not only made me a better defender, but also a better attacker.”

– Joseph Turcotte, OSDA | OSCP | OSWP | OSWA

WEB-200

![](https://www.offensive-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image7-200x200.png)

“…the way it’s all presented, and the fact that there are VMs you can start that let us break the problem into smaller problems (an eval sandbox that just executes whatever javascript you throw at it, and several sample apps that are each vulnerable to a different variant of XSS), makes for a very pleasant learning experience.”

– Anonymous

EXP-312

![](https://www.offensive-security.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image2-200x200.jpg)

“I’m happy to announce that I’ve achieved the #OSMR certification! Special thanks to @offsectraining and @theevilbit for arguably the best certification in the macOS infosec field.”

 – @cr7pt0pl4gu3, Offensive Security Specialist, OSCP | OSCE3 | OSMR
