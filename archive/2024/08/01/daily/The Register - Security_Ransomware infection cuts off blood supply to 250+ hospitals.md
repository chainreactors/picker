A ransomware attack against blood-donation nonprofit OneBlood, which services more than 250 American hospitals, has "significantly reduced" the org's ability to take, test, and distribute blood.

In a notice today, OneBlood revealed the intrusion disrupted a "software system," and had forced the organization to use manual processes and procedures to remain operational. The outfit provides blood for healthcare facilities across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

> We have asked the hospitals we serve to activate their critical blood shortage protocols

"Manual processes take significantly longer to perform and impact inventory availability," OneBlood spokesperson Susan Forbes explained in a [statement](https://www.oneblood.org/pages/ransomware-details.html).

"In an effort to further manage the blood supply we have asked the more than 250 hospitals we serve to activate their critical blood shortage protocols and to remain in that status for the time being."

Other blood centers across the US are sending blood and platelets to OneBlood, with the [AABB Disaster Task Force](https://www.aabb.org/about-aabb/organ...
