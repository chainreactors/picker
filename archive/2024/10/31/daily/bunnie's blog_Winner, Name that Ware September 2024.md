## Winner, Name that Ware September 2024

Last month’s Ware was a Cue COVID test reader. It uses [LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Transcription_Loop-mediated_Isothermal_Amplification) to perform a fast and sensitive detection of nucleic acid sequences. Thanks again to [Curtis Galloway](https://curtisgalloway.com/) for contributing this ware for me to take apart and photograph!

Nobody had guessed the ware exactly, but “microfluidic lab on a chip” is a pretty fair generic description of a LAMP reader, so I’ll give the prize to Jimmy. Congrats and email me for your prize!

I had perhaps gotten a bit overzealous with the image redaction, but here is the connector on the PCB that I had blurred out previously. I figured this connector would have been a dead ringer for the mating Cue cartridge.

One other interesting facet – the miniature optical interrupters I highlighted previously are used to detect when the assembly shown above is no longer flush to the circuit board. It’s basically a set of very strong magnets on a flexible polymer membrane.

I’m not quite sure how it works as I’ve never used the test myself, but I seem to recall the test cartridge having a slug of metal in it that would mate with this magnet. Probably, the magnets help to hold the test in place and make firm contact with the connector while giving positive feedback to the user it’s been inserted correctly, and the interrupters allow the circuitry to know when the cartridge is all the way in. The entire thing is constructed to resist some amount of accidental liquid exposure, so this perhaps explains the need for a mechanism to detect cartridge insertion via a sealed, flexible polymer membrane.
