During the first half of this year, SAP reached a major milestone in its business growth – cloud revenue became our largest revenue stream. Anyone watching our cloud momentum in recent years may view this achievement as inevitable. However, our numbers indicated something less expected – growth fueled by a significant rise in platform-as-a-service (PaaS) adoption.

According to our [first half of 2022 earnings report](https://www.sap.com/investors/en/investment-story/recent-results.html?pdf-asset=c6de2359-377e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&page=1), cloud revenue increased by 25% at constant currency and 33% at nominal levels. But once that figure is broken down by as-a-service categories, PaaS emerges as a stunning revenue generator with a 43% growth in constant currency, up 50% in nominal levels.

Jagdish Sahasrabudhe, Chief Technology Officer of the Global Partner organization at SAP, attributes growing interest in the SAP PaaS offering, [SAP Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html) (SAP BTP), to the "unlearning" organizations experience when transitioning from on-premise approaches. He writes in his [blog](https://news.sap.com/2022/09/sap-btp-amplifies-value-of-diverse-workplace/): "Unlike other PaaS and hyperscaler solutions, SAP BTP is business-aware, apps-aware, and process-aware. As a result, our customers gain that business context they need – which is difficult to attain any other way."

SAP partners are seizing this latest development in cloud adoption by using SAP BTP to move customers from on-premise ERP to SAP S/4HANA Cloud with greater ease and confidence. As a single comprehensive platform for native connections, services, content, and technologies, the PaaS accelerates the benefits of the cloud while extending the boundaries of existing digital investments.

Learn more about why SAP BTP and other PaaS technologies resonate well with customers as they seek a better way to operate in an increasingly challenging and competitive landscape.
