The King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, which handles all prosecutions in the Seattle area, has instructed police in no uncertain terms: [do not use AI to write police reports](https://komonews.com/amp/news/local/king-county-prosecutor-tells-police-not-to-use-ai-artificial-intelligence-for-official-reports-for-now-errors-concerns-law-enforcement-perjury-criminal-justice)...for now. This is a good development. We hope prosecutors across the country will exercise such caution as companies continue to [peddle technology](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/what-can-go-wrong-when-police-use-ai-write-reports) – generative artificial intelligence (genAI) to help write police reports – that could harm people who come into contact with the criminal justice system.

Chief Deputy Prosecutor Daniel J. Clark said in a [memo](https://komonews.com/amp/news/local/king-county-prosecutor-tells-police-not-to-use-ai-artificial-intelligence-for-official-reports-for-now-errors-concerns-law-enforcement-perjury-criminal-justice) about AI-based tools to write narrative police reports based on body camera audio that the technology as it exists is “one we are not ready to accept.”
