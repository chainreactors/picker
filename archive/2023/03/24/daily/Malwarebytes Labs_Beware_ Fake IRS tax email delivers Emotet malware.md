# Beware: Fake IRS tax email delivers Emotet malware

Posted: March 23, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Tax season is upon us and, as with every year, we’re seeing tax scammers rearing their heads.

Below, we have an example of a tax scam currently in circulation along with some suggestions for avoiding these kinds of attacks.

## An IRS W-9 tax form scam

A Form W-9 is a form you fill in to [confirm certain personal details](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/w9form.asp) with the IRS. Name, address, and Tax Identification Number are all things you can expect to fill in on one of these forms.

In this case, the Form W-9 is being used as a lure for people to download something sinister. Our Senior Director of Threat Intelligence, Jerome Segura, found an email being sent out with the title of “IRS Tax Forms W-9” which appears to have been sent from “IRS Online Center”. The email, which contains an attachment and very little text, looks like this:

![Rogue malware IRS spam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/easset_upload_file60400_262506_e.png)

The rather short message reads as follows:

> Let me know if you would like a hard copy mailed as well.
>
> Respectifully [SIC]
>
> Barbara LaCosta
>
> Inspector
>
> Department of Treasure

The attachment, W-9 form.zip, is 709 KB in size.

Opening the attachment up reveals a Word document called W-9 form.doc

![Bogus W-9 document](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/easset_upload_file45192_262506_e.png)

This file’s size is 548,164 KB (548 MB), which is very suspicious. You won’t find many genuine Word documents weighing in at 500MB or more. In fact, a file size of 500MB is a potential indicator that [Emotet](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet) is lurking in the background. Malware authors are artificially pumping up the size of the document in order to try and fool or break security tools. This is because the large file size may prove too difficult for the tools to get a handle on and properly analyse.

Opening the document quickly becomes a game of Macro-related risk. Macros, used to [automate aspects of your documents](https://www.pcworld.com/article/422689/word-macros-three-examples-to-automate-your-documents.html), are a tried and tested way of infecting a PC with malware. This is why you’ll almost always see a message saying that [Macros are disabled](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/10/at-long-last-microsoft-is-disabling-excel-4-0-macros-by-default) when opening a downloaded document.

Malware authors know this, and will do everything in their power to make you enable them. This is no exception. When opening W-9 form.doc, you’ll see the following message:

> This document is protected
> Previewing is not available for protected documents. You have to press “enable editing” and “enable content” buttons to preview this document.

*![Rogue word document](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/easset_upload_file3817_262506_e.png)*

Enabling this will result in Emotet being downloaded onto the system.

Emotet has been around since 2014. Originally created as a banking [trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan), [later versions added malware delivery and spam services](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet). Mostly featuring in email [spam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spam) campaigns, a big focus of fake mails helping to deliver the infection include subjects like parcel shipping, in...
