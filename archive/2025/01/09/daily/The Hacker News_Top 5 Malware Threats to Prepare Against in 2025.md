2024 had its fair share of high-profile cyber attacks, with companies as big as Dell and TicketMaster falling victim to data breaches and other infrastructure compromises. In 2025, this trend will continue. So, to be prepared for any kind of malware attack, every organization needs to know its cyber enemy in advance. Here are 5 common malware families that you can start preparing to counter right now.

## Lumma

Lumma is a widely available malware designed to steal sensitive information. It has been openly sold on the Dark Web since 2022. This malware can effectively collect and exfiltrate data from targeted applications, including login credentials, financial information, and personal details.

Lumma is regularly updated to enhance its capabilities. It can log detailed information from compromised systems, such as browsing history and cryptocurrency wallet data. It can be used to install other malicious software on infected devices. In 2024, Lumma was distributed through various methods, including fake CAPTCHA pages, torrents, and targeted phishing emails.

### Analysis of a Lumma Attack

Proactive analysis of suspicious files and URLs within a sandbox environment can effectively help you prevent Lumma infection.

Let's see how you can do it using [ANY.RUN's cloud-based sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top_5_malware_threats&utm_content=landing&utm_term=080125). It not only delivers definitive verdicts on malware and phishing along with actionable indicators but also allows real-time interaction with the threat and the system.

Take a look at [this analysis](https://app.any.run/tasks/bf38c488-5fc9-40fb-8602-c36e246bfb97?utm_source=the_hacker_news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=top_5_malware_threats&utm_content=task&utm_term=080125) of a Lumma attack.

| ANY.RUN lets you manually open files and launch executables |

It starts with an archive which contains an executable. Once we launch the .exe file, the sandbox automatically logs all processes and network activities, showing Lumma's actions.

| You can use the IOCs extracted by the sandbox to enhance your detection systems |

After finishing the analysis, we can export a report on this sample, featuring all the important indicators of compromise (IOCs) and TTPs that can be used to enrich defenses against possible Lumma attacks in your organization.

## XWorm

XWorm is a malicious program that gives cybercriminals remote control over infected computers. First appearing in July 2022, it can collect a wide range of sensitive information, including financial details, browsing history, saved passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet data.

XWorm allows attackers to monitor victims' activities by tracking keystrokes, capturing webcam images, listening to audio input, scanning network connections, and viewing open windows. It can also access and manipulate the computer's clipboard, potentially stealing cryptocurrency wallet credentials.

In 2024, XWorm was involved in many large-scale attacks, including ones that exploited CloudFlare tunnels and legitimate digital certificates.
