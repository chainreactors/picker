In the first section of this multi-part practical guide, I’ll introduce you to Kubernetes (K8s) from a penetration testing perspective, including basic information, vocabulary, and how to identify and explore Kubernetes instances. Stay tuned for the next installment, where I’ll detail more vulnerabilities and attack paths.

To begin, let’s discuss what Kubernetes is and some of the terminology you’ll need to know. K8s is an open-source system for automating deployment and management of containerized applications across multiple servers (known as a cluster). There is an official [glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true) available, but here are several key terms to make note of:

* **Pod** - The smallest object of the Kubernetes ecosystem, a group of containers running together on your cluster.
* **Node** - What pods run on, each with a kubelet and kube-proxy.
* **Kubelet** - Uses the Kubernetes API server to make sure pods are running; registers and reports nodes within a cluster.
* **Kube-proxy** - A proxy that runs on each node in a cluster, maintaining and allowing network communication.
* **Cluster** - A group of nodes (made up of a control panel node and a set of worker nodes) that run containerized applications.
* **Container** - Packages an application and dependencies in an optimized way, most often as microservices.
* **etcd** - A distributed key-value store for managing configuration, state, and metadata.
* **Kubectl**- A [command-line tool](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/ "https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/") for communicating with a Kubernetes API server.
* **Kubernetes API Server** - Front-end for the cluster, allowing other components to interact.  Additionally, configures valid data for API objects.
* **Kube-scheduler** - Default option for scheduling pods onto nodes.
* **Namespace** - A virtual cluster allowing for provisioning of resources and establishing scope for pods, services, and deployments using unique naming.

---

Next, let's discuss [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/), your main tool for interfacing with K8s instances. This command-line tool is easily installed using Homebrew:

*brew install kubectl*
or
*brew install kubernetes-cli*

Figure 1 - kubectl Installed

In order for kubectl to find and access a Kubernetes cluster, it needs a [kubeconfig file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).

Figure 2 - Unconfigured kubeconfig

Check that kubectl is properly configured by getting the cluster state:
*kubectl cluster-info*

Some common commands:
List all pods across all namespaces:  *kubectl get pods -A*
Get secret: *kubectl get secrets*
Get services: *kubectl get services*
Version: *kubectl version*
