This three-part blog series introduces SAP Signavio Process Insights’ new guide: **[Get Started with SAP Signavio Process Insights](https://dam.sap.com/mac/u/a/7dUZECW.htm?rc=10).** In this series we will explore the content of the guide, which will hopefully make your first days and weeks with SAP Signavio Process Insights as easy as possible.

In the [first part](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/04/get-started-with-sap-signavio-process-insights-release-of-a-new-guide/) of our blog series, dianakveit outlined the purpose of the guide and described how your first day with SAP Signavio Process insights could look like. In the following [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/09/get-started-with-sap-signavio-process-insights-your-first-week-who-do-i-need-to-involve-and-which-challenges-do-i-want-to-solve/), we talked about potential use cases and the relevant stakeholders.

Having identified the colleagues involved and agreed on a guiding question for your analysis, you are ready to start the analysis in SAP Signavio Process Insights.

**Step 1: Choose an entry point for your analysis**

Depending on your use case, you can start your analysis based on any one of the 7 end-to-end processes included in SAP Signavio Process Insights, for example, Source to Pay and modular processes (for example, Invoice to Pay). Alternatively, you can choose the from 8 lines of business view and select specific value drivers you want to achieve (for example, Improve Days Payable Outstanding).

From there, you will be guided to the relevant **process flows** (for example, Sales billing document creation to FI-AR clearing), which will help you to get an overview of overall process performance. At first glance, you can also get an overview of the objects collected at process flow level, as well as the completion rate and average time to completion within the defined reference period. The number of process blockers identified can indicate where a closer look might be worthwhile.

In addition to the process flows, the associated **process** **performance indicators** can give you additional insights into aspects related to automation, exceptions, or backlog impacting your process efficiency and performance. Depending on your use case, you might want to concentrate on a particular category of performance indicator:

Looking at the sample use cases defined in this blog, starting an analysis could look like this:

**Step 2: identify improvement potential**

You have identified the relevant process flows and performance indicators for your analysis. As a next step, you want to understand the improvement potential along this process. SAP Signavio Process Insights provides immediate information on potentially critical parts of a process. Specifically, based on lead time information, process blockers, and the associated performance indicators, you can zoom in on problem areas. Comparing data across organizational units can help to identify where the issues are primarily occurring.

Looking at the sample use cases defined in this blog, identifying improvement potential could look like this:

**Step 3: ANALYZE ROOT CAUSES**

You have identified improvement potential. However, to improve the process, you need a better understanding of the root causes for the issues you have identified. By applying filters to process flows and performance indicators, you can do a root cause analysis to understand your current challenges. For selected process flows, guided analysis shows how to approach such an analysis.

Looking at the sample use cases defined in this blog, doing a root cause analysis could look like this:

**STEP 4: DERIVE IMPROVEMENT MEASURES**

Having learnt about issues and their root causes along your processes, you might wonder how to address them and improve your processes moving forward. SAP Signavio Process Insights provides recommendations on improving the situation in your ERP system, including concrete instructions. Additionally, it evaluates relevant SAP innovations that could help you to further improve processes in the future, for example, automation capabilities or new product capabilities coming with SAP S/4HANA.

For this, we recommend involving the affected departments to get their buy-in and support to perform these changes.
