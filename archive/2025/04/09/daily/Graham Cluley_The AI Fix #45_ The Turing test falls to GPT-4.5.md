In episode 45 of The AI Fix, our hosts discover that ChatGPT is running the world, Mark learns that mattress companies have scientists, Gen Z has nightmares about AI, OpenAI gets a bag, Graham eats too many cheese sandwiches, and too much training makes AIs over-sensitive.

Mark reveals why he‚Äôs got beef with cows, GPT-4.5 beats the Turing test, and Anthropic‚Äôs brain scanner reveals how AIs really think.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
