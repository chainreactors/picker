# The Risks of Pirate Site Blocking, Who Benefits, Who Pays, And at What Cost?

With site-blocking legislation currently under discussion in the United States, a new report examines site blocking measures elsewhere in the world. Commissioned by Cloudflare, the report warns that a patchwork of measures risks disruption to the internet's global technical infrastructure. It also questions whether the claimed benefits are worth the risk in the bigger picture.

Whether by court order, administrative process, or even on a semi-voluntary basis, on paper there are dozens of countries that now have some kind of mechanism requiring local ISPs to block pirate sites.

Previously, measures were implemented within specific regions by local ISPs. Now, rightsholders are venturing beyond local infrastructure into the wider internet, to compel global DNS resolvers to render sites inaccessible.

Commissioned by Cloudflare and prepared by [Analysys Mason](https://www.analysysmason.com/), a new report titled *The Economic Cost of Network Blocking* examines the repercussions of escalating global efforts to restrict access to content online.

## A Patchwork of Blocking Measures

The report provides a detailed overview of how blocking is supposed to work and what can go wrong when things break down. Examples include [blunders](https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-shield-cloudflare-disaster-blocks-countless-sites-fires-up-opposition-240226/) concerning Italy’s Piracy Shield and [LaLiga’s campaign](https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-blocks-cloudflare-again-new-pirate-iptv-providers-anything-in-the-way-250218/) that intermittently wiped out thousands of innocent sites because pirate sites shared the same IP addresses at the time. While all of these events have been reported here in detail, the cumulative effect of blocking on the wider internet is of particular interest.

The report notes that the success of the internet has been made possible by technical standards, infrastructure, and practices applied on a global scale, developed without government intervention at the technical level. Now that governments are attempting to exert more control over content accessible within their countries, the use of blocking measures may come at a cost to the internet itself.

“By intervening at the technical layer, governments risk fragmenting the Internet’s technical fabric. Recent examples show a patchwork of approaches to restricting access to illegitimate content, leading to diverging national regulations and increasing technical fragmentation.”

## Undermining the Internet Undermines Confidence

The report warns that the most common methods used, IP address and DNS blocking, impact the wider internet and can lead to collateral damage, impacting both legitimate services and their users. Despite having no connection to the illegitimate content being targeted, those affected suffer immediate economic damage, but the long-term effects are potentially even more serious.

A lack of transparency means that when content is rendered unavailable, intentionally or otherwise, users typically receive no explanation, leading to confusion and erosion of trust in online services. Blocking measures such as DNS poisoning, which effectively lie in response to queries about IP addresses, risk damaging trust built up over decades concerning the reliability of the underlying functions of the internet itself.

Due to a “siloed approach” and a patchwork of blocking measures deployed by various countries, the internet’s success – which was built on a consistent global user experience – risks a descent into disruption, inconsistency, and declining confidence.

None of this, the authors suggest, is good for the wider internet; regional complications undermine global collaboration, with negative consequences for security, resilience, even general fault-finding.

## Bad for Users, Bad For the Internet, Bad For Business

While rightsholders point out that piracy hurts their bottom lines, the report submits that the chosen remedy has negative effects on businesses that have no connection to the problem or its purported solution.

“Network blocking can also discourage investments and increase compliance costs for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – potentially leading to a situation where only large businesses can manage the complexity of varying national regulations,” the report warns.

“Network blocking may also threaten the openness and economies of scale that have allowed businesses to be created, expand, and flourish through a common shared infrastructure. This environment may give way to hard ‘digital borders’ for online services, with limitations to the global collaboration that has underpinned Internet security and resilience, while threatening investment in new services and infrastructure.”

## Additional Risk and Costs For Service Providers

In May 2024, when a [French court ordered](https://torrentfreak.com/opendns-suspends-service-in-france-due-to-canal-piracy-blocking-order-240629/) Google, Cloudflare and OpenDNS to block access to pirated content at the behest of Canal+, the immediate fallout made international headlines.

Rather than build the systems necessary to ensure compliance with the legal requirement, Cisco withdrew its OpenDNS service from the entire country. When a court in Belgium [issued a similar ruling](https://torrentfreak.com/opendns-quits-belgium-under-threat-of-piracy-blocks-or-fines-of-e100k-per-day-250416/) earlier this year with a €100,000 daily penalty for failure to comply, OpenDNS exited that country too.

“Most global public DNS resolvers provide their services for free. If the only way to offer such a service is to build and maintain complex software to geolocate and apply distinct blocking requirements for a multitude of countries around the world, companies are likely to simply stop offering the public service, to the detriment of Internet users around the world,” the report notes.

“In the short term, these effects mean it can be more desirable to withdraw the service from the jurisdiction requesting the block than to continue to offer it with a specific set of rules.”

For remaining service providers, Cloudflare and Google, compliance through their global resolvers meant the introduction of different processes and procedures in different jurisdictions. And with that, additional compliance costs, for which they pick up the bill. Ultimately, however, these increased costs are often passed on, meaning consumers of legitimate content and services pay for site blocking.

## Who Benefits From Site-Blocking?

When sites are blocked on copyright grounds, any benefits are primarily enjoyed by a relatively small number of private stakeholders, the report notes. Service providers, on the other ha...
