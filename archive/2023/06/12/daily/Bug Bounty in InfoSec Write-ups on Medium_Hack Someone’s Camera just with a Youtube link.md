Hello learners, I am back again with my new and really interesting blog.
I know most of you have seen in the movies how hackers can gain access to the victim‚Äôs camera and capture their pictures and their current location as well. So, In this blog, we are going to see how hackers can access your camera and your current location. But before starting let me give you a good news that I started a youtube channel for cybersecurity students where they can learn cybersecurity from the beginning to advance and trust me you‚Äôll not find content like this on Youtube before. [https://youtube.com/@securedsyntax](https://youtube.com/%40securedsyntax) that‚Äôs the link for it so enjoy and learn Hacking with Me.

> Disclaimer: Do not use these technique to hack anyone unless you have permission.

At first you need to download the tool called CamPhish which is available in github you can access it through this [**link**](https://github.com/techchipnet/CamPhish)**.**

Or you can download it just by typing the following command to your terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/techchipnet/CamPhish
```

After Installing the tool just run it and you should see the following options

You can continue with anyone but I recommend you to continue with option 1 which is Ngrok. So, Ngrok is the tool that will expose you.

Don‚Äôt think like that its not like that what you are thinking. It will just expose your home network to the Internet. You just need to go to the ngrok‚Äôs official website and create a account there and get your authtoken, copy it down somewhere for future use.

After this it will ask you which type of template you want I recommend you to use option 2 for youtube link because these two seems more suspicious so we‚Äôll continue with youtube for that just select 2 and press ENTER.

As you select the Live Youtube TV option it will then ask you for a watch ID which you can get from Youtube. Let me show you how, So select any vedio on [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) in my case I am selecting a song SCOPIN by KORDHELL.

![]()

and check the url you‚Äôll get the watch ID. See the screenshot below.

As you can see in the Direct link we have our link so as the victim clicks on it they will get a youtube page of the song I‚Äôve selected but on the other hand the magic starts working see the screenshot below and guess what ? I got pictures of victim which stored in my CamPhish folder itself.
