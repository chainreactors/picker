Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-0814, exists due to missing authorization within the wppb_toolbox_usermeta_handler() function. The affected function is defined as a callback function to the ‘user_meta’ shortcode, which is registered via the WordPress add_shortcode() function in usermeta.php.

As with all shortcode callback functions, wppb_toolbox_usermeta_handler() takes an array of attributes. In particular, the ‘user_id’ attribute is used to create a new user object. Then, the ‘key’ attribute is used in a call to ‘$user->get()’. Finally, the function returns the value of the retrieved ‘key’ for the given ‘user_id’. During this process, capability checks are not properly implemented to ensure that the user executing the function is authorized to retrieve the given ‘key’ value.

The wppb_toolbox_usermeta_handler() function creates a user object and performs a $user->get() with threat actor-supplied values.

Prerequisites

Vulnerable instances of Profile Builder need the ‘Enable Usermeta shortcode’ setting enabled within the ‘Shortcodes’ section of the ‘Advanced Settings’ tab of the plugin’s ‘Settings’ page.

Information Disclosure

Any authenticated user, with subscriber-level permissions or greater, can send a specially-crafted HTTP POST request to the ‘wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ endpoint with the ‘action’ parameter set to ‘parse-media-shortcode’ and the ‘shortcode’ parameter containing the ‘user_meta’ shortcode with the ‘user_id’ and ‘key’ attributes set.

As explained earlier, the value of the ‘key’ attribute is passed to a $user->get() call. Since the get() method of the WP_User class is designed to retrieve user information, any column of the ‘wp_users’ table can be passed via this attribute, including:

- ID
- user_login
- user_pass
- user_nicename
- user_email
- user_url
- user_registered
- user_activation_key
- user_status
- display_name

Password Reset to Privilege Escalation

The Profile Builder plugin provides the shortcode ‘[wppb-recover-password]’ to embed a password recovery form into a page on a WordPress site. The form allows users to submit their username or email address to receive an email with a password reset link containing a user activation key. When generated, this key is stored in the ‘user_activation_key’ column in the ‘wp_users’ table of the WordPress database. Using CVE-2023-0814, this key can be retrieved for any user.

First, the threat actor must generate the user activation key by entering the username or email address of the targeted user in the password recovery form and clicking the ‘Get New Password’ button.

Next, the threat actor will make a similar POST request to our previous user enumeration proof-of-concept, but this time ensuring the ‘user_id’ is set to the user ID of the username or email address entered into the password recovery form and setting the ‘key’ attribute to ‘user_activation_key’.

Once the threat actor has retrieved the user activation key, they can navigate back to the password recovery form page, but this time with the ‘key’ query parameter set to the retrieved user activation key.

At this point, the threat actor simply needs to enter a new password and click the ‘Reset Password’ button. The threat actor will then be able to login using the targeted username and new password.
