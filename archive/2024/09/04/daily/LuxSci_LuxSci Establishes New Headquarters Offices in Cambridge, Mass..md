# LuxSci Establishes New Headquarters Offices in Cambridge, Mass.

September 3rd, 2024

We’re thrilled to announce the opening of LuxSci’s new headquarters offices at **Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts!**

The move marks another milestone in our continuing journey to innovate and grow in secure healthcare communications. The new workspace aims to bring our people and teams together for in-person interactions and collaboration, and to better connect with our customers, partners and thought leaders. Located in the heart of one of the world’s most prestigious educational and technology hubs, our new office space reflects our roots and connections to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and our founder Erik Kangas, an MIT alumnus and advisor.

**A Strategic Move for Continued Growth and Expansion**

Opening our Cambridge office, part of the Industrious complex of offices, is not just about a change in location. The new office puts us at the center of cutting-edge technology in a thriving area for healthcare innovation. As a company deeply rooted in delivering the latest in secure, HIPAA-compliant communication solutions, this move allows us to leverage the rich talent pool and dynamic environment that Cambridge and the Greater Boston area have to offer.

**Leading the Way in HIPAA Compliance for Healthcare Communications**

At LuxSci, we’re proud to be the leader in HIPAA-compliant communication solutions for the healthcare industry, which includes serving some of the largest organizations in the US. With over two decades of experience, we understand the critical importance of safeguarding sensitive patient information and protected health information (PHI), but also how to increase patient and customer engagement.

**The Next Step into Personalized Healthcare Engagement**

Effective healthcare communication goes beyond just compliance—it’s about creating personalized and meaningful interactions with patients and customers. This often requires healthcare organizations to move beyond patient portals to open-up new communications channels and use cases, including email, marketing, text and forms—all in a HIPAA-compliant way. By protecting PHI data and using it in your communications for better personalization, you can deliver improved experiences and better outcomes for everyone involved.

**Multi-Channel Suite of Secure Healthcare Communications Solutions**

Today, LuxSci offers a suite of secure healthcare communication solutions, including support for high volume email, marketing, text messaging, and forms. As the demand for secure, compliant communication tools grows, LuxSci is at the forefront of delivering solutions that keep up with regulations and protect you from the latest threats.

“With our new Cambridge office, we’re launching the company into a new future with valuable connections to our past and where LuxSci was born,” said Mark Leonard, CEO of LuxSci. “Cambridge offers an unparalleled environment for innovation, and we’re excited to to bring our employees, partners and customers together – and to be part of this vibrant community.”
