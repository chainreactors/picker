In the previous blog of the **React Native Pentesting for Android Security Masterclass**, we covered [methods for decompiling APK files and analyzing their structure](https://payatu.com/blog/attack-surfaces-static-analysis/%E2%86%97).

Let’s now move to editing and patching React Native apps.

Modifying and patching React Native applications is relatively easier than doing so with Java-native Android applications. As we already learned, when an APK of a React Native project is built, all of the React Native JavaScript code gets compiled into one single file, i.e., “index.android.bundle.”

We have to find the correct piece of code in the “index.android.bundle” file, and then we can modify the code right away. We can find the code block by searching for the specific keywords in the application. For example, we can search for text (like the text on the button, touchable opacity, etc.) shown in the applicat...
