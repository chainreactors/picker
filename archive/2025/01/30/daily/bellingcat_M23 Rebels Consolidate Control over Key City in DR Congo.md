# M23 Rebels Consolidate Control over Key City in DR Congo

January 29, 2025

Rwandan-backed rebels M23 are continuing to consolidate their control over Goma after [taking control of the city’s international airport](https://news.sky.com/story/rwandan-backed-m23-rebels-complete-takeover-of-key-democratic-republic-of-congo-city-13298463) and border crossing. Fighting between M23 and the Congolese army [reportedly dampened overnight](https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20250129-dr-congo-and-rwanda-leaders-in-crisis-talks-as-m23-rebels-on-brink-of-seizing-goma) as footage from Goma showed Congolese soldiers surrendering, with M23 celebrating in the streets. It remains unclear exactly how much of the city the Congolese government still controls.

Congolese military forces are supported by government-backed local militias and a UN peacekeeping mission ([MONUSCO](https://peacekeeping.un.org/fr/mission/monusco?_gl=1*6p7b6j*_ga*OTMyODU1MDQ5LjE3MzcwMjI4OTc.*_ga_TK9BQL5X7Z*MTczODA1NTkwOC4zLjEuMTczODA1NTk1NC4wLjAuMA..*_ga_S5EKZKSB78*MTczODA1NTkwOC4zLjEuMTczODA1NjA0MC42MC4wLjA.)), but [M23 is reportedly supported by an estimated 3,000- 4,000](https://apnews.com/article/un-congo-rwanda-troops-m23-panel-experts-8619a4ce5727a7fec85808ef76762d9b) members of the Rwandan Defence Forces.

Goma has a population of approximately [2 million people (including 1 million Internally Displaced Persons)](https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2025-press-releases/drc-over-1.5-million-children-need-protection#:~:text=About%203%20million%20people%20live,over%201.5%20million%20%2D%20are%20children.), and is the gateway to precious mineral mines in the region as well as being a humanitarian hub and a busy cross-border trading post.

The loss of key parts of the city represents a huge strategic blow to the Congolese military and will exacerbate one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.

Leaders of both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo were expected to meet in Kenya on Wednesday for emergency talks, but the DRC President has said [he will not attend](https://actualite.cd/2025/01/29/rdc-rwanda-tshisekedi-ne-participera-pas-au-sommet-de-leac-convoque-par-ruto).

UN Secretary General António Guterres’ demands for Rwanda to withdraw its troops and for M23 to cease its offensive have been ignored. [Thirteen peacekeepers were killed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2l07e550qko) in M23’s advance towards Goma last week.

Amid internet and power outages, the spread of disinformation online and ongoing fighting in the city, it has been hard to gain accurate information from the ground. Bellingcat geolocated footage emerging from the city and surrounding region to track the M23 assault.

The Long Presence of M23 in North Kivu

The M23 is a Rwanda-backed armed group whose stated goal is to defend Congolese Tutsis from surrounding communities. The group was formed in 2012 and seized Goma in the same year, but left the city shortly after being repelled by Congolese and UN troops. The group’s resurgence began in 2022 with the seizure of the town of Bunagana, on the Ugandan border north of Goma. The group’s advances south towards Goma and west into the mineral-rich territory of Masisi have displaced over [2 million people](https://www.internal-displacement.org/expert-analysis/m23-conflict-caused-nearly-3-out-of-every-4-displacements-in-the-drc-this-year/). US-backed peace negotiations held in Luanda, Angola, fell apart in late 2024 with Rwanda blaming the DRC for refusing to negotiate with M23 and DRC refusing to recognise M23 as anything more than a shadow army of the Rwandan government.

In a statement released Sunday, the [Rwandan government blamed](https://www.minaffet.gov.rw/updates/news-details/statement-on-situation-in-eastern-drc) the Congolese army for violating previous ceasefire agreements and said the M23 group was fighting to protect their community. They raised concerns about the ongoing conflict in the neighbouring country and accused the Congolese government of failing to enter negotiations with M23.

Goma is located at a cross-roads. The city shares a porous border with Rwanda to the east, and to the south, it borders the massive Lake Kivu. The west and the north are the traditional Congolese routes into the city along the paved N2 highway. Sake, an outlying town to the west of Goma, was taken by M23 on their way to the regional capital.

While the UN [peacekeeping force remains in the city](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159496), some were forced to temporarily take shelter amid the fighting.

## The Assault on Goma

The political wing of M23 had issued a statement on Saturday urging the Congolese military in Goma [to surrender in the next 48 hours](https://x.com/LawrenceKanyuka/status/1883170137723043925). M23 penetrated the city overnight on Sunday and fighting between the two sides intensified over the next few days.

In the early hours of Monday, a video was posted on [X](https://x.com/TshisolaYan/status/1883658422635340163) showing soldiers walking calmly along the road with heavy vehicles driving alongside them. We geolocated the video to [-1.681136, 29.234377](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1%C2%B040%2752.1%22S%2B29%C2%B014%2703.8%22E/%40-1.6811306%2C29.2318021%2C938m/data%3D%213m2%211e3%214b1%214m4%213m3%218m2%213d-1.681136%214d29.234377?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), on one of the city’s larger streets – Boulevard Kanyamahanga in downtown Goma.
