In 2024, 60% of cloud data breaches were caused by incorrect settings, which cost firms an average of $4.9 million per time (IBM Cost of a [Data Breach Report](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), 2024. How can businesses make sure they have strong security and consumer trust as they move to the cloud? The key to keeping data safe in the cloud is SOC 2 compliance. This blog talks about SOC 2’s role in keeping the cloud safe, its benefits, and how to make sure you’re following the rules by 2025.

**What does SOC 2 mean?**

The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) created SOC 2 (System and Organisation Controls 2), a compliance standard that checks how well service providers keep client data safe in cloud and SaaS settings. SOC 2 differs from SOC 1 (financial reporting) and SOC 3 (public summary) since it focuses on security and privacy controls. Its focus makes it perfect for enterprises that use the cloud initially.

**There are five Trust Services Criteria (TSC) that make up SOC 2:**

1. **Security**: Keeps those who aren’t supposed to be able to get in (for example, with encryption and firewalls).

2. **Availability**: Makes sure systems are running (for example, uptime for cloud platforms).
