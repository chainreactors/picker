Remote access outfit GoTo has admitted that a threat actor exfiltrated an encryption key that allowed access to "a portion" of encrypted backup files.

A third-party cloud storage service GoTo uses for its own products and affiliate biz LastPass was attacked in August 2022. GoTo and LastPass revealed the incident in separate notifications that *The Register* covered after the companies 'fessed up in [November 2022](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/01/lastpass/).

LastPass later [admitted](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/23/lastpass_attack_update/) that some of its source code was accessed, data stored in the cloud decrypted, and files containing customers' passwords copied. Thankfully those files were well encrypted, so customer data was likely not at risk unless they practiced poor password hygiene.
