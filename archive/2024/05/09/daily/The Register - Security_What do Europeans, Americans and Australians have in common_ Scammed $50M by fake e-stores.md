A crime ring dubbed BogusBazaar has scammed 850,000 people out of tens of millions of dollars via a network of dodgy shopping websites.

Victims in Western Europe, Australia, and America were tricked by these sham sites into placing orders for goods that either didn't exist or were cheap knock-offs, and had their credit card details harvested for fraud to boot.

The crooks behind the caper bagged roughly $50 million in the past three years from fake online stores spanning 22,500 domains, according to a [report](https://www.srlabs.de/blog-post/bogusbazaar) by analysts at SRLabs this week.

> The fraudsters managed to evade the attention of the law enforcement despite earning millions

"The operation of fraudulent webshops is a seemingly small but well-organized crime," Matthias Marx, a security consultant at SRLabs, told *The Register*.

"As each fraud case has a relatively low volume, the fraudsters seem to have managed to evade the attention of the law enforcement authorities despite earning millions."
