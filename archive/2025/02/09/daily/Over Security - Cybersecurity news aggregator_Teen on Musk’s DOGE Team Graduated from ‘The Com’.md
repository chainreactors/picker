# Teen on Musk’s DOGE Team Graduated from ‘The Com’

*Wired* reported this week that a 19-year-old working for **Elon Musk**‘s so-called **Department of Government Efficiency** (DOGE) was given access to sensitive US government systems even though his past association with cybercrime communities should have precluded him from gaining the necessary security clearances to do so. As today’s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘**The Com**,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.

Since President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk’s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the **U.S. Treasury**, the **Office of Personnel Management**, the **Department of Education**, and the **Department of Health and Human Resources**, among others.

*Wired* first [reported on Feb. 2](https://archive.ph/HCCA4) that one of the technologists on Musk’s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named **Edward Coristine**, who reportedly goes by the nickname “Big Balls” online. One of the companies Coristine founded, **Tesla.Sexy LLC**, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.

“Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,” *Wired* reported. “One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.”

Mr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In [a follow-up story](https://archive.ph/VAD48) this week, *Wired* found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.

Internet routing records [show](https://bgp.he.net/net/23.133.104.0/24#_whois) that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called **Packetware** (AS400495). Also known as “**DiamondCDN**,” Packetware [currently hosts](https://bgp.he.net/net/23.133.104.0/24#_dnsrecords) tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.

DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname “**Rivage**” on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as “Edward.”

From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage’s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.

Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel “**Dstat**,” a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. [Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ddos-site-dstatcc-seized-and-two-suspects-arrested-in-germany/) in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.

Coristine’s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called **Path Networks**, which *Wired* generously described as a “network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.” *Wired* wrote:

“At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees **Eric Taylor**, also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.”

The founder of Path is a young man named **Marshal Webb**. I wrote about Webb back in 2016, in a story about a DDoS defense company he co-founded called **BackConnect Security LLC**. On September 20, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity published data showing that the company [had a history of hijacking Internet address space that belonged to others](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ddos-mitigation-firm-has-history-of-hijacks/).

Less than 24 hours after that story ran, KrebsOnSecurity.com was [hit with the biggest DDoS attack the Internet had ever seen at the time](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/). That sustained attack [kept this site offline for nearly 4 days](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/).

The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was **Tucker Preston**, a Georgia man who [pleaded guilty in 2020](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/ddos-mitigation-firm-founder-admits-to-ddos/) to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.

The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor [pleaded guilty in 2017](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/men-who-sent-swat-team-heroin-to-my-home-sentenced/) to charges including [an attack on our home in 2013](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/the-world-has-no-room-for-cowards/). Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as “swatting.”

CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers [set up the Web site exposed[dot]su](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/credit-reports-sold-for-cheap-in-the-underweb/), which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed.

*Wired* noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn’t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website [pathtruths.com](https://www.pathtruths.com) includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine’s firing.

According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine’s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path’s technicians was a C...
