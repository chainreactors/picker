Following the emergence of data-leak sites (DLSs) for new extortion groups [Kairos](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/an-elephant-in-kairos-data-leak-site-emerges-for-new-extortion-group/), [Chort, Termite](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/the-devil-and-the-termite-data-leak-sites-emerge-for-chort-and-termite-extortion-groups/), and [CONTfr,](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/contfraversy-in-ransomland-tor-based-site-emerges-for-new-french-speaking-raas-operation-contfr/) Cyjax has observed a DLS for a group going by the name âArgonauts Groupâ. This group has claimed 10 victims so far. This brings the total of new DLSs discovered this month to seven, with a few days remaining in November. This continues the [general trend observed by Cyjax](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/here-there-ransomware-the-surge-of-new-ransomware-groups/) of a greater number of DLSs making their way onto the scene, with an [average of six groups emerging each month in 2024](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/data-leak-site-emergence-continues-to-increase/). Read on to find out what we know about the Argonauts Group so far.

**Figure 1** - Number of new DLS emerging for extortion groups per month in 2024.

### ContextÂ

*Extortion groups commonly use DLS to further extort victims, typically proceeding in multiple stages. The first threat is that the victimâs name and news of a successful attack against it will be published on the extortion groupâs website. Should this fail to motivate a victim to pay a ransom, the groupâs next step is typically to provide proof of the successful theft of its data, such as screenshots of internal file trees, samples of employee or customer PII, or other sensitive documents. The group may add a countdown at this stage, noting that should the victim fail to pay by the conclusion, it will make available to DLS visitors all stolen data, either for free or at cost.*

### Known locationsÂ

The Argonauts Group DLS consists of four main pages. The home page hosts a list of victims from which the group claims to have stolen data, which appears to advertise to visitors to the site should the visitors not comply with the groupâs demanded ransoms. Clicking on victim names directs to a specific page for each.

### VictimologyÂ

So far, the group has claimed attacks against 10 organisations. The victims primarily span the technology and manufacturing sectors and are located in Italy, but some are also based in Taiwan and Japan:

* 15 September 2024 - Taiwan-based medical research organisation **Ivy Life Sciences.**
* 20 September 2024 - Italy-based manufacturer **BOCCHI S.R.L.**
* 6 October 2024 - Taiwan-based technology company **Hung Jie Technology** **Corporation (å¼æ½ç§æè¡ä»½æéå¬å¸).**
* 9 October 2024 - Italy-based manufacturer **Contact S.R.L.**
* 9 October 2024 - Japan-based technology company **Zacros (è¤æ£®å·¥æ¥­æ ªå¼ä¼ç¤¾).**
* 22 October 2024 - â Italy- based healthcare organisation **Intermunicipal** **Avis Arnaldo Colombo.**
* 26 October 2024 - Italy-based aerospace and defence organisation company **AIAD.**
* 30 October 2024 - Italy-based transport organisation **FIT-CISL.**
* 8 November 2024 - US-based security solutions company **NUUO**

Argonaut Group has shared alleged samples of data for two victims, namely Ivy Life Sciences and Zacros. This data includes personally identifiable information (PII), internal documents and blueprints, and file names. The group claims to have stolen over 200GB of data from Ivy Life, and 140GB from Zacros, for which a PDF is available for visitors to download for free.Â

It is of note that this document is a Chinese-language letter dated 22 October 2024. Here, Zacros appears to acknowledge that its production systems had been restored from back-ups on 27 September 2024, following a ransomware attack that occurred on an unknown date. It is not clear from the letter whether this relates to an incident entirely separate from Argonauts Groupâs alleged breach, or whether they are one and the same.Â

It has advertised the Ivy Life and Zacros data via the DLS âdue to the companyâs refusal to pay the ransomâ. Regarding the other named victims, no data is yet available to view publicly; visitors must enter a password to uncover any other information on the page. Despite the groupâs claims, Cyjax has not identified any of the named victims publicly acknowledging any recent cyber incidents.

Other pages on the site are:Â

* Leak, which lists all alleged victims for which Argonaut Group has shared data samples.
* Sale, which lists all alleged victims for which Argonaut Group is advertising data for sale.
* Sold, which is currently empty. It is assumed that this is the page where the group would list victims, the data of which Argonaut Group has sold.

The Argonaut site appears incomplete. A link to a page titled âAbout USâ, simply resolves to the home page. The bottom of the home page lists icons that would appear to link to the groupâs pages on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and WordPress, but at the time of writing these do not resolve. A link to âArgonauts Groupâ directs to 127.0.0.1, which is also known as âlocalhostâ.

### Other locationsÂ

Cyjax has identified a user on a prominent English-language data-leak focused cybercriminal forum going by the name âArgonautsâ, who uses the same logo as the Argonauts Group as their profile picture. The account was registered on 21 November 2024 and a total of one post has been made, which has since been deleted. A copy of the post archived by Cyjax saw the user advertising data allegedly stolen from Hung Jie Technology Corporation. Given the shared name, date of account creation, and the naming of a victim initially advertised by Argonauts Group; Cyjax assesses that the same entity likely operates both the DLS and the forum account. The date of the groupâs first post is unclear. The postâs date of 15 September 2024 may b...
