In episode 29 of The AI Fix, an AI company makes the bold step of urging us to ‚Äústop hiring humans‚Äù, Graham is wrong about GB AI, parents prepare their kids for the imminent Moxie-mageddon, Google releases Gemini 2.0, and a robot is found dead at work and nobody knows why.

Graham inspects the AI Miss World competition for research purposes and wonders if our hosts should start an OnlyFans, and Mark meets an ‚Äúevolving‚Äù AI that wants to be a billionaire.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
