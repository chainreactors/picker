[Business email compromise (BEC)](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/business-email-compromise-bec/) exploits the main common denominator found across every technology, tool, and process – the humans that interact with it. Taking advantage of human decision making habits and emotions, BEC has remained one of the most lucrative attack methods seen in today’s cyber threat landscape.

This May, the FBI issued a public [warning](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230324) against BEC schemes, which they described as being one of the most financially damaging online crimes, capitalizing on the fact that email communication remains a steadfast tool for modern businesses. In fact, recent [reports](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/business-email-compromise-market-162703497.html) show that the market for BEC is expected to grow from a value of $1.1 billion in 2022 to an estimated $2.8 billion by 2027.

Like with all methods of cyberattack, threat actors continue to develop the tools of their trade and iterate on their processes to become more cost effective, efficient, and profitable. BEC attacks have also evolved in the last few years to exploit new vulnerabilities and bypass traditional security measures. In this post, learn how these email-based attacks have evolved over the past two decades to adapt to changing security solutions, the latest tactics and techniques threat actors are using in current BEC scams, and ways to protect against them in the long run.

## Emails From Nigerian Princes to High-Profile Attacks | How Business Email Compromise Has Evolved

In the early 2000s, the world saw some of the earliest phases of BEC scams take form. While the term “BEC” might not have been coined then, the fundamental elements in these attacks were already in motion. Early examples of social engineering tactics used in emails include:

* The Nigerian Prince Scam – One of the earliest and most notorious forms of BEC attacks is the “Nigerian Prince” or “419 scam”. It began as early as the 1980s through postal mail but transitioned to email in the early 2000s. Scammers claimed to be Nigerian princes or government officials seeking assistance to transfer a large sum of money out of their country. They promised to share the fortune with the recipient in return for a small fee to cover legal or administrative costs. This classic scam capitalized on people’s greed and willingness to believe in unlikely windfalls.
* Lottery and Inheritance Scams – Similar to the Nigerian Prince scam, these earlier forms of BEC attacks involved emails informing recipients that they had won a lottery or inherited a large sum of money from a distant relative. To claim the prize or inheritance, victims were asked to provide personal information or pay a fee upfront, leading to [identity theft](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/rise-in-identity-based-attacks-drives-demand-for-a-new-security-approach/) and financial loss.
* Overpayment Scams – In these attacks, scammers posed as potential customers or clients and contacted businesses regarding purchasing their products or services. They would then send a check or make a payment for an amount higher than the agreed-upon price and request the excess to be refunded. The initial payment would later bounce or be canceled, leaving the business out of pocket.
* Executive Impersonation – Early instances of executive impersonation involved scammers pretending to be high-ranking executives or business partners within an organization. They would instruct employees to perform certain tasks, such as transferring funds or sharing sensitive information, under the guise of confidentiality or urgency.

Early BEC scams were relatively simple and didn’t require sophisticated techniques from cyber criminals to launch successful attacks. Seeing how profitable these scams were and how easily they could be tailored to targeted higher profile targets, BEC attacks soon expanded to affect every industry vertical. According to the IC3, BEC fraud now costs global businesses just over $50 billion dollars with [reports](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230609) of scams reported in all 50 states and in 177 countries. The IC3 has also classified the threat of BEC as one of the leading categories of cybercrime by financial losses.

Macro socio-economic trends have also fostered an environment where modern BEC scams thrive. Since the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/three-key-challenges-for-cloud-security-in-a-world-changed-by-covid-19/), more workplaces and individuals conduct their business virtually, creating additional avenues of attack for BEC scammers. Rising use of cryptocurrency now also plays a role in the BEC, specifically in investment scams.

Right now, experts [say](https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/) that the number of emails sent per day is projected to increase to over 370 billion by 2025. Whether used for personal and business communication or to support massive e-commerce and e-marketing industries, emails are clear targets in modern malware campaigns, advanced persistent threats (APTs), [phishing attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing-scams/), identity theft, and more.

## Current Top Trends In Business Email Compromise Attacks

Today’s world is saturated by connection with billions of [internet-connected devices](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/bringing-iot-out-of-the-shadows/) linking everyone and everything together at all hours of the day. Considering global collaboration, smart mobile devices, and the accessibility provided by [cloud](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/securing-cloud-in-modern-times-how-businesses-can-build-cohesive-cloud-native-security-strategies/) technologies, emails are still the one, simple way to reach many at once making BEC attacks as relevant as ever.

As technology has advanced, BEC scammers have also furthered their craft. Many BEC scams are now much more sophisticated, involving multi-stage attacks and misuse of [artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/advancing-security-the-age-of-ai-machine-learning-in-cybersecurity/) along with targeting more attractive groups such as vendors, big banks, and [government](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/why-governments-and-agencies-are-targeted-by-cyber-attacks-a-deep-dive-into-the-motives/) entities. This section explores some of the top trends found in recent BEC attacks that enterprises need to stay alert for.

### Multi-Stage AiTM & BEC Attacks

Security professionals are [seeing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/06/08/detecting-and-mitigating-a-multi-stage-aitm-phishing-and-bec-campaign/) multi-stage, adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing and business email compromise (BEC) attacks against financial institutions and large banks. In these types of campaigns, threat actors seek to exploit trusted relationships between partnered organizations to bypass [multi-factor authentication](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/) (MFA) measures.
