TI Lookup: Real-World Use Cases
from a Malware Researcher

*Editor’s note: The current article is authored by Anna Pham* (*also known as RussianPanda), a threat intelligence researcher. You can find her latest research and insights on [X](https://x.com/RussianPanda9xx), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-p-868921105), and her [blog](https://russianpanda.com/).*

ANY.RUN introduced [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/) in February 2024, followed by the [YARA Search](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/yara-search/) in April 2024. This article will explore both services and their use cases.

## How Threat Intelligence Lookup Works

[Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup) allows users to search through the database of sandbox tasks by examining specific details such as:

* Processes
* Modules
* Files
* Network and registry activity

All of these are logged by the [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/).

The service helps users find critical information like IOCs (Indicators of compromise), events, sandbox reports, and other data corresponding to the search query.

The main page of the [Threat Intelligence](https://intelligence.any.run/) service provides a summary of the most common [MITRE](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-attack/) techniques used, malware threat statistics, and popular [Suricata rules](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/detection-with-suricata-ids/) derived from submitted samples, offering valuable insight into current cyber threat trends.

After navigating to the [Lookup section](https://intelligence.any.run/) you’ll be able to submit your search query using over 40 different search parameters.

Explore all search parameters available in TI Lookup in [the following article.](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-lookup-search-parameters/) ANY.RUN also offers a comprehensive query guide for the TI Lookup once you’re on the platform.

Let’s now look into a few use cases with some of TI Lookup’s key search parameters.

## Searching for Stealers Reaching out to Telegram

We can create a query to identify [stealers](https://any.run/malware-trends/stealer) reaching out to [Telegram](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/intercept-stolen-data-in-telegram/) IPs, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data, using the “*destinationIpAsn*” and “*threatName*” parameters, as shown below, for the past three months or 180 days. You can also search within 60, 30, 14, 7, 3, or 1-day intervals and bookmark the search query for later use.

Here is the query:

|  |
| --- |
| [destinationIpAsn:"Telegram Messenger Inc" AND threatName:"stealer" AND threatName:"exfiltration"](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_use_cases_from_researcher&utm_term=021024&utm_content=linktolookup#%7B%2522query%2522:%2522destinationIpAsn:%255C%2522Telegram%25C2%25A0Messenger%25C2%25A0Inc%255C%2522%25C2%25A0AND%25C2%25A0threatName:%255C%2522stealer%255C%2522%25C2%25A0AND%25C2%25A0threatName:%255C%2522exfiltration%255C%2522%2522,%2522dateRange%2522:180%7D) |

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image3-1024x851.png)

The search results show the associated IPs, Events, Files, Tasks, Synchronization (events and [mutexes](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mutex-search-in-ti-lookup/) created), and [Network threats](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/suricata-search/).

From the Files tab, users can extract indicators and save them in JSON format.
