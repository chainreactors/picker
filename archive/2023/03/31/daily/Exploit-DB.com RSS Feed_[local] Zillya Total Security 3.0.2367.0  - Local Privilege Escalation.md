# Version: IS (3.0.2367.0) / TS (3.0.2368.0)
# Tested on: Windows 10 Professional x64

Vulnerabiliy Description:
---------------------------------------
Zillya's processes run in SYSTEM privileges. The user with low privileges in the system can copy any file they want
to any location by using the quarantine module in Zillya. This is an example of AVGater vulnerabilities that are often
found in antivirus programs.

You can read the article about AVGater vulnerabilities here:
https://bogner.sh/2017/11/avgater-getting-local-admin-by-abusing-the-anti-virus-quarantine/

The vulnerability affects both "Zillya Total Security" and "Zillya Internet Security" products.

Step by step produce:
---------------------------------------
1 - Attackers create new folder and into malicious file. It can be a DLL or any file.

2 - Attacker waits for "Zillya Total Security" or "Zillya Internet Security" to quarantine him.

3 - The created folder is linked with the Google Symbolic Link Tools "Create Mount Point" tools to the folder that
the current user does not have write permission to.

You can find these tools here: https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools

4 - Restores the quarantined file. When checked, it is seen that the file has been moved to an unauthorized location.
This is evidence of escalation vulnerability. An attacker with an unauthorized user can write to directories that require
authorization. Using techniques such as DLL hijacking, it can gain access to SYSTEM privileges.

Advisories:
---------------------------------------
Developers should not allow unauthorized users to restore from quarantine unless necessary.

Also, it should be checked whether the target file has been copied to the original location. Unless necessary, users
should not be able to interfere with processes running with SYSTEM privileges. All processes on the user's side should
be run with normal privileges.

Disclosure Timeline:
---------------------------------------
13.11.2022 - Vulnerability reported via email but no response was given and the fix was not released.
02.12.2022 - Full disclosure.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the ...
