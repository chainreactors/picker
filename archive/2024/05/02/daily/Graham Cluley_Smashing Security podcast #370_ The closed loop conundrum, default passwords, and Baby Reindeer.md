The UK Government takes aim at IoT devices shipping with weak or default passwords, a man spends two years incarcerated after being mistaken for the person who stole his identity, and are you au fait with the latest scams?

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Paul Ducklin.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
