# 12 Million Zacks accounts leaked by cybercriminal

Posted: February 14, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A cybercriminal claimed to have stolen 15 million data records from the customers and clients of the company Zacks—a number that a separate investigation, after analysis, shaved down to just 12 million.

Zacks is an investment research company best known for its “Zacks Ranks,” which are daily lists that provide stock market watchers and likely investors with possible company portfolio purchases, ranked on a scale from one to five.

Over the years Zacks has suffered a few [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach). In 2023, [data allegedly belonging to Zacks containing 8,615,098 records](https://www.scworld.com/news/zacks-confirms-iaccount-data-hacked) was leaked online. The most recent data in this database is from May 2020. The data contains names, email addresses, usernames, passwords, phone numbers, addresses, company names, and additional personal information. This leak is being publicly shared on online forums.

In October 2024, we found data reported to belong to Zacks containing 8,441 records which includes email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, and full names, and potentially other compromised user details. This breach is also being publicly shared on the internet.

Now, a cybercriminal using the monicker Jurak, leaked [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) related to roughly 12 million accounts, which allegedly stems from a breach that happened last year.

![Jurak's post on BreachForums](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Jurak_post.jpg)

Cybercriminals leaks data allegedly stolen from Zacks

> “In June 2024, Zacks Investment Research suffered a data breach exposing their source code and their databases containing 15M lines of their customers and clients. This would be the 2nd (hacked back in 2020) major data breach for Zacks.
>
> The data leaked in this thread contains usernames, emails, addresses, full names, phone numbers.
>
> I thought about releasing the source code, but I don’t want every retard to have access to it. If you have high reputation and want the source code send a PM
>
> Breached by @**Jurak** and @StableFish
>
> Below is a sample of the customers database:
>
> CLUE , HINT , PASSWORD , USERNAME , LAST\_NAME , FIRST\_NAME , CUSTOMER\_ID , DATE\_REGISTERED , DATE\_UPDATED , DISPLAY\_NAME , FIRM\_NAME , TIMEZONE\_CODE , LAST\_PASSWORD\_CHANGE”

[BleepingComputer says](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-leaks-account-data-of-12-million-zacks-investment-users/) it has reached out to Zacks on several occasions but didn’t get a response. As with other [recent claims](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/20-million-openai-accounts-offered-for-sale) by criminals on BreachForums we have to be careful to take their word for anything, but Jurak claims they breached Zacks themselves in June 2024.

![I breached Zacks myself](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/June_2024.jpg)

“I breached Zacks myself”

Jurak told BleepingComputer that they gained access to the company’s active directory as a domain admin and then stole source code for the main site (Zacks.com) and 16 other websites, including some internal websites. They also shared samples of the source code they had stolen as proof...
