# FCC adopts new rule targeting robocalls

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday adopted a new rule which will give consumers more caller ID data in an effort to combat a rising number of robocalls, particularly from overseas.

The agency’s decision to approve a [proposal](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-415059A1.pdf) released on October 7 means the FCC will broaden the definition of “caller identity information,” implement new requirements for service providers and mandate that providers alert consumers when calls are coming from overseas and block the use of U.S. area codes for calls that originate in foreign countries.

The rule also requires voice providers to verify that caller name and other information transmitted to consumers is accurate.

In voting to approve the measure FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said that robocalls are the number one consumer complaint to the agency.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr said that under the new rule providers will not only be required to display a “verified caller name” but also “other useful data like a brand logo or the reason for a call.”

“With more information, people can stop guessing and start making better informed decisions,” he said.

Carr said the agency focused some of the new rulemaking on foreign originated robocalls because a large number of “fraudulent and unwanted” calls come from overseas.

“If this type of transparency encourages corporations to onshore more of their call center operations, then that will be an added benefit too,” he said.
