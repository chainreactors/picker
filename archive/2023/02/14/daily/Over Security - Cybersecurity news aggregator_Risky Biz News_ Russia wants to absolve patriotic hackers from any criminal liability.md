The Russian government is exploring the possibility of absolving Russian patriotic hackers from criminal liability for attacks carried out "in the interests of the Russian Federation."

The head of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, [Alexander Khinshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Khinshtein), told reporters at a press conference on Friday the exemption would be granted to individuals located abroad and within Russia's borders alike.

"We will talk in more detail when it receives more of a clear wording," Khinshtein said, as quoted by [RIA](https://ria.ru/20230210/khakery-1851213742.html) and [TASS](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/17021313).

Currently, the creation, use, and distribution of malicious computer software is punishable in Russia with up to seven years in prison. There are no exemptions to this law, so many of the current pro-Kremlin hacktivist groups are actually breaking Russian law and could technically face prosecution, especially in the aftermath of a possible regime change.

The exemption would allow pro-Kremlin hacktivists to carry out attacks with a legal carte blanche and would most likely apply to the likes of Killnet, XakNet, NoName057(16), CyberArmyRussia, FRwL Team, and the rest of their ilk.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Reddit security breach:** Social network Reddit [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/10y427y/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_we_know/) that earlier this month, a sophisticated phishing campaign targeted its staff and successfully breached the account of one of its employees. The company says the attackers only gained access to some internal dashboards and business systems that contained internal documents and some of its source code. The intruders did not gain access to primary production systems nor to any user passwords and accounts. Reddit says the incident was quickly dealt with after the phished employee self-reported the issue to its security team. This marks Reddit's second breach after another threat actor gained access to its internal systems [back in 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) in an incident that also exposed some old user passwords.

**Oakland ransomware attack:** The city of Oakland, California, was hit by a ransomware attack that encrypted some of its IT systems. Officials say they detected the attack on Wednesday and have shut down all the city's IT systems to prevent the attack from spreading and to restore systems safely. [Officials say](https://www.oaklandca.gov/news/2023/city-of-oakland-targeted-by-ransomware-attack-core-services-not-affected) the incident did not affect the activity of its 911, fire, and emergency services. The ransomware gang behind the attack has yet to be identified.

**Technion ransomware attack:** A ransomware gang named DarkBit has hacked and encrypted the IT systems of Israel's Institute of Technology, Technion, a public research university based in Haifa. The hackers are requesting 80 bitcoin ($1.7 million) to decrypt the organization's network, according to a [ransom note](https://mastodon.social/%40underthebreach%40infosec.exchange/109851005630710836) shared by Israeli threat intel firm HudsonRock.

**New Ali's Justice (Edalat-e Ali) hack:** Iranian hacktivist group Ali's Justice (Edalat-e Ali) has [hijacked](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202302119802) the signal of Iran's state television channel IRIB on the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, which took place on Saturday, February 11. The hacktivist group interrupted a speech from Iran President Ebrahim Raisi and replaced it with a call to the Iranian people to withdraw money from government banks and to assemble in new anti-government protests to take place on February 16. The interruption only lasted one minute and was also accompanied by a "Death to Khamenei" slogan.
