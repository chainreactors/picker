## DOGE as a National Cyberattack

In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. And the implications for national security are profound.

First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had [accessed](https://bsky.app/profile/wyden.senate.gov/post/3lh5ejpwncc23) [the](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html) [US](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-doge-treasury-access-federal-payments.html) [Treasury](https://therecord.media/union-groups-sue-treasury-over-giving-doge-access-to-data) computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department’s roughly [$5.45 trillion](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/fds/) in annual federal payments.

Then, we learned that uncleared DOGE personnel had gained access to [classified](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/usaid-security-leaders-removed-refusing-elon-musks-doge-employees-acce-rcna190357) data from the US Agency for International Development, possibly copying it onto their own systems. Next, the Office of Personnel Management—which holds detailed personal data on millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances—[was](https://fedscoop.com/opm-email-federal-workforce-lawsuit-server-privacy-security/) [compromised](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/elon-musk-seizes-computer-system-171738117.html). After that, [Medicaid and Medicare records](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-aides-search-medicare-agency-payment-systems-fraud-wsj-reports-2025-02-05/) were compromised.

Meanwhile, only partially redacted names of CIA employees [were sent](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5129170-cia-email-employee-identities/) over an unclassified email account. DOGE personnel are also reported to be [feeding](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/) Education Department data into artificial intelligence software, and they have also [started working](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/three-doge-members-raise-access-concerns-us-energy-department-sources-say-2025-02-07/) at the Department of Energy.

This story is moving very fast. On Feb. 8, a federal judge [blocked](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-accessing-payment-systems-2025-02-08/) the DOGE team from accessing the Treasury Department systems any further. But given that DOGE workers have already copied data and possibly installed and modified software, it’s unclear how this fixes anything.

In any case, breaches of other critical government systems are likely to follow unless federal employees stand firm on the protocols protecting national security.

The systems that DOGE is accessing are not esoteric pieces of our nation’s infrastructure—they are the [sinews of government](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/elon-musk-weaponizes-the-government).

For example, the Treasury Department systems contain the technical blueprints for how the federal government moves money, while the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) network contains information on who and what organizations the government employs and contracts with.

What makes this situation unprecedented isn’t just the scope, but also the method of attack. Foreign adversaries typically spend years attempting to penetrate government systems such as these, using stealth to avoid being seen and carefully hiding any tells or tracks. The Chinese government’s 2015 breach of [OPM](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chinese-hackers-breach-federal-governments-personnel-office/2015/06/04/889c0e52-0af7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html) was a significant US security failure, and it illustrated how personnel data could be used to identify intelligence officers and compromise national security.

In this case, external operators with [limited experience](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/) and minimal oversight are doing their work in plain sight and under massive public scrutiny: gaining the highest levels of [administrative access](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base) and making changes to the United States’ most sensitive networks, potentially introducing new security vulnerabilities in the process.

But the most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted. It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—[by](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge) removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.

The Treasury’s computer systems have such an impact on national security that they were designed with the same principle that guides nuclear launch protocols: No single person should have unlimited power. Just as launching a nuclear missile requires two separate officers turning their keys simultaneously, making changes to critical financial systems traditionally requires multiple authorized personnel working in concert.

This approach, known as “separation of duties,” isn’t just bureaucratic red tape; it’s a fundamental security principle as old as banking itself. When your local bank processes a large transfer, it requires two different employees to verify the transaction. When a company issues a major financial report, separate teams must review and approve it. These aren’t just formalities—they’re essential safeguards against corruption and error. These measures have been [bypassed or ignored](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/). It’s as if someone found a way to rob Fort Knox by simply declaring that the new official policy is to fire all the guards and allow unescorted visits to the vault.

The implications for national security are [staggering](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-biggest-breach-of-u-s-government-data-is-under-way/). Sen. Ron Wyden said his office had learned that the attackers gained [privileges](https://securityaffairs.com/173776/security/elon-musk-s-doge-granted-full-access-to-sensitive-treasury-systems.html) that allow them to modify core programs in Treasury Department computers that verify federal payments, access encrypted keys that secure financial transactions, and alter audit logs that record system changes. Over at OPM, reports indicate that individuals associated with DOGE [connected](https://www.rawstory.com/elon-musk-doge-lawsuit/) an una...
