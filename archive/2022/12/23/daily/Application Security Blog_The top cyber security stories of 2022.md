Yes, ‘tis the season when cyber security experts gaze into the crystal ball to tell us what to expect in the coming year, which is fine, but it’s also good to look in the rearview at a year that will be over next week, both for what happened but also for what it all might mean and what we can learn from it.

With that as a goal, you could say (or sing) along with the late Frank Sinatra that “it was a very good year.” Not all good news, but plenty to learn. Even when it’s painful, it’s useful.

They include the breach of the federal Office of Personnel Management, discovered in 2014, that compromised the personal and financial information of more than 22 million current and former federal employees; [Stuxnet](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/), which destroyed a significant portion of Iran’s nuclear facilities in 2010; [Industroyer](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/01/04/blackenergy-trojan-strikes-again-attacks-ukrainian-electric-power-industry/), which brought down a portion of the energy grid in Ukraine in 2016; the 2021 [ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/08/colonial-pipeline-cyber-attack-485984) that led to the shutdown of nearly half the fuel supply to the East Coast for almost a week; and the discovery a year ago of Log4Shell group of vulnerabilities in the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) (ASF) open source logging library [Log4j](/blog/mitigating-impact-of-l...
