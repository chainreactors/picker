The percentage of confirmed data breaches involving third-party relationships doubled last year as cybercriminals increasingly exploited weak links in supply chains and partner ecosystems.

That's according to Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) —one of the industry's most-watched autopsies on what actually goes wrong in infosec. This year's edition, released Wednesday, covers incidents that occurred between November 1, 2023, and October 31, 2024.

It found that the proportion of breaches involving third parties rose from 15 percent in last year's dataset to 30 percent in this year's report. This figure includes those breaches (incidents in which data loss was confirmed) caused by exploited software vulnerabilities and supply chain compromises.
