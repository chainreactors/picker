# How Google, Adidas, and more were breached in a Salesforce scam

Posted: August 7, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

At the heart of multiple [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) against sophisticated and robust companies, including Google, Adidas, Louis Vuitton, and Chanel, was a rudimentary attack method that required little technical finesse—making a phone call.

By disguising themselves as IT support personnel on the phone, hackers belonging to the group “ShinyHunters” successfully tricked the employees at several multinational corporations into handing over the data within their own Salesforce platforms. The attacks underscore the vulnerability that all businesses face—large or small—in preventing cyberattacks that begin through basic [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) scams.

In a bizarre twist of irony, security researchers at Google Threat Intelligence Group (GITG) [originally uncovered the hacking campaign in June](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion), only to announce that Google itself had been hit by the very same tactic this week. Other victims in the [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) campaign include [Allianz Life](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/allianz-life-says-majority-of-1-4-million-us-customers-info-breached), the airline [Qantas](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/07/qantas-breach-affects-6-million-people-significant-amount-of-data-likely-taken), and the jeweler Pandora.

The data breaches all leverage a Salesforce feature that allows users to connect to various, external apps. This functionality allows business owners and employees to, for instance, connect their Salesforce data to mapping tools to visualize the locations of a customer base, or to connect their Salesforce data with a newsletter platform to deliver email marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.

In the attacks, the hackers trick employees into connecting to a fraudulent version of Salesforce’s “Data Loader” app, which lets users import, export, update, and delete large quantities of data that are stored or managed within Salesforce itself. The process for connecting to an external app is simple, as employees just enter an 8-digit code when prompted by Salesforce. But once ensnared in the [phone scam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/scam-call), employees are tricked into entering an 8-digit code that will connect to a data exfiltration program owned and operated entirely by the hackers.

Once connected, the hackers are free to roam inside the company’s Salesforce data and steal what they see fit. Some attacks reportedly included an expansion by the hackers into other corporate online accounts, including Microsoft 365, which could reveal a company’s emails and other sensitive messages.

In the attack against Google, the hackers accessed a Salesforce “instance,” which is a term used to describe a company or user’s implementation of software and the data they manage through that software (Think of it like when a hacker breaches an online account and then pilfers all the data related to that account and what it can access). In the Google attack, the Salesforce instance “was used to store contact information and related notes for...
