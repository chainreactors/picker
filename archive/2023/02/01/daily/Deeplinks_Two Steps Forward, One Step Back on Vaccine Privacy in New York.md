EFF was proud to support New York’s A. [7326](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/A7326)/S. 6541, which the legislature passed to protect the confidentiality of medical immunity information. It limits what data can be collected or shared, who it can be shared with, and how long it can be stored. (In New York, bills must have identical versions in each chamber.) It’s important to put privacy protections in place now to ensure personal medical information is kept safe, and that that information won’t be used to harm the most vulnerable members of our society.

The original bill would have protected people from having their information misused by private companies, the government, or other entities that wish to track their movements or use their private medical information to punish or discriminate against them. It also would have expressly prohibited immunity information from being shared with immigration agencies seeking to deport someone, or with child services seeking to take away their children. Finally, it would have required those asking for immunity information to accept an analog credential, such as a paper record.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the bill into law at the end of December. Unfortunately, she [amended the bill](https://www.eff.org/document/ny-gov-hochul-signing-memorandum-vaccine-confiden...
