@ Bruce,

> “I’m speaking at Mobile World Congress”

There was a time I would have said meet-up in the bar there, but I nolonger go to Barcelona for that or other telco-related conferences.

The world has changed a lot in this past couple of decades, and I’m not even sure these big trade shows and conferences realy have much life left in them.

I remember back in the 1980’s maning a trade show stand either for my employer or association nearly every other week / weekend. They were fun times for a “foot loose” young man.

Whilst I’m not quite ready for a bath-chair, blanket, and hot coco, the attraction for such major events has waned.
