## GameOn? It's looking more like game over for that biz

The co-founder and former CEO of AI startup GameOn is in a pickle. After exiting the top job last year under a cloud, he's now in court – along with his wife – for allegedly bilking his company and its investors out of more than $60 million.

Federal prosecutors in California [announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/founder-and-former-ceo-san-francisco-technology-company-and-attorney-indicted-years) this week a 25-count indictment of Alexander Beckman and his wife Valerie Lau Beckman, with charges ranging from wire and securities fraud to identity theft and obstruction of justice. It is claimed the pair screwed GameOn, now known as ON Platform, out of millions of dollars between 2018 and July 2024, when ON finally parted ways with Beckman after months of concerns over the financial state of the business.

The pair, of San Francisco, were arrested following a FBI investigation, and appeared in federal court in the city on Thursday morning for an initial hearing. They are presumed innocent unless and until convicted.
