The IRS has paid an Israeli company hundreds of thousands of dollars for an internet investigative tool that allows the IRS to conduct undercover investigations online, according to internal IRS documents obtained by Motherboard. Cobwebs Technologies, the company behind the tool, sometimes sells its platform with a facial recognition and other AI-focused capabilities add-on.

The news shows the continued use of AI-linked tools by law enforcement, and that of the IRS’ Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) unit specifically, which has invested heavily in modern technologies, [including systems based on the harvesting of cell phone location data](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7agpa/irs-location-data-venntel-contract), and [blockchain analysis tools](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7xz35e/us-law-enforcement-have-spent-hundreds-of-thousands-on-bitcoin-tracking-tools). The news comes as Republicans try to prevent the Biden administration from hiring tens of thousands of new IRS employees. Mitch McConnell, for example, [wrote an op-ed](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/10/05/mitch-mcconnell-dont-let-joe-biden-irs-snoop-bank-account/5990038001/) stating that “Biden wants to give the IRS the OK to snoop on your bank account.”

“Cobwebs web-based subscriptions are needed to help implement and support the IRS-CI Cyber Crime Strategy to focus on cyber-enabled crime,” one of the documents reads. Motherboard obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the IRS.

The IRS paid Cobwebs $181,000 in August 2020, and $229,000 in August 2022, according to procurement records. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also bought Cobwebs’ products, paying the company $226,060 in August 2022, and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, [a part of the DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/office-intelligence-and-analysis), has paid Cobwebs more than $1.5 million, the records show.

Cobwebs describes itself as “a global leader in AI-Powered Open-Source Intelligence,” and says “Our mission is to protect global communities and organizations from crime, threats, and cyber-attacks, by providing seamless access to publicly available data.”

Cobwebs’ main product is called Tangles, which lets users search content across social networks, the open web, and the dark web. It can include an artificial intelligence module that adds features such as facial and image recognition, [according to Cobwebs’ website](https://cobwebs.com/press-releases/cobwebs-technologies-redefining-the-norms-of-cyber-intelligence/). Tangles is designed to work even if a social media site changes its API rules, the site suggests. Cobwebs offers this system to government agencies and private companies. It then also offers two extras to only government customers, called Trapdoor and Lynx, the website adds.

The IRS documents show the deal included the “LYNX add-on for every named user.” Lynx provides a global network of proxies that investigators can use to remain anonymous, [according to Cobwebs’ site](https://cobwebs.com/blog/adapting-humint-methodology-for-cyber-investigations/). “With Lynx, analysts can join darknet forums, hacker communities and other platforms without their cover being blown. With a single solution provided by Cobwebs and by using the proxies provided by Lynx, investigators can work in complete virtual isolation and collect and capture all necessary content from across all layers of the internet without disclosing or jeopardizing resources,” it reads.

Cobwebs also has a financial investigations platform that it says on its website can “identify frauds/money mule threats,” and “gauge reputation risk and conduct due diligence powered by AI.”

An IRS-CI spokesperson told Motherboard in an email that IRS-CI “conducts a variety of financial investigations, which include tax, money laundering, organized crime, drug t...
