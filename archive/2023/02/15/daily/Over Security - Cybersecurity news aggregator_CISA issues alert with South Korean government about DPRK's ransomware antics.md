## CISA issues alert with South Korean government about DPRK’s ransomware antics

February 13, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

CISA and other federal agencies were joined by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Defense Security Agency of the Republic of Korea (ROK) in releasing [the latest cybersecurity advisory](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa23-040a) in the US government’s ongoing [#StopRansomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog?s=stopransomware) effort. This alert highlights continuous state-sponsored ransomware activities by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) against organizations in the US healthcare sector and other vital infrastructure sectors. The agencies have reason to believe cryptocurrency ransom payments from such operations support DPRK’s “national-level priorities and objectives”.

“North Korea’s cyber program poses a growing espionage, theft, and attack threat,” the Annual Threat Assessment report in 2021 [said](https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2021-Unclassified-Report.pdf). “North Korea has conducted cyber theft against financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, potentially stealing hundreds of millions of dollars, probably to fund government priorities, such as its nuclear and missile programs.”

DPRK has a lengthening history of conducting ransomware attacks against organizations in both US and South Korean territories, some of which have become “mainstream” to fund their other cybercrime activities. Who can forget [WannaCry](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wannacry) in 2017, for example, the strain that attacked unpatched Windows systems that remained vulnerable against [EternalBlue](https://www.malwarebytes.com/glossary/eternalblue)? The US and UK had recognized that North Korea, via the [Lazarus Group](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/03/the-advanced-persistent-threat-files-lazarus-group), a nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) group, was responsible for unleashing WannaCry to the world.

Then there’s [Magniber](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/10/magniber-ransomware-exclusively-for-south-koreans) ransomware, a strain distributed by the [Magnitude exploit kit (EK)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/08/enemy-at-the-gates-reviewing-the-magnitude-exploit-kit-redirection-chain) in late 2017. Magniber only targets systems located in South Korea, an attribute unique only to itself. This makes Magniber the first ransomware to home in on a single country.

In the last few years, two new ransomware strains from DPRK have surfaced: Maui and H0lyGh0st.

[Andariel](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/maui-ransomware-operation-linked-to-north-korean-andariel-hackers/) (aka Silent Chollima and Stonefly), the APT group believed to be behind Maui ransomware campaigns, has been [attacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/07/north-korean-apt-targets-us-healthcare-sector-with-maui-ransomware) Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector organizations since May 2021. Once it arrives on target networks, it encrypts servers responsible for record-keeping, diagnosing, imaging services, and others. As a result, Maui attack victims experience severe disruption for prolonged periods.

H0lyGh0st, like other current ransomware gangs, favors double-extortion tactics, maintains a leak site, and targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Microsoft [believed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/14/north-korean-threat-actor-targets-small-and-midsize-businesses-with-h0lygh0st-ransomware/) it has ties with PLUTONIUM, another North Korean APT, as the H0lyGh0st ga...
