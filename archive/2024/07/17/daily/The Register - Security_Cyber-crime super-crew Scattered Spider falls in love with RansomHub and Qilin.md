The Scattered Spider cybercrime group is now using RansomHub and Qilin ransomware variants in its attacks, illustrating a possible power shift among hacking groups.

This is all according to the incident response engagements from the second quarter of the year involving Microsoft, which has described the group as one of the most sophisticated and threatening of its kind currently in operation.

Scattered Spider – which hit Las Vegas casinos last year [among many other victims](https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/15/scattered_spider_snares_100_victims/), and is tracked as Octo Tempest by Microsoft, or the gazillion other aliases it has depending on who's doing the talking – accounts for "a significant bulk of [Microsoft's] investigations."
