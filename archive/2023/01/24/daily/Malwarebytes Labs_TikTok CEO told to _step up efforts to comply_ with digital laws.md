# TikTok CEO told to “step up efforts to comply” with digital laws

Posted: January 23, 2023

EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, the EU’s digital policy chief, “explicitly conveyed” to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew that the company must “step up efforts to comply” with the European Union’s rules on copyright, data protection, and the [Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package)—an EU regulation setting out “an unprecedented new standard for the accountability of online platforms regarding illegal and harmful content”.

According to the [Associate Press](https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-mobile-apps-european-union-europe-d7aca9860f443b4e55227eec06c88567), this transpired in a call on Thursday, January 19, wherein Breton and Chew discussed how TikTok plans to comply with the DSA, which is set to take effect on September 2023. The act will require online platforms to reduce harmful content online and combat online risks. Online platforms [include](https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2022/december/1/eu-digital-services-act-key-action-points-for-february-2023-and-later-deadlines) (but may not be limited to) social networks and online marketplaces.

The West has been scrutinizing TikTok for years because of its parent company’s potential ties with the government of the People’s Republic of China. This alone brought up a lot of cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Though the company has consistently denied such a relationship, this didn’t stop state governments and [private companies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/07/tiktok-may-be-banned) from banning the app from worker and employee phones, labeling it an [“unacceptable security risk”](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/07/tiktok-is-unacceptable-security-risk-and-should-be-removed-from-app-stores-says-fcc) and a [“Chinese Trojan Horse”](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/indiana-sues-tiktok-describes-it-as-chinese-trojan-horse), accusing it of being a tool to [promote various forms of misinformation](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/07/tiktok-owner-bytedance-pushed-a-pro-china-agenda-to-americans-say-former-employees) and spying, and classing it as another social platform that doesn’t take the security of children’s [privacy](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/09/tiktok-faces-28m-fine-for-failing-to-protect-childrens-privacy) and [well-being](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2022/07/the-wren-eleanor-story-why-you-should-keep-your-kids-off-social-media) seriously.

“With younger audiences comes greater responsibility,” Breton said, according to a readout of his call with Chew. “It is not acceptable that behind seemingly fun and harmless features, it takes users seconds to access harmful and sometimes even life-threatening content.”

“We will not hesitate to adopt the full scope of sanctions to protect our citizens if audits do not show full compliance,” Breton further said.

Early last week, four European Commission officials met with Chew in Brussels to discuss growing concerns from Western countries, ranging from online child safety to the flow of user data to China.
