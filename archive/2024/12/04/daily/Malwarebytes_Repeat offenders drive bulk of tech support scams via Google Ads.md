# Repeat offenders drive bulk of tech support scams via Google Ads

Posted: December 3, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Of all the different kinds of malicious search ads we track, those related to customer service are by far the most common. Brands such as PayPal, eBay, Apple or Netflix are among the most coveted ones as they tend to drive a lot of online searches.

Tech support scammers are leveraging Google ads to lure victims in, getting them on the phone and finally fleecing them. While hard to measure precisely, tech support scams accounted for $924M, according to the FBI’s [2023 Internet Crime Report](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf).

We’ve identified specific advertiser accounts that make up the bulk of fraudulent ads we have reported to Google this past year. What’s interesting is that the scammers keep reusing the same accounts over time. For instance, one advertiser had over 30 reported incidents in the past 3 months.

While it would be foolish to assume fraudsters would stop scamming altogether if those accounts were terminated, it also exposes something problematic with our reporting, and to a greater extent with how Google’s policies apply to repeat offenders.

## Search for help, find a scam

Search engines, and Google’s in particular, are our gateway to the web. Yet, that door sometimes opens up to unsavory places thanks to sponsored search results, AKA ads.

Take this search for ‘*paypal help*‘ which displays an ad as the first result, followed by the official website. While the organic result looks more trustworthy, it does appear under. We should also note that sometimes it shows way below the fold, as documented in our recent blog “[*Printer problems? Beware the bogus help*](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2024/11/printer-problems-beware-the-bogus-help)“.

Not only is the ad malicious, it is also linking to a fraudulent page hosted on Google Sites, Google’s free platform to build websites. The scammers created it with PayPal’s logo to make it look legitimate, with — quite literally — a simple call to action.

Somewhere far in Asia, someone in a call centre is waiting to welcome the next victim by starting with “*Hi, welcome to PayPal support, my name is John, how can I help you?*“

## Repeat offenders

We have found and reported many of such fraudulent ads to Google over the past year. At some point, we realized that the same advertiser accounts kept coming up, begging the question: why would an account with multiple incidents not get blocked permanently?

In the screenshot below, you can see the same advertiser ID associated with over 30 incidents in a period of around 3 months.

In fact, these are only the malicious ads we were able to find, using our own tools. For example, not in the list of targeted brands in our tracking for this account is Amazon. Looking at this advertiser via Google’s Ads Transparency Center, we see a fraudulent ad we had missed reporting:
