## Introduction

The Windows registry is a central database that is leveraged by the operating system and many applications to store all sorts of configuration information and user preferences.

Leveraging data from the registry can provide key insights to an investigation that may not be found in other artifacts. A few of the key areas of focus are:

* User activity (program execution, files and folders accessed, urls types, and much more!)
* System configuration (OS information, hostname, timezone, adapter settings, network configuration, audit policy, and much more)
* Installed applications
* Attached storage devices
* Malware persistence

If you are looking to dive straight into key forensic artifacts from the registry check out one of our previous blog posts!

## Registry Basics and Structure

### What Is the Windows Registry?

A hierarchical structured database used by the system and applications to store configuration data, state information, usage telemetry, and more.

The following are **key concepts** related to the Windows Registry:

| Concept | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| **[Registry Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-files)** | [REGF](https://github.com/libyal/libregf/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20NT%20Registry%20File%20%28REGF%29%20format.asciidoc) formatted binary files used to store registry data.  ``` Ex. C:\windows\system32\Config\SOFTWARE ``` |
| **[Transaction Logs](https://github.com/msuhanov/regf/blob/master/Windows%20registry%20file%20format%20specification.md#format-of-transaction-log-files)** | Multiple [REGF](https://github.com/libyal/libregf/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20NT%20Registry%20File%20%28REGF%29%20format.asciidoc) formatted files that record changes to the registry before writing to the registry files. This ensures data can be recovered in case of an error. Must be reviewed when registry files are “dirty” – uncommitted changes exist in the transaction log. Read more about transaction logs [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/digging-up-the-past-windows-registry-forensics-revisited/).   ``` Ex. C:\windows\System32\Config\SOFTWARE.LOG1 ``` |
| **[Registry Hives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-hives)** | Logical grouping/view of registry data loaded in memory.  ``` Ex. HKLM\Software ``` |
| **Keys** | Named “folder” like objects that contain last write timestamps, subkeys, and values. |
| **Subkeys** | A key that is stored under another key, making a hierarchical structure. |
| **Values** | Can hold arbitrary data and are made up of several components:  * Value Name: Name of the value. * Value Data: Data stored for associated name value. * [Value type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-value-types): Format data is stored in. |
| **Last Write times** | A timestamp that records when a registry key was last updated. Updates to a key are represented by values added/modified/deleted to a key or subkeys added/renamed/deleted from a key. These timestamps a...
