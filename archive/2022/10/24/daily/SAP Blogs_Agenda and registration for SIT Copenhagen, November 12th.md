After a very long wait, the 6th SAP Inside Track Copenhagen event is finally happening on Saturday, November 12th. We’re looking so much forward to seeing both old and new SAP community friends!

In addition to networking and hanging out with the local SAP community gang, we have a bunch of really cool presentations lined up. You can find the sessions below. And as always, attending is free. You’ll find registration information below as well.

SAP Inside Track Copenhagen is a very laid-back and friendly event. Everybody’s welcome, whether you are completely new to world of SAP, just curious about it or a seasoned SAP veteran. We run the event in the spirit of Danish “hygge”, which translates to something like having a really nice and cozy time with friends. At lunch we serve what we consider the ultimate *hygge* food, namely open-faced sandwiches on rye bread (“smørrebrød” in Danish).

We hope to see you all in November!

## Agenda

**Open ABAP** by *Lars Hvam*

What is Exercism? What are the ABAP file formats? Let’s investigate how it all comes together into a brighter future for the world of ABAP.

**Migrating from SAP PO to SAP Integration Suite** by *Daniel Graversen*

If you are an SAP Process Orchestration developer, you have probably heard that SAP PI/PO will end support in 2027-30 and that you will need to migrate. In this session I will discuss when it makes sense to migrate and what you should migrate. We’ll also cover how your migration can work and what you can do to automate it.

**Challenges when going from ABAPer to BTPer** by *Steve Guo*

I'd like to share my experience of helping developers move from the classical ABAP world to the world of modern SAP technologies. I’ll discuss what the main challenges are and how I have helped developers overcome them.

**My journey into the clouds** by *Jesper Kampfeldt*

In this session I will give you a short introduction to SAP Cloud Integration. What is it and what are its strengths and weaknesses? I will also share my hard-earned experience on how to avoid the various pitfalls when developing on SAP Cloud Integration.

**The Future of SAP Cloud ALM** by *Ole Jedrzejczyk*

Get to know the dream team that enables holistic business transformation: SAP Application Lifecycle Management, SAP Signavio, SAP Business Transformation Center and Tricentis. Get a closer look at how to move your landscape and your ALM platform from SAP Solution Manager to SAP Cloud ALM and what the roadmap looks like.

**Compliance validation for designed APIs** *by Vadim Klimov*

In this session, we are going to explore and discuss some techniques and tools that can be used to enforce and automate compliance validation and harden APIs during the design phase. We will see how a shift left approach can be leveraged and applied to API design and how API style guides and security best practices can be enforced for designed APIs.
