Purple Teaming is a field of cybersecurity that links together several different disciplines, including Detection Research and Engineering (DRE), Incident Response (IR), and Threat Hunting (TH), and has evolved to include fields like Threat Intelligence (TI) and Threat Emulation. Because of this, Purple Teaming is becoming more relevant to developing both individual skills and capabilities, and has become a key focal point for organizations to build a solid foundation for internal security programs.

This blog post will outline several different open-source tools, techniques for security practitioners interested in getting into Purple Teaming as well as recommendations on how individuals can power up offensive and defensive skillsets.

## Developing SKILLZ

Our team is often asked how we started Purple Teaming and how to build the skills to enter our subsection of the cybersecurity industry. To keep things concise, here are our five recommendations for practitioners looking to start Purple Teaming.

## Recommendation #1 – Build a Lab

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that building a lab comes as our top recommendation for building up your Purple Team knowledge.

However, the lab functionality required for Purple Teaming may require some additional set-up and infrastructure in order to support both red (offensive) and blue (defensive) capabilities.

### Components

While many red team-focused labs are designed to focus on having a basic staging/attacking host and an associated victim host, our Purple Team lab needs to go a little further to do attack simulation and have defensive infrastructure in place to build a detection. The requirements for such a lab are as follows:

* A basic AD structure
* One (1) or two (2) domain-attached workstations
* An attack host (e.g., Kali Linux or Ubuntu, whatever your preference is)
* A built-out SIEM

Building out a full lab has been covered by many hugely talented security professionals who have done a great job at providing detailed guidance, such as [this](https://trustedsec.com/blog/offensive-lab-environments-without-the-suck) article. While we won’t go into detail on lab creation, we will talk about each of the bullet components above, some resources, and suggestions on things you can do to increase the value of your home lab and make it more purple.

### Building AD Structure/Domain Workstations

There are many resources out there that enable you to automate building out an Active Directory environment to make the process faster and easier such as:

* [Marvel Lab](https://github.com/jsecurity101/Marvel-Lab)
* [BadBlood](https://github.com/davidprowe/BadBlood)
* As well as a tool I haven’t had the chance to work with yet, [PurpleLab](https://github.com/Krook9d/PurpleLab).

However, if you’re familiar with lab building and you want to up your general skills, I highly recommend building yo...
