The AI train keeps rolling. Later today, many analysts will be listening carefully to [NVDA’s third quarter earnings call](https://www.reuters.com/technology/investors-look-ai-darling-nvidias-earnings-us-stocks-rally-wobbles-2023-08-23/). And I sure didn’t expect to have IBM leveraging a code-generating AI model to [translate COBOL into Java](https://www.techmeme.com/230822/p32#a230822p32) on my bingo card, but here we are.

### Embrace AI While Protecting Your Data

When it comes to business use cases in AI, one study I keep coming back to is McKinsey and Company’s ‘**[The economic potential of generative AI](https://www.techmeme.com/230822/p32#a230822p32)**’ report. It's  a report I referenced in last week’s post about [AI and hype](https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/ai-in-business-is-it-overhyped), and it's one that's well worth reading. In this robust report, 8 authors analyzed 63 use cases where AI technology can impact specific business challenges directly in “ways that produce one or more measurable outcomes.’

![McKinsey & Comapny - The economic potential of generative AI](https://www.forcepoint.com/sites/default/files/mckinsey.png)

Overall, McKinsey expects AI to add **$2.6 - $4.4 trillion annually** across those 63 use cases. According to McKinsey, 75% of that total will come from 4 different areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering and R&D. In my opinion, it’s worth reading the report to see McKinsey’s deeper dive into how AI will potentially impact those top four areas.

And it’s also worth digging into the Spotlights section of the report to better  understand use cases in  industries outside those top four into areas like retail, banking and pharmaceutical/ medical products. For example, McKinsey estimates that AI could result in an additional **$400 billion to $660 billion**, just by increasing productivity 1.2 – 2 percent. And that’s just scratching the surface of the industry use cases they analyzed.

If you work in one of the areas that McKinsey expects widespread adoption of AI, or you have been tasked with scoping out ways AI can be leveraged to improve your business, the **[McKinsey economic potential of AI report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction)** is a good place to start digging in.
