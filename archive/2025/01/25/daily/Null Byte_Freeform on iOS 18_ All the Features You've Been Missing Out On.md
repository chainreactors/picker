![Freeform being used on an iPad and iPhone.](https://assets.content.technologyadvice.com/freeform_cover_4fbf593693.webp)

Apple's [Freeform](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/explore-freeform-apples-new-digital-whiteboard-for-brainstorming-collaboration-and-more-0385261/) app levels up with [iOS 18](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/collection/ios-18-tips-news/) and [iPadOS 18](https://ipados.gadgethacks.com/collection/ipados-18-tips-news/), offering you new features to enhance creativity, collaboration, and organization. While some updates, like the new Scenes feature, are prominent, others are more subtle but just as powerful. This incredible app's versatile features work equally well on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

If you haven't updated to iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 yet, it's definitely worth it for Freeform's upgraded capabilities. Many of these features also work on macOS Sequoia 15.

The updates cater to a wide range of users, from casual planners to professional teams working on large projects. Freeform's improvements also beautifully integrate with other Apple ecosystem features, including [iCloud](https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/create-unlimited-icloud-email-address-variations-take-total-control-over-your-icloud-mail-inbox-0385502/), [Siri](https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/18-siri-commands-every-iphone-owner-should-know-0385294/), and [Apple Intelligence](https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/make-most-apple-intelligences-writing-tools-proofread-rewrite-summarize-and-create-content-0385598/). If you enjoyed the app's earlier ability to create freehand sketches and collaborative boards, this update expands on those strengths with new tools designed to make your workflow smoother and your projects more polished.

## Break Down Big Ideas with Scenes

The new Scenes feature is perfect for tackling big, complex boards. It allows you to divide a board into sections or topics, making navigating and focusing on specific parts of your project easier. To create a scene, fill the frame with the content you want locked to it, tap More (â¢â¢â¢), then select Add Scene. When you do, the Scene Navigator will appear to help you navigate from one scene to the next and manage them. In the Scene Manager, you can:

* Select Edit to delete and reorder scenes.
* Select + Add Scene to create or duplicate a scene.
* Select More (â¢â¢â¢) next to a scene to rename, replace, print, or delete it, as well as export it as a PDF.
* Select More (â¢â¢â¢) for all to print all scenes or export them as a PDF.

This feature is especially useful for project managers or teams brainstorming on large boards. It works seamlessly across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, keeping your projects organized no matter which Apple device you use.

## Share a Board as a Copy

Before, when you would tap the Share button on a Freeform board, you could only share the board with collaborators. With iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, you also get a Send Copy option. This lets the person you share the board with make it their own, giving them a good starting point. When sharing the copy, you can select any apps or services from the list or use Copy iCloud Link, which makes the board copy downloadable for 30 days for anyone you share the link with.

## Keep Things Organized with Snap to Grid

Tired of messy layouts? The Snap to Grid feature ensures your boards look neat and professional. When on, objects automatically align to a visible grid whenever you resize or move them, helping you position elements with precision. This is a must-have for anyone creating diagrams, organizing ideas, or designing layouts. You can enable or disable Snap to Grid from within a board via More (â¢â¢â¢) Â» Alignment Settings or for all boards from Settings Â» Apps Â» Freeform.

## Change Alignment Settings Per Boards

Before, you could set Center Guides, Edge Guides, and Spacing Guides from Settings Â» Freeform, but these rules apply to all boards. You can still set them for all boards via Settings Â» Apps Â» Freeform, but you can also do it on a board-by-board basis. As seen above, you can manage these preferences from within a board via More (â¢â¢â¢) Â» Alignment Settings.

## Type Lists Out Faster

For some reason, lists will not automatically continue when typing them out in Freeform on iOS 17 and iPadOS 17. Thankfully, iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 fix this. So, now you can type 1., â¢, or - followed by a space, and it will automatically go into list mode. Then, type the first item in the list, and when you hit Return on your keyboard, Freeform will auto-populate the next number, bullet, or dash. Also, typing an asterisk (\*) followed by a space will now create a bullet.
