##### SHARE

In any engineering organization, management of communication among the stakeholders is a key challenge. The more extensive the complexity and scope of the endeavor, the greater the need to communicate. From senior leadership to the shop floor, communication is key. Digital engineering transformation is increasingly driving the methods and the means to improve how we share information.

In November of 2024, the SEI brought together stakeholders from the Department of Defense and the intelligence community (IC) who have been engaging and actively innovating in the dynamic environment of digital engineering. Our workshop focused mostly upon model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as a pillar in aligning best practices in modeling with systems engineering practices. The SEI’s work in this field is focused on developing [approaches and processes to document, assess, and optimize MBSE methodolog](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/model-based-systems-engineering/)y. We aim to help government stakeholders choose better systems engineering pathways for large mission-critical programs. This blog post, which is adapted from [a recently published technical note](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/report-on-the-first-mbsynergy-workshop/), highlights a research agenda and calls to action for future work in MBSE and digital engineering from practitioners in the field.

## Distilling MB Synergies

[DOD Instruction 5000.97](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/500097p.PDF?ver=bePIqKXaLUTK_Iu5iTNREw%3D%3D) states that MBSE and digital engineering would “enable faster, smarter, data-driven decisions through the system life cycle.” Yet, reproducing MBSE and digital engineering benefits *at scale* remains a challenge. The SEI’s work in this field is focused on developing [approaches and processes to document, assess, and optimize MBSE methodolog](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/model-based-systems-engineering/)y, assisting government stakeholders to choose better systems engineering pathways for large mission-critical programs.

Recognizing the interwoven nature of modeling and engineering activities, MBSE balances the desire for agile velocity and responsiveness with the need for carefully designed capabilities by using models as a common exchange format. Model-based techniques can often address scalability challenges for complex systems. Integrating the complex elements of modern systems as a synergistic whole requires the power of modeling and modern computing. The advancements of engineering agility cannot be fully realized without a sufficient understanding of digital engineering infrastructure architecture and its relation to MBSE.

We use the term MBSynergy to refer to a community approach to cultivate learning and the derived benefits of MBSE and digital engineering efforts spanning the DoD and IC. The goal of the effort is to develop an organized, integrated approach that will enable us to provide a consistent, effective level of understanding to the DoD, IC, and ultimately to industry at large. The initial MBSynergy workshop engaged participants who work on behalf of the warfighter and civilian emergency services. In these roles, they engage lead systems integrators or any of the well-known providers to the Defense Industrial Base. The selection of participants ensured relatability among their similar contexts of work. We employed [Chatham House Rule to](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule) enable participants to speak freely without personal attribution associated to any particular comment.

The issues raised during the workshop were grouped into five areas: “hot” topics, DoD/IC policies, digital engineering environment, training, and MBSE processes.

## “Hot” Topics in MBSE Technologies

MBSE and digital engineering continue to evolve with new areas of interest emerging in SysMLv2 and artificial intelligence.

Finalization of SysMLv2 and the migration from SysML1.x to SysMLv2 is a major concern in the defense industrial base, DoD, and the intelligence community. The prevalence of the Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) and shortcomings in language and tools support for SysML1.x were among the key subjects discussed. Early evaluations of SysMLv2 demonstrate the importance of this subject for major programs.

Workshop participants also expressed interest in exploring how AI might help support MBSE applications in modeling. They expect a new and revolutionary user experience for development environments.

**Calls to action include**

* Investigate the SysMLv2 transition.
* Explore the use of AI to support MBSE.

### DoD/IC Policies

Practitioners in the DoD and intelligence communities who use MBSE share common policy, deployment, and sustainment concerns. Also, these practitioners use similar tools for capturing requirements modeling in UAF or SysML, and so on. The paradox reported by participants is that bespoke environments deployed in different settings build-in obstacles to the application of MBSE concepts across the boundaries of differing impl...
