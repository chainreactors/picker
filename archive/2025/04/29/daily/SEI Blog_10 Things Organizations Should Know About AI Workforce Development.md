In early April the White House Office of Management and Budget issued [a memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-21-Accelerating-Federal-Use-of-AI-through-Innovation-Governance-and-Public-Trust.pdf) encouraging federal agencies to prioritize recruitment and development of technical talent in artificial intelligence (AI). The memorandum, in response to executive order [*Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/), outlined the benefits of prioritizing AI workforce development including increasing capability for responsible AI innovation, providing the federal workforce pathways to AI up-skilling, and assisting employees in applying AI to their work. The memorandum also called on federal agencies to provide “sufficient and periodic training, assessment, and oversight” for staff to act on the AI' s output and manage associated risks.

On a related front, the DoD’s Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) has defined [workforce talent and workforce training as critical dimensions along the pathway to AI readiness](https://www.ai.mil/About/Resources/Pathway-to-AI-Readiness/). At the SEI’s AI Division, we’re creating AI workforce development content to enhance digital transformation initiatives by establishing trust and proficiency among the developers and the users of AI systems. As we’ve seen with our mission partners such as the [Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/annual-reviews/2023-year-in-review/assuring-trustworthiness-of-ai-for-warfighters/) (OUSD(R&E)), promoting AI literacy results in better solutions architecture by providing the knowledge necessary to properly develop and maintain systems while increasing user adoption rates. Through numerous discussions with various DoD mission partners around enabling their workforces to implement AI solutions, the SEI AI Workforce Development team has created 10 recommendations that organizations need to know about AI workforce development. Because of the number of individuals within any organization that will be impacted by their commitment to embrace and develop an AI culture, some of these recommendations are designed to develop AI talent among the 11 roles most directly involved with AI and identified by the [Defense Cyber Workforce Framework](https://public.cyber.mil/wf-element-sub/ai-data/) (DCWF):

* AI adoption specialist
* AI innovation leader
* AI risk & ethics specialist
* AI test & evaluation specialist
* AI/ML specialist
* data analyst
* data architect
* data officer
* data operations specialist
* data scientist
* data steward

Other recommendations can be directed to roles less directly involved, such as leadership within the organization, or even the end users of the AI applications.

1. **Create immersive, hands-on training to teach AI effectively**. This training allows individuals to work directly with AI systems, apply theoretical knowledge, and solve real-world problems. This experiential approach helps build deeper understanding among students by offering the opportunity to experiment with data, develop models, and interpret results. It has also proved to be [more effective at retaining new knowledge than lecture alone](http://tru.uni-sz.bg/tsj/Volume2_4/EXPERIENTIAL%20LEARNING.pdf). In the DoD context, the AI Division’s Workforce Development team builds content to allow students to *train like you fight* on simulated real-world mission systems.
2. **Map the DoD workforce to AI-specific roles, such as those defined by the** [**DCWF**](https://public.cyber.mil/wf-element-sub/ai-data/)**, to ensure AI training aligns with organizational needs and employee capabilities**. By clearly defining AI roles—such as data scientists, AI/ML specialists, application developers, AI-savvy system engineers, business analysts, and non-technical users—organizations can tailor training programs to address both foundational AI skills and advanced expertise. Once roles are defined, the knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks necessary for those roles also need to be defined. For example, the DCWF maps 71 knowledge, skills, abilities, and tasks (KSATs) to the AI/ML specialist role. However, many of these 71 KSATs also map to one or more of other 11 data/AI DCWF roles and can be tailored to the specific mission of an organization. Aligning training to these KSATs allows some of the developed content to be used for many roles instead of just one, while also being more effective for those roles in that organization. This approach optimizes the distribution of AI knowledge, allowing employees to realize their responsibilities by augmenting their tasks with AI technologies. Time saved reusing KSAT-aligned content can then be better spent on all the developing impactful content for the many unique KSATs that are specific to one of the 11 roles.
3. **Establish a strategy for consistent AI engineering literacy and approved tools within organizations**. Currently, [78 percent of AI users are bringing their own AI ...
