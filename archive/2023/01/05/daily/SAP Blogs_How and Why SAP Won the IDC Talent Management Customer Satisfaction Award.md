*The ratings are in — and they show we put customers first.*

The International Data Corporation (IDC) recently conducted its 2022 SaaSPath survey, which reviews customer satisfaction at roughly 2,400 organizations across all regions and company sizes. SAP placed in the highest-scoring group for vendors providing software-as-a-service (SaaS) talent management applications. As a result, we have been awarded the [2022 Customer Satisfaction Award for our SAP SuccessFactors Learning and Talent solutions](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html?pdf-asset=c0cf05f2-4e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&page=1). This software gives employees, managers, and HR professionals the tools and guidance they need to succeed — regardless of where or when they're working.

IDC, the leading global provider of marketing, intelligence, and advisory services for various technology markets, started the CSAT Awards, its customer satisfaction award program, to recognize the leading SaaS vendors in 19 functional application markets. The survey is conducted worldwide and includes roughly 55 percent of IT leaders and 45 percent of business leaders, with respondents ranging from senior managers to chief experience officers.

To receive an award, a vendor must achieve the highest customer ratings in more than 30 metrics, including 19 customer satisfaction categories and 13 vendor vulnerability [categories](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html?pdf-asset=c0cf05f2-4e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&restricting=%2F%2Fwww.sap.com%2Fdocuments%2F2022%2F11%2Fc0cf05f2-4e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.rc.html&page=1). On average, SAP ranked at the top of all vendors in every metric, including:

* Product innovation

* User experience

* Ease of implementation

* Fast time to value

* Built-in decision-making guidance

The survey also revealed intriguing data about the overall talent management market. For example, the average customer believes that vendors are delivering innovative solutions with strong data security, but they still want easier integration, more verticalization, and data management enhancements.

We believe this award clearly proves our customers are satisfied with our solutions and the way we help them support and enable their employees and business so everyone can do their best work. That’s great to know — but it doesn’t mean we’re going to stop here. We will continue striving to produce some of the best learning and talent management software available because we know our customers and their employees expect and deserve an award-winning experience.
