# Weekly Update 455

09 June 2025

The bot-fighting is a non-stop battle. In this week's video, I discuss how we're tweaking Cloudflare Turnstile and combining more attributes around how bot-like requests are, and... it almost worked. Just as I was preparing to write this intro, I found a small spike of anomalous traffic that, upon further investigation, should have been blocked. So we've pivoted again, adding yet more logic to try and give legit humans the best experience possible whilst making it painful for the bots. Fortunately, we're doing this with resources that have minimal impact if a limited number of bot requests come through, but it does make for a challenging if not somewhat infuriating experience.
