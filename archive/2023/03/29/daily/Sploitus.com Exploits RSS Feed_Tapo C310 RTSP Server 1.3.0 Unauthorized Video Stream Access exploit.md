These Tapo cameras work via an app. There is a facility on the app to set up a “Camera Account”, which adds user details for the RTSP server. Unfortunately if you don’t set up the user details on versions 1.3.0 and below there are default login details. I sourced these from the “cet” binary on the camera.

You can gain unauthorised access to the RTSP stream using the following user details:
