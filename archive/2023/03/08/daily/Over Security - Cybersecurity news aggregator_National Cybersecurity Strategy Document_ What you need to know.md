# National Cybersecurity Strategy Document: What you need to know

Posted: March 6, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

The US Government has been working on the [National Cybersecurity Strategy Document 2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/) for some time now, and [it’s finally been released](https://www.voanews.com/a/us-launches-aggressive-national-cybersecurity-strategy-/6986279.html). The strategy document, which replaces the last such piece of work from 2018, attempts to indicate the general direction of the US approach to cybercrime and security for the next few years.

While you don’t necessarily need to take immediate action on the points raised, there’s a lot of talk about liability for poor security practices for larger organisations, better ratings for IoT devices, and a greatly improved hiring strategy for unfilled security vacancies. If these are areas of concern for you, we highlight the important parts below.

 As per the WSJ, [the five primary areas for action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-u-s-national-cyber-strategy-reaches-beyond-government-agencies-ef83ac74) are:

* Defending critical infrastructure
* Disruption and dismantling of criminal gangs
* Shape market forces
* Investing in a resilient future
* Forge international partnerships

One large part of this new strategy is that organisations potentially most well equipped to fend off attacks must step up and do more:

> The most capable and best positioned actors in cyberspace must be better stewards of the digital ecosystem…we must ask more [across both the public and private sectors] of the most capable and best positioned actors to make our digital ecosystem more secure and resilient. In a free and interconnected society, protecting data and ensuring the reliability of critical systems must be the responsibility of the owners and operators of the systems that hold our data and make our society function, as well as of the technology providers that build and service these systems.

With this in mind, then, let’s highlight some of the standouts from relevant sections.

## Defending critical infrastructure

### Expanding the use of minimum cybersecurity requirements in critical sectors

If you work in a critical sector of industry, you can expect to see new requirements heading your way in the near future. “Existing authorities” will set new requirements for cybersecurity, and where gaps exist in statutory authorities to create minimum standards, the Administration will work with congress to close them. Regulations will be performance based and make use of existing security frameworks—no reinventing the wheel here. A focus on driving better practices in the [cloud](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-the-cloud) industry is also evident.

Update Federal response plans

You can expect better processes should you need to contact Federal authorities after a cyber incident, with the aim of creating a “unified, coordinated, whole of government response” with organisations able to quickly and easily find out who to contact, and when. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) will be updated through this work, and the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) will require specific entities in critical infrastructure sectors to report incidents to CISA “within hours”.
