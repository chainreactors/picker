[Tips](https://news.stv.tv/north/what-are-squid-egg-mops-and-what-to-do-if-you-find-one) on what to do if you find a mop of squid eggs.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Predatory squid likely dominated ancient oceans

In a previous iteration on drone warfare, I corresponded with Stuart Russell.

This jogged my memory. I suggest “The Age of AI Drone Warfare Is Here Now.”

In case the connection to computer security isn’t crystal clear, “When autonomous lethal weapons systems are deployed, they need to be very secure.”

@ ALL,

Speaking of a weekend night blow out… This news item is enough to put you off Kebabs for life (if the worms in the brain story has not done so already).

You’ve probably heard stories of “explosive decompression” that are quite graphic?

Well how about “explosive deingestion” a step up or so from projectile vomiting? It’s called “Boerhaave syndrome”,

Detecting Stingrays.
Some current methods such as Apple’s lockdown mode are all or nothing.

@ Bruce, ALL,

I’ve waited nearly a couple of weeks to see if there was any “come back” from the AI FaniBoys over a response to the Apple paper that basically said,

“AGI is not happening because AI can only discover the already known”

Which is not exactly surprising considering how it works (glorified database).

Anyway the Apple paper caused much outcry in the hypers, and several rebuttal papers…

One of which got spread far and wide by the FaniBoys, shills, and hypers of AI.

The problem is it was a “joke paper” ment as a subtle rebuke of the FaniBoys,

<https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/five-quick-updates-about-that-apple>

Well it appears there is still an “embarrassed silence” spreading quietly across their community.

Any way what ever your position on AI enjoy the read.

Regarding drone warfare, Australia’s ABC has a new piece out in its excellent “If You’re Listening” video series  [How Israel’s Perfect Sneak Attack on Iran Will Change Warfare Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkZB3BcOU8I). It covers the Ukrainian attack on Russian air assets and the more recent Israeli assault on Iran.

re: Boerhaave syndrome

Why is it not called Wassenaer syndrome, after the index case Admiral Baron Jan van Wassenaer who died of it in 1724? Boerhaave did many other worthy things, including a thesis “On the Difference of the Mind from the Body” which current LLM proponents may not have read, and he was such a fan of Isaac Newton that some allege he appropriated Newton’s ideas in his own work.

@ lurker,

With regards,

> “he was such a fan of Isaac Newton that some allege he appropriated Newton’s ideas in his own work.”

And Newton of course was accused of stealing the work of another astronomer so he could get access to something like two decades of observations…

Whilst that story might be apocryphal, the fact Newton is now portrayed as a thoroughly unpleasant person who had a strong vindictive streak is what modern historians think of him,

<https://scienceillustrated.com/scientists/newton-was-hiding-a-dark-secret>

As for his alleged rival well it is known he did sit on data and was as equally unpleasant and ruminated at best slowly.

They might not have been “academics” in the modern sense, but there are many who would see the parallels in behaviours.

@**Clive**, @**lurker**: Re: *Boerhaave syndrome*.

It should probably be called *Arius Syndrome*, after the 3rd Century CE Cyrenaic presbyter and ascetic Arius. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arius#Exile,_return,_and_death) for the somewhat grisly details.

@ JG5, Steve

Investment in drones and infantry is crucial and gives an immediate increase in defence capacity. Elected governments should be showing that they understand and are acting. That is not the case down under.
