Modern enterprises have rapidly adopted hybrid cloud environments to harness the benefits of both on-prem infrastructure and public cloud services. With higher rates of adoption and [nearly half of all breaches](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach) occurring in the cloud, the question of how to secure this growing hybrid cloud landscape has become a top [priority](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/all-eyes-on-cloud-why-the-cloud-surface-attracts-attacks/) for business leaders.

One significant aspect of [securing hybrid clouds](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/) is effectively managing [identity](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/identity-security-what-it-is-why-its-so-important/) and access controls. Since identity and access provide the framework and controls to authenticate and authorize user access, understanding them in the context of hybrid clouds is a critical element in establishing a secure environment.

In hybrid cloud deployments where resources are distributed across on-prem and cloud platforms, managing identities can be a challenge for security teams. This blog post covers how security teams and business leaders can combine identity and access control best practices with advanced detection and response capabilities to ensure robust security for their hybrid cloud environments.

## Understanding Identity & Access Management In Cloud Security

Identity and access controls are essential measures in the fight against [cyberattacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/threat-landscape-the-most-dangerous-cloud-attack-methods-in-the-wild-today/). They involve the processes used to authenticate and authorize user access to resources within an organization’s data infrastructure. Through strong identity and access controls, organizations can establish a robust security framework that helps prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of breaches and [cloud ransomware attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/a-myth-or-reality-debunking-misconceptions-surrounding-cloud-ransomware/).

Identity and access controls ensure that only authenticated and authorized individuals can access sensitive information, systems, and resources. Effective controls also enable organizations to enforce least privilege principles, limiting user access to only what they need to for their specific roles. Maintaining granular control over user permissions means security teams can [reduce](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/7-practical-solutions-for-modern-businesses-combating-cloud-based-attacks/) the attack surface and protect against [insider attacks](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/surviving-the-storm-defending-against-cloud-misconfigurations-vulnerabilities-and-insider-threats/), [data breaches](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-a-data-breach/), and attacks involving privilege escalation.

When it comes to the digital infrastructure, organizations must consider all fronts: on-prem, public cloud, and hybrid cloud environments:

* On-premises (on-prem) refers to infrastructure that is owned and managed directly by the organization within its premises.
* Public cloud involves utilizing resources and services provided by third-party cloud service providers (CSPs) over the internet.
* Hybrid cloud combines both on-prem and public cloud components, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both.

While on-prem offers full control and customization, it requires significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance. Public cloud offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, but data privacy and compliance concerns may arise. This in mind, hybrid clouds have become a popular option as they provide a balance by allowing organizations to leverage existing investments while utilizing the scalability and flexibility of the public cloud for specific workloads. Understanding these differences is crucial for organizations to make informed decisions about their infrastructure security.

## Key Components of Identity & Access Controls For Hybrid Clouds

Effective management of identity and access controls is crucial in securing hybrid cloud environments. To establish a robust security framework, several key components need to be considered.

### Identity Management Systems

Identity management systems play a pivotal role in managing user identities and access rights across hybrid cloud environments. These systems provide a centralized approach to identity management, enabling organizations to streamline user provisioning, authentication, and deprovisioning processes. With a unified identity management system in place, organizations have the capability to enforce password policies, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and efficiently manage user lifecycle events across hybrid cloud platforms.

Centralized identity management ensures consistent access control policies throughout the hybrid cloud infrastructure and reduces the risk of unauthorized access or compromised credentials. Also, it simplifies the administration of user identities, giving security teams greater visibility and control over user access privileges. Organizations with a unified identity management system in place are much better positioned to achieve a higher level of security, streamline user management processes, and ensure compliance with any industry-specific [regulations](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/compliance-in-the-cloud-navigating-the-complexities-of-cloud-security-regulations/).

### Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication mechanisms are the gatekeepers along the path to accessing resources in hybrid cloud environments. Organizations must carefully evaluate and implement appropriate authentication methods to strengthen security. While traditional methods like passwords are still often used, they are no longer considered sufficient protection on their own. Advanced techniques such as digital certificates, biometrics, or token-based authentication offer stronger security measures.

One of the most effective authentication mechanisms in hybrid cloud environments is multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA requires users to provide multiple pieces of evidence to verify their identities. By combining something the user knows (such as a password) with something they have (like a physical token) or something they are (biometrics), MFA significantly elevates the security posture of hybrid cloud deployments. Even if one factor is compromised, the additional layers of authentication provide an added layer of defense against unauthorized access.

Implementing strong authentication mechanisms in hybrid clouds ensures that only authorized users can access resources, minimizing the risk of credential theft and unauthorized account access. Organizations should choose authentication methods that align with their security requirements and strike the right balance between usability and protection.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely adopted authorization model that simplifies access management in hybrid cloud environments. RBAC associate...
