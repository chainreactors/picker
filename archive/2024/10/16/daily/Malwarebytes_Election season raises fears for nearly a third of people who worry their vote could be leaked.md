# Election season raises fears for nearly a third of people who worry their vote could be leaked

Posted: October 15, 2024

As the United States enters full swing into its next presidential election, people are feeling worried, unsafe, and afraid.

And none of that has to do with who wins.

According to new research from Malwarebytes, people see this election season as a particularly risky time for their online privacy and cybersecurity. Political ads could be hiding online scams, many people feel, and the election, they say, will likely fall victim to some type of “cyber interference.” Amidst this broader turbulence, 32% are “concerned about who could learn [their] vote”—be they family, spouses, or cybercriminals.

For this research, Malwarebytes conducted a pulse survey of its newsletter readers between September 5 and 16, 2024, via the Alchemer Survey platform. In total, 1600 people across the globe responded.

Broadly, Malwarebytes found that:

* 74% of people “consider US election season a risky time for [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).”
* Despite a tight presidential race, a shocking 3% of people said they **will not vote** because of “privacy or security concerns.”
* Distrust in political ads is broad—62% said they “disagree” or “strongly disagree” that the information they receive in US election-related ads is trustworthy.
* The fears around election ads are not just about trustworthiness, but about harm. 52% are “very concerned” or “concerned” about “falling prey to a scam when interacting with political messages.”
* 57% have responded to these concerns with action, taking several steps to protect their personal information during this election season.

The electoral process is (forgive us) a lot like cybersecurity: It scares people, it’s hopelessly baroque, and, through a lack of participation, it can produce unwanted results.

Here is what Malwarebytes discovered about the intersection of cybersecurity and elections, with additional guidance on how to protect personal information this season.

## **Open distrust**

Getting more than 70% of people to agree on anything is remarkable. And yet, 74% of survey participants said that they “consider US election season a risky time for personal information.” Drilling further into the data, 56% said they were “extremely concerned” or “very concerned” about the security of their personal information during this election season.

The reasons could be obvious. Unlike any other season in America, election season might bring the highest volume of advertisements sent directly to people’s homes, phones, and email accounts—and the accuracy and speed at which they come can feel invasive. The network of data brokers that political campaigns rely on to target voters with ads is enormous, as one Washington Post reporter found in 2020, with [“3,000 data points on every voter.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/27/political-campaign-data-targeting/)

Escaping this data collection regime has proven difficult for most people. Just 9.6% of survey participants said they “have not received any election related ads” this year.

Elsewhere, 60% had received election-related ads through emails, 58% through physical mailers, 55% through text messages, 40% through social media, and 29% through phone calls....
