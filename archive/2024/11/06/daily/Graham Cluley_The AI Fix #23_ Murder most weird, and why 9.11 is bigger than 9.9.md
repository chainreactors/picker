In episode 23 of The AI Fix, an AI finds a new way to make life difficult for women in STEM, Graham reveals his brilliant idea for treating any medical emergency, a beloved chat show host returns from the grave, and our hosts learn that computer viruses were almost called computer weeds.

Graham tells Mark a story involving a murder, a moth, and an AI journalist, and Mark pits his co-host against the world‚Äôs most advanced computer program in a maths Olympiad.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
