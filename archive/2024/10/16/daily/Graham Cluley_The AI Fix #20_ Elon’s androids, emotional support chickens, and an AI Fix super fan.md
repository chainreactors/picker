In episode 20 of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù, Mark asks an AI to make a very important decision, the Nobel academy finds a bandwagon, Graham gets a new nickname, a pair of robots prove that AI can‚Äôt do humour, and our hosts find out why emotional support insects haven‚Äôt taken off.

Graham introduces Mark to Optimus, the robot that can‚Äôt be trusted to fold a t-shirt, and Mark introduces Graham to an AI Fix super fan.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
