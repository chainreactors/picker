# Ransomware hiding in fake AI, business tools

Posted: June 5, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

[Artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) and small business tools are being abused as smokescreens to hit unsuspecting victims with ransomware.

In the masquerade campaigns [discovered by Cisco Talos](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/fake-ai-tool-installers/), cybercriminals hid malware behind software and install packages that mimicked the websites or names of the lead monetization service Nova Leads, the enormously popular Chat GPT, and an AI-empowered video tool called InVideo AI.

As small businesses quickly adopt AI tools—a [recent survey from the US Chamber of Commerce and the strategy firm Teneo](https://apnews.com/article/small-business-artificial-intelligence-productivity-f6fa7b2a1ce0a9f2e5b8b48670b3098a) revealed that 98% of small businesses already use at least one AI-powered product and 40% use generative AI—these cybercriminal lures pose the next, big threat to sole proprietors and boutique shops.

According to the researchers at Cisco Talos, the threat is twofold.

“Unsuspecting businesses in search of AI solutions may be deceived into downloading counterfeit tools in which malware is embedded,” Talos said. “This practice poses a significant risk, as it not only compromises sensitive business data and financial assets but also undermines trust in legitimate AI market solutions.”

In the first potential online attack, Talos found that cybercriminals created a fake website that closely resembled that of the legitimate company Nova Leads. The company helps businesses with lead monetization through acquisition, conversion, and content creation. But rather than simply copying the look and feel of Nova’s website, the cybercriminals also offered a completely fake, AI-powered product called “Nova Leads AI.”

On the malicious website, users were prompted to download Nova Leads AI for ”free access” for 12 months. If users downloaded and installed the fake software, the ransomware CyberLock was instead deployed. Researchers at Talos analyzed how CyberLock moved throughout a network and retrieved the ransom note left behind by the cybercriminals. In it, the ransomware gang claimed, falsely, that their attacks were altruistic.

“We want to assure you that your payment does not go to us,” the ransomware gang said in its note. “It will instead go to support affected women and children in Palestine, Ukraine, Africa, Asia, and other regions where injustices are a daily reality.”

In the note, victims are directed to pay $50,000 in [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency). The ransomware campaign is particularly dangerous as cybercriminals managed to manipulate SEO practices to rank their malicious website near the top of relevant online searches. This method, called “SEO poisoning,” is deployed by scammers, [hackers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker), and shady websites.

In a second potential attack, Talos found that a software installer labeled “ChatGPT 4.0 full version – Premium.exe” was actually hiding the ransomware Lucky\_Gh0$t. Interestingly, the files contained within the installer also contained legitimate open-source AI tools from Microsoft, likely as an ev...
