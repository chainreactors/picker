The online world never takes a break, and this week shows why. From ransomware creators being caught to hackers backed by governments trying new tricks, the message is clear: cybercriminals are always changing how they attack, and we need to keep up.

Hackers are using everyday tools in harmful ways, hiding spyware in trusted apps, and finding new ways to take advantage of old security gaps. These events aren't random‚Äîthey show just how clever and flexible cyber threats can be.

In this edition, we'll look at the most important cyber events from the past week and share key takeaways to help you stay safe and prepared. Let's get started.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**LockBit Developer Rostislav Panev Charged in the U.S.** ‚Äî Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old dual Russian and Israeli national, has been [charged](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/lockbit-developer-rostislav-panev.html) in the U.S. for allegedly acting as the developer of the now-disrupted LockBit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, netting about $230,000 between June 2022 and February 2024. Panev was arrested in Israel in August 2024 and is currently pending extradition. With the latest development, a total of seven LockBit members have been charged in the U.S. That said, the group appears to be readying a new version, LockBit 4.0, that's scheduled for release in February 2025.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Lazarus Group Continues to Evolve Tactics** ‚Äî The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group has been observed targeting nuclear engineers with a new modular malware called [CookiePlus](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/lazarus-group-spotted-targeting-nuclear.html) as part of a long-running cyber espionage campaign dubbed Operation Dream Job. CookiePlus is only the latest manifestation of what security researchers have described as the growing sophistication that threat actors have begun incorporating into their malware and tactics. The variety of TTPs used highlights the versatility and diversity of the hacking group.
* **APT29 Uses Open-Source Tool to Set Up Proxies in RDP Attacks ‚Äî** The Russian state-sponsored group tracked as APT29 has [repurposed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/apt29-hackers-target-high-value-victims.html) a legitimate red teaming attack methodology that involves the use of an open-source proxy tool dubbed PyRDP to set up intermediate servers that are responsible for connecting victim machines to rogue RDP servers, deploy additional payloads, and even exfiltrate data. The development illustrates how it's possible for bad actors to accomplish their goals without having to design highly customized tools.
* **Serbian Journalist Targeted by Cellebrite and NoviSpy** ‚Äî An independent Serbian journalist, Slavi≈°a Milanov, had his phone first unlocked by Cellebrite's forensic tool and subsequently compromised by a previously undocumented spyware codenamed NoviSpy, which comes with capabilities to capture personal data from a target's phone and remotely turn on the phone's microphone or camera. The [spyware attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/novispy-spyware-installed-on.html), detailed by Amnesty International, are the first time two different invasive technologies have been used against civil society members to facilitate the covert gathering of data. Serbia's police characterized the report as "absolutely incorrect."
* **The Mask Makes a Comeback** ‚Äî A little-known cyber espionage actor known as The Mask has been linked to a [new set of attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/the-mask-apt-resurfaces-with.html) targeting an unnamed organization in Latin America twice in 2019 and 2022. The group, first documented by Kaspersky back in early 2014, infected the company with malware such as FakeHMP, Careto2, and Goreto that are designed to harvest files, keystrokes, and screenshots; run shell commands; and deploy more malware. The origins of the threat actor are presently not known.
* **Multiple npm Packages Fall Victim to Supply Chain Attacks** ‚Äî Unknown threat actors managed to [compromise](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/rspack-npm-packages-compromised-with.html) three different npm packages, @rspack/core, @rspack/cli, and vant, and push malicious versions to the repository containing code to deploy a cryptocurrency miner on infected systems. Following discovery, respective project maintainers stepped in to remove the rogue versions.
