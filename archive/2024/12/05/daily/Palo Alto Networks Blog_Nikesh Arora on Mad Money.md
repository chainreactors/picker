# Cloud Security and Platformization Lead the Quarter

Palo Alto Networks has been making significant strides under the guidance of our Chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora. In a recent discussion with [CNBC’s Jim Cramer on ‘Mad Money,’](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/11/20/we-are-the-premium-platform-with-cloud-security-says-palo-alto-ceo-nikesh-arora.html) Arora shared insights into our company’s quarterly results, our robust position in the cloud security market, and the innovative strides Palo Alto Networks is making across various sectors.

Jim Cramer remarked how the year is off to a strong start. He highlighted the company's impressive performance. Indeed, Palo Alto Networks has seen a 33% increase so far in 2024, signaling strong investor confidence and market approval.

### The Rise of Platformization and the Renaissance of Firewall

Both new and legacy security solutions are charging the way for this quarter’s success. While [platformization](/blog/2024/06/platformization-unified-platforms/) is the wave of the future, [firewalls](/network-security/next-generation-firewall) are part of the steam that drives that engine forward.

Arora emphasized the importance of platformization in the industry. "Platformization is finally taking center stage. We are the premium platform as it relates to network security, cloud security, and as it relates to the new area of SIM and software management with AI," he stated. This approach not only enhances security measures but also offers cost savings and reduces workload, making it a preferred choice for many businesses.

The discussion also touched upon the resurgence of the firewall business, with Arora noting, "I’m delighted that people are running out of old firewalls when our new firewalls are coming in." This refresh cycle is part of a broader trend where businesses are increasingly recognizing the need for updated and more robust security solutions.

### Cloud Security and [CNAPP](/resources/videos/cloud-native-application-protection-benefits-cnapp)

As businesses move more workloads to the cloud, the need for advanced cloud security measures becomes paramount. Palo Alto Networks is at the forefront with its [Prisma® Cloud](/prisma/cloud) platform, which has seen a significant increase in adoption. "Our business there has gone 10X in the number of agents we’ve sold in the last year," Arora revealed, underscoring the growing demand for cloud security solutions.

### Government Collaboration and AI Deployment

The conversation also covered the company’s involvement with government contracts, focusing on upgrading legacy systems with better technology. "The US government has a lot of legacy infrastructure that needs to be replaced or upgraded," Arora explained. The deployment of AI technologies is crucial in this context, enhancing efficiency and security.

### A Strategic Move — Stock Split

Lastly, Palo Alto Networks announced a two-for-one stock split, making it more accessible for investors. "We wanna make sure everybody in your club can go buy a share," said Arora, highlighting our company's commitment to broadening its investor base, even though the split does not create additional value directly.

## Leading to a Bright Future

This quarter shows that Palo Alto Networks is poised to continue our leadership in the cybersecurity sector. With strong quarterly performances, a focus on platformization and significant advancements in cloud security, our company is well equipped to handle the evolving security needs of businesses worldwide.
