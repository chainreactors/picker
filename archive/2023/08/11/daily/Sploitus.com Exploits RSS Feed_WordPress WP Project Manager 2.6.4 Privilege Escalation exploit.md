Description: WP Project Manager <= 2.6.4 – Arbitrary Usermeta Update to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Privilege Escalation

Plugin Slug: wedevs-project-manager

Affected Versions: <= 2.6.4

CVE ID: CVE-2023-3636

CVSS Score: 8.8 (High)

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Researcher/s: Lana Codes and Chloe Chamberland

Fully Patched Version: 2.6.5

The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 2.6.4 due to insufficient restriction on the ‘save_users_map_name’ function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the ‘usernames’ parameter.

Technical Analysis

WP Project Manager plugin is a task, project, and team management tool for WordPress. Upon closer examination of the code, we see that there is an API endpoint, the ‘save_users_map_name’ function, which updates a user’s github and bitbucket username.

[View this code snippet on the blog.]

The most significant problem and vulnerability is caused by the way the explode() and in_array() functions are used to ensure that only the ‘github’ and ‘bitbucket’ meta values can be updated. Unfortunately, these functions are not sufficient to prevent exploitation, because they can be bypassed with a special character, known as a homoglyph, that acts like an underscore, however, won’t be properly “exploded” but will be saved in the database as a proper underscore.

This made it possible for authenticated users, such as subscribers, to supply the ‘wp_capabilities’ array parameter with any desired role, such as administrator, when updating what should be username metadata, which would grant the user access to capabilities based on that role.

As with any Privilege Escalation vulnerability, this can be used for complete site compromise. Once an attacker has gained administrative user access to a WordPress site they can then manipulate anything on the targeted site as a normal administrator would. This includes the ability to upload plugin and theme files, which can be malicious zip files containing backdoors, and modifying posts and pages which can be leveraged to redirect site users to other malicious sites.
