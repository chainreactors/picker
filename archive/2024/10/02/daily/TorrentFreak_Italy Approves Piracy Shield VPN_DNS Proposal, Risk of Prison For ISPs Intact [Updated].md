# Italy Approves Piracy Shield VPN/DNS Proposal, Risk of Prison For ISPs Intact [Updated]

Italy's Senate Budget and Finance Committees have approved amended legal proposals that require VPN and DNS services located anywhere, to block pirated content flagged by rightsholders. Other service providers, including ISPs, will face prison for failing to report "known" criminal conduct. A vote on the text is scheduled for today and the new legislation could be in place in less than a week.

[![football-senate-s](https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-senate-s.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/football-senate-s.png)In 2023, the Italian government passed new legislation that aimed to rid the country of illegal IPTV services and web-based streaming platforms. At least in part, this would be achieved by blocking their domain names and IP addresses via the now-infamous Piracy Shield system.

To drive the message home, the law also introduced tougher criminal sanctions at the supply end of the market, with increased fines and custodial sentences on the table. For consumers, it meant that those pirate IPTV users face fines of up to 5,000 euros, and authorities suggest that [automated fines](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-iptv-subscribers-warned-they-face-automated-fines-240929/) might be just around the corner.

Last week, it was revealed that the tough new law (Law 93/2023), introduced last year and already amended once, was about to find itself amended again. Set to benefit top-tier football league ‘Serie A’ most in the short term, [the original proposals](https://torrentfreak.com/will-piracy-kill-football-in-italy-not-if-football-damages-the-internet-first-240927/) can be summarized as follows:

*• Compel VPN and DNS services to block pirated content, not just ISPs*

• Allow blocking of IP addresses and domains, even if legal content is present

• Remove limits on the volume of domains and IP addresses ISPs must permanently block

• Compel service providers to report *suspected* crime, or face up to a year in prison

## Amendments Approved, After a Series of Amendments

The proposals were signed by Senator Dario Damiani of the Forza Italia party on the input of Senator Claudio Lotito, also of Forza Italia. Senator Lotito understands football and lives and breathes Serie A. As the majority owner and president of Serie A football club Lazio, he’s uniquely positioned to take part in the lawmaking process and then benefit from the outcome.

The Senate Budget and Finance Committees have now approved the proposals we reported late last week but only after further amendments. The first set of changes are shown in the image below, with unchanged text in white, red representing the earlier text, and green the now-approved text; summarized as follows:

## Amendments (6.0.35) ([Law 93/2023](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2023-07-14;93))

• Incidental blocking of non-infringing sites and services permitted as long as shared server/resources “predominantly” used for infringement.

• New provision allowing those negatively affected by blocking to request revocation.

• “Alternative DNS services” clarified as “publicly available DNS” *(Pi-Hole users can therefore relax).*

• Proposal to block unlimited domains/IP addresses left intact.

• Introduction of provisions for domain registries / IP assignment services to unblock domains / IP addresses six months after initial blocking, providing illegal use has been discontinued.

• Introduction of provisions for domains / IP addresses to be removed from the Piracy Shield platform. Current law provides no mechanism for revoking domain or IP address blocks, leading to concerns IPv4 addresses could eventually run out.

*Amendments 6.0.35 ([Law 93/2023](https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2023-07-14;93))[![6.0.35 [text 1 and 2] diff-unified-1](https://torrentfreak.com/images/6.0.35-text-1-and-2-diff-unified-1.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/6.0.35-text-1-and-2-diff-unified-1.png)*

*Original documents [(old text](https://www.senato.it/loc/link.asp?tipodoc=EMENDC&leg=19&id=1428176&idoggetto=1429611) / [approved text](https://www.senato.it/loc/link.asp?tipodoc=EMENDC&leg=19&id=1428931&idoggetto=1429611)) (Italian)*

## Amendments (6.0.36)

• The requirement for providers of network access services, search engines, ISPs, VPN providers, CDN services, DNS providers and reverse proxy services, to report *suspected criminal activity* has been withdrawn.

• A replacement requirement specifies that when any of the above “become aware” that “criminal conduct is underway or has been committed or attempted” they must immediately report the circumstances to the “judicial authority” or “judicial police” providing all relevant information.

• A new requirement for online services to register a point of contact for direct communication with the authorities, for the purposes of tackling crime

• A prison sentence of up to one year, for failure to comply with the reporting requirements listed above, remains intact.

*Amendments (6.0.36)*[![6.0.36 [text 1 and 2] diff-unified-1](https://torrentfreak.com/images/6.0.36-text-1-and-2-diff-unified-1.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/6.0.36-text-1-and-2-diff-unified-1.png)

*Original documents [(old text](https://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=Emendc&leg=19&id=1428175&idoggetto=1429611) / [approved text](https://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/frame.jsp?tipodoc=Emendc&leg=19&id=1428932&idoggetto=1429611)) (Italian)*

## What Happens Next

A vote is scheduled for today and, if that goes to plan, the amendments will head immediately to the Chamber of Deputies (lower house of parliament) for a second reading before the measure expires on October 8, 2024.

The proposals, should they become law, could trigger a legal challenge. In an article published last Friday, the president of AIIP – the Italian Internet Provider Association – described the amendments as “an initiative that betrays two years of commitment and loyal collaboration in the sector.”

Giovanni Zorzoni says that the amendments run contrary to the conclusions reached following an AGCOM technical table last year, while introducing “new and dangerous surveillance obligations” on communication operators, supported by threats of imprisonment under criminal law.

In our article last weekend we mentioned an amendment in 2023 that allowed rightsholders to block domains without AGCOM oversight; that was considered a betrayal, Zorzoni’s public comments go much further than that.

## Keeping ISPs Happy Seems Less of a Priority

Confirmation that ISPs feel let down doesn’t come as a surprise. Assurances previously given to ensure full cooperation appear to have been forgotten once the critical phase ended. From the outside looking in, ISPs’ concerns never seemed likely to ge...
