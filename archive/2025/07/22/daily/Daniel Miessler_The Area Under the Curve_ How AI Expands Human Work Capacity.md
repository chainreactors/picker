# The Area Under the Curve: How AI Expands Human Work Capacity

Visualizing the gap between what humans can do and what needs to be done

The overwhelming volume of work that needs to be done (click for full size)

Every minute, millions of security events flow through corporate networks. Thousands of telescopes capture asteroids that could threaten Earth. Medical researchers analyze countless genetic sequences looking for disease patterns. And millions of hours of video are captured—many of which include crimes being committed.

But nobody's paying attention.

Not because we don't care, but because there's just too many *things* to watch. To do. To monitor. To take action on.

## The Universe of Intelligence Tasks [​](#the-universe-of-intelligence-tasks)

Our modern world runs on what I call Intelligence Tasks—work that requires human judgment, pattern recognition, and decision-making. These aren't things you can solve with simple automation or basic programming. They require actual intelligence.

Here's just a small sample of Intelligence Tasks happening (or not happening) right now:

### Security & Safety [​](#security-safety)

* `monitor_security_cameras` - Watch for suspicious activity
* `analyze_network_traffic` - Detect cyber intrusions
* `review_access_logs` - Find unauthorized access attempts
* `investigate_fraud_claims` - Determine if claims are legitimate
* `track_space_debris` - Monitor objects that could hit satellites

### Medical & Health [​](#medical-health)

* `analyze_xrays` - Look for abnormalities
* `check_moles` - Identify potential skin cancer
* `review_patient_history` - Find patterns in symptoms
* `monitor_vital_signs` - Detect concerning changes
* `analyze_genetic_data` - Identify disease markers

### Business Operations [​](#business-operations)

* `review_contracts` - Check for issues and risks
* `process_insurance_claims` - Determine validity and payout
* `analyze_customer_feedback` - Extract insights and trends
* `quality_inspection` - Find defects in products
* `evaluate_loan_applications` - Assess creditworthiness

### Research & Analysis [​](#research-analysis)

* `analyze_satellite_imagery` - Track military movements
* `review_scientific_papers` - Extract key findings
* `monitor_social_media` - Detect emerging threats
* `analyze_financial_data` - Find trading opportunities
* `investigate_corruption` - Uncover illegal activities

The list goes on endlessly. Every industry, every field, every aspect of modern life generates Intelligence Tasks faster than we can possibly handle them.

## What Makes Something an Intelligence Task? [​](#what-makes-something-an-intelligence-task)

Let's look at a concrete example to understand what we're talking about. Take CutePup, a company that curates cute dog photos for their website. Their process might seem simple, but it perfectly illustrates the concept:

![CutePup Workflow](/images/13c09127-64e2-49b2-b0d5-c5ab85021814-image.png)Even "simple" tasks require human intelligence when you can't code rules for them

This workflow has three Intelligence Tasks:

1. **Is it a dog?** - Requires visual pattern recognition
2. **Is it cute?** - Requires subjective judgment
3. **What breed is it?** - Requires specialized knowledge

You can't write traditional code to do these things. You need intelligence—either human or artificial.

Now imagine Chris, who works at CutePup. He sits at his desk all day looking at uploaded photos and clicking "Yes" or "No" on whether they contain dogs. His colleague Carol determines if the dogs are cute. Amir identifies the breeds.

CutePup employs 48,912 people just to process their daily photo uploads. Nearly 50,000 humans doing work that requires intelligence but is relatively simple.

## The Complexity Spectrum [​](#the-complexity-spectrum)

Not all Intelligence Tasks are created equal. Let's look at a more complex example: ClaimRight Insurance.

ClaimRight processes insurance claims for products that wear out prematurely. Their workflow shows how Intelligence Tasks can require significant expertise:

![ClaimRight workflow](/images/image.png?t=1722279962)Multiple Intelligence Tasks requiring experience and judgment

Their pipeline includes:

1. Analyzing 50 photos per claim
2. Determining coverage eligibility
3. Reviewing video testimony
4. Verifying identity through face/voice
5. Matching items across media
6. Distinguishing wear from abuse
7. Approving or denying payout

Meet Kira, one of their top performers. With 25 years of experience, she processes 29 cases per day with 89% accuracy—exceptional by human standards. But ClaimRight needs 349,219 employees to handle their claim volume.

The jump in complexity from CutePup to ClaimRight is significant, but let's go even further.

## When Intelligence Tasks Require Extreme Expertise [​](#when-intelligence-tasks-require-extreme-expertise)

Some Intelligence Tasks demand not just intelligence, but deep expertise built over decades. Consider Overseer, a military intelligence company analyzing satellite imagery:

![Overseer workflow](/images/e1c3b7e3-5f11-49aa-ab3a-79c0375319b6-image.png)High-stakes analysis requiring years of specialized training

Their daily workflow:

1. Process 28,452 new satellite images
2. Compare with previous day's imagery
3. Identify all objects and changes
4. Assess military significance
5. Correlate with other intelligence
6. Write targeted reports for different agencies

Kevin, one of their star analysts, can produce 9 complete intelligence reports per week. That's considered exceptional—he's one of the few who can work across multiple parts of the pipeline. But even with 712,309 employees, Overseer can only analyze a fraction of what needs attention.

Or take BadSpot, a medical service checking for dangerous moles:

![BadSpot workflow](/images/b919772e-dd77-45ab-a6eb-00a0a146d181-image.png)Life-or-death decisions requiring medical expertise

Every person working this pipeline must be:

* A licensed medical doctor (8+ years training)
* Dermatology specialized (3-4 additional years)
* Experienced in pattern recognition
* Capable of making life-or-death decisions

The result? Millions of people with suspicious moles never get them checked by a qualified professional. There simply aren't enough doctors.

## Visualizing the Work That Needs to Be Done [​](#visualizing-the-work-that-needs-to-be-done)

Now that we understand Intelligence Tasks, let's visualize the scale of the problem. This chart represents all the Intelligence Tasks that exist in our world:

The total Intelligence Tasks that exist in our world

The x-axis represents volume—how many tasks need to be done. Think millions of insurance claims, billions of security events, trillions of financial transactions.

The y-axis represents difficulty—the expertise and intelligence required. From "is this a dog?" at the bottom to "diagnose this rare disease" or "assess this military threat" at the top.

The area under the curve? That's everything that needs intelligent analysis to keep our civilization running smoothly.

## The Harsh Reality of Human Capacity [​](#the-harsh-reality-of-human-capacity)

Now let's overlay what humans can actually accomplish:

We're only covering a tiny corner of what needs to be done

This isn't even close to scale—we'd be an invisible speck.

That tiny blue area represents the sum total of human capacity. Every doctor, every analyst, every investigator, every expert on Earth working at fu...
