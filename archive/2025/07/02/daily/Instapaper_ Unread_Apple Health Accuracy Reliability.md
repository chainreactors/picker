Despite that, I think there are a couple of nuggets of information here that could be useful to know. So let’s dig in...  The Details    **The Files**  The two files we’ll be looking at are:   * /private/var/mobile/Library/Health/healthdb\_secure.sqlit * /private/var/root/Library/Caches/location/cache\_encryptedC.db   Apple Heath testing was focused on both the data found in **healthdb\_secure.sqlite** and **cache\_encryptedC.db** to determine the possibility of erroneous flight climb events or steps/distance being recorded while the device was travelling in a vehicle.  Further to that, the accuracy of the number of steps and distance travelled was tested for accuracy  .  **Cache\_encryptedC.db**  Cache\_encryptedC.db’s StepCountHistory table contains several fields that appear related to timestamps.   |  |  | | --- | --- | | startTime | This field consistently has a timestamp value that appears relevant to physical activity occurring. | | timestamp | This field is always increasing like a timestamp but cannot be converted to a typical timestamp value. | | activeTime | This field is always increasing like a timestamp but cannot be converted to a typical timestamp value. | | firstStepTime | This field does not always contain a value, although when it does it is around 3 seconds earlier than the startTime. |   The rest of the fields in the table track the total number of steps taken, meters travelled, floors ascended or descended etc.  When referring to records in this database, the startTime field was chosen as the most appropriate field to use as a timestamp and the activity was inferred from the difference in field values.  For example, if records existed which showed:   |  |  | | --- | --- | | **startTime** | **floorsAscended** | | 12:00:02 | 100 | | 12:00:08 | 101 |   This would indicate that that 12:00:08, the device detected a single floor was ascended as the value differs by one from the record which precedes it.  Likewise, if records existed which showed:   |  |  | | --- | --- | | **startTime** | **count** | | 12:00:10 | 1000 | | 12:00:20 | 1005 |   This would indicate that that between 12:00:10 and 12:00:20, the device detected 5 steps were taken as the value differs by 5 between the two records.    **Flights Climbed Times - Healthdb\_secure.sqlite vs cache\_encryptedC.sqlite**  **Test Scenario**   This test sought to find out the accuracy of the timestamps recorded in both the Health database and cache\_encryptedC databases.  The test involved placing 8 iPhones (various models/iOS versions) on a tray and ascending 2 flights of stairs twice. The total altitude difference between the top and bottom was slightly over 6m. At the half way point was an approximately 3m long landing.  The first ascent took place between 11:53:00 and 11:53:15 with a 45 second pause on the landing before the second flight was started. The second flight occurred between 11:54:00 and 11:54:16.  The second ascent started at 11:55:30 and occurred over the next 25 seconds with no prolonged pause on the landing.  **![](blog/resources/BlogArticles/36/1.png)**  Given Apple’s definition of a “Flight” being approximately 3m altitude gain over 16 steps, it was reasonable to postulate that 4 Flights should be recorded on the devices.  **Test Results - HealthDB\_secure.db [Samples]**   |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Device** | **iOS Version** | **Start Time** | **End Time** | **Flights Climbed** | | iPhone 8 | 14.2 | 11:53:27 | 11:56:00 | 3 | | iPhone X | 15.2.1 | 11:53:28 | 11:56:09 | 4 | | iPhone 6s | 15.8.3 | 11:53:28 | 11:56:13 | 4 | | iPhone X | 16.7.5 | 11:53:27 | 11:56:09 | 4 | | iPhone X | 16.7.10 | 11:53:28 | 11:56:10 | 4 | | iPhone SE (2) | 17.5.1 | 11:53:19 | 11:56:10 | 4 | | iPhone Xs | 17.6.1 | 11:53:21 | 11:56:10 | 3 | | iPhone 12 | 18.1 | 11:53:26 | 11:56:11 | 4 |     As can be seen from the table above, most devices recorded 4 flights climbed as expected. 2 devices only recorded 3 flights.  In general, the recorded Start Time was between 20 and 30 seconds after the actual start time of the ascent and the End Time was 10 to 15 seconds after the ascents were completed.  **Test Results - cache\_encryptedc.db [StepCountHistory]**   |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Device** | **iOS Version** | **First Flight** | **Second Flight** | **Third Flight** | **Fourth Flight** | | iPhone 8 | 14.2 | 11:53:30 | 11:54:46 | 11:56:00 | - | | iPhone X | 15.2.1 | 11:54:07 | 11:54:50 | 11:55:59 | 11:56:09 | | iPhone 6s | 15.8.3 | 11:54:06 | 11:54:47 | 11:56:00 | 11:56:13 | | iPhone X | 16.7.5 | 11:53:30 | 11:54:49 | 11:56:00 | 11:56:10 | | iPhone X | 16.7.10 | 11:54:06 | 11:54:51 | 11:56:00 | 11:56:10 | | iPhone SE (2) | 17.5.1 | 11:54:05 | 11:54:46 | 11:59:59 | 11:56:10 | | iPhone Xs | 17.6.1 | 11:53:29 | - | 11:56:00 | 11:56:10 | | iPhone 12 | 18.1 | 11:54:07 | <11:55:37 | 11:56:00 | 11:56:11 |   \*Note that due to a delay in extraction of the iPhone 12, some cache\_encryptedC.db records had been purged and were unrecoverable. This included the exact time of the Second Flight ascent. All that could be ascertained is that it occurred prior to 11:55:37.  The cache\_encryptedC.db data allowed a more granular view at the data and actually see when each flight was recorded as completed (I say completed as these times are derived from when the device recorded an increase in the flightsClimbed field - so although it didn’t tell me when the climb started, I know when the altitude difference was recognized).  This data has been laid out on the graph below.   * The solid green bars that run vertically across the graph are the actual times of the ascents. * The solid red lines which run horizontally indicate the timespan reported by HealthDB and the number of flights climbed during that time is shown at the far right. * The red crosses show the time that the ascent is recognized and written the cache\_encryptedC.db. * The dotted red line shows that there is no definitive time for this record due to record purging.   **![](blog/resources/BlogArticles/36/2.png)**  As can be seen on the graph, in all cases where a flight ascent was recorded, on average, the timestamp shows between 15 and 50 seconds *after* the ascent was completed.  In the case of the two consecutive flights being ascended, the first flight was recorded in cache\_encryptedC.db about 15 seconds after the midway point of the ascent, and the second flight had a timestamp 15 seconds after the ascent was completed.  **Conclusion**   The conclusion drawn from these tests is that the timestamps shown are not necessarily *exactly* when the activity took place. It may be obvious to state, but the iOS device is reactionary to the altitude increase, which needs to be detected by the device for the record to be created. This is definitively observed to occur once the flight climb is completed.  The time period provided from Apple Health provides a good general idea of when the flight climb activity happened and the cache\_encryptedC.db data, if present, can provide an additional level of fidelity even though the timestamp is in general ~15 to ~35 seconds post ascent.    **Steps & Distance**  This test was designed to evaluate the accuracy of the Steps and Distance taken during the recorded Health events.  **Test Scenario**  A R...
