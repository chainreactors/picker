## TL;DR

We are hiring consultants at various levels. The job posting can be found under the Consultant opening here: <https://specterops.io/careers/#careers>

![]()

## Introduction

Hey there! I’m Duane Michael, a Managing Consultant and red teamer at SpecterOps. Over the past four years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the company’s incredible journey. In that time, we’ve grown by almost 100 employees, built a product, created new teams and capabilities, trained thousands of students, and performed countless unique and challenging penetration tests and red team exercises.

I’m always chatting with applicants, friends, and fellow security geeks about SpecterOps and the unique blend of challenges and opportunities we offer. There’s a certain SpecterOps “sparkle” that’s hard to define but easy to recognize — a passion for pushing the boundaries of security, a collaborative spirit, and a commitment to growth. I find myself wishing I could bottle this essence and share it with a wider audience, hoping to attract more individuals who can contribute to and benefit from this special culture. This blog aims to illuminate some facets of the SpecterOps sparkle that red teamers will find particularly appealing.

The list is not comprehensive and there are many additional benefits and perks to working here that I won’t cover in this blog.

## Focus on Personal Sustainability

Burnout is real in this industry. Most of our leadership, all the way to the top, including our CEO and COO, are former operators and understand the importance of sustainability. We know how easy it is to get sucked down the rabbit hole researching the latest technique or Windows bug (feature). We have a flexible time off policy and we will *strongly encourage* you to take at least four weeks off during the year.

We also recognize that “utilization” is not the consultant’s responsibility; it’s a function of the sales pipeline and scheduling. While we track time to ensure projects are scoped and effectively resourced, you won’t be stressed about meeting arbitrary utilization targets. Your job is to do your best work.

Consultancies are known for their high travel cadence. That was certainly true before 2020, but on-site assessment requirements have significantly decreased post-COVID. An unfortunate side effect of reduced client travel is reduced face-to-face interactions and collaboration. Do you like to travel occasionally to meet up with your team? We offer a “discretionary travel” benefit, where you can optionally fly out to one of our offices for one week per quarter to collaborate with your project team face-to-face. We also coordinate larger department events, where we run hackathons and play mini-golf. Regardless of your travel appetite, we have something for everyone.

**Pro-tip**: Instructing our training courses is a great way to travel, especially internationally. I’ve had the privilege to take four trips to Europe in two years to teach [*Adversary Tactics: Red Team Operations*](https://specterops.io/training/red-team-operations/)*.*

## Professional Development

Our people are what makes us unique, so we invest in you! The most obvious way we invest in our people is through monetary budget benefits, such as our $5000/year professional development (PD) budget and our $5250/year higher education budget. Still, there’s so much more. Money is only half of the equation. PD requires time and a lot of it. We provide all Specters three weeks of PD time to spend in flexible ways, including (but not limited to) training courses, research, tool development, and blog or conference talk creation.

*Most recently, I used some of my PD time to develop the* [*Misconfiguration Manager*](https://github.com/subat0mik/Misconfiguration-Manager) *project,* [*blog*](/misconfiguration-manager-overlooked-and-overprivileged-70983b8f350d)*, and* [*SO-CON*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvaOszFzXCQ) *and* [*Troopers*](https://troopers.de/troopers24/talks/nvp3zs/) *conference talks. Other Specters commonly use this time for training or progress toward their professional goals.*

## Details

In addition to personal PD time, we offer various opportunities for consultants to get hands-on experience for one to six months in other areas of the company outside of consulting. We refer to these temporary assignments as “details.” Some teams you may be assigned or request a detail on include:

**Internal and Community Products (ICP):** The development team responsible for many of the open-source projects SpecterOps is known for, such as [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) and [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter). A detail to this team entails development on one of the projects and serves as a great way to flex and build your development muscles.

*Earlier this year,* [*Jonathan Owens*](https://x.com/DragoQcc)*, one of our Consultants, spent two months detailed to the ICP team to work on the C# Mythic agent,* [*Apollo*](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Apollo)*.*

**Research and Development (R&D):** Our R&D team focuses on large-scale, open-ended research problems and they’re always looking for more. If you have a research idea, you can submit a proposal and you may earn a detail to the team to research and flesh out your idea!

*In 2023,* [*Evan McBroom*](https://x.com/mcbroom_evan) *spent three months with the R&D team to research Windows authentication packages and develop the* [*LSA Whisperer*](/lsa-whisperer-20874277ea3b) *tool.* [*Max Harley*](https://x.com/0xdab0) *also spent three months with the R&D team to help build* [*Nemesis*](https://medium.com/specter-ops-posts/shadow-wizard-registry-gang-structured-registry-querying-9a2fab62a26f...
