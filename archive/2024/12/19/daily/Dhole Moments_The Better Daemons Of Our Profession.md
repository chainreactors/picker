I’ve spent the better part of 2023 and 2024 trying to imagine the specific changes we technology nerds could make to improve things somewhat.

![The Matt Bors "we should improve society somewhat" comic, but the person coming out of the well is the Sickos saying "Yes... ha ha ha... YES!" instead of a debate-bro.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/8798530bdf773d0f.jpg?resize=680%2C494&ssl=1)

I’ve shared some of my ideas and musings throughout the past year. Briefly:

You are not required to read any of these blog posts. In fact, [none of this matters](https://soatok.blog/2024/09/09/doesnt-matter/).

Not to put too fine a point on it: If I got hit by a bus tomorrow, don’t expect a black bar on Hacker News (should word of my passing even reach them).

Most people don’t give a fuck about me or you.

Most people *shouldn’t* give a fuck about us. Isn’t it enough that *we* care about ourselves?

## Enough

Much yarn has been spun about the evils of social media, and of “algorithms”. (Really, recommendation systems.)

Journalists seem to love to write about how tech companies amplify engagement-bait to keep you coming back to their platform, and use the data you provide to improve the efficacy of their ad placements.

Greed is good. Everything in service of [the line going up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g).

I’ve spent the past couple of years primarily posting [on Mastodon](https://furry.engineer/%40soatok), where there is no recommendation algorithm to appease. If you post good things, other people will see it, and it will get popular because other people will boost it.

I’ve spent the same number of months diving through specifications and trying to envision [the best strategy for improving the privacy of direct messages](https://soatok.blog/category/technology/open-source/fediverse-e2ee-project/).

I will refrain from describing this time as a “detox”, as so many bloggers are prone to do, because I’m painfully aware of the distinction between an **addiction** and a **compulsive behavior**. (This is partly because, as a gay furry online, I’m constantly forced to engage with [the “sex/porn addiction” narrative](https://journalofpositivesexuality.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Addiction-to-Sex-Porn-Position-Statement-from-CPS-TASHRA-NCSF.pdf).)

But I will say the past couple of years has been **enlightening**.

![Soatok gasping with a lightbulb above his head, as if shouting, "Eureka!"](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SoatokBulb.png?resize=512%2C397&ssl=1)

The worst evils of social media might related to the greed of the companies that built the platforms, but the power of such platforms to poison our egos cannot be overstated. Even the Fediverse is not immune to this effect.

**Gamification and enshittification are never far apart.**

I [recently suggested](https://bsky.app/profile/soatok.bsky.social/post/3ldjxv2nuxs2p) Bluesky replace raw follower counts with a humbling percentage of all Bluesky users that follow you. For most of us, this would result in something like this:

![Dev Tools modification of my Bluesky profile with the follower count replaced by "0.00%".](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/soatok-bluesky-0.00-percent.png?resize=611%2C445&ssl=1)

The limited number of significant digits is deliberate.

This wasn’t entirely a serious suggestion; I merely wanted to provoke others to imagine software that didn’t try to hijack people’s dopamine receptors through gamification and dark patterns.

Of course, if you suggest this sort of notion to any VC-funded startup, you’ll struggle to be taken seriously. After all, [the tech industry collectively chooses to not understand consent](https://soatok.blog/2024/02/27/the-tech-industry-doesnt-understand-consent/).

![Windows prompt. Title: "Howdy, Stranger?" Window contents: "Would you like to have sex? Right here, right now." There are two buttons. The first (selected) is labeled "Yes". The other is labeled "Maybe Later".](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image.png?resize=274%2C169&ssl=1)

This isn’t acceptable, but tech companies think it is.

The harms of ego poisoning aren’t mitigated by intelligence or social status. Let me share a poignant example:

## American Bald Ego

Daniel J. Bernstein (DJB), a prolific cryptographer (who has provided the Internet with Curve25519, Salsa20, Poly1305, and many other important algorithms used widely today), was recently admonished for [his unprofessional behavior on an IETF mailing list discussion](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/_15N-0uipLJAIBEPlEq_7F2NB2Q/).

> You continue to violate list policy with unprofessional commentary on other participants’ motivations and repeatedly raising points that are out of scope. Please stop this behavior. This is the last warning before we will take action and temporarily ban you from the list; see BCP 94 [0].

This caught my attention, so I read the discussion that preceded this warning to figure out what the hell just happened. But as with most IETF mailing lists, the context isn’t super interesting to most people who aren’t (in this case, antitrust policy) super nerds.

The discussion in question started with an RFC draft proposed by [Deirdre Connolly](https://durumcrustulum.com/) to support ML-KEM (the NIST approved post-quantum [key encapsulation mechanism](https://soatok.blog/2024/02/26/kem-trails-understanding-key-encapsulation-mechanisms/)) in newer versions of TLS.

It’s important to know that Deirdre Connolly also co-authored [X-Wing, a hybrid KEM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/039). When someone suggested they have customers asking for non-hybrid KEMs (i.e., only ML-KEM), DJB cited antitrust rules while concern-trolling, which led to [this succinct response from Filippo Valsorda](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/sEre58h7AHwzZOGH_P6TFGYFGQQ/).
