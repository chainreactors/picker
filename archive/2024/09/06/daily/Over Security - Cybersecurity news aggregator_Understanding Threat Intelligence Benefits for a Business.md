Understanding Threat Intelligence Benefits for a Business

***Editor’s Note****: This is an edited version of an article originally posted in October 2023. It has been updated with some new information about ANY.RUN’s threat intelligence products.*

As a business owner, you’ve likely invested in a range of security tools like SIEMs, antivirus software, and IDS/IPS systems to safeguard your operations.

You might even have a dedicated cybersecurity team that monitors your systems and responds to incidents such as a SOC (Security Operations Center) or a DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) team.

But here’s the question: Are your teams equipped to go beyond simply reacting to cybersecurity incidents? If your company underutilizes threat intelligence, chances are they’re not.

## Understanding the role of Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber threat intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data on potential or current cybersecurity threats. It plays an important role in helping organizations detect and prevent cyberattacks by offering insights into adversaries’ [tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-ttps-explained/)

CTI spans a wide range of activities, from identifying malware variants to monitoring trends in cybercrime, and it involves the use of specialized tools to protect against evolving threats.

**Types of threat intelligence tools**

| Category | Primary Use Cases | Primary Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Threat Intelligence Feeds | Expand threat coverage of your security systems like SIEMs, firewalls, and IPS/IDS with the latest IOCs. | 1. SOC Team   2 Incident Response Team |
| [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/) | Provide linked, contextual data around indicators, allowing to query databases for known IOCs such as malicious IPs, URLs, or file hashes. | 1. SOC Team  2. Threat Analysts |
| Sandboxing Solutions | Analyze suspicious files or URLs in isolated environments to understand their behavior and impact. | 1. SOC Team  2. Threat Analysts |
| Aggregation Platforms | Enable to combine multiple threat feeds for analysis and correlation, enhancing decision-making during an incident. | 1. SOC Team  2. Threat Intelligence Analysts |
| Threat Sharing Platforms | Facilitate the sharing of structured threat information within a community or organization. | 1. Threat Intelligence Team  2. SOC Team |

Keep in mind that internal organizational structures differ among companies. Your team names and responsibilities may vary, but the table above should give you a solid understanding of who typically uses which threat intelligence tools and for what purpose.

## What happens in teams that don’t have threat intelligence

Without threat intelligence tools, your teams are essentially flying blind. Consider a situation where a suspicious artifact shows up in your system logs, like an unfamiliar IP address. How does the SOC team immediately identify what this IP means and how to address it effectively?

In short, without threat intelligence, they can’t.

Manual research will be needed instead, requiring the team to pull data from various open-source sources to understand the threat. This process takes time, and time is something you can’t afford to lose during an active attack.

One of the primary goals of threat intelligence is to provide context for artifacts and indicators. Linking an IOC to a specific threat and then to TTPs helps the team understand the exact steps needed to counter the threat.
