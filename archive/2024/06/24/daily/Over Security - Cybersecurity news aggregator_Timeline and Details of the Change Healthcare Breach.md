We used Microsoft Designer to create this abstract image.

**Important Note: This article is not for the purpose of blame and shame on Change Healthcare or any other named persons or companies. The purpose is to track a major breach, highlight several details, and provide lessons learned. The impact of this breach continues to be highlighted because there was more news every time I went to write more about it. Even as of this writing, there was another bit of news, so I added that.**

# A Timeline Story of Change Healthcare Breach

It’s February 12, 2024. Using leaked credentials, criminals exploit the Change Healthcare Citrix portal and gain remote desktop access.

Then, on March 14, 2024, we discovered that the Change Healthcare hack might affect [billing and care authorization portals](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/minnesota/articles/2024-02-29/a-large-us-health-care-tech-company-was-hacked-its-leading-to-billing-delays-and-security-concerns?ref=secjuice.com), leading to [prescription backlogs](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-02-23/hack-against-change-healthcare-resulting-in-delays-says-american-pharmacists-association?ref=secjuice.com) and [missed revenue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/03/change-health-care-hack-hospitals/?ref=secjuice.com), posing threats to paychecks and patient care.

On April 8, 2024, we learn of a second round of ransomware attacks. "RansomHub claimed responsibility for attacking Change Healthcare in the last few hours, saying it had 4 TB of the company's data containing personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to active US military personnel and other patients, medical records, payment information, and more. The miscreants demanded a ransom payment from the healthcare IT business within 12 days, or its data would be sold to the highest bidder."

*(Relevant side note: on March 22, 2024, it’s believed that ALPHV may have turned into RansomHub – see* [*https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-ransomhub*](https://socradar.io/dark-web-profile-ransomhub/?ref=secjuice.com)*)*

On April 19, people asked:

> "Is OCR’s [*Office for Civil Rights*] 2016 ransomware guidance applicable to the Change Healthcare cyberattack?"

The answer?Yes.

> "OCR’s [ransomware guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/guidance/cybersecurity/ransomware-fact-sheet/index.html?ref=secjuice.com#footnote6_j3aqq5s)  provides specific information on the steps covered entities and  business associates should take to determine if a ransomware incident is  a HIPAA breach. A breach, under the HIPAA Rules, is defined as, ‘…the  acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of [PHI] in a manner not  permitted under the [[HIPAA Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html?ref=secjuice.com)]  which compromises the security or privacy of the PHI.’ See 45 CFR 164.402. Whether the presence of ransomware would be a breach under the HIPAA Rules is a fact-specific determination."

Customers and those affected are looking for a response from someone, anyone, and soon.

 On April 22, 2024, Change admitted it paid the $22 million ransomware payment.

Then on April 30, Tom Kellerman (*SVP of cyber strategy at Contrast Security*On April 30, Tom Kellerman (SVP of cyber strategy at Contrast Security) said, “It’s extremely frustrating to have one of the largest companies in the world failing to meet its obligations under existing law to adequately protect some of our most sensitive personal information.”

Multifactor authentication (MFA) was not enabled. Requiring MFA is considered Security 101 - "This underscores pure negligence on the part of UnitedHealth."

 On May 2, 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s (Change is a subsidiary) CEO Andrew Witty "… estimated that data belonging to a substantial portion of the U.S.  population could be at risk, although he noted that the exact number of  affected individuals is still being determined.”

Now we come to May 6. where we read 5 key lessons learned:

> “1. Legacy tech at Change amplified attack’s impact

> 2. Stolen credentials unlocked access'

> 3. Incident response cavalry called in

> 4. Response and recovery snags

> 5. Multifactor authentication wasn’t turned on”

On May 13, the impact has grown. “ALPHV’s cyber attack on Change Healthcare is one of the most impactful in history. Change Healthcare is one of the world's largest health payment processing companies, and it is a subsidiary of United Healthcare. As a clearing house for 15 billion medical claims yearly, it makes up [nearly 40% of all claims](https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/what-we-learned-change-healthcare-cyber-attack?ref=secjuice.com).”

Now we’re up to May 20, and we see the following complaints from groups about the lack of notifications, especially when it’s a) this late in the game and b) things seem to be getting worse:

![](https://www.secjuice.com/content/images/2024/06/image.png)

On May 21, 2024, we read that "More than 100 medical associations and industry groups representing tens of thousands of U.S. doctors and healthcare professionals have  banded together to urge federal regulators to hold Change Healthcare  responsible for breach notifications related to a massive February  ransomware attack." ([https://www.databreachtoday.com/100-groups-urge-feds-to-put-uhg-on-hook-for-breach-notices-a-25285](https://www.databreachtoday.com/100-groups-urge-feds-to-put-uhg-on-hook-for-breach-notices-a-25285?ref=secjuice.com))

We’re up to June 20, and “…Change will begin to notify health care providers, insurance companies, and other customers that their patients’ data was stolen in the company’s February cyberattack…” [https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/change-healthcare-cyberattack-patient-data-stolen-notification/](https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/20/change-healthcare-cyberattack-patient-data-stolen-notification/?ref=secjuice.com) (this link has a handy brief timeline of the main events)
