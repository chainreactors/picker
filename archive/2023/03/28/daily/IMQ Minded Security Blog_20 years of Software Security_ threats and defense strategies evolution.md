# 20 years of Software Security: threats and defense strategies evolution

Software security has come a long way in the past two decades. With the advent of new technologies and a rapidly evolving threat landscape, defending against cyber attacks has become more challenging than ever before. We recently presented on the evolution of software security threats and defense strategies at the [Security Summit in Milan on 15th March 2023](https://securitysummit.it/eventi/milano-2023/sessioni/20-anni-di-software-security-l-evoluzione-delle-minacce-e-delle-difese). In this blog post, we'll explore some of the key takeaways from the presentation.

In the early 1990s, the Internet was still in its infancy, and most people accessed it through their workstations or personal computers. Security threats were relatively simple, and malware and viruses were typically spread through floppy disks or infected email attachments. As the Internet became more ubiquitous, so did the security threats. In the early 2000s, browser-based attacks became more common, and operating systems became a prime target for cyber criminals.

With the rise of mobile devices in the 2010s, new security challenges emerged. Smartphones and tablets became a popular target for attackers, and the proliferation of internet-connected devices made it easier than ever for hackers to find vulnerabilities. The number of devices and users increased rapidly, creating a larger attack surface for hackers to exploit.

Fast forward to 2020, and the Internet of things (IoT) and automotive industries are the new frontiers of software security. IoT devices such as home assistants, smart thermostats, and security cameras are often poorly secured and easily hacked. Automotive software is becoming increasingly complex, with trillions of lines of code running on modern cars. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in software also presents new security risks.

The timing for a successful attack has also changed dramatically over the years. In the past, attackers had to rely on users to download and execute malicious software. Today, many attacks are automated and can happen in real-time, targeting vulnerable devices as soon as they connect to the Internet.

As software becomes more integrated into our lives, the security risks also increase. In the past, a security breach might have resulted in the loss of some data or a temporary disruption in service. Today, a security breach could have much more serious consequences, including the loss of life in the case of critical infrastructure or autonomous vehicles.

**The evolution of software security approach** is as important as the evolution of the software security scenario itself. In the early days of software development, security was not given much importance. But as the importance of technology grew, the security risks also grew, which led to the evolution of the software security approach.
