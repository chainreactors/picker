# Satellite Imagery Shows Vast Destruction in Rafah

“Please, can you help me obtain a recent photo of my residential area in Tall As Sultan to check on our homes?”

The question was sent via X, the platform previously known as Twitter, and detailed an area on the outskirts of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza. Such requests, from people who say they’ve been forced to flee their homes, have become common for many open source researchers documenting Israel’s 10-month-old invasion.

Verifying the identity of those sending such messages can be difficult. Israel has prevented foreign press from entering Gaza, which has suffered extensively during the air and ground incursion that followed the October 7 Hamas attacks. Many Gazans who reach out, meanwhile, take precautions not to reveal their real identity – especially if they voice frustrations about Hamas.

On this occasion, the broader issue was something Bellingcat had already been monitoring for several weeks.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded Rafah in May this year in order to establish control over the Gaza-Egypt border – an eight-mile-long strip of land referred to as the “Philadelphi Corridor”. Recent imagery provided by Planet Labs PBC showed a large amount of destruction not only along the corridor but in neighbourhoods two kilometres from the border such as eastern Tall As Sultan.

*Before and after satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows the eastern residential neighbourhood. After the IDF began an operation in the area, the majority of buildings in the neighbourhood were destroyed.*

Using [OpenStreetMap building data](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Gaza_Update_2024), Bellingcat found that out of the roughly 670 buildings in an eastern neighbourhood of Tall As Sultan, only 224 remained standing.

Based on historical imagery from Google Earth, it is possible to see that the largely residential area was built more than a decade ago. But most buildings were demolished between July 18 and August 4 2024, after the IDF arrived. The house identified by the individual who reached out via X was one of those that had been demolished.

In May, U.S. President Joe Biden set a “red line” for Israel during [an interview with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/politics/joe-biden-interview-cnntv/index.html). If the Israel Defense Forces went into Rafah’s population centres, such as Tall As Sultan, his administration was going to start limiting what weapons the U.S. would provide Israel. When asked about the red line days later, [U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken clarified](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-kristen-welker-of-nbcs-meet-the-press-3/) that the president specifically referred to a “major military operation” in Rafah.

The Biden administration’s position [has not changed](https://www.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-1-2024/) since then. Bellingcat asked the US State Department whether the IDF had crossed any red lines but had not received an answer by the time of publication.

Yet further satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows how the landscape of other parts of Rafah and southern Gaza, beyond just Tall As Sultan, have changed dramatically since May.

## Plans To Expand the Philadelphi Corridor

The IDF announced they had “operational control” over the Philadelphi Corridor [in late May](https://t.me/manniefabian/45157). Recent satellite imagery shows they are maintaining a military presence along the corridor.

The Planet Labs imagery shows vast swaths of Rafah have been damaged or destroyed since the IDF began its ground operation in the city. Bellingcat has annotated before and after imagery of a section of Rafah stretching from the border crossing with Egypt to the coast.

*Scroll and zoom to see damage along the Philadelphi Corridor in each of the date tabs. The first image is from November 23, 2023, after Israeli forces had already started hitting Rafah with airstrikes. The second one is from April 2024, before the major ground operation in May began. The latest image is from August 22, 2024.*

Using a [damage tracking tool](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/11/15/a-new-tool-allows-researchers-to-track-damage-in-gaza/) developed by Bellingcat contributor [Ollie Ballinger](https://oballinger.github.io/), Bellingcat estimates that almost 8,500 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in just this region of southern Gaza alone from the start of the war in October last year until July of this year. The number is likely higher, given the destruction visible in the more recent August imagery from Planet Labs.

[Data from the Decentralized Damage Mapping Group](https://www.conflict-damage.org/), which uses Sentinel-1 radar data to determine damage throughout the Gaza Strip, shows that almost 44 percent of all buildings in the Rafah governorate in southern Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.

[Reporting from the Times of Israel’s military correspondent](https://x.com/manniefabian/status/1813227006936465551?t=kDGVoqZIJkV0kT3ntvAVYA) suggests the IDF plans to expand the Philadelphi Corridor as deep as 800 metres into southern Gaza, something that would result in the destruction of even more homes and most of the city of Rafah.

“The plan to expand the Philadelphi Route stems from the need to improve the infrastructure for vehicle and armoured vehicle travel. […] The aim of expanding the route is to reduce the number of these accidents and provide drivers with safer access to the area. This action will improve the IDF’s operational capabilities and protect the lives of both soldiers and civilians,” the IDF told Bellingcat.

Satellite imagery shows that the Israel Defense Forces demolished entire city blocks along this route, including the Brazil Refugee Camp and the Al Salam Neighborhood. This is something that has happened in [other parts of the Gaza Strip](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2024/04/29/weve-become-addicted-to-explosions-the-idf-unit-responsible-for-demolishing-homes-across-gaza/) in the past.
