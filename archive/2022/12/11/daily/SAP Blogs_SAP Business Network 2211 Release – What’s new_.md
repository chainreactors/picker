This blog post provides an overview of key innovations in the 2211 Release of SAP Business Network Solutions.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/11/Networks_3_Text.jpg)

On November 11, 2022, we released exciting new SAP Business Network innovations for our customers. We continue the vision based on the foundation laid down in the 2105 release back in May 2021.

Let me share some of the key highlights from the SAP Business Network 2211 Release: -

**Network Onboarding and Account Administration Improvements**

In order to comply and provide transparency to the Trading Partner verification process, for any account on SAP Business Network, a verification is performed to check the validity of the company profile information against data quality rules. If an account fails the verification, an automated email notification is sent to the email address used to create the account. The account is set for verification if the company profile information is updated. If it is not updated within 30 days of receiving the email notification, the account will be expired.

Additionally, when logging on to SAP Business Network, if your first name, last name, or email address is missing, or if your phone number contains non-Latin characters or hyphen (-), you get a post-login reminder to update these fields. When you update your contact information based on post-login reminder, SAP Business Network validates your contact information against data quality rules. If validation fails, an error message is displayed, prompting you to update the fields with the correct information.

**Trading relationship requests for standard accounts**

SAP Business Network buyers can now send trading relationship requests to unregistered suppliers, allowing them to register new standard accounts on SAP Business Network. The trading relationship request template, vendor CSV file template, and Supplier Invite API have been enhanced to include methods to indicate the account type that an invited supplier registers with.

**New standard account registration experience for the payment proposal**

The supplier invitation letters for the Payment Proposal enablement method have been updated to include SAP Business Network branding. Suppliers registering this way are onboarded as standard accounts using the new SAP Business Network experience.

**Supplier self-service to downgrade account type into a Freemium Account.**

Suppliers no longer have to contact SAP Ariba Support Services to convert from an enterprise account to a Freemium account or so-called Standard Accounts. The convert option is now entirely self-service.The enterprise administrative user is presented with an account change eligibility check screen. All the pre-checks are automatically performed.

Converting to standard accounts results in losing advanced account capabilities such as full external integration, supply chain collaboration features, priority customer service and more.

**E-Invoicing and Localization**

**Peppol integration extended to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway.**

SAP Business Network established a connection to the Peppol Network earlier in 2022 and is available in Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. We have now extended the rollout for additional European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway.

**Supplier Insights:**

**Invoice cycle time KPI**

The new Invoice cycle time KPI widget allows suppliers to track the invoice processing performance of their customers and identify potential credit and collection issues. Invoice cycle time KPI measures the time required to process (intake, review, matching, approval, and payment setup) a single supplier invoice within the Accounts Payable department.

**KPI Definition:** The number of business days required to process an invoice from when the invoice is received by the Accounts Payable Department until it is approved and scheduled for payment.

**Approved Invoices KPI**

The Approved invoices widget calculates the quantity and value of approved invoices. It works with the invoice cycle time KPI widget to help suppliers understand customer performance.

**KPI Definition:** The KPI is calculated based on the value and quantity of approved invoices time by counting scheduled payments sent to you by your customers.
