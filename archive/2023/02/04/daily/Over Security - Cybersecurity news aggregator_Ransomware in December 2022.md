## Ransomware in December 2022

February 1, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

*Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence builds a monthly picture of ransomware activity by monitoring the information published by ransomware gangs on their dark web leak sites. This information represents victims who were successfully attacked but opted not to pay a ransom.*

Lockbit has rebounded from its unusual fall from grace in November, snatching the title of the month’s worst ransomware, [back from Royal](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2023/01/ransomware-in-november-2022). Royal has meanwhile still shown itself as a force to be reckoned with, ranking third in number of attacks for December.

Attacks by Royal may be down 35 percent from their high of 49 in November, but at the same time, there’s good reason to suspect that their attacks are becoming more targeted.

On December 07, 2022, the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3)—an arm of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)—[released a threat brief](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/royal-ransomware-analyst-note.pdf) about Royal after observing the group disproportionately targeting the healthcare industry. Their crowning attack for December came late in the month when they breached [telecommunications company Intrado](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/royal-ransomware-claims-attack-on-intrado-telecom-provider/).

In terms of progress, the two newcomers that we introduced last month, Play and Project Relic, have vastly different stories to tell.

Project Relic has fallen off the map while Play has turned up the jets—we recorded a whopping 136 percent increase in attacks from the gang compared to November. Since our last update Play has been seen leveraging a never-before-seen exploit chain, which might be responsible for their sharp uptick in attacks. The new Microsoft Exchange attack, dubbed [‘OWASSRF’](https://duo.com/decipher/play-ransomware-group-using-new-proxynotshell-exploit), chains exploits for [CVE-2022-41082](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2022-41082) and [CVE-2022-41080](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41080) to gain initial access to corporate networks. This was the technique behind a ransomware attack on [cloud computing service provider Rackspace](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/rackspace-confirms-it-suffered-a-ransomware-attack) in early December, which Play later claimed responsibility for.

Play’s surge in activity, however, was hardly an anomaly for December. Month-on-month we saw hefty percentage-point increases in attacks across the board.

ALPHV (aka BlackCat), for example, is a ransomware gang that has consistently topped the charts in our ransomware reviews; the number of their attacks in December (33), however, is not only a 70 percent increase from November but also the highest it’s been all 2022. We also saw 25 percent and 116 percent increases from BianLian and BlackBasta, respectively. These upticks are perhaps to be expected, [given that attackers famously love the holiday](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/11/how-to-stay-secure-from-ransomware-attacks-this-labor-day-weekend) seasons due to the reduction in security staff on deck.
