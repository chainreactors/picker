British high street giant WH Smith has revealed that it has suffered a ‚Äúcybersecurity incident,‚Äù which has seen hackers gain unauthorised access to its systems, and steal data including information related to current and former employees.

In its [statement filed at the London Stock Exchange](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/SMWH/notice-of-cyber-security-incident/15859335 "Link to WH Smith statement") it doesn‚Äôt mention the word ‚Äúransomware‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think anyone would be surprised if that‚Äôs what happened.

The retailer, which has hundreds of stores across the United Kingdom says that its investigation into the incident is ongoing and that it takes ‚Äúsecurity extremely seriously.‚Äù

Does any company ever announce it‚Äôs been hacked \*without\* saying it takes security seriously? I don‚Äôt think so‚Ä¶

![Whsmith notice](https://grahamcluley.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/whsmith-notice.jpeg)

WH Smith says it is informing all affected employees, and has notified the relevant authorities.

Customer databases and WH Smith‚Äôs online presence are not affected according to the company.

In due course we‚Äôll no doubt learn more about what has happened, and the nature of the data which has been stolen by WH Smith‚Äôs attackers. Whether that will become clear through news released from WH Smith itself, or by a ransomware gang publishing details of what it has done on the dark web, remains to be seen‚Ä¶

Last year one of WH Smith‚Äôs subsidiaries, online greeting cards business Funky Pigeon, suffered [its own cybersecurity incident](https://grahamcluley.com/funky-pigeon-stalls-orders-after-hackers-breached-its-systems/) after hackers gained access to its systems.
