# The First Wi-Fi Training and Certification Mini-Event

Next month, [Peter Mackenzie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mackenziewifi) and I are co-hosting the first [Wireless Tech Summit](https://www.wirelesstechsummit.com/), a Wi-Fi training and certification mini-event. The best part? It will be in-person here in North Carolina!

Okay, maybe that’s not actually the *best* part. The *best* part is probably the concept overall. We wanted to give people access to training and peer connections they may not otherwise have, and do it at a critical time in Wi-Fi history.

The FCC has opened new spectrum so we’re managing 2.4Ghz, 5GHz, and now 6GHz with Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7, and that has huge implications for both the design and security of our networks. Plus, Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 require WPA3 security and unfortunately, there’s no easy button for migrating from WPA2 to WPA3.

So, we thought we could get together, co-host a mini-event, and give people four days of training and certification coupled with peer networking and social events. Plus, some special joint labs, testing, and guest speakers to round it out!

It’s bigger than a training, and smaller than a conference. A way to maximize time and precious training budget without having to give up a weekend.

The [November 2024 event](https://www.wirelesstechsummit.com/) offers a choice from two training classes:

* [Wi-Fi Design and Hamina Certified Network Architect](https://www.wirelesstechsummit.com/WirelessTechSummit2024#/wlandesignandhaminacourse) with Peter Mackenzie
* [Secure Wi-Fi Architecture Masterclass](https://www.wirelesstechsummit.com/WirelessTechSummit2024#/securewifi) and Certification with me (JJ) and Jonathan Davis

All three of us are practitioners. Meaning, we teach only part time and the rest of our time is focused on doing the work related to our class content. The content is not only fresh and timely but also real-world and hyper applicable to the daily roles of engineers and architects.

Our first Secure Wi-Fi Architecture Class at WLPC 2024 ([read more](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7255613632116396032/))

Peter is arguably one of the best and most popular Wi-Fi instructors in the the world. He’s not only teaching the course, he developed it (and many others). You can find his full offering at [MQ Training Services](https://www.mqts.co.uk/), based out of the UK, including a suite of the [CWNP courses](https://www.mqts.co.uk/cwnp-training) such as CWNA, CWDP, and CWAP.

[Jonathan Davis (JD)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanadavis/) is also a CWNP-certified instructor and CWNE (Certified Wireless Network Expert) and brings deep Wi-Fi knowledge to our security architecture class, where I of course dive into the depths of security from technology to compliance.

As for me, well I’ve been doing network security for over 20 years and layer that with 15+ years deeply focused on more holistic security architecture addressing all aspects of security. The class is based on those 20 years of experience working with and in hundreds of client environments across all industries.

Check out more class details on the event site, including videos. We’d love to have you join us at this or another upcoming event!
