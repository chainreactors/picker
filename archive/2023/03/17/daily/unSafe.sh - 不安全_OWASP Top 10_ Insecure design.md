*Listed as #4 on the OWASP Top 10 list, insecure design is a new category added in 2021 and is related to design and architectural flaws in web apps.*

Insecure design is a new category in the OWASP Top 10 in 2021. Listed at #4, it is a broad category related to critical design and architectural flaws in web applications that hackers can exploit.

Insecure designs can’t be fixed by a perfect implementation. They require security controls to mitigate the threats. In this [video](https://youtu.be/jBwesZOmARk), Jonathan Knudsen, head of global research at the [Cybersecurity Research Center](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/cybersecurity-research-center.html), demonstrates an example of an insecure design flaw with a banking application. Viewers also learn what security controls are necessary to mitigate risks associated with insecure design flaws.
