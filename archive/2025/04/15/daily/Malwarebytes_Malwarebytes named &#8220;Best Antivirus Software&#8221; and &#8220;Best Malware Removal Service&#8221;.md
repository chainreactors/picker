Horn tooting time: We’re excited to say we’ve earned a coveted spot in PCMag’s “[Best Antivirus Software for 2025](https://uk.pcmag.com/antivirus/8141/the-best-antivirus-protection#malwarebytes-premium-security-27167)” list, and been recognized as the “Best [Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) Removal Service 2025” by CNET.

PCMag’s rigorous [evaluation process](https://uk.pcmag.com/security/84684/how-we-test-antivirus-and-security-software) takes into account a range of factors, including real-world, hands-on testing, independent lab tests, and decades of experience in the field.
