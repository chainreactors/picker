It is not a secret anymore, that we are already counting the days to be with you again at our [International SAP Conference for Utilities](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities)  and [International SAP Conference for Oil, Gas and Energy](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-energy/) in Basel in April 2023.

As it is a joint conference, I am happy to co-host the sustainability topic with peter.koop1 this year.

[![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/Sustainability-Guides-Blogpost3-scaled.jpg)](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities)

In this blog article, I would like highlight how we underline our full commitment for sustainability and to equip you for the Energy Transition.

We will have more presentations on and touchpoints with sustainability solutions to build the sustainable enterprise than ever. To be honest, it makes me proud that we could have renamed every track to something with sustainability as we are aware that without our industries doing the Energy Transition successfully no other industry will become sustainable.

On April the 18th, [the pre-conference day](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities/pre-conference-day) – we have Expert-Clinics as a new presentation offering for you. It is our goal to connect you with our experts and we are happy to have the following sessions:

* Implement Holistic Steering and Reporting with SAP Sustainability Control Tower to Transform Your Business with Christian Polivka and myself

* Business Models in E-Mobility with Jörg Ferchow and Jean-Marc Delbos

* Sustainable Procurement with Thomas Dahm and Peter Schlemmer

Of course we are looking forward to  meet you in our core sustainability track on the [first conference day](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities/conference-agenda) where we have a strong agenda around green hydrogen.

We are happy to welcome

* Jonas Moberg, CEO of the Green Hydrogen Organization (GH2)

* Carsten Borchers, MD/ Vice President Global Green Gas Projects, E.ON Hydrogen GmbH

* Stephane Bungener, Senior Manager Energy & Environment, Yara

on stage to share insights of the strategies and concrete actions of their organizations towards the production, transport, distribution and sales/usage of green hydrogen and ammonia.

In our Panel Talk **Green Hydrogen Value Chain in Action** moderated by my co-pilot Peter we will discuss the points that are relevant for the whole supply chain e.g. digitalization, certification and calculation of the CO2 footprint just to mention a few topics. We will also directly answer your questions.

This session will be enriched afterwards by jamesveale sharing an overview of SAP Green Token, the solution that ensures that green hydrogen/ammonia is really green and not green washed.

The round tables around E-Mobility with Jörg Ferchow or the Energy Communities hosted by Anselma Wörner, Co-Founder & COO, from Exnaton or the session about Distributed Energy Resources are worth to be added to your personal agenda, too.

On the [second conference day](https://tacinsights.eventsair.com/international-sap-conference-for-utilities/conference-agenda) my personal highlight will be the sustainability related panel talk after the keynote “Shifting to Zero” with Emily Penn. She and Jonas Dennler, Chief Marketing & Solutions Officer for Sustainability, plus two customers will join me on stage to discuss how we can “Empower Energy Transition for a Sustainable Future”. Remember my intro? Our industries are the roots for sustainable industries globally.

As we start the second day with a keynote from Emily and her passion about water for sure I have to make you aware of our dedicated water track with sessions about the Smart Water Platform as well as the round table with klauslohnert on how you can leverage your existing investments to Power your “Sustainable Energy Transition” ambitions.

To close this blog post it should be mentioned that you can meet us all days at the sustainability corner of the SAP booth.

We have prepared a little surprise how you can personally act ![:deciduous_tree:](/html/@7DD093903AC7C99A1495EA45D75D83DA/emoticons/1f333.png ":deciduous_tree:") and we offer to experience our solutions such as the SAP Sustainability Control Tower in an exclusively booked 1:1 session. Do you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us.

Are we going to meet you in Basel?
