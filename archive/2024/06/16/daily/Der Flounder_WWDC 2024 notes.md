## WWDC 2024 notes

This week, as in previous years since 2020, I attended Apple’s [WWDC 2024 conference](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/) from the comforts of home. As part of this, I took notes during the labs and session videos. Due to wanting to stay on the right side of Apple’s NDA, I’ve posted my notes to Apple’s developer forums rather than to here.

To make it easier for Mac admins to access them, I’ve set up a post in the forums where I’ve linking the various forum posts with my notes. It’s available via the link below:

<https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/758357>

**Update 6-17-2024**: The content posted to the Apple developer forums is no longer available. I have received no communication from Apple as to why it is no longer available, but my assumption is that posting the content was objectionable and subsequently removed.

As the Apple developer forums were the only location that I felt were safe to post this content, and because I have no desire to speak with Apple Legal about this issue, I will not be sharing the notes I took at WWDC to any other locations. Instead, I would encourage interested parties to watch the session videos for the two sessions I took notes in:

* **What’s new in Privacy**: <https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10123>
* **Whats new in device management**: <https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10143>

**Update 6-28-2024**: The notes are back! The link above has been updated to point to a new post in the forums where I’ve linked the various forum posts with my notes.

I learned about the posts being restored via a message from Apple that the notes were restored, along with an apology for their previous removal. Apparently they were flagged as being spam, which is what prompted them to be removed.

Thanks to Apple for restoring them, and also for reaching out to let me know!

     Looks like my note taking posts from this year are no longer available. Don’t know why.

   Any chance you could share the notes in the Appleseed channel on Slack?
