# Weekly Update 454

02 June 2025

We're two weeks in from the launch of the new HIBP, and I'm still recovering. Like *literally* still recovering from the cold I had last week and the consequent backlog. A major launch like this isn't just something you fire and forget; instead, it takes weeks of tweaks and refinements to iron out all the little creases, both known and unpredictable. None of them have been significant, fortunately, but the more I look at it, the more I see, and the more we refine. This week, we're diving headfirst into something I'd rather avoid: wacky procurement demands. Stuff like quote generation so that you can have the same stuff as you can find on the pricing page right now, just as a PDF with your name on it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è And look, I get it - it's not the people reading this making those demands and I have tread in your shoes and felt your pain. Hopefully, sometime this week, we'll automate away both your and my pain, and that'll be a massive step forward for all of us. Stay tuned!
