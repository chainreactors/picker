The Supreme Court today correctly [found](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf) that social media platforms, like newspapers, bookstores, and art galleries before them, have First Amendment rights to curate and edit the speech of others they deliver to their users, and the government has a very limited role in dictating what social media platforms must and must not publish. Although users remain understandably frustrated with how the large platforms moderate user speech, the best deal for users is when platforms make these decisions instead of the government.

As we explained in our [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-brief-moodyvnetchoice), users are far better off when publishers make editorial decisions free from government mandates. Although the court did not reach a final determination about the Texas and Florida laws, it confirmed that their core provisions are inconsistent with the First Amendment when they force social media sites to publish user posts that are, at best, irrelevant, and, at worst, false, abusive, or harassing. The government’s favored speakers would be granted special access to the platforms, and the government’s disfavored speakers silenced.

We filed our first [brief](https://www.eff.org/document/prager-university-v-google-eff-amicus-brief) advocating this position in 2018 and are pleased to see that the Supreme Court has finally agreed.
