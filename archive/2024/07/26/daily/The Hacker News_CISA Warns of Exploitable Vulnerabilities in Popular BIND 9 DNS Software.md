[![BIND 9 DNS Software](data:image/png;base64... "BIND 9 DNS Software")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHh4a9W1ZlAO43aiIWPL1I3pzixjZYWCiVm8cmzwqiyAZb7fP6jXmC1SU44AOCcGPFmrE8ttA3wmPiRHz3_dIGOjIsBCNmYgbnGWYErjApm8KMUihR0xeC3rkedjOYvZ9ITwR8EbnslrjT_9xOx8UDRF3EdbWiqhI1OEm4YbDi_jrf7j7R922pD0rUxtpH/s790-rw-e365/dns.png)

The Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) has released patches to address multiple security vulnerabilities in the Berkeley Internet Name Domain ([BIND](https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9.18.28/chapter1.html#dns-and-bind-9)) 9 Domain Name System (DNS) software suite that could be exploited to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

"A cyber threat actor could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to cause a denial-of-service condition," the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [said](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/07/24/isc-releases-security-advisories-bind-9) in an advisory.

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

The list of four vulnerabilities is listed below -

* [CVE-2024-4076](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-4076) (CVSS score: 7.5) - Due to a logic error, lookups that triggered serving stale data and required lookups in local authoritative zone data could have resulted in an assertion failure

* [CVE-2024-1975](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-1975) (CVSS score: 7.5) - Validating DNS messages signed using the SIG(0) protocol could cause excessive CPU load, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

* [CVE-2024-1737](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-1737) (CVSS score: 7.5) - It is possible to craft excessively large numbers of resource record types for a given owner name, which has the effect of slowing down database processing

* [CVE-2024-0760](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2024-0760) (CVSS score: 7.5) - A malicious DNS client that sent many queries over TCP but never read the responses could cause a server to respond slowly or not at all for other clients

Successful exploitation of the aforementioned bugs could cause a named instance to terminate unexpectedly, deplete available CPU resources, slow down query processing by a factor of 100, and render the server unresponsive.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

The flaws have been addressed in BIND 9 versions 9.18.28, 9.20.0, and 9.18.28-S1 released earlier this month. There is no evidence that any of the shortcomings have been exploited in the wild.

The disclosure comes months after the ISC [addressed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/microsoft-rolls-out-patches-for-73.html) another flaw in BIND 9 called KeyTrap (CVE-2023-50387, CVSS score: 7.5) that could be abused to exhaust CPU resources and stall DNS resolvers, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
