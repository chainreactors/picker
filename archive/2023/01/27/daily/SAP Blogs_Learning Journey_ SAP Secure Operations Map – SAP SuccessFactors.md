Dear members,

We are excited to announce the release of our new application specific learning journey [SAP Secure Operations Map - SAP SuccessFactors](https://jam2.sapjam.com/groups/nNZzUw58bEnzWfS4oZRn1X/overview_page/t58TOfMlAQ8wbGrpXzSH9r)  in our SAP Enterprise Support Value Maps Learning Room.

This new learning journey is designed to guide you through a set of expertly chosen SAP Enterprise Support offerings, assets, and tools categorized into the Secure Operation Map layers to empower you to achieve security knowledge around SAP SuccessFactors in a sequential, interactive format. The Secure Operations Map 'SOM' is a structure to informally identify areas and topics which are most important to address. Using this reference model specifically with SAP products brings a third dimension giving a specific view or projection onto several blocks.

You can access this new learning journey via both the [SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite](https://jam2.sapjam.com/groups/bV0MUAjcUmkwpkNqLTVrE6/overview_page/CmChP8nrwK0qYcyHBXEloi) and the [SAP Security Value Map](https://jam2.sapjam.com/groups/nNZzUw58bEnzWfS4oZRn1X/overview_page/TAQPiShm54ZTii7snj3n0R).

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/01/Security-VM-1.jpg)

In our SAP Enterprise Support Value Maps, you will notice the areas of the map that we are concentrating on will have color, the others will be grayed out.  As an example, ‘Awareness’ is usually included as part of an organization’s overall security and not specific to an application.  We will not touch upon this topic as part of the SAP SuccessFactors dimension.

Do plan to revisit security on a regular basis as new functionality and technologies require additional security measures. This map and content will grow and change with the application and when new content is needed and created.

If you are not a member by now, don’t miss out to sign up for [SAP Enterprise Support Value Maps](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support/enterprise-support-academy/value-maps.html) by requesting access to [SAP Learning Hub](https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/enterprise-support/enterprise-support-academy/learn.html) or join directly our [SAP Enterprise Support Value Maps Learning Room](https://enrollment-ac82d52a4.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com/index.html?itemID=LR_ValueMaps_EN) if you already have access.
