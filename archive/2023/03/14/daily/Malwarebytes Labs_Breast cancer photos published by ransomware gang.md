# Breast cancer photos published by ransomware gang

Posted: March 13, 2023
 by [Jovi Umawing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jumawing)

The Russia-linked ALPHV ransomware group, also known as [BlackCat](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/06/alphv-aims-to-shock-victim-with-dedicated-leak-site-for-its-employees-and-customers), has posted sensitive clinical photos of breast cancer patients—calling them “nude photos”—to extort money from the Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN).

This has triggered a chorus of accusations from the cybersecurity community, with some labeling the group as “[barbarians](https://twitter.com/Maxwsmeets/status/1632654116320075776)” and others saying the group is “[exploiting and sexualizing breast cancer](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1632465659417206786)“.

The leak page for data stolen from the Lehigh Valley Health Network. Apart from the clinical photos, ALPHV also leaked sensitive, [personally identifiable information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) on passports and questionnaires.

“This unconscionable criminal act takes advantage of patients receiving cancer treatment, and LVHN condemns this despicable behavior,” LVHN spokesman Brian Downs said, *Lehigh Valley News* [reported](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/health-news/2023-03-07/hackers-posted-photos-of-lvhn-cancer-patients-receiving-treatment-hospital-says).

LVHN [had previously said](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/lehigh-valley-health-network-targeted-by-blackcat-ransomware) it fell victim to a BlackCat [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) on February 20. The Network initially detected an intrusion within its IT systems on February 6 and said that initial analysis showed the attack was on a network supporting one physician practice located in Lackawanna County.

The ransom amount has [never](https://news.yahoo.com/lehigh-valley-health-network-hit-200300251.html) been made public, but we know that the Network decided not to pay ALPHV anyway. Lehigh’s website has remained offline since the attack.

## How to avoid ransomware

* **Block common forms of entry**. Create a plan for [patching vulnerabilities](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/vulnerability-patch-management) in internet-facing systems quickly; disable or [harden remote access](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/03/blunting-rdp-brute-force-attacks-with-rate-limiting) like RDP [and VPNs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-is-a-proxy); use [endpoint security software](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/edr) that can detect [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) and [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) used to deliver ransomware.
* **Detect intrusions**. Make it harder for intruders to operate inside your organization by segmenting networks and assigning access rights prudently. Use [EDR](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/edr) or [MDR](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/managed-detection-and-response) to detect unusual activity before an attack occurs.
* **Stop malicious encryption**. Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response software like [Malwarebytes EDR](https://www.malwarebytes.com/business/edr) that uses multiple different detection techniques to ident...
