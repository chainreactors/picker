In this blog I wish to share my knowledge of RISE with SAP based on the details that are open to public. This blog is intended for those who have a basic understanding of RISE with SAP and want to understand more details based on the general information available to all. This blog can also be used as a base to understand a BOM that has been created for a customer.

```
NOTE: This blog does not cover in-depth details on RISE as it is only available for RISE

with SAP partners via the Learning hub portal.This blog is more targetted at the details

 that SAP has made available to public.

### =============================================================

### A. RISE with SAP SDG (Service Description Guide):

This is one of the basic important documents that SAP has released for general public usage.

```
Link: https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/agreements/cloud/cloud-services.html?sort=latest_desc&tag=agr...

Choose => "RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud , private edition Service Description Guide("SDG")from the list
```

#### Key takeaways from this document:

1. SLA:

As per the point 2.5, RISE with SAP can provide an application SLA ( inclusive of infrastructure, Network, application etc) of 99.9% if the customer subscribes to this SLA specifically. Else SAP provides an application SLA of 99.7% for production and 99.5% for non-production.

2. Disaster Recovery and GxP Eligibility

As per point 2.6 disaster recovery service is not part of a standard subscription and customers who need one must explicitly add this SKU to their BOM

3.FUE ( Refer to SECTION 5 in the document: RISE WITH SAP S/4HANA CLOUD, PRIVATE EDITION, TAILORED OPTION (FORMERLY, “SAP S/4HANA FOR ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT, PRIVATE EDITION, TAILORED OPTION”)

FUE is Full User Equivalent.This is the way for calculating user licenses that are required for any customer and is based on existing on-premise licenses that the customer currently holds.

1 FUE = 0.50 SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Developer Access
1 FUE = 1 SAP S/4HANA Cloud for advanced edition use
1 FUE = 5 SAP S/4HANA Cloud for core use
1 FUE = 30 SAP S/4HANA Cloud for self-service use

Eg: If the customer holds 5 developer on-premise licenses, it gets converted into a requirement of 10 FUE. If the customer holds 10 core users , it gets translated into 2 FUE .

The video from SAP throws a detailed explanation of the same.

4. T-SHIRT SIZE Mapping (Section 5.6)

Based on the total FUE that are required per customer, it gets translated into the below T-Shirt sizes
