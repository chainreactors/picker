"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."

-Sir Arthur Conan Doyle*, Sherlock Holmes,* 1891

## 1.1      Introduction

Throughout my career, I've observed complications that arise when teams work to launch new divisions as well as when working to refine, build up, and cultivate a great cyber defense team.

This post aims to share some of my experiences with you, so that teams can be better equipped to navigate hurdles that might be slowing growth as an individual, team, or even an organization. While perfection is an elusive standard, I believe teams can effectively navigate roadblocks that keep them from reaching the next level.

## 1.2      Identifying and Resolving Obstacles

The obstacles keeping organizations from elevating their cyber defense team to the next level and beyond are usually a combination of multiple problems rather than a single issue. These barriers include bureaucratic delays, inexperience, groupthink, employee burnout, understaffing, and other logistical constraints.

Often, for those in a leadership position, the measurement of team growth as well as the investigative skill development of individual contributors can be difficult to evaluate. For the organization as a whole, a mindset of mutual trust is key. Also, an exceptional SOC is going to be set apart from a standard SOC in a few ways:

* Success is based on being right, not fast.
* Events, incidents, and scheduled offensive testing are viewed as learning opportunities.
* Training is provided for analysts and engineers to boost their skills.
* All groups within the defense team are in constant contact.
  + Building on this, communication between the security team and other departments should be encouraged in order to facilitate better interdepartmental communication.
* Leaders take feedback from their team in order to drive future direction.

## 1.3      Being Right, Not Fast

It's common to find SOCs being measured by the volume of alerts created or by the number of tickets closed. Usually there isn't much incentive to correctly define the scenario in the alert, as long as a quick triage of whether something is malicious is determined and the ticket closed. This can lead to bad habits and can cause the investigators to prioritize closing the investigation at the expense of making the correct determination.

Figure 1 - Metrics - Choose Wisely

The ideal situation is to have, or be, a defender who can begin an investigation, analyze data, correlate with extraneous data, and make a correct determination as fast as possible. Timeliness is important in order to ensure malicious activity does not go unchecked, however, a proper and detailed investigation should still be t...
