The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has revealed that it has observed the notorious cybercrime group [Scattered Spider](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/scattered-spider-behind-cyberattacks-on.html) broadening its targeting footprint to strike the airline sector.

To that end, the agency said it's actively working with aviation and industry partners to combat the activity and help victims.

"These actors rely on social engineering techniques, often impersonating employees or contractors to deceive IT help desks into granting access," the FBI [said](https://x.com/FBI/status/1938746767031574565) in a post on X. "These techniques frequently involve methods to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as convincing help desk services to add unauthorized MFA devices to compromised accounts."

Scattered Spider attacks are also known to target third-party IT providers to obtain access to large organizations, putting trusted vendors and contractors at risk of potential attacks. The attacks typically pave the way for data theft, extortion, and ransomware.

In a statement shared on LinkedIn, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42's Sam Rubin [confirmed](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7344401358281719808/) the threat actor's attacks against the aviation industry, urging organizations to be on "high alert" for advanced social engineering attempts and suspicious multi-factor authentication (MFA) reset requests

Google-owned Mandiant, which [recently alerted](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/google-warns-of-scattered-spider.html) of Scattered Spider's targeting of the U.S. insurance sector, also echoed the warning, stating it's aware of multiple incidents in the airline and transportation verticals that resemble the modus operandi of the hacking crew.

"We recommend that the industry immediately take steps to tighten up their help desk identity verification processes prior to adding new phone numbers to employee/contractor accounts (which can be used by the threat actor to perform self-service password resets), reset passwords, add devices to MFA solutions, or provide employee information (e.g., employee IDs) that could be used for a subsequent social engineering attacks," Mandiant's Charles Carmakal [said](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7344421800702844931/).

One reason Scattered Spider continues to succeed is how well it understands human workflows. Even when technical defenses like MFA are in place, the group focuses on the people behind the systems—knowing that help desk staff, like anyone else, can be caught off guard by a convincing story.

This isn't about brute-force hacking; it's about building trust just long enough to sneak in. And when time is short or pressure is high, it's easy to see how a fake employee request could slip through. That's why organizations should look beyond traditional endpoint security and rethink how identity verification happens in real time.

The activity tracked as Scattered Spider overlaps with threat clusters such as Muddled Libra, Octo Tempest, Oktapus, Scatter Swine, Star Fraud, and UNC3944. The group, originally known for its SIM swapping attacks, counts social engineering, helpdesk phishing, and insider access among its roster of initial access techniques to penetrate hybrid environments.

"Scattered Spider represents a major evolution in ransomware risk, combining deep social engineering, layered technical sophistication, and rapid double‑extortion capabilities," Halcyon [said](https://www.halcyon.ai/blog/scattered-spider-tactics-observed-amid-shift-to-us-targets). "In a matter of hours, the group can breach, establish persistent access, harvest sensitive data, disable recovery mechanisms, and detonate ransomware across both on‑premises and cloud environments."

What makes this group especially dangerous is its mix of patient planning and sudden escalation. Scattered Spider doesn't just rely on stolen credentials—it spends time gathering intel on its targets, often combining social media research with public breach data to impersonate people with scary accuracy. This kind of hybrid threat, blending Social engineering techniques with cloud infrastructure sabotage, can fly under the radar until it's too late.

Scattered Spider is part of an amorphous collective called the Com (aka Comm), which also counts other groups like [LAPSUS$](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/british-lapsus-teen-members-sentenced.html). It's assessed to be [active at least since 2021](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/5-scattered-spider-gang-members.html).

"This group evolved in the Discord and Telegram communication platforms, drawing in members from diverse backgrounds and interests," Unit 42 [said](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/muddled-libra/). "The loose-knit and fluid nature of this group makes it inherently difficult to disrupt."

In a report published Friday, ReliaQuest detailed how Scattered Spider actors breached an unnamed organization late last month by targeting its chief financial officer (CFO), and abused their elevated access to conduct an extremely precise and calculated attack.

The threat actors have been found to carry out extensive reconnaissance to single out high-value individuals, especially impersonating the CFO in a call to the company's IT help desk and persuading them to reset the MFA device and credenti...
