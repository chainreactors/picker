# Piracy Shield Concerns Prompt EU Commission to Engage Italian Govt.

In a letter to Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, the European Commission acknowledges Italy's work against online piracy. However, concerns remain over aspects of the Piracy Shield system, potential non-compliance with the Digital Services Act, and the fundamental right to freedom of expression. The letter follows submissions by tech and telecoms advocacy group CCIA, voicing concerns over safeguards, transparency, and cross-border content removal.

As rightsholders in the live sports sector continue to face unprecedented levels of online piracy, Italy decided that an extraordinary challenge could only be tackled with an extraordinary response.

The ‘Piracy Shield’ blocking notification system has attracted significant criticism, although the legal and regulatory frameworks that support it, built on a theory that faster, heavier blocking will eventually solve the problem, are the real drivers behind the ongoing controversy.

Fundamental issues and legal amendments, including draft proposals published earlier this year, prompted the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) to [voice its concerns](https://torrentfreak.com/tech-industry-urges-eu-to-halt-italys-overreaching-anti-piracy-measures-250122/) at the EU Commission, highlighting [significant risks](https://torrentfreak.com/tech-giants-propose-critical-piracy-shield-regulation-amendments-250409/) to the principles of freedom of enterprise and expression.

## European Commission Responds to Concerns

After several months of engagement, last month [the CCIA urged](https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-shield-tech-giants-urge-commission-to-assess-legality-under-eu-law-250524/) the European Commission to carry out an immediate review to establish compatibility of the existing system and Italy’s draft proposals with EU law requirements.

Site-blocking within 30 minutes, limited transparency, lack of recourse for those wrongfully blocked, and new proposals potentially at odds with the Digital Services Act, could have serious consequences for the wider EU, CCIA warned.

In a letter dated June 13, 2025, Roberto Viola – the European Commission’s Director General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology – addresses Italy’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Tajani, who is also the country’s Deputy Prime Minister.

“The Commission welcomes the efforts made by the Italian authorities in the fight against online piracy, which remains a serious concern for the creative and sports sectors across the EU,” Viola begins.

The Italian draft ‘reflects the objectives’ of the [recommendations](https://torrentfreak.com/the-battle-plan-for-combating-iptv-piracy-in-europe-has-arrived-230504/) published by the Commission in 2023, which the letter suggests is another plus.

## Digital Services Act

Turning to more problematic areas, *Articles 8, 8-bis, 9-bis and 10* in the Italian draft are intended to meet the requirements of Article 9 of the Digital Services Act. The Commission says they fail to do so, including by falling short of “the linguistic requirements” set out in Article 9(2)(c).

However, as highlighted in the CCIA’s recent submission, the Commission also notes the following;

**“[T]he DSA does not provide a legal basis for the issuing of orders by national administrative or judicial authorities, nor does it regulate the enforcement of such orders.”**

The Commission adds that it “would like to remind the Italian authorities of the procedures and conditions set out in Article 9″ and invites them to “clarify these aspects in the final text of the notified draft.”

## Charter of Fundamental Rights

Since site-blocking measures amount to a denial of service, restrictions should be sufficient to end or limit infringement, while taking care not to encroach on the fundamental rights of third parties. The importance of maintaining the right balance is stressed by the EC.

“The Commission would also like to emphasize that the effective tackling of illegal content must also take into due account the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU,” the letter continues, with the following excerpt from the DSA offered as guidance;

> *[I]n that regard, the national judicial or administrative authority, which might be a law enforcement authority, issuing the order should balance the objective that the order seeks to achieve, in accordance with the legal basis enabling its issuance, with the rights and legitimate interests of all third parties that may be affected by the order, in particular their fundamental rights under the Charter.*

## Blocking in 30 Mins, Blocking Blunders Assessed in 10 Days

Balancing the rights of various parties isn’t always straightforward. However, some aspects of Piracy Shield give the impression that the rights of third parties are given less than equal weight.

With 30 minute takedowns championed as essential in the fight against live sports piracy, victims of over-blocking blunders face a wait of up to 10 days before telecoms regulator AGCOM assesses the validity of their complaint.

“The Commission notes that there do not seem to be other measures available to the addressee of [a blocking order] to help prevent eventual erroneous or excessive blocking of content,” the letter notes.

“Furthermore, [..] the technical specifications of the Piracy Shield envisage unblocking procedures limited to 24 hours from reporting in the event of an error. This limitation to 24 hours does not seem, in principle, to respond to any justified need and could lead to persisting erroneous blockings not being resolved.

“In this respect, the Commission would like to invites the Italian authorities to ensure that the Piracy Shield operates with sufficient controls and safeguards to avoid overblocking and negative impact on information which is not illegal content.”

## Commit to Safeguards – In Writing

Another ‘feature’ of Piracy Shield’s operations is the clarity and latitude afforded to those granted the authority to carry out blocking, versus safeguarding procedures that may receive an occasional mention but lack legal substance due to their absence from legislation.

The Commission welcomes details on safeguarding provided by Italian authorities and appears to see benefits in the measures being committed to more formally.

“The Commission therefore invite the Italian authorities to consider whether such elements could also be included in the final text. This is for example the case of the Addendum annexed to the Operating Manual of the Piracy Shield platform according to which, authorized persons are required t...
