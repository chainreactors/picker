## US as a Surveillance State

Two essays were [just](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/04/american-panopticon/682616/) [published](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/opinion/musk-doge-data-ai.html) on DOGE’s data collection and aggregation, and how it ends with a modern surveillance state.

It’s good to see this finally being talked about.

EDITED TO ADD (5/3): Here’s a [free link](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/american-panopticon/ar-AA1DHVYA) to that first essay.

Wired says Palantir are providing some of the engine for this,

@ vaadu,

You say,

> “DOGE’s mission is to root out fraud, waste and abuse. It can’t do that without looking at data.”

Well the “find fraud waste and abuse” is what we outside the US looking in call,

“A lame cover story at best.”

You further say it,

> “can’t do that without looking at data”

Which again we outsiders looking in call,

“A great big pile of horse apples.”

Because “the data” they have gone after provably has nothing to do with “root[ing] out fraud, waste and abuse.”

The data they are going after and trying to keep hidden –unsuccessfully– from public knowledge is for,

“Political purposes and as favours to certain favoured few”

Such as big corporations that “render unto caesar” what Caeser covets”. Who by their illegal and unlawful acts have found themselves subject to court cases of such significance that those behind them could face significant legal sanction.

It’s also easy to see that the “Department of Government (in)Efficiency”(DOGiE) and it’s untrustworthy, untrained, irresponsible, and reckless “Muttlings”, are not there to cut waste and inefficient and national debt. No they are targeted/vectored on to those their leader Hell-On Rusk and his “master” have petty cognitive and business grievances with. Again what many outsiders would call,

“Throwing the toys out of the pram”

Or the only fractionally more mature and less excusable,

“Behaviour befitting Violet Elizabeth Bott.”

DOGiE, Hellon Rusk and his Muttlings are not going to “save America” they are only there for their own corrupt purposes and gains.

This can be seen most simply by the fact they insist on “no oversight” and administrative access privileges well above and beyond any legal requirement, that results in “special accounts” unexplainably trying to unlawfully image data through Russia etc…

The fact that some of the Muttlings have such questionable pasts they would not get even basic security clearance is a very big flag that is being ignored.

And in a way it makes a complete nonsense of the anti-DEI mantra, untill you realise that to Trump,

“We the People”

Has a very specific and very narrow and horrendously discriminatory meaning[1] to Trump the Puppet and those behind pulling strings.

The very worrying thing is that the Puppet Face of Trump is actually too stupid to have thought up most of this nonsense. It’s actually been carefully planned by others over the past four or more years by those “just your humble servant” types. Most of what Trump the Puppet allegedly signs in terms of Executive Orders he has never read let alone had any input into.

Funny thing to think about, look up “Doge” in the dictionary[2] as a word it tells much about the likely future in the US.

Even as an outsider to the US this greatly concerns me. But is not unexpected, because there is a saying that,

“The candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.”

The US had resources aplenty yet chose to go through then ten to a hundred times as fast as anywhere else on the planet. The result is the US has become accustomed to a life style that can not be supported.

History with Spain and South American Gold shows us what happens, aside from the genetic imbicility of actual inbreeding, it encouraged a stupidity in the wider “self entitled” that led privileged lives untill they had spent the gold and wealth and had absolutely nothing to fall back on and nothing anybody wanted. We can see the same stupid pattern repeating in several South American states so it’s fairly clear that the US survival in the long term can only be by change of behaviour. However in the short term the “self entitled” will to keep the candle burning, form a predatory Empire that can only result in warfare fed by “cannon fodder” which are how the “self entitled” see those they do not consider a part of “We the People”…

But don’t take my word for it, study a little history, or just wait a short while for it to unfold.

[1] It would take too long to adequately describe the mentality behind the Trump, select GOP members, and similar self entitled thinking wrapped in faux-academic nonsense of the likes of the Heritage Foundation who “Pay Cash For Opinion” of a certain very unpleasant form. But you can read a fraction of it in,

<https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-dei-and-anti-discrimination-law>

[2] The “Doge” was the supposedly elected leader of certain independent states. In particular one that is in many ways the architectural prototype of what we now call a “Surveillance State”, the Renaissance City of Venice. It gave us all the basics of what Russia became as an Empire and their 20th Century leaders certainly willingly became and still practice today.

Are you people for real?

Musk aside, you can’t drive anywhere, walk anywhere, visit anywhere or do anything without some electronic, non-governmental digital record being created. And ALL of these are aggregated by data brokers.

Banks share your info with each other, unless you opt out. Even if you opt out, massive banking corporations can still share in-house. This includes credit card purchases, Amazon, etc. How many of you do social media? Search for stuff on Google? Turn on GPS/Bluetooth on your iPhones?

Guess what? None of that stuff is available to the government unless they have a valid reason. But the government gets around that by BUYING it from corporations. That is why you will n...
