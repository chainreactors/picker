# Harvard dropouts to launch ‘always on’ AI smart glasses that listen and record every conversation

Two former Harvard students are launching a pair of “always-on” AI-powered smart glasses that listen to, record, and transcribe every conversation and then display relevant information to the wearer in real time.

“Our goal is to make glasses that make you super intelligent the moment you put them on,” said AnhPhu Nguyen, co-founder of [Halo](http://www.halo.so), a startup that’s developing the technology.

Or, as his co-founder Caine Ardayfio put it, the glasses “give you infinite memory.”

“The AI listens to every conversation you have and uses that knowledge to tell you what to say … kinda like IRL Cluely,” Ardayfio told TechCrunch, referring to [the startup that claims to help users “cheat” on everything](http://techcrunch.com/2025/06/20/cluely-a-startup-that-helps-cheat-on-everything-raises-15m-from-a16z/) from job interviews to school exams.

“If somebody says a complex word or asks you a question, like, ‘What’s 37 to the third power?’ or something like that, then it’ll pop up on the glasses,” Ardayfio added.

Ardayfio and Nguyen have raised $1 million to develop the glasses, led by Pillar VC, with support from Soma Capital, Village Global, and Morningside Venture. The glasses will be priced at $249 and will be available for preorder starting Wednesday. Ardayfio called the glasses “the first real step towards vibe thinking.”

The two Ivy League dropouts, who have since moved into their own version of the [Hacker Hostel](https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Hacker_Hostel) in the San Francisco Bay Area, recently caused a stir after developing a facial-recognition app for Meta’s smart Ray-Ban glasses to prove that the [tech could be used to dox people](https://www.404media.co/someone-put-facial-recognition-tech-onto-metas-smart-glasses-to-instantly-dox-strangers/). As a potential early competitor to Meta’s smart glasses, Ardayfio said Meta, given its history of security and privacy scandals, had to rein in its product in ways that Halo can ultimately capitalize on.

“Meta doesn’t have a great reputation for caring about user privacy, and for them to release something that’s always there with you — which obviously brings a ton of utility — is just a huge reputational risk for them that they probably won’t take before a startup does it at scale first,” Nguyen added.

And while Nguyen has a point, users may not yet have a good reason to trust the technology of a couple of college-aged students purporting to send people out into the world with covert recording equipment.

While Meta’s glasses have an indicator light when their cameras and microphones are watching and listening as a mechanism to warn others that they are being recorded, Ardayfio said that the Halo glasses, dubbed Halo X, do not have an external indicator to warn people of their customers’ recording.

“For the hardware we’re making, we want it to be discreet, like normal glasses,” said Ardayfio, who added that the glasses record every word, transcribe it, and then delete the audio file.

Privacy advocates are warning about the normalization of covert recording devices in public.

“Small and discreet recording devices are not new,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.

“In some ways, this sounds like a variation on the microphone spy pen,” said Galperin. “But I think that normalizing the use of an always-on recording device, which in many circumstances would require the user to get the consent of everyone within recording distance, eats away at the expectation of privacy we have for our conversations in all kinds of spaces.”

There are [several states in the U.S.](https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf) that make it illegal to covertly record conversations without the other persons’ consent. Ardayfio said they are aware of this but that it is up to their customer to obtain consent before using the glasses.

“We trust our users to get consent if they are in a two-party consent state,” said Ardayfio, referring to the laws of a dozen U.S. states that require the consent of all recorded parties.

“I would also be very concerned about where the recorded data is being kept, how it is being stored, and who has access to it,” Galperin adde...
