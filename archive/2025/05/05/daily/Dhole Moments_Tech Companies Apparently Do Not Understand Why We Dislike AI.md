It’s becoming increasingly apparent that one of the reasons why tech companies are so enthusiastic about shoving AI into every product and service is that they fundamentally do not understand why people dislike AI.

**I will elaborate.**

I was recently made aware of [the Jetbrains developer ecosystem survey](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/developer-ecosystem-survey-2025-sh?pcode=628823912759035112), which included a lot of questions about AI. After I answered some of them negatively (and possibly *because* I answered some of them negatively), I was presented with a question about what my concerns with AI are.

What I found most interesting is that the multiple choice options included a lot of “I found the Terminator movies scary”, “I read too much Ray Kurzweil”, and/or “I am or was a SF Bay Area rationalist” undertones, but actual ethical objections were strangely absent.

It’s not just companies that have lost the plot. Content creators are pushing the same narrative that AI will imminently surpass human intelligence.

Included as an example, not an endorsement.

With this in mind, I want to lay out in as plain of language as I can muster *why I personally dislike AI*:

## My Aversion To AI

Before I get into why I’m adverse towards AI technology, let me explain why these incorrect answers aren’t applicable:

* I am not worried about “The Singularity”.
  + I do not actually believe “The Singularity” is a realistic threat due to every system that exhibits exponential growth encountering carrying capacities, which converts it into an S-curve.
* I am not worried about a violent machine uprising that enslaves or eradicates humanity, even if it does make an interesting premise for science fiction.
* The threat of hypothetical artificial superintelligence enacting retribution on me for not bringing about its creation is just a reskin of Pascal’s Wager, and I am not religious.
* I’m not afraid of an AI rendering my employment obsolete.
  + What I do is somewhat niche, so even if the AI hype crowd is correct, I strongly suspect society will already be totally fucked due to worker displacement and social unrest *long* before they get to my specialty.
* Thought experiments about “how do you know we’re not living in a simulation?” are interesting philosophy that has no practical consequences, and therefore do not occupy a lot of my mental resources.
* As someone who grew up in poverty and only accessed media through online piracy, I don’t particularly care about the impact on intellectual property laws in the abstract way that corporations understand them.
  + Separately, though, I *do* worry about the negative impacts on creative industries.

What concerns me about AI has very little to do with the technology in and of itself.

I’m concerned about the kind of antisocial behaviors that AI will enable.

* Coordinated inauthentic behavior
* Misinformation
* Nonconsensual pornography
* Displacing entire industries without a viable replacement for their income

In aggregate, people’s behavior are largely the result of the incentive structures they live within.

But there is a feedback loop: If you change the incentive structures, people’s behaviors will certainly change, but subsequently so, too, will those incentive structures.

If you do not understand people, you will fail to understand the harms that AI will unleash on the world.

Distressingly, the people most *passionate* about AI often express a not-so-subtle disdain for humanity.

If that sounds strange, you’ve probably seen this behavior before, but didn’t understand it for what it is.

I’m talking about the kind of X users that dislike experts so much that they will ask Grok to fact check every statement a person makes. I’m also talking about the kind of “generative AI” fanboys that treat artists like garbage while claiming that AI has finally “democratized” the creative process.

On the other paw, this one is a must-watch.

### On Privacy Concerns

Consider the use case of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. In the United States, law enforcement cannot perform dragnet surveillance of your encrypted messages without your knowledge or consent. Typically this requires a warrant or court order to obtain. You have constitutional rights under the 4th and 5th Amendments to not surrender your decryption keys. This is technology working as intended.

But then the app developer decides to shoehorn an unwanted AI feature into the mix. Suddenly, your conversations are being siphoned off to a cloud server to be analyzed by a large language model–presumably to perform some “useful” functionality (such as updating your calendar automatically).

The operator of the LLM that’s processing your data in the cloud doesn’t have the same 4th or 5th amendment protection for your privacy anymore. The AI model *doesn’t actually serve you* if its operators can be subpoenaed to snitch on you.

Hallucinations make this even more concerning. A person who shares edgy humor with their friends might get incorrectly judged as a potential terrorist by a sufficiently dubious LLM.

**This is not a problem that you can solve with technology alone.**

I don’t care how your TEE is configured if your company can be compelled to update it in a way that helps the government spy on users.

I don’t care if your language model is “local-only” and runs on the user’s device. If it can build a profile of the user (regardless of accuracy) through their smartphone usage, that can and will be used against people.

If you want to get all sci-fi about it, you don’t need artificial superintelligences.

Just combine a local language model that builds a psychological profile on its victim with self-propagating *ransomware* and you’ve got a nightmarish scenario that no amount of “identity protection” or corporate anti-phishing training will ever mitigate.

## An Appeal To All Companies Doing AI

Please make it turned off by default, and only turn on if the end user deliberately **opts in** to using it.

If you do that, I will not complain about your AI feature’s existence.

Because here’s the truth: The first thing I do whenever a technology I use ships a new AI feature is try to figure out how to disable it. If I cannot disable the feature, I uninstall it. If I cannot uninstall it, I will end up taking a pneumatic dril...
