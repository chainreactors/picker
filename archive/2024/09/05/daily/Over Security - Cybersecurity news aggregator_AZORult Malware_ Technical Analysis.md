AZORult Malware: Technical Analysis

*Editor’s note: The current article is authored by Mostafa ElSheimy, a malware reverse engineer and threat intelligence analyst. You can find Mostafa on [X](https://x.com/M4lcode) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m4lcode).*

In this malware analysis report, we conduct an in-depth examination of AZORult, a sophisticated credential and payment card information stealer.

Our walk-through covers the malware’s evolution, including its transition from Delphi to C++ and the introduction of .bit domain support. We will examine a sample of AZORult to uncover its behavior, evasion techniques, and operational tactics. This analysis aims to enhance understanding of AZORult’s functionality and inform effective countermeasures.

## Overview

AZORult is a sophisticated credential and payment card information [stealer](https://any.run/malware-trends/stealer) that can also act as a [downloader](https://any.run/malware-trends/loader) for various malware families. Notably, version 2 introduced support for .bit domains, enhancing its capabilities.

AZORult has been observed operating alongside Chthonic and has been deployed by Ramnit. Originally developed in Delphi, the malware was ported to C++ in 2019, which shows its evolution and increased complexity.

## Basic Analysis

Let’s begin our analysis of a sample. Here’s its key details:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sample Hash | 90a82defe606e51d2826265a43737130682b738241700782d7e41188475b7fb7 |
| Creation Time | 2013-12-25 05:01:38 UTC |

It’s important to note that the creation time has been edited by the author.

First we run the sample in the [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=azorult_analysis&utm_term=040924&utm_content=linktolanding) to observe its behavior in a real-time and fully interactive virtual environment.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image2-1024x568.jpg)

The sample initiates two critical processes:

* Executes a [PowerShell command](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/powershell-script-tracer/)

* Drops a file belonging to the Azorult malware family

The PowerShell command launches a [script](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malicious-scripts/) in a hidden window:

```
"powershell.exe" -windowstyle hidden "$Nummmeret=Get-Content 'C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\forgrovelse\konstituerendes\Printermanualens.Ear';$Trojanerens=$Nummmeret.SubString(42833,3);.$Trojanerens($Nummmeret) "
```

This command performs the following:

* Reads the contents of a file located at C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\forgrovelse\konstituerendes\Printermanualens.Ear and stores it in the variable $Nummmeret.

* Extracts a substring from $Nummmeret, starting at index 42833 with a length of 3 characters, and stores this substring in the variable $Trojanerens.

* Attempts to execute the content of $Trojanerens as a command or script, passing $Nummmeret as an argument to this command.

It also drops a file named Declinometer235.exe, the main AZORult payload.

The malware tries to contact thirteen IP addresses and one malicious domain.

An analysis of the sample using UnpacMe suggested that it was likely not [packed](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-packers-explained/).
