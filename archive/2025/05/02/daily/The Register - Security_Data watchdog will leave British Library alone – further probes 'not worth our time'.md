The UK's data protection overlord is not going to pursue any further investigation into the British Library's 2023 ransomware attack.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it doesn't think its resources would be best spent on UK's national library, even though it was such a disaster due to MFA not being applied on an admin account.

![library](https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/12/01/library.jpg?x=174&amp;y=115&amp;crop=1)

"Having carefully considered this particular case, the Information Commissioner decided that, due to our current priorities, further investigation would not be the most effective use of our resources," a statement read.

"We have provided guidance to the British Library, which has reassured us about its commitment to continue to review and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect people's data."
