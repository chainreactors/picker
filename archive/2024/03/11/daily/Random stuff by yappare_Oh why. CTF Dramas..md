Hmm..This will be my first time publishing non-tech related just to clear up the dramas from the local cybersecurity scene. I'll try to answer each of them in chronologies, mentioning friends' names (some will be redacted) and screenshots as proof.

## Why I attended RAWSEC RENTAS

* This is for sure a sign of support for their commitment to organise cybersecurity events in Malaysia. I've reposted the event's details, like (thumbs up) the posts that they shared in Linkedin and other social medias.

* Do I really want to go there? Not really. The reason is the place is too far from my home. I need to spend ~RM100+ to travel there. However, my friend Sr\*\*\*\*n said he would be there to listen to the talks. Also, there will be many friends from M53 and MCC alumni will participate in the CTF. Taking advantage of that, considering fasting month is coming soon, I decided let's go and have a gathering too. See below and check the dates.

Done. Next:

## "Ok je" comment.

* Correct. I agreed that I said "ok je" which I still stand on my opinion for that. Nothing is wrong with the CTF at RENTAS. But please dont twist too much in here. That's the only comment I gave and when RAWSEC's crew, Sh\*\*\*\*l wanted to gather more opinion I was ready. We were at the round table in the hall, and he brought his Macbook which I assumed he wanted to take note of my further opinions. But none of that happened. Why? Because my friend, Sr\*\*\*\*n, who also was a co-worker of Sh\*\*\*\*l came to the table and we started talking about other stuff while listening to the first talk about DevSecOops. Then came another friend which also a RAWSEC's crew, E\*\*a, and the conversation about other topics kept going until the first talk finished. Then it was a quick break. During this time, me, Sr\*\*\*\*n and three other friends decided to see the CTF which was held at a different building, 1km from the hall. Sr\*\*\*\*n decided to walk there, I followed.
* End. I hope the person who tweeted this, could ask Sh\*\*\*\*l for further clarification. Sr\*\*\*\*n was there too, feel free to ask him as well if needed.

## Why "Ok je"

* Ok je = acceptable. During the pre-qualification round, RAWSEC posted a poll on Linkedin and I voted as "Below expectation". At that time, yes I stand with that decision, it was "Below expectation" due to the comments and complaints I saw in chats about the questions by the participants (from M53 and MCC members). I received a message from someone stating that, RAWSEC members were quite upset with it.
