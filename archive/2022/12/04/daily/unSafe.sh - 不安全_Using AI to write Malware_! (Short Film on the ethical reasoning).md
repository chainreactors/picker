Author here, wanted to start the conversation on AI being used in our field.

AI can be used in software reverse engineering for several purposes. It can be used to automate the process of reverse engineering a software program to identify its structure and components. AI can also be used to detect malicious code or vulnerabilities in a software program. AI can also be used to identify and analyze patterns in the code in order to gain insight into how the program works and how to improve it.

Finally, AI can be used to automate the process of generating documentation for a software program, which can be used by developers to understand how the program works.
