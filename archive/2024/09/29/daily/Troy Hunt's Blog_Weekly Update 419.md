# Weekly Update 419

29 September 2024

It's not a green screen! It's just a weird a weird hotel room in Pittsburgh, but it did make for a cool backdrop for this week's video. We were there visiting our FBI friends after coming from Washington DC and a visit to CISA, the "America's Cyber Defence Agency". This week, I'm talking about those visits, some really cool new Cloudflare features, and our ongoing effort to push more and more of HIBP's data to Cloudflare's edges. Enjoy!
