## Project Delivery Framework Fundamentals

Before going into details about how each release and phase works, there is a set of fundamental principles and practices which should be understood for an SAP Customer Data Platform project.

The SAP Customer Data Platform can be implemented by applying different project methodologies. However, SAP Activate is a proven methodology that can help you to move fast.

The project approach for the SAP Customer Data Platform is not strict about agile or waterfall methodologies. Nevertheless, the recommendation is to use principles that are rooted in agile development methodologies such as building a minimum viable product (MVP), creating a backlog of use cases and activities from which you can prioritize, and realizing those use cases iteratively with quality baked in and clear acceptance criteria.

The project approach is based on multiple releases and phases within a release. This is sometimes referred to as a crawl-walk-run approach.

Identify the most valuable use cases to be delivered with the functional and technical scope.  Consider keeping the scope such that it is both small enough but delivers the right level of business value within the time constraints that you may have.  For example, consider only three use cases within a single region/business area leveraging 3-5 data sources and 2-3 destinations.

Always keep compliance with consent and legal regulations top of mind.

## Delivering SAP Customer Data Platform with SAP Activate

### Project Phases

The project delivery framework for SAP Customer Data Platform as described in this article is aligned with SAP Activate. The image below will provide you with a quick reference of SAP Activate phases for the first release of your SAP CDP implementation.

Note that the Discover and Run phases are no less important to the success of your project, but are represented differently since they are not the focus of this article.

#### **Discover**

* Explore and define the "where", "why", "how" and "what" of the project, including scope, architecture, planning and costs.

* Create an initial solution design.

* Software licenses are typically procured and the base solution provisioned

* Some level of handover from the team who were involved in purchasing the solution; possibly having defined the business case for the solution, and an adoption roadmap

#### **Prepare**

The main goal of the prepare phase is to, set the foundation for the project

* Project Planning and Governance

  + Formally recognize that a new project exists and initiate the work

  + Align concerned parties around the project; its goals, scope, and plan especially

  + Obtain a commitment to proceed

  + Secure the required resources

  + Develop all required project management and planning documentation

  + Prepare a consistent system for overseeing efficient and effective project execution

* Project Team Alignment and Enablement

  + Have the team build their knowledge and skills related to the SAP CDP.  There are a number of learning journeys, videos, formal trainings, and help pages available to facilitate this.

  + Give the team enough time to review the project definition and the project information prepared above.

* Project Kick-off and Onboarding

  + Ensure project team alignment on scope, timeline, resources, and assumptions

  + Ensure that the project team resources and concerned parties have all the information that they need to be engaged in the project

#### **Explore**

The main goal of the Explore phase is to have an updated and approved scope baseline to move into the Realize phase, and build the solution. The phase is structured with three workshops, but these may not be held on different days/events.  Conceptually, the use cases are to be defined, evaluated to determine which ones should be delivered within the project constraints, and then the technical details are fleshed out.  The results of the workshops should be documented so that the project team and concerned parties are clear on the way forward.

* Use Case Definition (workshop #1)

  + The goal is to discuss and formulate the key use cases for the CDP implementation

  + The output is the initial set of use cases

* Value Determination and use case prioritization (workshop #2)

  + The goal is to evaluate the use cases for measurability and business impact

  + Further, it is to determine the key use cases to include in the MVP and prioritize them

  + Finally, this workshop should document the goals and key performance indicators for the project and the post-go live metrics
