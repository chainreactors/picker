Office buildings have become like web browsers – they're full of tracking technology, a trend documented in a report out this week by Cracked Labs.

The [study](https://crackedlabs.org/en/data-work/publications/indoortracking), titled "Tracking Indoor Location, Movement and Desk Occupancy in the Workplace," looks at how motion sensing and wireless network technology in buildings is being used to monitor the movement and behavior of office workers and visitors.

"As offices, buildings and other corporate facilities become networked environments, there is a growing desire among employers to exploit data gathered from their existing digital infrastructure or additional sensors for various purposes," the report says. "Whether intentionally or as a byproduct, this includes personal data about employees, their movements and behaviors."
