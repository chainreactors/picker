“Products don’t sell themselves.”

That’s why even Edison conducted comprehensive marketing for the light bulb in 1880, transforming it from an innovative invention into a household necessity. In 1955, P&G introduced the first fluoride toothpaste, but consumers were skeptical of its cavity-fighting claims, viewing toothpaste as purely cosmetic. It took over five years of extensive marketing before P&G achieved widespread adoption.

It's natural for people to resist change, but it's curious how we often hesitate to embrace innovations that could benefit us. While innovative technology has the potential to enhance our lives, realizing this potential requires a shift in consumer mindsets. Marketing plays a crucial role in driving this adoption and turning technological possibilities into everyday realities.

## **What Marketing Transforms Web3 Into a Necessity?**

Since joining the crypto industry in 2018, I have had the privilege of contributing to the marketing of various crypto projects. This experience provided me with the opportunity to engage directly with a diverse range of individuals in the crypto space, offering valuable insights into their needs and behaviors. I learned what people expect, how they respond, what drives their happiness or frustration, and how these emotions translate into actions and outcomes. This led me to realize that Web3 requires a completely different marketing playbook compared to traditional or Web2 marketing.

For instance, all crypto projects I've worked on have placed a strong emphasis on branding, often asking me to spend a significant amount of time creating and managing their websites. However, how often do crypto users actually visit the homepage of a specific project? Crypto enthusiasts primarily congregate in community channels like Discord or X.

While traditional marketing centered around the homepage, in Web3, community channels have become the new hubs, with the opinions and activities of community members serving as key branding elements. Social media is where the project's operations actually take place. It's akin to the ancient Greek Agora, a hub of political, economic, and social activity.

A successful marketing playbook can only be developed after gaining a thorough understanding of customers. Therefore, the primary focus of my marketing efforts was to gain a deep understanding of our users through community channels. In this article, I will share three key insights that could form the backbone of an effective crypto marketing playbook.

## **1st Thing - Web3’s Unique Customer Structure: Layers, Not Segments**

In traditional marketing, customer segmentation involves dividing a company's customers into distinct groups. However, Web3 customers, as I've observed, do not fit into segmented groups. Fundamentally, all customers of a Web3 project are ‘token holders’. Those who actively use the protocol become ‘users’, and those who participate in DAO governance are considered ‘community members.

Therefore, the customer structure in Web3 is not about segmentation but about layered inclusion, where each layer encompasses the previous one.

| Customer Layer | Community Member | User | Retail Investor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Qualifications** | DAO participant dApp user Token holder | dApp user Token holder | Token holder |
| **Goals** | Project’s success dApp utility Token price increase | dApp utility Token price increase | Token price increase |

Most Web3 projects lump all customers together as community members, regardless of their layers, and focus solely on expanding their user base. In my view, this is the fundamental reason why Web3 user adoption has become directionless and stagnant. Since each layer has its own expectations and contributions, marketers should tailor their strategies to address them as outlined below:

The community members are undoubtedly the most foundational layer. In Web3, the community serves as both owners and contributors. Thus, the future of the project depends on the community's quality—how capable, motivated, and loyal they are. “Community is where its members get daily dopamine." This is the coolest, most succinct community management principle I've encountered in the Web3 space. The ideal Web3 marketing strategy revolves around continuously engaging the community with this mindset.

Successful branding is not about making the brand itself cool; it is about making its customers feel cool. In other words, consider whether your marketing programs are motivating and exciting the community, ultimately leading them to feel proud to be part of it. This is the direction in which Web3 branding should evolve—more than just a nice website or visual design.

### **(2) Users: Educate on Why and How to Use**

The user layer is crucial for scaling the project and cultivating future community members. In the current nascent stage of Web3, educating users on *why* they should use a product is more important than *how*. [In a previous article,](https://hackernoon.com/web3-marketing-is-not-about-the-network-effect?ref=hackernoon.com) I criticized the widespread use of airdrops to artificially inflate user bases. Consumers are often smarter than brands, and current airdrop marketing is merely attracting airdrop farmers.

Recent issues with fake accounts and bots during the [Megadrop IEO event](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/10028234579130?ref=hackernoon.com) and [ZKSync’s airdrop](https://news.bitcoin.com/user-games-zksync-airdrop-receives-over-1-1-million-in-350-wallets/?ref=hackernoon.com) highlight the risks of airdrop marketing. In fact, the problem is deeper. Users who stay after claiming rewards may create toxic communities focused on price speculation, making it harder to attract quality members.

Regarding*how to use* the product, many projects struggle with user onboarding, offering either overly complex or insufficient guides. This issue is compounded by the incomplete state of many systems, where timely risk alerts become crucial. [The recent Black Monday exemplified this problem](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/08/07/synthetix-founder-appears-to-have-sent-portion-of-company-funds-to-beleaguered-ex-treasurer-embercn/?ref=hackernoon.com), with users incurring losses due to unadjusted collateral ratios. Web3 marketers must therefore focus not just on promotion, but also on providing preemptive risk management.

### **(3) Retail Investors: Monitor Their Voices and Sentiments**

Typically, retail investors are not the primary target for Web3 marketers, just as traditional companies do not target stock investors. However, since token price affects community morale and reflects product and marketing performance, Web3 marketers must recognize that retail investors are a stakeholder group that requires continuous management.

This involves closely monitoring their feedback, ensuring the accuracy, timeliness, and quality of the information, and proactively managing the dissemination of this information across both internal and external crypto channels.

The biggest irony for a Web3 marketer is that tokens are integral to the functioning of the Web3 ecosystem, yet a marketer cannot directly market to...
