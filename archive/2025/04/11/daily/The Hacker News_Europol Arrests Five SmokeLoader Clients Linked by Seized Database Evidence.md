[![Europol Arrests Five SmokeLoader Clients](data:image/png;base64... "Europol Arrests Five SmokeLoader Clients")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-N-Ti-9Im1xPoi6wQJO0TswFcWeBdXCQXfwLIUycGYUcSESB9Ix5V_4MAETbIRB6jOqSO-NKA3twM68hpFpleEgROmOjd9IeGv_FJRVJiMsdSqYJBiPtc5EsGyszyBimf0EKWKDDfv91HtEQLeKVw86cpPIiXIuPyGYHHsEKUKk1lqu0MlvDbqO6pb6De/s790-rw-e365/malware-attacker.jpg)

Law enforcement authorities have announced that they tracked down the customers of the [SmokeLoader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/smokeloader-malware-resurfaces.html) malware and detained at least five individuals.

"In a [coordinated series of actions](https://www.operation-endgame.com), customers of the Smokeloader pay-per-install botnet, operated by the actor known as 'Superstar,' faced consequences such as arrests, house searches, arrest warrants or 'knock and talks,'" Europol [said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-endgame-follow-leads-to-five-detentions-and-interrogations-well-server-takedowns) in a statement.

Superstar is alleged to have run a pay-per-install service that enabled its customers to gain unauthorized access to victim machines, using the loader as a conduit to deploy next-stage payloads of their choice.

According to the European law enforcement agency, the access afforded by the botnet was used for various purposes such as keylogging, webcam access, ransomware deployment, and cryptocurrency mining.

The latest action, part of an ongoing coordinated exercise called [Operation Endgame](https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/authorities-ramp-up-efforts-to-capture.html), which led to the dismantling of online infrastructure associated with multiple malware loader operations like IcedID, SystemBC, PikaBot, SmokeLoader, Bumblebee, and TrickBot last year.

Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States participated in the follow-up effort that's meant to focus on the "demand side" of the cybercrime ecosystem.

Authorities, per Europol, tracked down the customers who were registered in a database that was previously seized, linking their online personas to real-life individuals and calling them for questioning. An unspecified number of suspects are believed to have opted to cooperate and have their personal devices examined to collect digital evidence.

"Several suspects resold the services purchased from SmokeLoader at a markup, thus adding an additional layer of interest to the investigation," Europol said. "Some of the suspects had assumed they were no longer on law enforcement's radar, only to come to the harsh realisation that they were still being targeted."

### Malware Loaders Come in Different Forms

The development comes as Broadcom-owned Symantec [revealed](https://www.broadcom.com/support/security-center/protection-bulletin/modiloader-deployed-via-scr-in-taiwanese-freight-impersonation) details of a phishing campaign that employs the Windows screensaver (SCR) file format to distribute a Delphi-based malware loader named [ModiLoader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/cybercriminals-target-polish-businesses.html) (aka DBatLoader and NatsoLoader) on victims' machines.

It also coincides with an evasive web campaign that tricks users into running malicious Windows installer (MSI) files to deploy another loader malware referred to as [Legion Loader](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/uac-0226-deploys-giftedcrook-stealer.html).

"This campaign uses a method called '[pastejacking](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2025-04-04-IOCs-forKongTuke-web-inject-leading-to-fake-CAPTHA-page.txt)' or 'clipboard hijacking' because viewers are instructed to paste content into a Run window," Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 [said](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2025-03-31-IOCs-for-evasive-campaign-pushing-Legion-Loader.txt), adding it leverages several cloaking strategies to evade detection through CAPTCHA pages and disguising malware download pages as blog sites.

Phishing campaigns have also been a delivery vehicle for Koi Loader, which is then used to download and execute an information stealer called [Koi Stealer](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/north-koreas-scarcruft-deploys-kospy.html) as part of a multi-stage infection sequence.

"The utilization of Anti-VM capabilities by malware like Koi Loader and Koi Stealer highlights the capability of modern threats to evade analysis and detection by analysts, researchers, and sandboxes," eSentire [said](https://www.esentire.com/blog/the-long-and-shortcut-of-it-koiloader-analysis) in a report published last month.

And that's not all. Recent months have once again [witnessed](https://gootloader.wordpress.com/2025/03/31/gootloader-returns-malware-hidden-in-google-ads-for-legal-documents/) the return of [GootLoader](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/new-gootloader-campaign-targets-users.html) (aka SLOWPOUR), which is being spread via sponsored search results on Google, a technique first spotted in early November 2024.

The attack targets users searching for "non disclosure agreement template" on Google to serve bogus ads that, when clicked, are redirected to a site ("lawliner[.]com") where they are asked to enter their email addresses to receive the document.
