# ðŸŒ€ Shortscan

An IIS short filename enumeration tool.

## Functionality

Shortscan is designed to quickly determine which files with short filenames exist on an IIS webserver. Once a short filename has been identified the tool will try to automatically identify the full filename.

In addition to standard discovery methods Shortscan also uses a unique checksum matching approach to attempt to find the long filename where the short filename is based on Windows' propriatary shortname collision avoidance checksum algorithm (more on this research at a later date).

## Installation

### Quick install

Using a recent version of [go](https://golang.org/):

```
go install github.com/bitquark/shortscan/cmd/shorts...
