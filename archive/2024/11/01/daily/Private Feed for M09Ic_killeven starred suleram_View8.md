# View8

`View8` is a static analysis tool designed to decompile serialized V8 bytecode objects (JSC files) into high-level readable code. To parse and disassemble these serialized objects, View8 utilizes a patched compiled V8 binary. As a result, View8 produces a textual output similar to JavaScript.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Disassembler binary. Available versions:

+ V8 Version `9.4.146.24` (Used in Node V16.x)
+ V8 Version `10.2.154.26` (Used in Node V18.x)
+ V8 Version `11.3.244.8` (Used in Node V20.x)

For compiled versions, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/suleram/View8/releases).

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

* `input_file`: The input file name.
* `output_file`: The output file name.
* `--path`, `-p`: Path to disassembler binary (optional).
* `--disassembled`, `-d`: Indicate if the input file is already disassembled (optional).
* `--export_format`, `-e`: Specify the export format(s). Options are `v8...
