EFF was deeply disturbed to learn that Alexey Soldatov, known as the “father of the Russian Internet,” was [sentenced in July](https://apnews.com/article/russia-crackdown-soldatov-1515f320ea6e332574f38d0320a69b5f) to two years in prison by a Moscow court for alleged “misuse” of IP addresses.

In 1990, Soldatov led the Relcom computer network that made the first Soviet connection to the global internet. He also served as Russia’s Deputy Minister of Communications from 2008 to 2010.

Soldatov was convicted on charges related to an alleged deal to transfer IP addresses to a foreign organization. He and his lawyers have denied the accusations. His family, many supporters, and [Netzpolitik suggest](https://netzpolitik.org/2024/alexei-soldatov-russischer-internet-pionier-zu-haftstrafe-verurteilt/) that the accusations are politically motivated. Soldatov’s former business partner, Yevgeny Antipov, was also sentenced to eighteen months in prison.

Soldatov was a trained nuclear scientist at Kurchatov nuclear research institute who, during the Soviet era, built the [Russian Institute for Public Networks](https://www.ripn.su/en/) (RIPN), which was responsible for administering and allocating IP addresses in Russia from the early 1990s onwards. The  network RIPN created was called Relcom (RELiable COMmunication). During the 1991 KGB-led coup d’etat Relcom—unlike traditional media—remained uncensored. As his son, journalist Andrei Soldatov [recalls](https://cepa.org/article/russia-jails-the-father-of-russias-...
