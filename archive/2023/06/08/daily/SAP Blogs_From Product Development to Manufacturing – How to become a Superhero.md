Imagine, if you could lower costs, reduce time-to-market and secure product quality which all ends up in increasing business profit, and just by taking a closer look and care on how data is handled in the company... Obviously, these are some very good criteria to become a company's superhero.

But what about becoming such a superhero? It all begins with some knowledge behind the data and process scenes … let’s go!

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/06/IntroSlide-1.png)

In one of my previous blog-posts I wrote about "[Connecting Engineering to the Enterprise](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/16/connecting-engineering-to-the-enterprise-do-you/)", and which approaches we have, to connect product engineers directly by [Engineering Control Center (ECTR)](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/engineering-control-center.html) or by a dedicated PDM/PLM platform (such as Siemens [Teamcenter](https://www.sap.com/products/scm/teamcenter-by-siemens.html)) to our SAP ERP backbone.

Therefore, as you already know, we have various options to connect tools and systems technologically. But what about the business processes and needs of corresponding dataflows? And what about this crucial moment when product development is sending their data, structures, and documents to manufacturing?

Product Development to Manufacturing Handover in a simplified E2E Business Process

Still today, in many companies, this exclusive process step is a very loose interaction between different colleagues and departments, a fragmented data-exchange and handover process which has more similarity to a “hot potato” then a runners’ baton or even a “handshake”.

**Handover Product data to Manufacturing - A crucial part of the Digital Thread**

Let us consider examples to examine the importance of connecting engineering to the enterprise. Whereas the product development to manufacturing step is of course not the only aspect but of very dedicated importance. I have selected three business principles as representatives and examples.

Exemplary Data-Flows of Selected Business Models

1. Engineer To Order (ETO)

It is usual for companies that follow ETO business model to manage themselves in a customer project-oriented way with multiple years of project lead-times. Also, the product dimensions and bill-of-materials can be enormously large and complex, such as in plant- and shipbuilding. Although the bidding-, planning- and engineering-phases consume already a lot of time, costly problems often happen on the construction site because of, e.g.

+ late engineering changes were not propagated in-time

+ long lead items were purchased too late

+ logistics delivers wrong parts, or to wrong location, or from wrong supplier

Operators on site may somehow be able to fix the issues, or in the worst case, a hard stop on the construction side occurs and causes delays until new parts/assemblies are delivered. Both cases cost time and money, may end up in severe project-delays, penalties, and unsatisfied customers.

2. Configure To Order (CTO)
Companies following CTO such as machine builders or in automotive industries are experts in taking care about defining product standards with variants and options and deliver configured products just as customers do need. Considering the data in the background, they face challenges such as

+ Inefficiently managed and distributed configuration data, leads to limitations and delays, e.g. on data packages for production or 3D supported structures for ordering or service needs

+ Error-prone handover from product engineering during New Product Development Introduction (NPDI) leads to extra efforts and failures in manufacturing and logistics

+ Need of high degree of flexible automation in production

To generate, manage and provide 150% of product (and manufacturing) data as well as being capable to use 100% extracts of a customer’s orders in all needed process steps as fast and consistent as possible is key to success, however decoupled databases and inconsistencies are happening and are the bitter truth.

3. Make To Stock (MTS)
The MTS principle is very common in consumer...
