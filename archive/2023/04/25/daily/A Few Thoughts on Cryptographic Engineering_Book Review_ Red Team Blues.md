I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

As a rule, book reviews are not a thing I usually do.

So when I received an out-of-the-blue email from Cory Doctorow last week asking if I would review his latest book, [Red Team Blues](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/redteamblues), it took a minute to overcome my initial skepticism. While I’m a fan of Cory’s work, this is a narrow/nerdy blog about cryptography, not a place where we spend much time on literature. Moreover, my only previous attempt to review a popular cryptography novel — a quick sketch of Dan Brown’s abysmal [*Digital Fortress*](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2011/11/23/digital-fortress-i-read-it-so-you-dont/) — did not go very well for anyone.

But Cory isn’t Dan Brown. And Red Team Blues is *definitely* not Digital Fortress.

This became obvious in the middle of the first chapter, when a character began explaining the operation of a [trusted execution environment](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/web) and its various digital signing keys. While it’s always fun to read about gangsters and exploding cars, there’s something particularly nice about a book whose plot hangs around a piece of technology that most people don’t even *think about*. (And if that isn’t your thing, there *are* exploding cars and gangsters.)

This still leaves the question of how a cryptography blog reviews a work of fiction, even one centered on cryptography. The answer is pretty simple: I’m not going to talk much about the story. If you want that, there are [other reviews out there](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60784417). While I did enjoy the book immensely and I’m hopeful Cory will write more books in this line (with hopefully more cryptography), I’ll mainly focus on the plausibility of the core technical setup.

But even to do that, I have to provide a few basic details about the story. (Note: minor spoilers below, but really only two chapters’ worth.)

The protagonist of Red Team Blues is 67-year-old Martin Hench, an expert forensic accountant with decades of experience tracing and recovering funds for some of the most powerful people in Silicon Valley. Martin is on the brink of retirement, lives in a bus named “the Unsalted Hash” and loves bourbon nearly as much as he despises cryptocurrency. This latter position is presumably a difficult one for someone in Martin’s line of work, and sure enough his conviction is quickly put to the test.

Before long Martin is hired by his old friend Danny Lazer — sort of a cross between Phil Zimmerman, David Chaum and (maybe) Max Levchin — who begs him to take one last career-defining job: namely, to save his friend’s life by saving his newest project: a cryptocurrency called TrustlessCoin.

TrustlessCoin is a private cryptocurrency: not terribly different from real ones like Monero or Zcash. (As a founding scientist of a [private cryptocurrency](https://z.cash/founding-scientists/), let me say that none of the things in this novel have ever happened to me, and I’m slightly disappointed in that.)

Unlike standard cryptocurrencies, TrustlessCoin containso...
