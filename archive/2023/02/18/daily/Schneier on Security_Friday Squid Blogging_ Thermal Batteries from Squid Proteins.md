## Friday Squid Blogging: Thermal Batteries from Squid Proteins

Researchers are [making](https://www.cbs19news.com/story/48333394/uva-lab-finds-that-squid-could-be-the-next-green-energy-source-in-project-for-department-of-energy) thermal batteries from “a synthetic material that’s derived from squid ring teeth protein.”

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

As someone responsible for the architecture of a data rich environment, I’d like to create/document my first threat model.

Any pointers on what blog/paper/book I should read or templates to structure my thinking?

And should I think about a threat model differently from a risk model or have one mode covering both?

Creating a threat model is an important step in ensuring the security of a data-rich environment. Here are some resources and guidelines to help you get started:

1. “Threat Modeling: Designing for Security” by Adam Shostack is a comprehensive book that covers the theory and practice of threat modeling. It includes templates, checklists, and other tools that can help you structure your thinking.
2. The “STRIDE” model is a common framework for identifying threats. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. Microsoft has a detailed guide on how to use this framework in threat modeling.
3. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) has several resources on threat modeling, including a Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet, which provides an overview of the process and steps to follow.
4. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has a guide on threat modeling that provides an overview of the process and includes templates and checklists.

When it comes to differentiating between a threat model and a risk model, the two are related but distinct concepts. A threat model focuses on identifying potential threats to a system, while a risk model assesses the likelihood and potential impact of those threats. You may choose to create separate models for each or combine them into a single model that covers both. However, it is important to ensure that both threat and risk are adequately addressed in any security planning or assessment.

@AllTheNews – Just for the record, it isn’t only the Russians who suggest the possibility of US involvement in sabotaging Nordstream. And your news source is itself a disinformation outlet:

“…one article citing a Russian government spokesperson … promoting (at least in the headline) the idea that the U.S. might have intentionally sabotaged the pipeline.”

See for example,

How America Took Out The Nord Stream Pipeline

“There is no other journalist, dead or alive, that can match the work and legacy of Sy Hersh — e.g., Watergate, CIA Assassinations, the Glomar Explorer, My Lai Massacre, Abu Ghraib, Syrian False Flag Chemical Weapon, Killing Bin Laden and now, the U.S. attack on the Nord Stream Pipeline.” – Larry Johson

Hersh’s report on February 8 disclosed that it was the Norwegian navy which finally found the optimal location for blowing up the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. Thus, on September 26, 2022, a Norwegian Navy P8 surveillance plane dropped a sonar buoy in a seemingly routine flight, triggering high-powered C4 explosives that had been planted on the pipelines.
