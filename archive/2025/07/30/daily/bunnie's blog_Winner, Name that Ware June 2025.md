## Winner, Name that Ware June 2025

The Ware for June 2025 is a Gentner EFT-900A frequency shifter for radio audio applications. According to [Chris Combs](https://chriscombs.net), “it lets two parties send and receive ‘full-range audio’, whatever that means, compressed and then decompressed via the usual 300-3500hz phone line”. Even though Per *named* the ware first, I will give the prize to Kienan because the response addresses the theory of operation of the ware – shifting the audio up/down by 250Hz so that low-end audio isn’t lost on analog telephone lines. I found that bit very insightful, and now I don’t look at the ware the same way as I did before. Congrats, email me for your prize!

Also, this has never happened before, but the designer of the ware (Bill Gillman) made a cameo in the comment sections. I really enjoyed looking at the board, so as a token of thanks for designing such a nice ware, email me and I’ll also give you a prize.
