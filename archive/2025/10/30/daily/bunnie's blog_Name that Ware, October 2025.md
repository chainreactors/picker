Thanks to Juan C. for contributing this curious ware!

I really can’t get enough of how the whole device is integrated with a multi-layer stacked PCB. I imagine that inside the middle of the stack there could be some interesting circuitry going on, too.

I redacted one part number to try and make things a smidge more challenging; at least, an LLM wasn’t able to outright guess the ware when that part number was omitted (but of course, the spirit of the game is to sharpen the wetware sitting on your shoulders by trying to reasoning about the function of the ware, with the aid of reference searches to find datasheets, learn theory, etc).

   That connector is used by G4 processors on old Apple PowerMacs – but that isn’t a PowerMac processor.

   Could it be some sort of signal terminator for IBM POWER systems? I could believe they used the same connector.

   The form factor, FPGA, and big Analog Devices part scream “camera”. I think the big AD part, and the smaller companion on the back are driving a CCD and digitizing the image data.

   Though only having one big connector on one side makes me question that theory. Typically you’d have the sensor on one side, and data going to a computer on the other.

   The FPGA and that huge grid connector make me think it’s pretending to be something. Maybe you attach it to pads where a BGA memory package would ordinarily be soldered, and this works like memory that you can control from another computer?
