## SAP SuccessFactors Report Stories provides a wealth of reporting and analytics capabilities for HR professionals

enabling them to gain insights into their organization’s workforce and make data-driven decisions. However, like any complex system, it’s not immune to issues and quirks that can sometimes cause frustration for users. In this blog, we’ll explore some of the common issues that users may encounter when working with Report Stories reports and provide some workarounds to help you overcome them. Whether you’re a seasoned Report Story user or just starting out, these tips can help you save time and avoid some of the common pitfalls that others have faced.

**Issue**: Struggling with the formula insertion when creating a calculated column in People Stories? Don’t worry; you’re not alone!

**Workaround**: A handy workaround is to write the formula in a separate document like Notepad or Word, and then copy/paste it into the calculated column. This trick can save you time and frustration and ensure that your formula is correctly inserted without any errors.

**Issue**: Do you find yourself struggling when creating a calculated column in People Stories, only to have it keep inserting a formula?

**Workaround**: A simple and effective workaround for this issue is to write the formula in a separate document, such as Notepad or Word, and then copy and paste it into the calculated column. By doing so, you can avoid errors and save time in the long run.

**Issue**: Are you facing errors in all widgets of a working report after importing it from one instance to another in Report Stories?

**Workaround**: A potential workaround for this issue is to edit the query and save it. Then, return back to the report to check if the widgets have been fixed. If the issue persists, ensure to check the Role-Based Permissions (RBP) of the user running the reports, as this could be a possible cause of the problem.

**Issue**: Are you having trouble using the “ISNULL” function in Report Stories, as it only seems to work on number fields?

**Workaround**: A useful workaround for this issue is to concatenate a symbol with the field, and then use the symbol in place of null.

**Issue**: Are you facing blending errors in People Stories due to linked tables?

![](https://veritasprime.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Report-Stories-in-SAP-step-3.jpg)

**Workaround**: One workaround to this issue is to use just one table at the query stage and pull the required field using a join by navigation, if possible. This can help avoid blending errors that often arise when dealing with linked tables. By simplifying the query structure, you can reduce the complexity of your report and ensure that it runs smoothly.

**Issue**: Are you facing the issue of reports being automatically shared with end-users upon import into the system in People Stories?

**Workaround**: One workaround to this issue is to follow these steps:

1. Go to the Report Sharing section

2. Check if the report is shared with any user, group, or role

3. If it is not shared, click on Save

4. Navigate to the Report Centre

5. Check that the shared icon is now gone, indicating that the report is no longer shared with end-users

By following these steps, you can ensure that your reports are not automatically shared with unintended end-users, and you can maintain control over the sharing permissions.

**Issue**: Are you facing the issue of intermittently getting the SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) page instead of the Report Stories query designer page in People Stories?

**Workaround**: A useful workaround for this issue is to complete a hard refresh of the browser by using the Ctrl + Shift + R command. It is important to note that you should not use the back button function and only navigate using the SuccessFactors UI to avoid this issue. By following these steps, you can ensure that you access the Report Stories query designer page without any disruptions and continue working on your reports seamlessly.

**Issue**: Are you experiencing an issue where some fields are not showing any values in a List Report in People Stories?

**Workaround**: One workaround to this issue is to convert the table into a cross-tab in the story designer section. By doing so, you can ensure that all fields display the required values correctly.

**Issue**: Are you facing the issue of the Events table not showing data when connected with the Job Info table in the query in People Stories?

**Workaround**: One useful workaround to this issue is to adjust the Time filter for the Event table. By default, the filter picks up the Time filter from the first (driving) table, which can lead to discrepancies in the data. To resolve this issue, you need to set a different filter for each table to ensure that the data is displayed correctly. By following this workaround, you can ensure that the Events table shows the required data accurately.
