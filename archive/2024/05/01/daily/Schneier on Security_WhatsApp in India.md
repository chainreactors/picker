## WhatsApp in India

Meta has threatened to [pull WhatsApp](https://thewire.in/law/disappearing-messages-whatsapp-says-will-leave-india-is-forced-to-break-encryption) out of India if the courts try to force it to break its end-to-end encryption.

I know another case earlier this year is when India threatened to ban Proton Mail in India due to it using end-to-end encryption. [(link)](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/indian-government-moves-to-ban-proton-mail-after-bomb-threat) Regardless, it’s disappointing to see this. Smart criminals will just move to other services, and unaware citizens will have their privacy breached.

Maybe that is because the current Indian government is going after unaware citizens and *not* after smart criminals. In other words, this is also self protection.

Why do white people get so worried when software made by white people have to follow the rules in non-white countries?

Is there any chance that WhatsApp/Meta would threaten to take their toys and go home if the US government makes an equivalent demand?

Most people on this page know in their hearts that the US government has already done so and Meta has complied with their tails between their legs.

@Vivek

> Why do white people get so worried when software made by white people have to follow the rules in non-white countries?

First, human rights are for everyone and India has ratified the universal declaration of Human Rights. Article 12 of the UDHR states:

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

Hence, the Indian state has signed a declaration to protect the privacy of its citizens and their communications.

Second, the current administration of India has shown to be willing to trample on the Human rights and the rule of law to stay in power and drive out all non-Hindu’s. Which gives us very good grounds to believe that they will maximally abuse any access to WhatsApp messages.

Third, we all protest too when Western countries try to break E2E encryption.

A question. Why do you oppose the privacy of Indian people?

@ ALL,

The practical solutions to the “End To End Encryption”(E2EE) have been known for a very long time. Claude Shannon gave if a fundamental mathematical proof back getting on for a century ago in the early 1940’s if not earlier.

But we need to remember E2EE is just a tiny part of the privacy problem.

To understand why you have to understand the fundamental problem of privacy is that if you want it you have to “pay in some way” by thought and effort, which most are unwilling to do.

Thus those that do become a very clear visible signal well above the well trimmed grass unless they go to considerably extra effort. So the price of privacy rises yet further. The same goes for other issues to do with the ends of the communications channel which gives rise to “traffic analysis” and other higher level attacks against privacy and the attendant costs of keeping it[1].

Now consider who this cost rise benefits and who it harms… Worse how it’s enabled both technologically and sociologically.

All for the sake of apparant convenience… Thus an “easy life” has become in effect an “Orwellian life”.

As for,

> “Smart criminals will just move to other services”

Will they?

I actually doubt it, and history in recent times shows the opposite as far as,

“The convenience of electronic communications”

The technology makes the cost of mass surveillance ever cheaper for those that profit by it. And society insists that you must be part of the mass surveilled at your own expense or be an outcast.

The thing is that few even who read this blog, realise that we are,

“Sleep walking into a trap of our own making.”

Like lambs to the slaughter…

Thus the question is what are “we” –the harmed– going to do against those harming us?

[1] I’ve mentioned many times over the years what you need to consider as part of a workable privacy strategy. It’s not just a lot of hard work, it’s also very fragile, and unlike many years ago nothing on “approved channels” is ephemeral any more. This “record it all” policy I’ve likened to those who surveil attempting to build a “Time Machine” so that they can take information and methods from now and apply it to what happened in the long past to punish those that have become inconvenient tomorrow.

It is not just in India, there are many governments who would like to have access to encrypted content. Here are a few articles which shed more light on this subject:

Australia’s spies and cops want ‘accountable encryption’ – aka access to backdoors:

Just a side note that the Declaration of Human Rights does not imply any legal obligations on countries which have adopted/recognized it.
