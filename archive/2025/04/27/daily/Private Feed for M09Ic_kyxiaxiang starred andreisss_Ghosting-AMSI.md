üõ° AMSI Bypass via RPC Hijack (NdrClientCall3)
This technique exploits the COM-level mechanics AMSI uses when delegating scan requests to antivirus (AV) providers through RPC. By hooking into the NdrClientCall3 function‚Äîused internally by the RPC runtime to marshal and dispatch function calls‚Äîwe intercept AMSI scan requests before they're serialized and sent to the AV engine.

üîç What‚Äôs happening under the hood:

Intercepted Arguments: Payloads are manipulated before hitting the AV, tricking AMSI into thinking clean data is being scanned.

Bypassing Detection: Unlike traditional methods that patch AmsiScanBuffer or set internal flags (like amsiInitFailed), this operates one layer deeper‚Äîat the RPC runtime itself.
