# Resistance, change, & freedom: powered by privacy

Every year, the Tor Project (a 501(c)(3) nonprofit) holds a [fundraiser](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp) where we ask for your support. (If youâre a Tor fan, you probably know that by now!) And every year, we unveil new gifts and a slogan that highlight our values and the importance of Tor.

This year, weâre highlighting three positive forces in the world that are powered by privacy: **resistance, change, and freedom**.

Weâre living in a time of rising authoritarianism. Restrictive [internet censorship and blackouts are](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech) [normal tools used by governments](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech) to disrupt organizing and dissent. Companies continuously [surveill their workers](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/16/tattleware-employers-spying-working-home) with digital spyware. Schools [restrict, monitor, and catalog student activity](https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Activity-Monitoring-Software-Research-Insights-and-Recommendations.pdf) and behavior. Data brokers [sell extremely precise browsing and location data](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/data-broker-helps-police-see-everywhere-youve-been-click-mouse-eff-investigation)âand governments easily circumvent warrants by scooping that data up for a bargain. After the 2022 reversal of Roe v Wade, U.S. [courts have already successfully used digital evidence, like web searches](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/03/abortion-data-privacy-prosecution/) to prosecute people seeking abortions. All of these violations of our privacy make it difficult to exercise our human right to assemble, research, speak, and protest.

At the Tor Project, our mission is to advance human rights and freedoms with open source privacy technology, because protecting privacy is key in the work for a better world.

Weâre a small nonprofit facing global adversaries. Compared to the billion dollar surveillance capitalism industry and global governments, weâre a small force. But just because weâre small doesnât mean we canât grow, and it doesnât mean we canât be successful.

**Your support is key to Tor's success, and the best way to power Tor into the future is through a [monthly](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp) [commitment](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp).**

Looking at leadership organizations like EFF and Wikimedia Foundation, you can see that recurring donationsâby individuals and by companiesâare what allow communities to take on ambitious projects (like, say, offering privacy online to everyone who needs it!). Why does a recurring commitment matter so much? Because reliable resources mean that we can plan for the future with confidence. When we bring new folks in to work on critical areas at Tor, we want to make sure they are here for the long term. Stability like this allows us to invest in solving the big problems.

Thereâs a unique strength to Tor: **this community knows the power of your support to change the course of history**. In moments of need, you step up in creative ways to support Torâs work, and millions of people can access Tor because of your drive to advance internet freedom.

You can see examples of your success right now: from spinning up more than 80,000 new Snowflakes to keep Iranians online during the #Ø²Ù\_Ø²ÙØ¯Ú¯Û\_Ø¢Ø²Ø§Ø¯Û / #MahsaAmini protests to adding thousands of new bridges when Russia began censoring the Tor Projectâs website.

In todayâs world, Tor needs to be available for those who need it at a momentâs notice. Circumstances change and governments make decisions that upend our lives. Your commitment to Tor ensures that is the case.

**[Now through the end of the year, your donation to the Tor Project today will](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp) [be matched](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp)[, 1:1](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-pbp)**. That means that every donation, up to $100,000, will be doubled. Now is an excellent time to give because your donation counts twice. Be sure to check out <https://donate.torproject.org> for this yearâs new t-shirt, and a brand-new offering: a sturdy canvas tote bag.
