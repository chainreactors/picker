# Lamborghini Carjackers Lured by $243M Cyberheist

The parents of a 19-year-old Connecticut honors student accused of taking part in a $243 million cryptocurrency heist in August were carjacked a week later — while out house-hunting in a brand new Lamborghini. Prosecutors say the couple was beaten and briefly kidnapped by six young men who traveled from Florida as part of a botched plan to hold the parents for ransom.

Late in the afternoon of Aug. 25, 2024 in Danbury, Ct., a married couple in their 50s pulled up to a gated community in a new Lamborghini Urus (investigators say the sports car still had temporary tags) when they were intentionally rear-ended by a Honda Civic.

A [witness told police](http://youtube.com/watch?v=xoiaGzwrunY) they saw three men exit a van that was following the Honda, and said the men began assaulting the couple and forcing them into the van. Local police officers spotted the van speeding from the scene and pursued it, only to find the vehicle crashed and abandoned a short distance away.

Inside the disabled van the police found the couple with their hands and feet bound in duct tape, the man visibly bruised after being assaulted with a baseball bat. Danbury police soon reported arresting six suspects in the kidnapping, all men aged 18-26 from Florida. They also recovered the abandoned Lamborghini from a wooded area.

A [criminal complaint](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/borrero-diaz-et-al.pdf) (PDF) filed on Sept. 24 against the six men does not name the victims, referring to them only as a married couple from Danbury with the initials **R.C**. and **S.C.** But prosecutors in Connecticut said they were targeted “because the co-conspirators believed the victims’ son had access to significant amounts of digital currency.”

What made the Miami men so convinced R.C. and S.C.’s son was loaded with cryptocurrency? Approximately one week earlier, on Aug. 19, a group of cybercriminals that allegedly included the couple’s son executed a sophisticated phone-based social engineering attack in which they stole $243 million worth of cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington, D.C.

That’s according to **ZachXBT**, a frequently cited crypto crime investigator who [published a lengthy thread](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1836753409749274895) that broke down how the theft was carried out and ultimately exposed by the perpetrators themselves.

ZachXBT’s post included [a screen recording](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1836753185718865979) of a Discord chat session made by one of the participants to the $243 million robbery, noting that two of the people involved managed to leak the username of the Microsoft Windows PCs they were using to participate in the chat.

One of the usernames leaked during the chat was **Veer Chetal**. According to ZachXBT, that name corresponds to a 19-year-old from Danbury who allegedly goes by the nickname “**Wiz,**” although in the leaked video footage he allegedly used the handle “**Swag**.”  Swag was reportedly involved in executing the early stages of the crypto heist — gaining access to the victim’s Gmail and iCloud accounts.

The same day ZachXBT published his findings, a [criminal indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1369661/dl?inline) was issued in Washington D.C. charging two of the men he named as involved in the heist. Prosecutors allege **Malone “Greavys” Lam**, 20, of Miami and Los Angeles, and **Jeandiel “Box” Serrano**, 21, of Los Angeles conspired to steal and launder over $230 million in cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington, D.C. The indictment alleges Lam and Serrano were helped by other unnamed co-conspirators.

“Lam and Serrano then allegedly spent the laundered cryptocurrency proceeds on international travel, nightclubs, luxury automobiles, watches, jewelry, designer handbags, and rental homes in Los Angeles and Miami,” reads [a press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/indictment-charges-two-230-million-cryptocurrency-scam) from the **U.S. Department of Justice**.

By tracing the flow of funds stolen in the heist, ZachXBT concluded that Wiz received a large percentage from the theft, noting that “additional comfort [in naming him as involved] was gained as throughout multiple recordings accomplices refer to him as ‘Veer’ on audio and in chats.”

“A cluster of [cryptocurrency] addresses tied to both Box/Wiz received $41M+ from two exchanges over the past few weeks primarily flowing to luxury goods brokers to purchase cars, watches, jewelry, and designer clothes,” ZachXBT wrote.

KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from Veer Chetal, and from his parents — **Radhika Chetal** and **Suchil Chetal**. This story will be updated in the event that anyone representing the Chetal family responds. Veer Chetal has not been publicly charged with any crime.

According to [a news brief](https://www.immaculatehs.org/discover-ihs/news/news-post/~board/mustang-monthly/post/mustang-moments-february-2022) published by a private Catholic high school in Danbury that Veer Chetal attended, in 2022 he successfully completed **Harvard’s Future Lawyers Program**, a “unique pre-professional program where students, guided by qualified Harvard undergraduate instructors, learn how to read and build a case, how to write position papers, and how to navigate a path to law school.” A [November 2022 story at patch.com](https://patch.com/connecticut/danbury/immaculate-high-school-leads-pack-academics) quoted Veer Chetal (class of 2024) crediting the Harvard program with his decision to pursue a career in law.

It remains unclear which Chetal family member acquired the 2023 Lamborghini Urus, which has a starting price of around $233,000. Sushil Chetal’s [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sushil-chetal-0898048/) says he is a vice president at the investment bank **Morgan Stanley**.

It is clear that other alleged co-conspirators to the $243 million heist displayed a conspicuous consumption of wealth following the date of the heist. ZachXBT’s post [chronicled Malone’s flashy lifestyle](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/malone-clubs.png), in which he allegedly used the stolen money to purchase more than 10 vehicles, rent palatial properties, travel with friends on chartered jets, and spend between $250,000 and $500,000 a night at clubs in Los Angeles and Miami.
