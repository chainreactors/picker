Fast. These days, it can be hard for us to agree on much of anything. But one thing that seems to unite us all is that when we want something, we want it *now*. And we need it fast.

*Fast* is definitely top-of-mind for anybody producing software. Delivery schedules are constantly being compressed, so anything that reduces the time for developer tasks is a good thing. But in software development, fast isn’t simply about the speed at which a particular function is performed. It’s also about

* **Simplicity.** Developers are awash in complexity due to the sophistication of the software they are building, as well as the increasingly complicated and varied toolchains they work with. They need tools that simplify their work and minimize time lost due to context switching.
* **Scalability.** Organizations are building a lot more software than they were even a few years ago. It’s not uncommon for teams to be managing hundreds or even thousands of concurrent development projects. It’s important for teams to have tools that can handle the volume of applications and releases they manage.
* **Power.** They say nothing kills productivity more than rework. It doesn’t matter how fast you did something the first time if you have to go back and do it a second time. So although teams want tools that are fast and easy-to-use, they still need them to be powerful enough to do their job effectively the first time, to avoid rework.

For development teams, *fast* translates into simplicity, scalability, and power, as well as speed.
