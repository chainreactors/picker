# Serbian police used Cellebrite to unlock, then plant spyware on, a journalist’s phone

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

10:05 PM PST · December 15, 2024

This year, a Serbian journalist and an activist had their phones hacked by local authorities using a cellphone-unlocking device made by forensic tool maker Cellebrite. The authorities’ goal was not only to unlock the phones to access their personal data, as Cellebrite allows, but also to install spyware to enable further surveillance, [according to a new report by Amnesty International](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/latest/2024/12/serbia-a-digital-prison-spyware-and-cellebrite-used-on-journalists-and-activists/).

Amnesty said in its report that it believes these are “the first forensically documented spyware infections enabled by the use” of Cellebrite tools.

This crude but effective technique is one of the many ways that governments use spyware to surveil their citizens. In the last decade, organizations like Amnesty and digital rights group Citizen Lab have documented dozens of cases where governments used advanced spyware made by Western surveillance tech vendors, such as [NSO Group](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/), [Intellexa](https://techcrunch.com/tag/intellexa/), and the now-defunct spyware pioneer [Hacking Team](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking-team/), among others, to remotely hack dissidents, journalists, and political opponents.

Now, as [zero-days and remotely planted spyware](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/zero-days-for-hacking-whatsapp-are-now-worth-millions-of-dollars/) become more expensive [thanks to security improvements](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/), authorities may have to rely more on less sophisticated methods, such as getting their hands physically on the phones they want to hack.

While many cases of spyware abuse happened across the world, there is no guarantee they couldn’t — or don’t — happen in the United States. In November, [Forbes reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/11/25/ice-spent-millions-on-phone-hacking-tech-just-in-time-for-trumps-mass-deportation-plans/) that the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spent $20 million to acquire phone hacking and surveillance tools, among them Cellebrite. Given President-elect Donald Trump’s promised mass deportation campaign, as Forbes reported, experts are worried that ICE will increase its spying activities when the new administration takes control of the White House.

## **A brief history of early spyware**

History tends to repeat itself. Even when something new (or undocumented) first appears, it’s possible that it is actually an iteration of something that’s already happened.

Twenty years ago, when government spyware already existed but little was known within the antivirus industry tasked with defending against it, physically planting spyware on a target’s computer is how the cops could access their communications. Authorities had to have physical access to a target’s device — sometimes by breaking into their home or office — then manually install the spyware.

That’s why, for example, early versions of Hacking Team’s spyware from the mid-2000s were designed to launch from a USB key or a CD. Even earlier, in 2001, [the FBI broke into the office of mobster Nicodemo Scarfo](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna3341694) to plant a spyware designed to monitor what Scarfo typed on his keyboard, with the goal of stealing the key he used to encrypt his emails.

These techniques are returning to popularity, if not for necessity.

Citizen Lab documented a case earlier in 2024 in which [the Russian intelligence agency FSB allegedly installed spyware on the phone of Russian citizen Kirill Parubets](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/05/russian-programmer-says-fsb-agents-planted-spyware-on-his-android-phone/?guccounter=1), an opposition political activist who had been living in Ukraine since 2022, while he was in custody. The Russian authorities had forced Parabuts to give up his phone’s passcode before planting spyware capable of accessing his private data.

## **Stop and search**

In the recent cases in Serbia, Amnesty found a novel spyware on the phones of journalist Slaviša Milanov and youth activist Nikola Ristić.

In February 2024, local police stopped Milanov for what looked like a routine traffic check. He was later brought into a police station, where agents took away his Android phone, a Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S, while he was being questioned, according to Amnesty.

When Milanov got it back, he said he found something strange.

“I noticed that my mobile data (data transmission) and Wi-Fi are turned off. The mobile data application in my mobile phone is always turned on. This was the first suspicion that someone entered my mobile phone,” Milanov told TechCrunch in a recent interview.

Milanov said he then used [StayFree](https://stayfreeapps.com/), a software that tracks how much time someone uses their apps, and noticed that “a lot of applications were active” while the phone was supposedly turned off a...
