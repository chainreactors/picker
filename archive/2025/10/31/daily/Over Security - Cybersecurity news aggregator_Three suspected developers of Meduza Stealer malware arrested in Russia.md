# Three suspected developers of Meduza Stealer malware arrested in Russia

Russian police said they detained three hackers suspected of developing and selling the Meduza Stealer malware in a rare crackdown on domestic cybercrime.

The suspects were arrested in Moscow and the surrounding region, Russia’s Interior Ministry spokesperson Irina Volk [said](https://t.me/IrinaVolk_MVD/5661) in a statement on Thursday.

The three “young IT specialists” are suspected of developing, using and selling malicious software designed to steal login credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data and other sensitive information, she added.

Police said they seized computer equipment, phones, and bank cards during raids on the suspects’ homes. A video released by the Interior Ministry [shows](https://mvdmedia.ru/news/ofitsialnyy-predstavitel/irina-volk-sotrudniki-mvd-rossii-zaderzhali-gruppu-khakerov-razrabotavshikh-i-rasprostranyavshikh-vi) officers breaking down doors and storming into apartments. When asked by police why he had been detained, one suspect replied in Russian, “I don’t really understand.”

Officials said the suspects began distributing Meduza Stealer through hacker forums roughly two years ago. In one incident earlier this year, the group allegedly used the malware to steal data from an organization in Russia’s Astrakhan region.

Authorities said the group also created another type of malware designed to disable antivirus protection and build botnets for large-scale cyberattacks. The malicious program was not identified. The three face up to four years in prison if convicted.

Meduza Stealer first appeared in 2023, sold on Russian-language hacking forums and Telegram channels as a service for a fee. It has since been used in cyberattacks targeting both personal and financial data.

Ukrainian officials have previously [linked](https://therecord.media/hackers-target-ukraine-draftees-meduzastealer-malware-telegram) the malware to attacks on domestic military and government entities. In one campaign last October, threat actors used a fake Telegram “technical support” bot to distribute the malware to users of Ukraine’s government mobilization app.

Researchers have also observed Meduza Stealer infections in [Poland](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6276652) and inside Russia itself — including one 2023 [campaign](https://bi.zone/eng/expertise/blog/stone-wolf-atakuet-rossiyskie-kompanii-stilerom-meduza/) that used phishing emails impersonating an industrial automation company.

Russia’s law enforcement agencies rarely pursue cybercriminals operating inside the country. But researchers say that has begun to change.

According to a recent [report](https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/dark-covenant-3-controlled-impunity-and-russias-cybercriminals) by Recorded Future’s Insikt Group, Moscow’s stance has shifted “from passive tolerance to active management” of the hacking ecosystem — a strategy that includes selective arrests and public crackdowns intended to reinforce state authority while preserving useful talent.

Such moves mark a notable shift in a country long seen as a safe haven for financially motivated hackers. Researchers say many of these actors are now decentralizing their operations to evade both Western and domestic surveillance.
