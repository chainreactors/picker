OtterCookie: Analysis of Lazarus Group Malware Targeting Finance and Tech Professionals

*Editor’s note:****The current article is authored by Mauro Eldritch, offensive security expert and threat intelligence analyst. You can***[***find Mauro on X***](https://x.com/MauroEldritch)***.***

What looks like a simple freelance bug fix turns out to be a full-blown malware infection. OtterCookie, a new tool from the Lazarus Group [APT](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/track-advanced-persistent-threats/), hides behind clean code and fake job offers, then silently steals credentials, [crypto wallets](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/crypto-malware/), and more.

In this step-by-step technical analysis, [Mauro Eldritch](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/authors/mauro-eldritch/) breaks down the full attack chain, supported by live insights from ANY.RUN’s [Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ottercookie&utm_term=030625&utm_content=linktolanding).

## Overview of OtterCookie Malware

North Korean state-sponsored groups, most notably Lazarus, continue to target the financial and cryptocurrency sectors using a range of custom malware families. Previously observed campaigns included threats like [InvisibleFerret and Beavertail](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/invisibleferret-malware-analysis/), which were distributed through elaborate social engineering tactics such as fake developer interviews and staged business calls with executives.

A new addition to this toolkit is **OtterCookie**, a [stealer malware](https://any.run/malware-trends/stealer/) that, much like its predecessors, isn’t spread through random means like pirated software or infected USB drives. Instead, it is part of a broader, coordinated campaign targeting professionals in the tech, financial, and crypto industries. By staging fake interviews, threat actors deliver malware disguised either as coding challenges (or their dependencies) or video call software, in a campaign now known as Contagious Interview or DevPopper.

OtterCookie, written in heavily obfuscated [JavaScript](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malicious-scripts/), was uncovered during a recent investigation conducted with the Bitso Quetzal Team. Notably, the delivery method used in this case stands out for its creativity and level of deception.

### Key Takeaways

* **OtterCookie is a new stealer malware** linked to North Korean APT Lazarus, delivered through fake job offers.

* **Payload is fetched from an external API** and executed using a require() call—no local implant needed.

* **Targets include browser credentials, macOS keychains, and crypto wallets** like Solana and Exodus.

* **Data is exfiltrated via port 1224 to a U.S.-based C2 server**, following patterns seen in Beavertail and InvisibleFerret.

* **ANY.RUN detects OtterCookie early, before deobfuscation**, and maps its behavior in the [ATT&CK Matrix](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/).

* **OtterCookie eventually deploys InvisibleFerret**, continuing Lazarus’s modular, multi-stage approach.

## Social Engineering Delivery: The “Job Offer” Trap

As part of the *Contagious Interview* campaign, one observed variation involved a new form of social engineering distributed through LinkedIn. Instead of requesting participation in a coding challenge or scheduling a business call, as seen in previous campaigns, the attacker proposed freelance contract work. The task was simple: resolve a minor visual bug in the frontend of a decentralized application (DApp).

The sender claimed their development team was unavailable due to vacation and shared access to a Bitbucket repository containing Node.js code.

Surprisingly, the repository appeared entirely clean. No implants, no hidden...
