China also known as the Great Firewall of China, as it has been actively blocking VPN service providers for the longest of time. Thus, the question arise as to *“Can you use VPN in China?”*. Those VPN service providers that you have downloaded prior entering to China, may have been blocked in China as it validates the difficulties to bypass the great firewall. Every now and then, China will actively hunt down VPN in China and block them, leaving you in want of one that’s not been blocked yet.

Before we continue, it is advisable that you download the VPN service provider and using the VPN before you head off to China. There’s a good chance you are unable to download any VPN providers while you are there and it can be very difficult for you.

On a side note, make sure you know the VPN service provider is not blocked in China. China has blocked a lot of VPN service providers so make sure you have done enough research on this matter beforehand.

At the same time, here are some things for you to consider before settling for the best VPN service to use in China.

## Our Top 7 Best VPNs for China

Here are our best 7 VPN for China for you to consider.

### 1. ExpressVPN

![ExpressVPN](data:image/svg+xml...)![ExpressVPN](https://www.suspek.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ExpressVPN-screenshot.png)

So far, ExpressVPN hasn’t been outright banned in China (yet) hence, it is still consider one of the VPNs legal in China. That’s good news considering how it’s one of the best VPN service providers you can choose from in the market that works in China.

ExpressVPN has over 3000+ servers for you to choose from. With such wide array of server choices you are spoilt for choice.

Since that there are so many servers to choose from, there should be one important thing about VPN servers you should know. When you choose to connect to a server, it can affect your connection speed.

Let’s say you have decided to connect to one in North America, that means your internet speed is going to slow down. The reason being that your data requires more time to travel over to North America before coming back to you. That’s why your connection speed may slow down when you are using it.

That’s the downside of using a VPN that is connected to a server that is really far away from you geographically. Having said that, most users reported back saying how with ExpressVPN, you won’t feel much difference in the connection speed.

Some users said they experience up to over 30% speed reduction. Otherwise the overall speed reduction does not hinder them from performing their much needed daily tasks online.

ExpressVPN has a round-the-clock customer service support ready at your service. If you have any issues with ExpressVPN, you can shoot them a question anytime via their live chat support. If you can’t get hold of their web live chat personnel, you can always call in or email them for any assistance you need.

If you are interested in ExpressVPN, they have several plans available for you.

* 1 month: US$12.95
* 6 months: US$9.99/month or US$59.95 billed every 6 months
* 12 months: US$12.95/month or US155.40 billed every 12 months

ExpressVPN has a 30 day money back guarantee feature. If you are unhappy with their services, you can choose to discontinue your subscription. Just make sure you do it before the 30th day mark, otherwise you will continue paying for the services every month, year, etc.

### 2. NordVPN

![NordVPN](data:image/svg+xml...)![NordVPN](https://www.suspek.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NordVPN-Screenshot.png)

NordVPN is another VPN service provider that hasn’t been blocked by China yet. That is basically good news as it’s one of the other VPN service providers that has a wide array of VPN servers.

With over 5600 servers to choose from, you can easily bypass the great China firewall with ease. Users have commented that the speed is purportedly one of the best among the leading VPN service providers for China. Not surprising considering NordVPN has one of the least complaints regarding its speed in China.

Though being one of the best for minimal internet connection lags, it does not mean it is without issues. Several users have also commented that though it does not affect their internet speed, they may experience slowness in speed.

As mentioned before, sometimes the lagging connection speed while connected to a VPN service is because you are connected to a server that in geographically further away from you. Alternatively, sometimes it may be due to slow initial internet connection, so there is that too.

At the same time, if you wonder if NordVPN collects your personal data and information, it does not. Like a lot of other leading VPN service providers, they practice a 0 logs policy. If any 3rd parties requested for your private data, NordVPN will not be able to hand it over as it doesn’t hold any it anyway.
