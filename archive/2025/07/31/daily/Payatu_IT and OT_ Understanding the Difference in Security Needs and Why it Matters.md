## IT vs OT

Ever heard someone casually say, ‚ÄúOT is just IT with industrial devices‚Äù? I get the temptation‚Äîbut it‚Äôs way off the mark. **Moral of the story:** OT isn‚Äôt your average office network‚Äîit‚Äôs mission-critical, physical, and **way less forgiving**. This kind of thinking can get systems broken, processes halted, or worse‚Äîsomeone hurt.
