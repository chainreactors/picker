# Andor, Season 2

Excited for Star Wars: Andor Season 2
![](/images/blog/img/2025/andor-season-2-banner-1000w.png)

I’m super excited for the new season of Andor. The first season was
great TV, and really pulled Star Wars away from lightsabers to the
question of what a rebellion is, and the moral qualms of those who
rebel.

The BBC had this [fascinating backstory](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250417-how-a-young-joseph-stalin-inspired-star-wars-series-andor) about how
Tony Gilroy based parts of the story on Stalin, Lenin, and
Trotsky.

A big part of the reason that Star Wars feels so real and relevant
is how artfully its writers have drawn timeless themes from the real
world, and worked them into the stories.

I may try to live-ish blog some of the new stories this week. But
hey, while we’re talking lessons from Star Wars, my Threats book is still
available for free from [Neowin](https://www.neowin.net/sponsored/threats-what-every-engineer-should-learn-from-star-wars-15-value-now-completely-free/). There’s a lot to learn
from how they execute, and engineers have a lot to learn from how
they don’t.
