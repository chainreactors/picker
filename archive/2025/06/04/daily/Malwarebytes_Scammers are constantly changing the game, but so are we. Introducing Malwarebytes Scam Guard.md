# Scammers are constantly changing the game, but so are we. Introducing Malwarebytes Scam Guard

Posted: June 3, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

Mobile scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated, leaving people vulnerable to cybercriminals.

We recently reported on the ever-increasing number of [scams that are created by AI-supported tools](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/02/how-ai-was-used-in-an-advanced-phishing-campaign-targeting-gmail-users), with attackers crafting highly convincing [phishing emails](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) that target both individuals and businesses, resulting in devastating financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised personal data.

Elaborate [sextortion scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/04/i-sent-you-an-email-from-your-email-account-sextortion-scam-claims) manipulate victims by using shame as a tactic to coerce them into taking action, sometimes draining their life savings.

And the list goes on. Scammers are always finding new ways to trick their victims into giving them their hard-earned money or [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

These tactics include urging individuals to [change their address information on a non-existent delivery,](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/04/text-scams-grow-to-steal-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars) promoting [job opportunities](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/task-scams-surge-by-400-but-what-are-they) that just seem too good to be true, or having a long-lost family member reach out on WhatsApp to invite you to share their newfound fortune with you.

As scammers develop new ways of exploiting unsuspecting users, Malwarebytes is introducing Scam Guard to combat this new wave of threats.

Scam Guard simplifies scam prevention by providing real-time feedback via an easy-to-use AI-powered chat. Just submit a screenshot, paste suspicious content, or share texts and numbers, and we’ll give you immediate personalized guidance and safety tips.
