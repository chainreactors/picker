# Vehicle Identification Numbers reveal driver data via telematics

Posted: December 6, 2022

There are many ways that data collection, and data availability, make less sense as the years pass by. This is frequently accompanied by a resistance to change, to improve these processes, because “that’s how we’ve always done it”. Sadly this is often the case even when those data collectors have been shown how real world harm can be done with this information.

We now see another example of this in motor vehicle land, with [customer info potentially retrievable via a VIN number on a windshield](https://www.hackread.com/honda-nissan-app-flaw-cars-vin/).

## A short history of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)

The VIN (or chassis number) is a unique marker on all vehicles put to use after 1981, originally designed to present you with an easy way to browse a vehicle’s history. This number is crucial for everything from insurance and accidents to modification work done and even crime.

The [individual sections of the 17 digit number](https://www.motorcheck.co.uk/what-is-a-vin/#:~:text=The%20Vehicle%20Identification%20Number%20(VIN,information%20about%20that%20vehicle's%20history.) detail all manner of information about the car, ranging from manufacturer to attributes. If there was no way to pull this data together, you’d potentially have no real way of knowing what you may be getting yourself into as a buyer which could have major ramifications down the line.

For a long time, the VIN served its purpose and the data provided didn’t cause any issues.

With vehicles becoming increasingly digital as far as many crucial operations go, there is a need to try and safeguard that digital information whenever possible. If something goes wrong, if somebody creates an exploit or finds a vulnerability, it could have ramifications for the vehicle owner.

The times have moved on. It makes little sense that various quantities of owner specific information is posted to several locations on a car including the door frame, or the engine block.

Which leads us neatly back to a car windshield…

## Just VIN and bear it

> Earlier this year, we were able to remotely unlock, start, locate, flash, and honk any remotely connected Honda, Nissan, Infiniti, and Acura vehicles, completely unauthorized, knowing only the VIN number of the car.

As with so many interesting system [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits), the weak spot is a service being made use of by many. In this case, the telematics service. Telematics vehicle gateways offer several services in one which are integrated into your car. [GPS, assistance, collision notification, and much more](https://www.telematics.com/what-is-vehicle-telematics/) flows between the server and motor vehicle.

The researchers noticed that multiple car brands were serviced by SiriusXM:

> While exploring this avenue, we kept seeing SiriusXM referenced in source code and documentation relating to vehicle telematics.

> This was super interesting to us, because we didn't know SiriusXM offered any remote vehicle management functionality, but it turns out, they do! ...
