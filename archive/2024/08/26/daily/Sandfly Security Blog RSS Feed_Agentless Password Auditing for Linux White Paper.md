# Agentless Password Auditing for Linux White Paper

25 August 2024

White Paper

We have released a white paper on our powerful agentless password auditor for Linux. We discuss the problem of password brute force attacks, and how Sandfly can quickly and safely audit for weak passwords across all Linux hosts and distributions instantly.

[Agentless Password Auditing for Linux White Paper](https://sandflysecurity.com/sharing/sandfly-agentless-linux-password-auditing.pdf)

Read the paper to learn more about:

* Password brute force attack threats.
* The limitations of external brute force password auditing.
* Password auditing across modern, legacy, embedded, and Linux appliances.
* Custom password lists to find notorious shared passwords common in most organizations.
* The low performance impacts of doing on-host auditing.

Sandfly is more than just Linux EDR. Our agentless password auditor is fast and effective at preventing serious breaches that can start with a simple default account and balloon into a massive incident. Let us find bad passwords before attackers do.
