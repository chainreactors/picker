# Hertz data breach caused by CL0P ransomware attack on vendor

Posted: April 15, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The Hertz Corporation, on behalf of Hertz, Dollar, and Thrifty brands, is sending [breach notifications](https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/agviewerad/ret?loc=2360) to customers who may have had their name, contact information, driver’s license, and—in rare cases—Social Security Number exposed in a [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach).

The car rental giant’s data was stolen in a [ransomware attack](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) [leveraging a vulnerability in Cleo file sharing products](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/cleo-the-next-moveit-and-goanywhere/).

In 2023, the CL0P ransomware gang broke the scalability barrier and shook the security world with a series of short, automated campaigns, hitting hundreds of unsuspecting targets simultaneously with attacks based on zero-day [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) in file sharing software like [MOVEit Transfer](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/upgrade-now-new-moveit-transfer-vulnerability-under-active-exploitation/) and [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/goanywhere-zero-day-opened-door-to-clop-ransomware/).

In 2024, CL0P repeated this method using a zero-day exploit against Cleo, a business-to-business (B2B) tech platform provider that specializes in managed file transfer (MFT) solutions, like Cleo Harmony, VLTrader, and LexiCom.

Hertz acknowledged that it was one of the victims:

> “On February 10, 2025, we confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zeroday vulnerabilities within Cleo’s platform in October 2024 and December 2024.”

We were already aware of the fact, since CL0P posted about it on their leak site.

This leak site is also where the stolen data is available for download. Malwarebytes Labs was unable to figure out how many people were affected, but the number of available archives for download is in the tenfolds.

After a full data analysis, Hertz is sending notifications to affected customers. The type of stolen data varies per customer, but could include:

* Name
* Contact information
* Driver’s license
* [Social Security Number](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web) (in rare cases according to Hertz)

> “A very small number of individuals may have had their Social Security or other government identification numbers, passport information, Medicare or Medicaid ID (associated with workers’ compensation claims), or injury-related information associated with vehicle accident claims impacted by the event.”

While Hertz says it’s not aware of any misuse of stolen [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) for fraudulent purposes, it offers affected customers two years of [identity monitoring](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web-monitoring) services by Kroll for free.
