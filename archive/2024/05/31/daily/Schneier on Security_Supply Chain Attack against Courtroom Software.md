## Supply Chain Attack against Courtroom Software

No word on how this [backdoor](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/crooks-plant-backdoor-in-software-used-by-courtrooms-around-the-world/) was installed:

> A software maker serving more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the world hosted an application update containing a hidden backdoor that maintained persistent communication with a malicious website, researchers reported Thursday, in the latest episode of a supply-chain attack.
>
> The software, known as the JAVS Viewer 8, is a component of the [JAVS Suite 8](https://www.javs.com/javs-suite-8-av-management-software/), an application package courtrooms use to record, play back, and manage audio and video from proceedings. Its maker, Louisville, Kentucky-based Justice AV Solutions, says its products are used in more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the US and 11 other countries. The company has been in business for 35 years.

It’s software used by courts; we can imagine all sort of actors who want to backdoor it.

I’m holding out for Cult Of The Dead Cow’s version.

@Aaron
You can hack the supply chains that refill the ammo box when you finish a trip to the range.

Or I guess you can take the ammo from the people who don’t keep up their proficiency.

I can imagine actors who are probably “backdooring” it now.

@Aaron

I agree, but the ammo box can be confiscated.

Somethings don't save a jot. •

@ Bruce

Although probably not this software

I still have all the paperwork from warning the UK HM Courts and Tribunal Service about the very many security risks their prototype Court System in Kingston Crown Court (SW London) was susceptible to.

It was the forerunner of the current system,

<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-to-use-the-hmcts-e-filing-service>

Which is even worse.

As you know from conversations with @Nick P I had an extraordinarily dim view of Code-Signing well over a decade ago.

Some of what I warned HMCTS about has since happened, but other things are shall we say still pending on the crooks catching up.

The plain fact is in reality it does not work very well except for the simplest of things and has been known to not have filings etc available at the right time and place.

Whilst not talked about loudly most members of the court hate it as it’s just to limiting.

As for things surrounding it HMCTS due to chronic cut backs just do not have enough staff and outsourcing roles to companies has been an unmitigated disaster.

I’m currently involved with a court case that started before C19 lockdown and it’s still dragging on… A big part of the drag is the failings of court electronic systems.

This is not justice but a slow march to death. As one of the defendants has died already drinking themselves into liver failure, jaundice, anemia, septicemia, and eventually “Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation”(DIC) and death.

i was recently in a courtroom and i was also shocked at how much computer stuff is going on in there.
really, it shouldn’t be that much; computers aren’t reliable for keeping data static and safe. computers are good at manipulating data, at dsp.

anyways, i was in the room by myself before everyone else arrived and thought about how my own computer was with me and the system is still slightly a sitting duck to people worse than me and my peers. anybody really mean and technologically capable and motivated could have done covert damage. thankfully, i’m not that guy. but still, it was sobering.

i even suspect that some laws in texas never actually changed, but were hacked into place instead. nobody ought to be using computers for law purposes at all in my opinion. we don’t need computers for lawfulness anywhere anytime anyhow.

even police body cameras ought to be more like flight recorders than digital recorders. we don’t need rogue police or malicious hackers editing the footage of what actually happened.
