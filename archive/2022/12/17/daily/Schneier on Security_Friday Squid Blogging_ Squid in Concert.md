## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid in Concert

Squid is [performing a concert](https://diymag.com/news/squid-london-scala-february-2023) in London in February.

If you don’t know what their music is like, try [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKqlwUOwF88) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKtjLYjqgPk) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fef6lTnQewM).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ SpaceLifeForm

Venn

And more

I find Dr.Venn a bit sinister. The reason why – I cannot tell; but this I know, and know full well.

Will auto insurers raise rates for unvaccinated drivers?

A study of Ontario drivers found that people who had not received the Covid vaccine were 70% more likely to get into a serious car crash.

The reasons for this are interesting. It would, of course, be nice to address this both actuarially and in improved safety outcomes.

@ Ted,

Re : C19 and auto insurance rate.

> “The reasons for this are interesting.”

They probably are, but the link you give is backed by a bunch of Yahhos who think outrageous personal data theft is their right.

They are one of the worst personal data stealers I’m aware of. Worse they have other policies to do a “Walled Garden” on you. That is they are trying to do the old and discredited AOL trick of passing you to other members in the Yahho “Chamber of Horrors”…

Any way that said…

I’ve probably found the paper already. It was already way down low on my reading list for reasons I explain below,

@ ALL,

According to another web site the “interesting reasons” are probably,

> *“The study found that those who hadn’t received a vaccine were more likely to be younger, living in a rural area, and in the lower fifth overall for income. Unvaccinated individuals were also more likely to be diagnosed with alcohol misuse or depression, and with untreated sleep apnea, diabetes, cancer, or dementia.”*

In short, what some would call “White Trash” or “Dec 37 / MAGA” mentality types.

As well as the suggestion that because they did not follow Public Health Advice, they were thus more likely to be “legal rule” breakers (hinting at potential criminal mentality as well).

I’ve not yet read the actual journal it’s low on my reading list. Because the abstracts opening paragraph says,

> *“Coronavirus disease (COVID) vaccine hesitancy is a reflection of psychology that might also contribute to traffic safety. We tested whether COVID vaccination was associated with the risks of a traffic crash.”*

For almost exactly the reason the motoring / driving journalists have lept on it. I suspect the paper may well be “coincidence dressed up as potential causality”, and that various idiots like insurance companies and prosecuters are going to jump on it for their own benifits…

There are a couple of huge red flags in that opening paragraph… Firstly the term “vaccine hesitancy” is one thought up by seniors in the “World Health Organisation”(WHO) who for financial reasons –ie China is a major contributor as are certain drugs companies– are into “victimising” those who want more data and honest behaviour befor they take what we now have good reason to suspect is an activity where the risk is over a thousand times the current potential benifit… The second is the use of “might” and for those who know a bit more about it “tested” does not mean what you might think like a double blind trial. No it means taking already suspect data[1] and looking for out of normal range data, that might or might not be an indicator or pure coincidence. Something you might build at best a tentative hypothises not the sole foundations of a paper.

Anyway for those people want to read the paper I found,

[https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00822-1/fulltext](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343%2822%2900822-1/fulltext)

[1] It’s a well known factor that people in the lower socio-economic range are more prone to accidents. Because they often work multiple “unsociable hours” jobs and spend considerably longer on the road in chalanging light / driving conditions, in older thus less safe and probably not as well maintained vehicles, than those who work normal hours. Who also can work from home, only have one job related journy, travel at times when traffic conditions are significantly different or can take public transport, etc, etc. Previous studies on Doctors and Nurses who are generally in the upper half of the socio-economic range, show similar accident statistics. They work shifts often do “bank work” at other medical fascilities and travel at times outside the normal work rush hours.

Israeli startup to deploy hazard-alerting chipsets on Germany’s autobahn

“Israeli startup Autotalks, a maker of smart vehicle communication systems, on Monday announced a partnership for the first deployment of its chipsets at roadside traffic signals

The Kfar Netter-based company has teamed up with Germany’s Afusoft, which focuses on communication and security technology, to deploy its chipsets at road-work signs on the autobahn.
