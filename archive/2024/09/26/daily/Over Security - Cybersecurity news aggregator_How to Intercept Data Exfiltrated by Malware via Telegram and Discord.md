How to Intercept Data Exfiltrated by Malware via Telegram and Discord

Often, malware uses platforms like — Telegram and Discord for data exfiltration. Due to its simplicity and the lack of need for building a server architecture, this exfiltration method has gained significant popularity. However, this very simplicity is also its weakness.

In this article we’ll show you how to obtain information related to threat actors’ activities using Telegram API, which can help reveal their identity, attribute malware samples to known families or discover new ones.

## **Parsing a Telegram Chat**

First, we need to find a relevant malware sample using [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=intercepting_malware_data&utm_term=250924&utm_content=linktolookuplanding) with the following query:

|  |
| --- |
| [​​domainName:”api.telegram.org”​](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=intercepting_malware_data&utm_term=250924&utm_content=linktolookup#%7B%2522query%2522:%2522domainName:%255C%2522api.telegram.org%255C%2522%2522,%2522dateRange%2522:180%7D) |

We can select one of them and [rerun it](https://app.any.run/tasks/93e29328-a39a-4769-94d7-44256e1c9cbb/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=intercepting_malware_data&utm_term=250924&utm_content=linktoservice) with the MITM Proxy feature enabled.

In Telegram, to send a message, two main methods are typically used:

| /sendMessage | /sendDocument |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| For sending text | For sending text and files |
| Any HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) can be used. The GET method allows parameters to be passed in the query string (url-encoded) | Only the POST method is available. The POST method requires parameters to be passed in the request body |

After turning on the MITM Proxy and starting the sandbox session, we navigate to the HTTP Requests tab, where we can see a request to api.telegram.org.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image5c-1024x96.png)

Looking at the POST request to /sendDocument, we see that it uses the form-data method for transmission.

In this case, the bot token can be obtained from the URL of the request, and the chat\_id from the body (in the screenshot, it is the first parameter in the body).

We can also examine the response from the server. It arrives in JSON format and contains a lot of useful information: the chat\_id, bot username, bot name/title, chat name, and chat type.

In [this sandbox session](https://app.any.run/tasks/861482ae-8f96-41ff-918f-3a642c87db79/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=intercepting_malware_data&utm_term=250924&utm_content=linktoservice), we can see an example of a request to /sendMessage using the GET method, where the data is passed in the query string (url-encoded):
