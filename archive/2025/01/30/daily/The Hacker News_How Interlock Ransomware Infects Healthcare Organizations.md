Ransomware attacks have reached an unprecedented scale in the healthcare sector, exposing vulnerabilities that put millions at risk. Recently, UnitedHealth revealed that 190 million Americans had their personal and healthcare data stolen during the Change Healthcare ransomware attack, a figure that nearly doubles the previously disclosed total.

This breach shows just how deeply ransomware can infiltrate critical systems, leaving patient trust and care hanging in the balance.

One of the groups that targets this already fragile sector is the Interlock ransomware group. Known for their calculated and sophisticated attacks, they focus on hospitals, clinics, and other medical service providers.

## Interlock Ransomware Group: An Active Threat to Healthcare

The Interlock ransomware group is a relatively recent but dangerous player in the world of cybercrime, known for employing double-extortion tactics.

This method involves encrypting a victim's data to disrupt operations and threatens to leak sensitive information if ransom demands are not met. Their primary motivation is financial gain, and their methods are tailored to maximize pressure on their targets.

### Notable characteristics

1. **Sophistication**: The group uses advanced techniques like phishing, fake software updates, and malicious websites to gain initial access.
2. **Persistence**: Their ability to remain undetected for long periods amplifies the damage they can cause.
3. **Rapid deployment**: Once inside a network, they quickly move laterally, stealing sensitive data and preparing systems for encryption.
4. **Tailored ransom demands**: The group carefully assesses the value of the stolen data to set ransom amounts that victims are likely to pay.

### Recent Targets by Interlock Ransomware Group

In late 2024, Interlock targeted multiple healthcare organizations in the United States, exposing sensitive patient information and severely disrupting operations. Victims included:

* **Brockton Neighborhood Health Center**: Breached in October 2024, with the attack remaining undetected for nearly two months.
* **Legacy Treatment Services**: Detected in late October 2024.
* **Drug and Alcohol Treatment Service**: Compromised data uncovered in the same period.

## Interlock Ransomware Group Attack Chain

The Interlock ransomware group begins its attack with a strategic and highly deceptive method known as a Drive-by Compromise. This technique allows the group to gain initial access to targeted systems by exploiting unsuspecting users, often through carefully designed phishing websites.

### Initial Attack of the Ransomware

The attack starts when the Interlock group either compromises an existing legitimate website or registers a new phishing domain. These sites are carefully crafted to appear trustworthy, mimicking credible platforms like news portals or software download pages. The sites often contain links to download fake updates or tools, which, when executed, infect the user's device with malicious software.

**Example:** ANY.RUN's interactive sandbox detected a domain flagged as part of Interlock's activity, apple-online.shop. The latter was designed to trick users into downloading malware disguised as legitimate software.

This tactic effectively bypasses the initial layer of user suspicion, but with early detection and analysis, SOC teams can quickly identify malicious domains, block access, and respond faster to emerging threats, reducing the potential impact on business operations.

### Execution: How Interlock Gains Control

Once the Interlock ransomware group breaches initial defenses, the Execution phase begins. At this stage, attackers deploy malicious payloads or execute harmful commands on compromised devices, setting the stage for full control over the victim's network.

Interlock ransomware often disguises its malicious tools as legitimate software updates to deceive users. Victims unknowingly launch fake updaters, such as those mimicking Chrome, MSTeams, or Microsoft Edge installers, thinking they are performing routine maintenance. Instead, these downloads activate Remote Access Tools (RATs), which grant attackers full access to the infected system.

Inside ANY.RUN's sandbox session, one of the updaters, **upd\_8816295.exe**, is clearly identified within the process tree on the right-hand side, showing its malicious behavior and execution flow.
