This week, I had the pleasure of joining Alan Quayle on the TADSummit Innovators Podcast to review the last six months of VoIP and WebRTC security news. We delved into some of the most intriguing trends emerging in the RTC security space.

We covered the following RTC security trends for 2024 so far:

1. Increasing focus on WebRTC vulnerabilities and security
2. Growing concern over VoIP and conferencing platform security
3. Emerging threats from AI and machine learning in audio manipulation
4. Growing importance of resilience in communication systems
5. SMS/Voice 2FA is hugely problematic

Here are the top 10 insights that emerged from our discussion:

1. Specialized knowledge in WebRTC and VoIP security is crucial for addressing niche vulnerabilities.
2. AI can scale attacks on VoIP systems, making them more dangerous.
3. The resilience of communication technologies is critical for maintaining security during crises.
4. Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for cybersecurity in the face of evolving threats.
5. Reliance on outdated security practices exposes modern communication systems to greater risks.
6. The RTC Security Newsletter is essential reading for telecom and IP communications professionals.
7. Denial of service attacks remain a major threat to real-time communications.
8. Two-factor authentication via SMS and voice calls is insecure and outdated.
9. The industry needs more security testers with expertise in VoIP and WebRTC.
10. Regular pen testing is critical to identify and fix vulnerabilities in VoIP and WebRTC systems.
