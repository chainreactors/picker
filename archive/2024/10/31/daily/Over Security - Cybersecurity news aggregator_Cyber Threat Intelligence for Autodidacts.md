## **Introduction**

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts come from diverse
backgrounds, and their roles can vary a lot depending on the type of
organisation they work for. The path to becoming a CTI analyst can follow one
of several routes, such as moving from Security Operations Center (SOC) and
other information security roles, joining from university, or from law
enforcement or military backgrounds. I’ve also met many who have radically changed
trades and reskilled from jobs such as secondary school teachers to bar and hotel
staff with great success.

CTI teams can also vary significantly in their structure and
focus. Some analysts work for vendors, providing intelligence to multiple
clients across industries like, for example, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group.
Others serve as defenders within a single company, working to protect that
organization’s assets like, for example Equinix’s ETAC team. There are analysts
who operate within government agencies as well, such as intelligence, security,
or law enforcement bodies, often focusing on national security or large-scale
cyber threats.

I should also highlight that all these resources have either
been created by myself or with the help of colleagues from Curated Intel, or
are collections created by me that I personally vouch for as I saved them to be used for my
job over the last five years.

Also, if you’re short on time, you can now listen to this blog as a podcast via [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VrBlU5jI0LM?si=mUHCI-6ToeuyBTqy), which I generated using Google’s NotebookLM.

### Starting Out

When starting out in CTI, it’s essential to become familiar
with key frameworks and resources that shape the field. At the core is the
Intelligence Lifecycle, a process that involves planning, data collection,
processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback. Another core concept are the
three levels of intelligence: strategic, operational, and tactical.
Understanding analysis frameworks like the Diamond Model, MITRE ATT&CK, the
Cyber Kill Chain, and the Pyramid of Pain, as well as landmark case studies like
the APT1 report are critical for grasping how adversaries operate and how CTI
can counter their tactics.

## Adversaries

Understanding the broad array of adversaries may seem like a
daunting challenge for new CTI analysts. This due to the plethora of threat
groups and campaigns, from state-sponsored adversaries belonging to “The Big 4”
(Russia, China, North Korea, Iran), to thousands of hacktivist groups, to
hundreds of ransomware gangs, and the broader cybercrime underground. Getting a
handle on all of these types of cyber threats is a huge undertaking. Hopefully
some of the resources below will help new analysts get started on this mammoth
task, but it should highlight why CTI analysts are always constantly
learning.

## Requests For Information (RFIs)

Responding to Requests for Information (RFIs) is a crucial
aspect of a CTI team’s function. RFIs typically come from internal
stakeholders, such as security, executive teams, or external partners, who need
in-depth analysis on specific threats or incidents. CTI analysts should answer
RFIs by conducting their own research and produce clear, actionable reports
that detail their findings, and their assessment of the potential impact on the
organisation.

## Threat Actor Profiles

Creating detailed threat actor profiles is a key part of a
CTI analyst’s job. These profiles help organisations understand an adversary’s
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) as well as who their victims are,
their motivations, and their potential origin. By compiling data on malicious
cyber adversaries, such as their preferred tools, infrastructure, and methods,
CTI analysts can provide valuable insights that enable proactive defenses
against future threats. Threat actor profiles can also serve as a valuable
resource for internal teams and leadership to prioritise risk management.
