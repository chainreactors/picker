# Is Opencode as Smart as Claude Code?

Why Claude Code's secret sauce might not be so secret after all

I want to answer the question of how good OpenCode is compared to Claude Code.

I've been traveling under the assumption that Claude Code is so good because it's doing some secret magic around orchestration and kind of like piping and wiring and plumbing. And it's got some magic sauce in terms of like not losing the plot. And it's not just the model itself, but it's how it keeps the whole story together, right?

Claude Code's superpower seemed to be keeping the whole story together.

And I feel like that's kind of been its advantage even above something like Cursor, which is also super smart and also has access to the same models, but maybe isn't quite as good as Claude Code. And that's why Claude Code has been so popular.

But I've been using Opencode, and I'm wondering if it can keep the plot as well as CC.

What I'm realizing is that maybe Claude Code's secret sauce isn't so secret after all. Maybe it's just really good engineering around context windows, memory management, and keeping track of what you're trying to accomplish across multiple files and multiple steps.

Because OC seems awfully good at doing exactly the same thing.

And if that's the case, then other tools catch up pretty quickly by implementing similar orchestration strategies.

This is actually really exciting because it means we're going to see a lot more competition in this space. And competition is good for users because it means better tools, more features, and just more innovation overall.

## The experiment [​](#the-experiment)

What I did in this video was try to do a very complex workflow where I basically wrote a new blog from scratch using just open code, and you'll see in the video what the result was.

Spoiler: OC is just as good as CC—at least for this task.

#### Notes

1. July 20, 2025—My biggest problems right now with open code are that you can't copy/paste from the conversation, and you can't queue up requests. They will hopefully fix these very quickly.
