# Welcoming The Next Generation of Programmers

written on July 20, 2025

*This post is addressed to the Python community, one I am glad to be a member of.*

I’m product of my community. A decade ago I [wrote about how much I owed the
Python community](/2014/2/13/programming-communities/). Recently I found
myself reminiscing again. This year at EuroPython I even gave a brief lightning
talk recalling my time in the community — it made me tear up a little.

There were two reasons for this trip down memory lane. First, I had the
opportunity to be part of the [new Python
documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqBqdNIPrbo), which brought back a
flood of memories (good and bad). Second, I’ve found myself accidentally
pulled towards agentic coding and vibe coders[1](#fn-1). Over the last month and a half
I have spoken with so many people on AI and programming and realized that a
growing number of them are people I might not, in the past, have described as
“programmers.” Even on the way to the conference I had the pleasure to engage
in a multi-hour discussion on the train with an air traffic controller who
ventured into programming because of ChatGPT to make his life easier.

I’m not sure where I first heard it, but I like the idea that you are what you
do. If you’re painting (even your very first painting) you are a painter.
Consequently if you create a program, by hand or with the aid of an agent, you
are a programmer. Many people become programmers essentially overnight by
picking up one of these tools.

Heading to EuroPython this year I worried that the community that shaped me
might not be receptive to AI and agentic programming. Some of that fear felt
warranted: over the last year I saw a number of dismissive posts in my circles
about using AI for programming. Yet I have also come to realize that acceptance
of AI has shifted significantly. More importantly there is pretty wide support
of the notion that newcomers will and should be writing AI-generated code.

That matters, because my view is that AI will not lead to *fewer* programmers.
In fact, the opposite seems likely. AI will bring more people into programming
than anything else we have done in the last decade.

For the Python community in particular, this is a moment to reflect. Python has
demonstrated its inclusivity repeatedly — think of how many people have become
successful software engineers through outreach programs (like
[PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/)) and community support. I myself can credit
much of my early carreer from learning from others on the Python IRC channels.

We need to pay close attention to vibe coding. And that not because it might
produce lower‑quality code, but because if we don’t intentionally welcome the
next generation learning through these tools, they will miss out on important
lessons many of us learned the hard way. It would be a mistake to treat them
as outcasts or “not real” programmers. Remember that many of our first
programs did not have functions, were a mess of GOTO and things copy/pasted
together.

Every day someone becomes a programmer because they figured out how to make
ChatGPT build something. Lucky for us: in many of those cases the AI picks
Python. We should treat this as an opportunity and anticipate an expansion in
the kinds of people who might want to attend a Python conference. Yet many of
these new programmers are not even aware that programming communities and
conferences exist. It’s in the Python community’s interest to find ways to
pull them in.

Consider this: I can name the person who brought me into Python. But if you
were brought in via ChatGPT or a programming agent, there may be no human there
— just the AI. That lack of human connection is, I think, the biggest
downside. So we will need to compensate: to reach out, to mentor, to create
on‑ramps. To instil the idea that you should be looking for a community,
because the AI won’t do that. We need to turn a solitary interaction with an
AI into a shared journey with a community, and to move them towards learning
the important lessons about engineering. We do not want to have a generation
of developers held captive by a companies building vibe-coding tools with
little incentive for their users to break from those shackles.

1. I’m using [vibe coders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) here
   as people that give in to having the machine program for them. I believe
   that many programmers will start in this way before they transition to more
   traditional software engineering.[↩](#fnref-1)
