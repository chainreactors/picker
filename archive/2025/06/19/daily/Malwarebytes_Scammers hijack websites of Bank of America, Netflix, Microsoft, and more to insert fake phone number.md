# Scammers hijack websites of Bank of America, Netflix, Microsoft, and more to insert fake phone number

Posted: June 18, 2025

*The examples in this post are actual fraud attempts found by Malwarebytes Senior Director of Research, Jérôme Segura.*

Cybercriminals frequently use fake search engine listings to take advantage of our trust in popular brands, and then scam us. It often starts, as with so many attacks, with a sponsored search result on Google.

In the latest example of this type of scam, we found tech support scammers hijacking the results of people looking for 24/7 support for Apple, Bank of America, Facebook, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, and PayPal.

![sponsored search result for Netflix](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/sponsored.png)

Here’s how it works: [Cybercriminals pay for a sponsored ad](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/05/tired-of-google-sponsored-ads-so-are-we-thats-why-were-introducing-the-option-to-block-them-on-ios) on Google pretending to be a major brand. Often, this ad leads people to a fake website. However, in the cases we recently found, the visitor is taken to the legitimate site with a small difference.

Visitors are taken to the help/support section of the brand’s website, but instead of the genuine phone number, the hijackers display their scammy number instead.

The browser address bar will show that of the legitimate site and so there’s no reason for suspicion. However, the information the visitor sees will be misleading, because the search results have been poisoned to display the scammer’s number prominently in what looks like an official search result.

Once the number is called, the scammers will pose as the brand with the aim of getting their victim to hand over personal data or card details, or even allow remote access to their computer. In the case of Bank of America or PayPal, the scammers want access to their victim’s financial account so they can empty it of money.

A technically more correct name for this type of attack would be a search parameter injection attack, because the scammer has crafted a malicious URL that embeds their own fake phone number into the genuine site’s legitimate search functionality.

See the below example on Netflix:

![Netflix Help Center with scammer's number](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/netflix.jpg)

These tactics are very effective because:

* Users see the legitimate Netflix URL in their address bar
* The page layout looks authentic (again, because it is the real Netflix site)
* The fake number appears in what looks like a search result, making it seem official.

This is able to happen because Netflix’s search functionality blindly reflects whatever users put in the search query parameter without proper sanitization or validation. This creates a reflected input vulnerability that scammers can [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits).

Fortunately, Malwarebytes Browser Guard caught this and shows a warning about “[Search Hijacking Detected](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/05/take-back-control-of-your-browsermalwarebytes-browser-guard-will-now-block-search-hijacking-attempts),” and explains that unauthorized changes were made to search results with an overlaid phone number.

But Netflix ...
