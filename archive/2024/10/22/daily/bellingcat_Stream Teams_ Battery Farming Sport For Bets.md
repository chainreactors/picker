**One of the world’s most controversial bookmakers takes bets on thousands of amateur sports events live-streamed to its website. The locations of the games are a secret. Bellingcat has geolocated sites in three countries where these matches are played.**

In a curtained-off gymnasium six men play football for
“Arsenal” and “Real”.

There are no spectators in the unnamed complex and no
referee can be seen on the sidelines.

A single camera shoots the game from one end of the pitch,
a grainy recording more consistent with security footage
than a sports broadcast.

With 32 seconds left on the clock, “Real” scores the winning
goal.

No one celebrates.

Off-screen the young men change uniforms. Then they reappear, representing different teams, and do it all over again. The scene is replicated on the other side of the sport hall’s divider curtains. “Barcelona” beats “Man City”, “Chelsea” loses to “Tottenham”.

In the final minutes of a 4:30am match, the goalkeeper for “Amsterdam” walks into an adjacent game to retrieve his stray ball. The schedule is relentless. Players compete in back-to-back football matches that run day and night.

The games have one thing in common: they are all live-streamed to the website of 1xBet, a Cyprus-based bookmaker that is licensed in the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.

The locations of the games streamed to 1xBet are never disclosed by organisers, but Bellingcat has identified sports venues across Russia, Ukraine and Belarus that host these amateur tournaments. This investigation has also found that the gaming operation allowed punters to gamble on a game in which children as young as 14 were competing.

## Odds on 1xBet

A controversial name in gambling, 1xBet is blacklisted in several countries but remains [one of the largest](https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/1xbet-achtergrond?share=OkEwi641HD6HSLBUkFei0JcDBA1vD9xWi%2FRYYyGysor589ml%2FCDZIX9%2BL6uetLs%3D) online casinos in the world, with a reported turnover of billions of dollars.

In 2020 Russian authorities issued an [international arrest warrant](https://www.forbes.ru/biznes/437563-reydery-goskorporaciya-chechenskiy-avtoritet-s-kem-stolknulsya-predpolagaemyy) for its three founders, Dmitry Kazorin, Roman Semiokhin and Sergey Karshkov. Investigators said in 2021 that the [company made more than 63 billion rubles](https://bryansk.sledcom.ru/news/item/1606585) (US$655 million) in illegal gambling activities.

1xBet is prohibited from operating in Russia, was suspended in the UK, and has faced a criminal complaint in Morocco. Its parent company, 1XCorp N.V., was declared bankrupt in the Netherlands after failing to pay out on bets, and last year was put on Ukraine’s sanctions list over its ties to Russia.

Premier League clubs Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur severed their deals with the bookmaker after a 2019 investigation by [The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/premier-league-clubs-accused-over-links-with-betting-firm-sdvw0nwfp?region=global) found that it had accepted bets on cockfighting and promoted a “pornhub” casino.

But despite its numerous controversies, 1xBet has maintained partnerships with other professional clubs. It remains a sponsor of [Paris Saint-Germain FC](https://en.psg.fr/teams/club/content/paris-saint-germain-welcomes-1xbet-as-new-regional-parter-campaign-psg) and earlier this year [renewed its deal with FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/4045810/1xbet-renews-partnership-with-fc-barcelona), making it the club’s official betting partner until 2029.

We asked both teams about their partnerships with 1xBet. FC Barcelona declined to comment. Paris Saint-Germain FC did not respond to questions.

## Industrial Scale Games

Far away from the splendour of Camp Nou and Parc des Princes, visitors to 1xBet’s website can punt on a continuous stream of non-professional football matches. One of the most prominent sports on offer is “short football”. Similar to futsal, it involves two, three, four and five-a-side amateur teams playing 10 or 12 minute games on small pitches.

Critics have described amateur bookmaker leagues as a scourge on sport. Viktor Kravchenko, a Russian football blogger, said in a 2021 [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSJWaVkt_xc/) that young footballers were recruited to play in shifts and claimed games were fixed.

Josimar has [published an account](https://josimarfootball.com/2024/10/18/childs-play/) from a young man who said he was paid in cash to work from 9am to 2pm playing football that was live-streamed to 1xBet.

A Bellingcat analysis of 1xBet’s website found that 1,297 games of short football were live-streamed during a 24 hour period in September. By comparison the Bundesliga, Premier League and La Liga play a combined 1,066 league games per season. Should these figures be indicative of 1xBet’s daily output, the number of amateur football matches broadcast to the gambling site each year would be almost half a million.

And the model has been replicated on an industrial scale. 1xBet streams videos from various locations hosting other non-professional tournaments ranging from basketball, volleyball and floorball to ice hockey, tennis, table tennis. Games are played in marquee warehouses and converted arenas that look like sets fr...
