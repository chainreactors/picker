# Wazuh – Open Source Security Platform for Threat Detection, Visibility & Compliance

May 16, 2025

As threat surfaces grow and attack sophistication increases, many security teams face the same dilemma: they want visibility but don’t want vendor lock-in or cloud pricing that scales like ransomware.

A free and open-source security platform with SIEM and XDR-like capabilities, Wazuh is fast becoming the go-to choice for deep host monitoring, compliance frameworks, and a unified dashboard, without sacrificing control.

## What is Wazuh?

Wazuh is an open-source platform for security monitoring, log analysis, intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring (FIM), vulnerability assessment, and incident response.

While it began as an OSSEC fork, today it has evolved into a full-featured security analytics platform. It supports:

* Real-time monitoring of Linux, Windows, macOS endpoints
* Detection of malware, rootkits, and file changes
* Threat intelligence ingestion and alert correlation
* Cloud monitoring (AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Compliance automation (PCI, HIPAA, NIST, GDPR)

It’s essentially a modular SIEM + HIDS + compliance suite—without the licensing bill.

## Key Features

### Host-based Intrusion Detection (HIDS)

Monitors endpoints for unusual behaviour, unauthorised file changes, suspicious binaries, and privilege escalation.

### Log Analysis & Event Correlation

Ingests logs from syslog, journald, cloud APIs, and custom apps. Built-in rules identify known attack patterns and suspicious activity.

### File Integrity Monitoring

Tracks changes to critical system files, binaries, and configs with support for real-time notifications and baseline comparisons.

### Vulnerability Detection

Correlates software versions with OVAL feeds and CVEs to flag known vulnerabilities on endpoints.

### Threat Intelligence Integration

Supports STIX/TAXII feeds and third-party threat sources for enrichment and correlation.

### Compliance Auditing

Out-of-the-box policy checks for:

* PCI-DSS
* HIPAA
* NIST 800-53
* GDPR
* TSC/ISO 27001

### Cloud & Container Support

Monitors Docker, Kubernetes, and public cloud activity, including misconfigurations, policy violations, and unauthorised actions.

### Visual Dashboards

Kibana-based dashboards provide real-time insight into alerts, agent status, attack surface exposure, and compliance drift.

---

## Architecture Overview

Wazuh follows a modular architecture:

* **Agents** run on endpoints, collecting logs and monitoring behaviour.
* **Manager** processes data, applies rules, and triggers alerts.
* **Indexing Layer** (usually Elasticsearch) stores events.
* **Dashboard** (via Kibana) presents interactive views for triage and investigation.

Optional: Active response modules can trigger scripts, firewall rules, or integrations when specific conditions are met.

## Why Use Wazuh?

* Open-source and fully auditable
* Strong documentation and community
* Active development (monthly releases)
* No vendor lock-in
* Lightweight agent, scalable backend
* Built-in compliance and CVE coverage

## Final Thoughts

Wazuh is more than a HIDS—it’s a modular, open-source security platform that provides many of the capabilities of commercial XDR tools without the lock-in or price tag.

Suppose you’re looking for deeper endpoint visibility, security telemetry, or compliance monitoring without handing your logs to a third party. In that case, this is one of the most mature and well-supported options.
