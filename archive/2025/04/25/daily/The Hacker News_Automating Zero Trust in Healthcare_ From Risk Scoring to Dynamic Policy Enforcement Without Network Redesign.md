## **The Evolving Healthcare Cybersecurity Landscape**

Healthcare organizations face unprecedented cybersecurity challenges in 2025. With operational technology (OT) environments increasingly targeted and the convergence of IT and medical systems creating an expanded attack surface, traditional security approaches are proving inadequate. According to recent statistics, the healthcare sector experienced a record-breaking year for data breaches in 2024, with over 133 million patient records exposed. The average cost of a healthcare data breach has now reached $11 million, making it the most expensive industry for breaches.

What's changed dramatically is the focus of attackers. No longer content with merely extracting patient records, cybercriminals are now targeting the actual devices that deliver patient care. The stakes have never been higher, with ransomware now representing 71% of all attacks against healthcare organizations and causing an average downtime of 11 days per incident.

## **New Regulatory Frameworks Demand Enhanced Security Controls**

Healthcare organizations now face stricter regulatory requirements that specifically mandate network segmentation. The updated [HIPAA Security Rule](https://elisity.co/3Y40JUT), published in December 2024 and expected to be implemented shortly, has eliminated the distinction between "addressable" and "required" implementation specifications. All security measures, including network segmentation, will become mandatory requirements rather than optional considerations.

Under section 45 CFR 164.312(a)(2)(vi), healthcare organizations must now implement technical controls to segment their electronic information systems in a "reasonable and appropriate manner." This means creating clear boundaries between operational and IT networks to reduce risks from threats like phishing attacks and prevent lateral movement within networks.

Similarly, HHS 405(d) guidelines now provide voluntary cybersecurity practices that specifically recommend network segmentation and access controls to limit exposure and protect critical systems and data. These regulations reflect the growing recognition that in today's interconnected healthcare environment, basic security measures are no longer optional but essential for protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

## **Bridging the Gap Between IT Security and Medical Device Teams**

One of the most significant challenges in healthcare security is the traditional divide between IT security teams and clinical engineering/biomedical teams responsible for medical devices. Each group operates with different priorities, expertise, and operational workflows:

IT security teams focus on vulnerability management, security policy enforcement, and compliance reporting, while clinical engineering teams prioritize device functionality, patient safety, and medical equipment uptime.

This divide creates blind spots in the security posture of healthcare organizations. Clinical devices often run proprietary or legacy operating systems that cannot support traditional security agents. Meanwhile, biomedical teams maintain separate inventory systems that don't communicate with IT security platforms, creating visibility gaps for unmanaged devices.

Aaron Weismann, Chief Information Security Officer at Main Line Health, describes this challenge: "We have a very difficult time handling non-traditional compute because of not having tooling specifically designed to address and manage those devices. So Elisity really provides a layer of defense and threat mitigation that we wouldn't otherwise have in our environment."

## **The Integrated Elisity and Armis Solution: A Comprehensive Approach**

The integration between Armis Centrix™ and Elisity's [microsegmentation](https://elisity.co/4ilrxXK) platform creates a powerful security framework that addresses these challenges head-on. By combining comprehensive asset intelligence with Elisity's dynamic microsegmentation capabilities, healthcare organizations can achieve true zero-trust architecture while maintaining operational efficiency.

### **Comprehensive Asset Discovery and Intelligence**

The integrated solution provides unmatched visibility across all connected devices—managed, unmanaged, medical, and IoT—without requiring agents or disruptive scanning. Leveraging an Asset Intelligence Engine containing knowledge of over 5 billion devices, the solution automatically discovers and classifies every device on the network, including those that traditional security tools miss.

The platform detects and profiles devices ranging from infusion pumps and MRI machines to building systems like HVAC units—anything connected to the network. For each device, the solution identifies critical information such as make, model, operating system, location, connections, FDA classification, and risk factors.

As Weismann notes, "Armis and Elisity have really been able to drive more robust understanding of our security posture and how we're implementing policies across the board."

### **Identity-Based Microsegmentation**

Elisity delivers identity-based microsegmentation through its cloud-delivered policy management platform, working with existing network infrastructure without requiring new hardware, agents, VLANs, or complex ACLs. The seamless integration enhances the Elisity IdentityGraph™, a comprehensive device, ...
