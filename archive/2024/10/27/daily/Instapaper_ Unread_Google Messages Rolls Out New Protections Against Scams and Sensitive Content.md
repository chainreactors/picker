Google is bolstering the [security](https://securityonline.info/CVE-WATCHTOWER) of its Messages app with a suite of new features designed to combat scams, warn about dangerous links, and give users more control over sensitive content.

As Google [states](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/5-new-protections-on-google-messages.html) in their [security](https://securityonline.info/CVE-WATCHTOWER) blog, ‚Äú*We‚Äôre committed to constantly developing new controls and features to make your conversations on Google Messages even more secure and private*.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key enhancements:

**Fighting the Rise of Scams:**

* **Enhanced Scam Detection:** Google Messages is getting smarter at identifying scam texts, particularly those related to package deliveries and job offers. ‚Äú[We‚Äôre] *rolling out enhanced scam detection, with improved analysis of scammy texts, starting with a focus on package delivery and job seeking messages*,‚Äù says Google. This feature leverages on-device machine learning to analyze messages and flag potential scams without compromising user privacy.
* **Blocking International Spam:** To combat spam originating from international numbers, Google Messages will soon allow users to automatically filter messages from unknown international senders. This feature will initially be piloted in Singapore before a wider rollout.

**Protecting Users from Dangerous Links:**

* **Intelligent Warnings:** Google Messages is expanding its system for warning users about potentially harmful links received from unknown senders. This feature, already active in some regions, will be rolled out globally later this year.

**Empowering Users with Content Control:**

* **Sensitive Content Warnings:** This optional feature allows users to blur images that may contain nudity before viewing them. It provides a ‚Äúspeed bump‚Äù with resources and options, including the choice to view the content. This functionality is designed to prevent accidental sharing and raise awareness about the risks associated with sending nude imagery. Importantly, Google emphasizes that ‚Äúall of this happens on-device to protect your privacy.‚Äù

**Ensuring You‚Äôre Talking to the Right Person:**

* **Contact Verification:** To combat impersonation attempts, Google is adding a contact verifying feature that allows users to confirm the identity of the person they are messaging by verifying their public keys. This feature will launch next year and will work across different apps.

These new features build on Google Messages‚Äô existing security measures, which already protect users from billions of suspicious messages every month. By combining AI-powered filters, end-to-end encryption, and user-friendly controls, Google is making significant strides in creating a safer and more private messaging experience.
