Cybersecurity today moves at the pace of global politics. A single breach can ripple across supply chains, turn a software flaw into leverage, or shift who holds the upper hand. For leaders, this means defense isn't just a matter of firewalls and patches‚Äîit's about strategy. The strongest organizations aren't the ones with the most tools, but the ones that see how cyber risks connect to business, trust, and power.

This week's stories highlight how technical gaps become real-world pressure points‚Äîand why security decisions now matter far beyond IT.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**[Popular Password Managers Affected by Clickjacking](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/dom-based-extension-clickjacking.html)** ‚Äî Popular password manager plugins for web browsers have been found susceptible to clickjacking security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to steal account credentials, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and credit card details under certain conditions. The technique has been dubbed Document Object Model (DOM)-based extension clickjacking by independent security researcher Marek T√≥th, who presented the findings at the DEF CON 33 security conference earlier this month. As of August 22, fixes have been released by Bitwarden, Dashlane, Enpass, KeePassXC-Browser, Keeper, LastPass, NordPass, ProtonPass, and RoboForm.

## **üîî Top News**

* **[Russian Hackers Go After Old Cisco Flaw](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/apple-patches-cve-2025-43300-zero-day.html)** ‚Äî Hackers linked to Russia are exploiting a seven-year-old vulnerability in unpatched end-of-life Cisco networking devices (CVE-2018-0171) to target enterprise and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S. and abroad. Over the past year, the threat actor, which Cisco is tracking as Static Tundra, has collected configuration files from thousands of networking devices used by US organizations in critical infrastructure sectors. On some vulnerable devices, the attackers changed the configuration settings to give themselves unauthorized access to the network. The attackers then used that access to explore the networks, looking specifically at protocols and applications that are commonly used in industrial systems. Cisco identified Static Tundra as primarily targeting organizations of strategic interest to the Kremlin, spanning the manufacturing, telecommunications, and higher education sectors across the globe. Once the threat actor gains access to a system of interest, they have been found to use stolen SNMP credentials to quietly control the compromised devices, letting them run commands, change settings, and steal configurations, all while hiding their activity from security controls. Static Tundra has also altered the configuration of compromised devices to create new local user accounts and enable remote access services like Telnet, granting them additional ways to regain access to the device if their initial communication mechanism is closed. Also used by the group is a backdoor called SYNful Knock to stay connected to infected devices and give a hidden foothold that survives reboots.
* **[Apple Fixes Actively Exploited 0-Day](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/apple-patches-cve-2025-43300-zero-day.html)** ‚Äî Apple released security fixes to fix a high-severity flaw in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that it said has come under active exploitation in the wild. The zero-day is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability affecting the ImageIO framework. Tracked as CVE-2025-43300 (CVSS score: 8.8), the issue could result in memory corruption when processing a malicious image. The iPhone maker said the bug was internally discovered and that it was addressed with improved bounds checking. The company provided no further technical details of the vulnerability or insights into the exploitation activity beyond characterizing the cyber attacks as sophisticated and highly targeted. The tech giant began using such terminology starting this year, presumably to signify nation-state threats and spyware activity.
* **[Murky Panda Abuses Trusted Relationships to Breach Cloud Environments](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/chinese-hackers-murky-genesis-and.html)** ‚Äî The threat actor known as Murky Panda (aka Silk Typhoon) has been observed abusing trusted relationships in the cloud to hack enterprise networks. The attacks leverage N-day and zero-day vulnerabilities to drop web shells and a Golang malware called CloudedHope to facilitate remote access. A notable aspect of Murky Panda's tradecraft concerns the abuse of trusted relationships between partner organizations and their cloud tenants, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to breach software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers' cloud environments and conduct lateral movement to downstream victims.
