Lazarus Group Attacks in 2025: Here’s Everything SOC Teams Need to Know

The Lazarus Group, North Korea’s state-sponsored hacking collective, has held the title of the most notorious advanced persistent threat (APT) for almost two decades now. In 2025, it escalated its cyber operations, targeting tech industries with fake IT workers, fraudulent job interviews, and hijacked open-source software.

It’s time to take a closer look at its current activities and see how SOC teams can proactively detect and track the group attacks using [ANY.RUN’s solutions](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=lazarus_attacks_25&utm_term=100925&utm_content=linktolanding).

## Biggest Lazarus Group Campaigns So Far

Lazarus’s 2025 campaigns combine sophisticated social engineering and supply chain attacks, posing severe risks to businesses’ financial stability, data security, and operational continuity.

### North Korean IT Workers

Since 2024, Lazarus Group has been deploying North Korean operatives posing as legitimate remote IT workers to infiltrate companies, particularly in the U.S. and UK. Using stolen or AI-enhanced identities, these operatives secure tech roles to steal sensitive data, deploy malware, or generate illicit revenue for North Korea.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, these schemes compromised over 100 U.S. companies, including Fortune 500 firms. For example, an Atlanta-based blockchain company lost over [$900,000](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-coordinated-nationwide-actions-combat-north-korean-remote) in virtual currency due to insider access by fake IT workers.

Beyond financial losses, businesses face reputational damage, loss of intellectual property, and regulatory scrutiny for hiring vulnerabilities. Extortion attempts, where operatives hold stolen data hostage, further disrupt operations and erode customer trust.

To detect such attacks early, SOC teams require a reliable solution for proactive analysis of suspicious files and URLs. [ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox](https://any.run/features/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=lazarus_attacks_25&utm_term=100925&utm_content=linktosandboxlanding) provides a fast, isolated, and hands-on way to expose malware and phishing in seconds.

### Operation 99: Fake Job Interviews (Contagious Interview)

Operation 99 (aka “Contagious Interview”) is a campaign from Lazarus and its subgroups like [Famous Chollima](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/pylangghost-malware-analysis/) that targets tech, crypto developers and CEOs, with fake job and partnership interviews.

Posing as [recruiters on LinkedIn](https://quetzal.bitso.com/p/interview-with-the-chollima), Telegram, or Calendly, Lazarus lures victims with fraudulent coding tests hosted on malicious GitLab repositories. As part of the scheme, Lazarus hackers utilize NPM packages.

For C-suite targets, criminals typically share fake Zoom executables and malware disguised as other software widely used in corporate environments.

The common losses for victims include stolen cryptocurrency and credentials, compromised systems, and disrupted operations. In some cases, device infections led to downstream supply chain attacks, affecting customers and partners. Crypto and tech firms rely on skilled developers, making them prime targets for social engineering. These attacks disrupt product development, expose proprietary code, and undermine trust in hiring processes, while recovery costs (e.g., system remediation, legal fees) s...
