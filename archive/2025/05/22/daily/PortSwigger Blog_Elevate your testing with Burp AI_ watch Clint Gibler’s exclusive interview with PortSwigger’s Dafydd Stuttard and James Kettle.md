### AI is transforming Application Security, and PortSwigger is leading the charge.

### In a [must-watch interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_tCNaQa-Qo), Clint Gibler - one of the leading voices in the AppSec industry - sat down with PortSwigger Founder Dafydd Stuttard and Director of Research James Kettle,  to uncover how Burp AI is changing the game for thousands of pentesters and security teams around the world.

## Watch Clint’s interview with Dafydd and James

## What’s Burp AI?

[Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/ai) is the first set of AI assistance features for [Burp Suite Professional](/burp/pro), designed to work alongside security professionals, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and insight - without replacing human expertise.

From reducing false positives to suggesting intelligent next steps during testing, Burp AI is designed to help security professionals work faster, smarter, and more effectively.

## Key talking points:

* Why the AppSec industry needs to embrace AI.
* How Burp AI enhances testing without compromising user privacy.
* Where AI truly adds value in the hands of expert testers.
* A behind-the-scenes look at PortSwigger’s R&D process.

World renowned security researcher James Kettle also shares two exclusive live demos:

* **Explore Issue**: James demonstrates how to use Burp AI to investigate potential leads on your behalf. In this example, Burp AI autonomously figures out how to leverage a potential [SQL injection](/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability to extract sensitive user data for a working PoC.
* **Shadow Repeater**:This AI-enhanced extension from PortSwigger researcher, Gareth Heyes, takes inspiration from the payloads you send in Repeater and intelligently attempts different permutations of them. This is a great example of the potential for human-driven AI features.

You'll also hear how users are already seeing real value, and what exciting features are on the horizon.
