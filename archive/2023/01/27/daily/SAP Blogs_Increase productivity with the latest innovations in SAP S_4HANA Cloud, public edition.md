*This blog has first been published on [SAP News](https://news.sap.com/2023/01/sap-s4hana-cloud-2302-innovations-increase-productivity/).*

With the 2302 update available in February, we are delivering new modern experiences, foundational capabilities, and core ERP innovations to improve organizational and employee productivity. Over the last year, we’ve been pleased to see an increase in user adoption and customer satisfaction, and we’re always looking for ways to make the product better based on customer and partner feedback.

## **Modern Experience**

We are taking collaboration and our user experience to the next level, enabling you to collaborate easily and make better decisions based on business data and processes. Some of the 2302 highlights include:

* The [Share as Tab](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2022/10/6008ff0f-4b7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) feature is released through an [Early Adopter Care program](https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3051). As the name suggests, your users can collaborate with their colleagues directly in Microsoft Teams by adding live data based on SAP Fiori Elements apps as tabs in their Teams channels.

* [Improved and additional card types for My Home](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/11/new-my-home-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-2208-deep-dive/), initially delivered with 2208, that orchestrate information, tasks, and applications and allow your users to do their daily activities more effectively and efficiently.

## **Core ERP Innovations**

We strive to enable you to get up and running with out-of-the-box business processes based on industry best practices. We are committed to expanding our set of ready-to-use capabilities needed to run your business.

Here are some of the 2302 highlights for product and manufacturing-centric industries:

* Innovations to enhance end-to-end process visibility and efficiency such as the [integration of SAP Configure, Price and Quote (CPQ) with solution order management](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=42F2E964F4E71EDA97D709D42DEA80E2&range=CURRENT-LAST#;INNO=000D3ABE772D1EDC82B4AC6D07E8BB67) to support business transformations from products to higher-margin services and solutions by offering combined quote and orders including products and service contracts.

* Increased flexibility, granularity, and ease in selecting the orders that are relevant to the user with a new [SAP Fiori app to set up an area of responsibility for a supervisor using production orders](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=67837800100800007389&range=CURRENT-LAST) that allows users to choose their area of responsibility with respect to the orders.

* With the new and modernized [manage material coverage app](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=67837800100800007389&range=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202022;INNO=000D3ABE796A1EECAB89A4DAF6B7DAD7), relevant data can be intuitively accessed with quick views and an additional column through a modernized look and feel and a flexible materials list.

And here are some highlights for finance and service-centric industries:

* Functionality to improve project planning and project resource management by providing [starter content for building forms to collect ESG data](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E919ED096400CC&PRODUCT=73554900100800000266&PRODUCT=73555000100800001012&range=FIRST-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAC9DD21EED8A8697525DB40062) to increase efficiency in building your own ESG (environmental, social, corporate governance) data collection forms by using sample forms as reference​.

* Increased flexibility in billing preparation through a released [OData API for the project billing request](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=67837800100800007389&range=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202020;INNO=000D3ABE772D1EDCB3EBD152B5484B02) to enable external applications and resource related billing processes.

* With the new [capacity evaluation app](https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E9186EE85B60CC&BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E91B6B24B240CC&BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E91B6B24DCA0CC&PRODUCT=67837800100800007389&range=2023Q1-2024Q4#;INNO=089E017A62AB1EDABBABBAD4FE6D80EB), flexible options for capacity analysis are provided, delivering insights about offered or available capacity within a flexibly defined timeframe, and about offered or available capacity, based on flexible aggregation options.
