# GoFileBinder

A builder üî® for binding evil program üòà and normal document üê£

[![image-20211130010534997](/inspiringz/GoFileBinder/raw/main/images/image-20211130010534997.png)](/inspiringz/GoFileBinder/blob/main/images/image-20211130010534997.png)

## Usage

Clone this repo and build GoFileBinder.go first, then start:

```
./GoFileBinder <evil_program> <bind_file> [x64/x86]
```

When the Output File is executed on the target machine, it will release your evil program to `C:\Users\Public\Music\`, and then self-delete after run normal file and evil program.
