# Weekly Update 450

03 May 2025

Looking back at this week's video, it's the AI discussion that I think about most. More specifically, the view amongst some that *any* usage of it is bad and every output is "slop". I'm hearing that much more broadly lately, that AI is both "robbing" creators and producing sub-par results. The latter is certainly true in many cases (although it's improving *extraordinarily* quickly), but the former is just ridiculous when used as a reason *not* to use AI. After doing this week's video, I saw press of [Satya saying that 30% of code in some Microsoft repositories is written by AI](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/30/microsoft_meta_autocoding/?ref=troyhunt.com); so, are developers in the same boat? Should we go back to writing more code by hand to keep us more employed? Maybe chuck out all the other efficiency tools we use too - IDEs give way to notepad.exe, and so on. It's kinda nuts.
