# Projects

The projects I'm actively working on

This is where I keep track of my active endeavors. Nothing fancy, just a list with a quick overview and a link to learn more.

Just like with [/ideas](/ideas/) and [/predictions](/predictions/), the main purpose here is to  encourage others into making a similar page of their own.

## Current Focus [​](#current-focus)

I do lots of stuff, but I'm primarily building applications and backend AI infrastructure that helps enable Human 3.0. I also advise companies on how best to become antifragile against this whole AI thing.

Here's a short list of the ones I think are most important right now.

## Additional detail on the projects [​](#additional-detail-on-the-projects)

Some additional context about the various efforts.

### Human 3.0 (`H3`) [​](#human-3-0-h3)

This is the umbrella project for many other projects below.

Human 3.0 is a framework for helping humans get ready for a world where AI has disrupted traditional corporate work.

It involves becoming an expressive, *full-spectrum* human who is constantly learning, creating, and interacting with others.

### Telos [​](#telos)

I was using documents like these in my consulting practice going back to 2009, but AI magnifies the power of the format exponentially.

Telos is a concept and structure for managing contextual information for things we care about, e.g., our personal lives, our family, an organization we're running, a team, a department, a company, or whatever.

The spiritual format for this is a single text document, known as a *Telos File*, but the format isn't as important as the concept of clear, deliberate capture of the various components.

The exact sections and how they're captured aren't as important as the exercise itself.

Key among those components are mission, goals, metrics, challenges, risks, ideas, team members, a journal, and many other sections.

### Threshold [​](#threshold)

This is the first commercial AI app I've launched.

Threshold is an app I built to solve a very simple and serious problem:

*There is too much content out there, and it's hard to know if it's worth your time before you actually waste your time on it.*

Here's [a screenshot](https://danielmiessler.com/images/threshold_ui.avif) of the interface. Threshold consumes thousands of high-quality sources and then rates them and summarizes them, \*\*allowing you to select the quality level threshold that a piece of content must meet\*\* before it's shown to you.

I literally built this because I needed it myself, and I use it every day.

→ [Threshold.app](https://threshold.app)

### Substrate [​](#substrate)

Substrate is an open-source framework for human understanding, meaning, and progress.

What does that mean? The purpose of the project is to make the things that matter to humans *more transparent, discussable, and ultimately—fixable*.

→ [Introducting Substrate](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/introducing-substrate)

### Daemon [​](#daemon)

This is the broadcast component of Human 3.0

Daemon is the API-ification system for people, objects, and organizations. It's the technology component that actually presents what an entity is about to the outside world.

Imagine a given Daemon having `/preferences`, `/ideas`, `/resume`, `/books`, etc., if it's for a person, and `/menu`, `/capacity`, and `/staff`, if it's for a restaurant.

### Beacon [​](#beacon)

I could use help from some uber engineers on this one because it's crucial that the architecture is designed well.

This one I'm just starting, and am actively thinking through implementation options.

Beacon is essentially an application / interface for processing activity being broadcasted by someone. So imagine all the books they're reading, the movies they're enjoying, mentions about their new favorite coffee shop, or favorite coffee recipe, etc.

All of this needs auth, of course.

It's essentially an activity feed for someone, which is automatically created as part of their *Daemon*, that allows me to **subscribe** to them as a source of connection, inspiration, etc.

### Unsupervised Learning [​](#unsupervised-learning)

Since 2015 I've been running a newsletter about security, tech, and society. Today it's still focused on the same things, but with a major orientation towards Human 3.0 that we just talked about. Basically, *how to upgrade ourselves to be ready for whatever comes next.*

→ [The Newsletter](https://newsletter.danielmiessler.com/)

→ [The Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unsupervised-learning/id1099711235)

The podcast gets thousands of downloads per week, the newsletter's at around 99,000 subscribers, and the YouTube channel is at over 600,000 subscribers.

### SamePage [​](#samepage)

It's already soft-launched otherwise I wouldn't be talking bout it.

After over 20 years of consulting with companies from seed to Fortune 5, I've seen one problem sink things more than any other:

**People being perpetually unclear about the mission and strategy.**

SamePage is a commercial product I'm launching in February 2025 that's focused on keeping companies, departments, and teams oriented in the same direction. It takes the methodologies I've been using for over 20 years in my consulting and combines that with AI to do even more.

### Fabric [​](#fabric)

Fabric was my answer to the AI situation in 2023, where there were a million different tools and million different prompts, with no easy way to manage them.

What we created is a crowd-sourced repository...
