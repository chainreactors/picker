##### The DORA regulation and the NIS2 directive approved by the EU raise cybersecurity requirements and increase the penalties for companies and management boards that fail to comply with the regulations

Cybersecurity is not a fad. On the contrary, it is an inescapable reality. Ransomware, phishing, smishing… The techniques used by criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and attacks are the order of the day. Nowadays, it is already strange not to receive, from time to time, an SMS or an email pretending to come from companies we trust the most, from our bank to a parcel delivery company to our electricity or Internet provider. In light of this threat-ridden scenario, the European Union [has just approved](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/11/28/digital-finance-council-adopts-digital-operational-resilience-act/) two regulatory packages that make it clear to medium and large companies and their managers that **ignoring cybersecurity will be very costly**.

**Following the approval of the DORA regulation**, which focuses on financial institutions, and the **NIS2 directive**, which affects companies in the EU’s strategic sectors, companies will have to redouble their efforts in designing, implementing and evaluating their **security strategies** and **contracting** [**cybersecurity services**](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-services/) to avoid incidents that could jeopardize their business model and the protection of their customers.

**Ignoring cybersecurity** will be costly not only because of the economic and reputational consequences associated with successful cyberattacks. But also because of the penalties and fines that the competent authorities may impose on companies and their managers who fail to comply with the requirements of the DORA regulation and the NIS2 directive.

In this article, we will address the **coercive measures to which tens of thousands of companies** throughout the European Union and the professionals who make up their management boards may be exposed. From now on, **ignoring cybersecurity will be very costly**, substantially affecting a company’s results and its managers’ careers.

## 1. DORA: Management boards of financial institutions are responsible for cybersecurity

The **DORA regulation** on the digital operational resilience of the financial sector, approved by the European Parliament and Council, aims to ensure that banks and other **financial institutions** have the tools and protocols to **withstand cyber-attacks**.

Suppose there are some particularly interesting players for criminals. In that case, it is undoubtedly financial institutions because they hold the economic resources of companies and citizens and have the most sensitive data at their disposal: financial data.

For this reason, initiatives have been launched within the EU to **secure the systems and assets of financial institutions**, such as the **ECB’s TIBER-EU program** or the DORA regulation.

### 1.1. Who is affected by DORA?

The provisions of the **DORA regulation** are mandatory for almost the entire financial sector. Unlike NIS2, which will be discussed later, this regulation applies to large and medium-sized companies and aims at small and micro-enterprises. However, the scope of the measures and rules is not the same. Hence, for example, the **digital operational resilience tests** to be performed by companies will be more demanding for large entities and less ambitious for smaller organizations.

The regulation stipulates the different classes of organizations that must comply with its provisions:

* Credit institutions, payment institutions, electronic money institutions and central counterparties.
* Investment services firms.
* Providers of account information, crypto assets and data provision services.
* Central securities depositories and central counterparties.
* Trading venues.
* Trade repositories.
* Alternative investment fund managers.
* Management companies.
* Insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as intermediaries in these areas.
* Occupational pension funds.
* Credit rating agencies.
* Managers of critical benchmark indexes.
* Providers of participative financing services.
* Securitization registries.

Beyond the financial sector, the DORA regulation also focuses on a key player in cybersecuri...
