Social engineering attacks have entered a new era—and they're coming fast, smart, and deeply personalized.

It's no longer just suspicious emails in your spam folder. Today's attackers use generative AI, stolen branding assets, and deepfake tools to mimic your executives, hijack your social channels, and create convincing fakes of your website, emails, and even voice. They don't just spoof—**they impersonate.**

Modern attackers aren't relying on chance. They're running long-term, multi-channel campaigns across email, LinkedIn, SMS, and even support portals—targeting your employees, customers, and partners.

Whether it's a fake recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn, a lookalike login page sent via text, or a cloned CFO demanding a wire transfer, the tactics are faster, more adaptive, and increasingly automated using AI.

The result? Even trained users are falling for sophisticated fakes—because they're not just phishing links anymore. They're operations.

### This Webinar Shows You How to Fight Back

[Join us for a deep dive](https://thehacker.news/defeating-digital-deception?source=article) into how **Doppel's real-time AI platform** detects and disrupts social engineering threats before they escalate.

You'll learn how AI can be used not just to spot suspicious signals, but to **understand attacker behavior**, track impersonation campaigns across platforms, and respond instantly—before reputational or financial damage occurs.

### What You'll Learn

* **The Modern Threat Landscape:** How AI-powered social engineering campaigns are evolving—and what that means for your current defenses.
* **Real-Time Defense:** How Doppel identifies impersonation attempts and shuts them down before users engage.
* **Shared Intelligence at Scale:** How learning from attacks across thousands of brands helps make deception unprofitable.

Impersonation attacks are scaling faster than any human team can monitor manually. Security awareness training isn't enough. Static detection rules fall short. You need a defense that thinks and adapts in real-time.

Doppel's AI learns from every attack attempt—so your protection keeps getting smarter.

**Who Should Attend:** Security leaders responsible for brand trust and executive protection, SOC teams overwhelmed by phishing and impersonation alerts, and risk, fraud, or threat intelligence professionals seeking faster, smarter signal-to-action.
