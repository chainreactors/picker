# How can I set up something that will automatically save media that is received by my browser? A local proxy MiTM that intercepts and saves things.

I am looking for a way to set up something that will automatically save things like pictures to my device.

For example, viewing a gallery of images and having all of the media my browser received saved to disk. Like "right click - save as" automatically on everything that my browser usually receives.

I could try to do this with a website cloner but that's invasive and unfriendly to the website. I don't want everything, just the media I intentionally view.

My idea was to use a local proxy to route all traffic through and have the proxy server take care of saving things like images that are being transmitted to my browser.

Maybe setting up a virtual machine and capturing traffic dumps to Wireshark for media extraction later on.

Wireshark, Burp, MiTM proxy, and httptoolkit are my first thoughts.

I need a little push in the right direction and I'm struggling with search engines. They all see "proxy" means "Free VPN", even using the minus (-vpn) search operator.
