I enjoyed being Chris Magistrado's guest on the [podcast.hackerstofounders.com](https://podcast.hackerstofounders.com). He
asked good questions, and his announcement is below:

New Episode Alert: "üò∑ Adam Shostack ‚Äì Co-Creator of the CVE System" üöÄ
I‚Äôm excited to share the latest episode of "Hackers to Founders" featuring the legendary Adam Shostack, the Co-Creator of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system. üéôÔ∏èüîê

In this compelling conversation, Adam delves into his transformative journey from a geeky childhood filled with D&D and Legos to becoming a pivotal figure in cybersecurity. He shares the story behind the creation of the CVE system, which has fundamentally reshaped how we identify and manage security vulnerabilities across the industry. Adam also discusses his influential roles in startups like Net Tech and Zero Knowledge Systems, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of building security-focused businesses in the early days of cybersecurity.

Beyond his technical expertise, Adam emphasizes the importance of education, training, and mentorship in advancing security practices. He explores his innovative work in cyber public health, aiming to apply public health methodologies to measure and mitigate cyber impacts effectively. Adam‚Äôs passion for making threat modeling accessible and his visionary approach to integrating interdisciplinary techniques underscore his commitment to enhancing global security.

üéß Listen to the episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXDCLf6HtlA&feature=youtu.be) and
Don‚Äôt miss out on Adam‚Äôs invaluable insights and inspiring story that
continue to shape the future of cybersecurity!
