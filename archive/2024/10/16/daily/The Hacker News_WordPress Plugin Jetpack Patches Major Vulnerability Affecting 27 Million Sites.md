[![WordPress Plugin Jetpack](data:image/png;base64... "WordPress Plugin Jetpack")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhp7Bz2cuHZ9XbvSfLsX-X1xcJ70sdzgVAPABkyTHApngZwvQJKFoZrJ0IVchpOPsRY8TVuvynkQWKDRFr-QqaoYGnMNw367dzZcsq8PL-eEO_wFbkfVa0F5ZiN9_F-aCsDPrQRabojCtiky9067N-I1Jk9vkf3TcbknmA35EKCFWYMKA11d7Q-OYQG5sRA/s790-rw-e365/jetpack.png)

The maintainers of the Jetpack WordPress plugin have released a security update to remediate a critical vulnerability that could allow logged-in users to access forms submitted by others on a site.

Jetpack, owned by WordPress maker Automattic, is an [all-in-one plugin](https://jetpack.com/about/) that offers a comprehensive suite of tools to improve site safety, performance, and traffic growth. It's used on 27 million WordPress sites, [according to its website](https://jetpack.com/newsroom/).

The issue is said to have been identified by Jetpack during an internal security audit and has persisted since version 3.9.9, released in 2016.

[![DFIR Retainer Services](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/cloud-insight-d)

The vulnerability resides in the Contact Form feature in Jetpack, and "could be used by any logged in users on a site to read forms submitted by visitors on the site," Jetpack's Jeremy Herve [said](https://jetpack.com/blog/jetpack-13-9-1-critical-security-update/).

Jetpack said it's worked closely with the WordPress.org Security Team to automatically update the plugin to a safe version on installed sites.

The shortcoming has been addressed in the following 101 different versions of Jetpack -

*13.9.1, 13.8.2, 13.7.1, 13.6.1, 13.5.1, 13.4.4, 13.3.2, 13.2.3, 13.1.4, 13.0.1, 12.9.4, 12.8.2, 12.7.2, 12.6.3, 12.5.1, 12.4.1, 12.3.1, 12.2.2, 12.1.2, 12.0.2, 11.9.3, 11.8.6, 11.7.3, 11.6.2, 11.5.3, 11.4.2, 11.3.4, 11.2.2, 11.1.4, 11.0.2, 10.9.3, 10.8.2, 10.7.2, 10.6.2, 10.5.3, 10.4.2, 10.3.2, 10.2.3, 10.1.2, 10.0.2, 9.9.3, 9.8.3, 9.7.3, 9.6.4, 9.5.5, 9.4.4, 9.3.5, 9.2.4, 9.1.3, 9.0.5, 8.9.4, 8.8.5, 8.7.4, 8.6.4, 8.5.3, 8.4.5, 8.3.3, 8.2.6, 8.1.4, 8.0.3, 7.9.4, 7.8.4, 7.7.6, 7.6.4, 7.5.7, 7.4.5, 7.3.5, 7.2.5, 7.1.5, 7.0.5, 6.9.4, 6.8.5, 6.7.4, 6.6.5, 6.5.4, 6.4.6, 6.3.7, 6.2.5, 6.1.5, 6.0.4, 5.9.4, 5.8.4, 5.7.5, 5.6.5, 5.5.5, 5.4.4, 5.3.4, 5.2.5, 5.1.4, 5.0.3, 4.9.3, 4.8.5, 4.7.4, 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.5, 4.3.5, 4.2.5, 4.1.4, 4.0.7, 3.9.10*

While there is no evidence that the vulnerability has ever been exploited in the wild, there is a likelihood that it could be abused going forward in light of public disclosure.

It's worth noting that Jetpack rolled out [similar fixes](https://thehackernews.com/2023/06/urgent-wordpress-update-fixes-critical.html) for another critical flaw in the Jetpack plugin in June 2023 that had been existing since November 2012.

The development comes amid an [ongoing](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/) [dispute](https://www.404media.co/wordpress-checkbox-login-wp-engine/) [between](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/10/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/) WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg and hosting provider WP Engine, with WordPress.org taking control of the latter's Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin to [create its own fork](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) called Secure Custom Fields.

"SCF has been updated to remove commercial upsells and fix a security problem," Mullenweg [said](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/secure-custom-fields/). "This update is as minimal as possible to fix the security issue."

WordPress did not disclose the exact nature of the security problem, but said it has to do with $\_REQUEST. It further said the issue has been addressed in version 6.3.6.2 of Secure Custom Fields.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

"Their code is currently insecure, and it is a dereliction of their duty to customers for them to tell people to avoid Secure Custom Fields until they fix their vulnerability," WordPress [noted](https://x.com/WordPress/status/1845680750210736392). "We have also notified them of this privately, but they did not respond."

WP Engine, in a post on X, [claimed](https://x.com/wp_acf/status/1845169499064107049) WordPress has never "unilaterally and forcibly" taken an actively developed plugin "from its creator without consent."

In response, WordPress said "this has happened several times before," and that it [reserves the right](https://github.com/wordpress/wporg-plugin-guidelines/blob/trunk/guideline-18.md) to disable or remove any plugin from the directory, remove developer access to a plugin, or change it "without developer consent" in the interest of public safety.
