# AI Access Security Now Available

The rollout of our Secure AI by Design product portfolio has begun. And now, the journey continues.

Today, we’re pleased to announce the general availability of [AI Access Security](/network-security/ai-access-security), an innovative offering that addresses the unique security challenges posed by generative AI and large language models in corporate environments. AI Access Security empowers organizations to harness the power of GenAI technologies while maintaining robust protection for sensitive data and ensuring compliance with security policies.

GenAI apps have become an indispensable tool, revolutionizing how we work and creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation and productivity. However, the rapid proliferation of GenAI apps, coupled with their unique characteristics and evolving AI ecosystems have introduced new security challenges.

AI Access Security provides real-time visibility into what GenAI apps are being used and by whom, with the ability to set up robust application access controls. What’s more, it provides comprehensive data protection, AI posture management and security controls for both sanctioned and shadow AI apps.

## Discover and Monitor Your GenAI Application Footprint

Gain immediate visibility with an up-to-date catalog of 600+ GenAI applications mapped over 60 AI-specific attributes (i.e., input/output modes and whether data is used in training models) to discover GenAI apps, monitor usage and assess risks.

Empower your IT security teams to not only keep pace with the latest GenAI apps but make informed risk-based decisions about which apps to sanction or tolerate.

## Don’t Just Block GenAI, Take Back Control

AI Access Security allows you to create and enforce granular policies for GenAI usage. These policies can be customized based on user roles, departments or specific data uploads, helping ensure that AI apps are used in compliance with your organization’s security and governance standards.

In addition to robust access controls, it’s essential to educate your employees on AI-related risks, and then to guide them to approved apps or to corporate policies. With best practice recommendations, granular controls and employee coaching, we enable businesses to innovate with confidence.

## Protect Your Sensitive Data from Un/Intentional Leakage

AI Access Security is specifically tailored to scan, detect and prevent sensitive information from being input into unauthorized AI tools. By leveraging [LLM-powered and context-aware ML models](/blog/sase/transforming-data-security-with-ai-powered-classification/), sensitive data is classified across 300+ predefined and custom categories with pinpoint accuracy to help ensure your organization’s sensitive data remains secure.

What’s more, you gain visibility into encrypted traffic directly through the [Prisma Access Browser](/sase/prisma-access-browser?utm_source=google-jg-amer-sase-smco-syhw&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaign=google-sase-prisma_access_browser-amer-multi-lead_gen-en&utm_content=7014u000001eDCjAAM&utm_term=prisma%20access%20browser&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4JCD2_zdhwMVMDUIBR1-KSigEAAYASABEgKVO_D_BwE) for an additional layer of control and enforcement. And, [integration with ChatGPT Enterprise](/blog/2024/07/announcing-openai-chatgpt-enterprise-compliance-integration/) further extends visibility into ChatGPT workspaces.
