Title:
================
Advanced Host Monitor > 12.56 - Unquoted Service Path

Summary:
================
An unquoted service path vulnerability has been discovered in Advanced Host
Monitor version > 12.56 affecting the executable "C:\Program Files
(x86)\HostMonitor\RMA-Win\rma_active.exe" . This vulnerability occurs when
the service's path is misconfigured, allowing an attacker to run a
malicious file instead of the legitimate executable associated with the
service.

An attacker with local user privileges could exploit this vulnerability to
replace the legitimate RMA-Win\rma_active.exe service executable with a
malicious file of the same name and located in a directory that has a
higher priority than the legitimate directory. That way, when the service
starts, it will run the malicious file instead of the legitimate
executable, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, gain
unauthorized access to the compromised system, or stop the service from
functioning.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need local access to the
system and the ability to write and replace files on the system. The
vulnerability can be mitigated by correcting the service path to correctly
quote the full path of the executable, including quotation marks.
Furthermore, it is recommended that users keep software updated with the
latest security updates and limit physical and network access to their
systems to prevent malicious attacks.

Proof of Concept:
================

C:\>sc qc ActiveRMAService
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

DISPLAY_NAME : KS Active Remote Monitoring Agent
DEPENDENCIES :
SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
