![The risks of nulled WordPress plugins](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-Post-Nulled-WP-Plugins-Themes-820x385.png)

The prospect of obtaining premium features without spending a dime is tempting. Nulled WordPress plugins and themes, often being advertised as the no cost versions of their premium counterparts, can seem like a dream come true for many WordPress users. Who doesn’t want to save some money while still enjoying the enhancements and extended features that premium plugins and themes provide? But the reality of using these “free” versions is much riskier than you might think.

The key message here is plain and simple: while the idea of getting something for nothing is enticing, the hidden costs and risks far outweigh the perks. Below we’ll shed some light on nulled plugins and themes to explain the importance of sticking to legitimate, licensed products.

Need a quick takeaway? **Do not install nulled plugins and themes**. Your website’s security, performance, and integrity are too valuable to be compromised.

## Understanding nulled WordPress plugins

To fully grasp the risks associated with nulled plugins and themes, let’s first go over what they are. Nulled plugins and themes are non-licensed copies of premium WordPress software. Despite not being technically considered “pirated” under the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), these versions have been modified to bypass the license key registration, allowing users to install and activate them without purchasing the required license.

These “free” versions are often distributed through various channels like seemingly random websites, torrent sites, and direct email offers. They often come with the promise of providing premium features for free, which of course makes them highly attractive to budget-conscious users.

But it simply isn’t worth the risk associated. These plugins and themes can be laced with malicious code that will disrupt your website. From data breaches to full on site takeovers, the potential dangers should make the entire idea a no-go.

## Why users opt for nulled WordPress plugins

One of the main reasons users will consider using nulled plugins or themes is to try to save money. Premium software gets pretty expensive, and the promise of obtaining the same functionality for free is undeniably tempting. But the notion that these plugins are “free” is a dangerous misconception and the short-term gain is often outweighed by long-term repercussions.

While it may seem like there’s no immediate cost, the hidden expenses could be substantial. Compromised security, [SEO penalties](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/06/seo-poisoning-on-nulled-templates.html), and degraded site performance are just a few of the many things that could go wrong. Moreover, the lack of updates and support guarantees you a short trip to having compatibility issues and a vulnerable website. Once installed, bad actors will use this access to distribute [spam](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/12/seo-spam-links-in-nulled-plugins.html), spread malware, gain unauthorized access to websites, and carry out other [malicious activities](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/06/seo-poisoning-on-nulled-templates.html). So the seemingly innocent act of downloading a nulled plugin or theme could actually be leaving the door wide open for cybercriminals to infiltrate your site.

## Unseen dangers of nulled plugins

The obfuscation technique used to hide this malicious code makes it even more dangerous. Obfuscation involves making the code difficult to read and understand, thereby concealing its true purpose. Bad actors will often obfuscate the harmful scripts they embed within the nulled plugins and themes. These scripts are capable of executing a range of malicious activities, from [creating backdoors](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/02/the-dangers-of-installing-nulled-wordpress-themes-and-plugins.html#:~:text=Example%20of%20a%20backdoor%20found%20in%20a%20nulled%20theme) for future attacks to SEO spam and malware. So even if you have some experience with code, identifying and removing these scripts can be difficult without specialized tools.
