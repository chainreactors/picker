Transport for London (TfL) suffers a cybersecurity incident and tells its 30,000 staff they will all have to their identities verified… in-person. Who might have been behind the attack and why? Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s curious relationship with cryptocurrency is explored.

All this and Demi Moore is discussed in the latest edition of the “Smashing Security” podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.

(This episode was recorded before the former US President survived a second assassination attempt)
