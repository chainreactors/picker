In January 2020, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio [announced New York City’s Internet Master Plan](https://digitaleconomy.nyc/nyc-internet-master-plan/), setting a path to deliver broadband for low-income New Yorkers by investing in public fiber infrastructure. The plan was a clear response to the gap created from systemic digital redlining ([an industry practice EFF has called for governments to ban](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/fcc-and-states-must-ban-digital-redlining)) that every American city deals with today. Shortly after the announcement by de Blasio, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the made the need for public fiber into low-income areas greater than ever before.

In response, former union workers at Spectrum opted to build their own broadband cooperative called [People’s Choice Communications](https://peopleschoice.coop/), to deliver free high-speed access. This was unequivocally a good thing. The [de Blasio Administration itself](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pyvg/disgusting-nyc-scraps-co-op-internet-in-public-housing-so-big-telecom-can-move-in) was even in the process of contracting with the worker-owned cooperative to build new networks. But since the election of Mayor Eric Adams, this critical progress has not only come to a halt, it is also [now actively being undermined, to the benefit of large cable corporations](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3pyvg/disgusting-nyc-scraps-co-op-internet-in-public-housing-s...
