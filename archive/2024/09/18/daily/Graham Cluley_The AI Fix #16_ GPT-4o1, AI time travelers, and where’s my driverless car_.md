In episode 16 of The AI Fix, Mark and Graham meet GPT-4o1 and ask if it knows how many cousins Alice‚Äôs sister has, a top cop wants AI injected into his colleagues ‚Äúlike heroin‚Äù, Mark finds an AI that might actually be able to help with that, and our hosts start a conspiracy theory about an AI that stops you believing in conspiracy theories.

Graham peers into his crystal ball and discover‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs bargain basement John Connor, and Mark is tired of waiting for the ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù of driverless cars we were promised.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
