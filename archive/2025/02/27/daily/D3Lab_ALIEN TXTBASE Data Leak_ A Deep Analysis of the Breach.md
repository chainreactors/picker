# ALIEN TXTBASE Data Leak: A Deep Analysis of the Breach

[Data Leak](https://www.d3lab.net/category/data-leak/)

[![](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ALIEX_TXTBASE.jpg?resize=1097%2C423&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ALIEX_TXTBASE.jpg?fit=1030%2C516&ssl=1 "ALIEX_TXTBASE")

In recent days, the cybersecurity community has been alarmed by the emergence of a massive data leak known as ALIEN TXTBASE, which was recently [indexed](https://www.troyhunt.com/processing-23-billion-rows-of-alien-txtbase-stealer-logs/) on Have I Been Pwned (HIBP). This breach, reportedly containing **over 23 billion records**, was published on a Telegram channel and claimed to be a collection of **Stealer Logs**—credentials stolen from malware-infected devices.

Our in-depth analysis questions the **authenticity and reliability** of these leaked records. This article will break down the dataset, uncover inconsistencies, and explain why this so-called **breach** might not be as alarming as it seems.

### **What Are Stealer Logs?**

**Stealer Logs** are data stolen from infected devices via specialized malware that extracts credentials stored in browsers and other sensitive information. These logs are often sold on underground markets or distributed through Telegram channels.

While **ALIEN TXTBASE** is advertised as a Stealer Log dump, our analysis suggests a **different reality**.

### **Artificially Generated Data and Recycled Combo Lists**

A deeper look into the dataset reveals **inconsistencies** that raise doubts about its legitimacy. Key findings include:

### **1. Randomly Generated or Non-Existent Emails**

Testing a sample of email addresses from the leak, we found these 9 emails:

```
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
[email protected]
```

All were **nonexistent** except for [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), which stands out as the **only real email**. It was initially exposed in the 2020 ‘*APB Combolist 58M*’ leak.

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Leak_Check.png?resize=1030%2C516&ssl=1)

This strongly suggests that many credentials in **ALIEN TXTBASE** were either **artificially generated** or **taken from previous leaks**.

### **2. Corrupt and Structurally Incorrect Data**

Many records contain formatting errors, such as:

```

This indicates that the dataset was assembled without **proper verification** or **data integrity checks**.

### **3. Similarity to Previous Malware Logs**

The **actual** malware logs found within the **ALIEN TXTBASE** dataset—excluding the fabricated or recycled credentials—show strong similarities to those previously shared by underground groups such as **IGGY CLOUD** and **SegaCloud**. This suggests that the criminal team behind **ALIEN TXTBASE** has aggregated data from multiple sources of various origins, rather than compiling an entirely new and original dataset.

### **Are There Any Real Stealer Logs?**

Despite the inconsistencies, the dataset does include **some authentic Stealer Logs**, as seen in the following example:

```
@TXTLOG_ALIEN - 188.txt:https://accounts.google.com/:[email protected]:d4@483pv$y-ykxj
```

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.d3lab.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Hudson.png?resize=755%2C471&ssl=1)

According to **Hudson Rock**, this credential **was indeed stolen via malware on April 25, 2024**. However, these legitimate Stealer Logs are mixed with **a massive amount of unreliable and recycled data**.

### **Key Takeaways from ALIEN TXTBASE**

Our **forensic analysis** of this dataset reveals critical insights:

* **ALIEN TXTBASE is NOT a pure Stealer Log breach**: The dataset is a mixture of **old Combo Lists, cleartext password dumps, and some real, but not recent, Stealer Logs**.
* **An email appearing in the leak does NOT mean the user was infected with malware**: Many email-password pairs were either **fabricated** or taken from **older, unrelated leaks**.
* **This is NOT a targeted attack but a disorganized data dump**: There is **no evidence** that **ALIEN TXTBASE** represents a structured, targeted breach against specific companies or institutions.
* **Beware of alarmist reports**: Just because an email appears in this dataset **does not** automatically mean it was stolen via malware or that the user is currently at risk.

### **Final Verdict: ALIEN TXTBASE is NOT the Massive Cyber Threat It Claims to Be**

Contrary to the alarmist claims surrounding it, **ALIEN TXTBASE is not a major data breach** but rather a **chaotic mix of unrelated datasets**, many of which are outdated, fabricated, or stolen from previous leaks.

Instead of panicking, organizations and individuals should **assess exposure logically, implement security best practices, and avoid falling for sensationalized breach reports**.

If you need expert **data breach analysis or cybersecurity support**, our team is available for in-depth investigations.

**Stay secure. Stay informed.**

To sum up, ALIEN TXTBASE is not the groundbreaking breach it claims to be. Instead, it’s a disorganized mix of different data sources, resembling what we’d call in Italy…“**Sembra un mappazzo...
