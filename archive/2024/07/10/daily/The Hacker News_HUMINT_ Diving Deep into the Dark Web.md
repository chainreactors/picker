Discover how cybercriminals behave in Dark Web forums- what services they buy and sell, what motivates them, and even how they scam each other.

## Clear Web vs. Deep Web vs. Dark Web

Threat intelligence professionals divide the internet into three main components:

* **Clear Web** - Web assets that can be viewed through public search engines, including media, blogs, and other pages and sites.
* **Deep Web** - Websites and forums that are unindexed by search engines. For example, webmail, online banking, corporate intranets, walled gardens, etc. Some of the hacker forums exist in the Deep Web, requiring credentials to enter.
* **Dark Web -** Web sources that require specific software to gain access. These sources are anonymous and closed, and include Telegram groups and invite-only forums. The Dark Web contains Tor, P2P, hacker forums, criminal marketplaces, etc.

According to Etay Maor, Chief Security Strategist at [Cato Networks](https://www.catonetworks.com/?utm_source=hackernews&utm_medium=referral), "We've been seeing a shift in how criminals communicate and conduct their business, moving from the top of the glacier to its lower parts. The lower parts allow more security."

### Spotlight: What is Tor?

Tor is a free network, built upon open-source, that allows for anonymous communication. While Tor was originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory, it has become an increasingly popular solution for illegal activities.

Conducting these activities on the Clear Web can lead to law enforcement monitoring and allow tracing back to the criminal. But through Tor, communication is encrypted across three layers that are peeled off at every node jump until exiting the network. Law enforcement agencies monitoring Tor will not see the criminal's IP, but the Tor exit node, making it harder to trace back to the original criminal.

Tor communication architecture:

Etay Maor adds "In the 2000s, a celestial alignment of digital capabilities boosted criminal efforts. First, the Dark Web emerged. Then, hidden and secure services through Tor. Finally, cryptocurrency allowed for secure transactions."

### Criminal Services Available on the Dark Web

Here are a few examples of services that were available on the dark web in the past. Today, many of these have been taken down. Instead, criminals are moving towards the Telegram messaging platform, due to its privacy and security features.

Example include -

Drug selling:

### How are Criminal Forums Managed? Creating Trust in an Untrusted Environment

Attackers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities and break into systems as a way to turn a profit. Just like any other commercial ecosystem, they use online forums to buy and sell hacking services. However, these forums need to create trust among members, while they themselves are built on crime.

Generally speaking, such forums were initially designed as follows:

1. **Admin** - Moderates the forum
2. **Escrow** - Facilitating payments among members
3. **Black-list** ...
