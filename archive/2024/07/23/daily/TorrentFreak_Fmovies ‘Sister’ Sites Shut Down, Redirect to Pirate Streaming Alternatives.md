# Fmovies ‘Sister’ Sites Shut Down, Redirect to Pirate Streaming Alternatives

A few days after popular pirate streaming site Fmovies seemingly shut down for good, a flurry of 'related' streaming portals have closed shop too. Flixtorz.to, Flixhq.bz, Movies7.to, Swatchseries.mx and Yeahmovies.to are among more than a dozen sites that are no longer online. The sites all redirect to new domains that are, purportedly, managed by another team.

Earlier this year, several popular pirate sites including Zorox, Upmovies, Animeflix, and Vegamovies lost their domains due to legal action. These sites relaunched under new domains, but more confusion lay ahead.

In June, Fmovies [switched to a new domain name](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-and-other-piracy-streaming-giants-switch-to-new-domains-240503/), Fmovies24.to, after trading Fmovies.to for Fmoviesz.to a few months earlier. These mystery changes have never been explained, but domain-related issues related to site blocking and search engine demotion measures may have played a role.

Fmovies [wasn’t the only](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-and-other-piracy-streaming-giants-switch-to-new-domains-240503/) site to adopt a new domain name; many related streaming portals including Bflix.to, Soap2dayx.to, and Sflixhd.to followed suit. These pirate streaming portals simultaneously redirected their users to new domains and kept running.

While Fmovies initially continued to operate as usual, things started to fall apart towards the end of June. Without explanation, the site [stopped adding new movies and TV shows](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-streaming-giant-fmovies-hasnt-updated-in-a-week-240702/) and then last week, things took a turn for the worse. Fmovies completely [went offline](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-has-gone-offline-the-end-of-a-pirate-streaming-giant-240717/) and remains offline today.

There’s still no official explanation for the shutdown. However, as we [highlighted in detail](https://torrentfreak.com/what-killed-fmovies-death-by-a-1000-cuts-one-killer-blow-or-possibly-both-240719/) this weekend, ongoing enforcement efforts alongside political and diplomatic pressure may have played a role. The fact that the MPA visited Fmovies’ alleged home country, Vietnam, right when the trouble started, is definitely noteworthy.

## More Pirate Streaming Sites Shut Down

In a similar vein, there are more ‘coincidences’ that are worth pointing out. This weekend, more than a dozen pirate streaming portals suddenly shut down at the same moment. This includes websites with millions of monthly visitors, including flixtorz.to, movies7.to, and swatchseries.mx.

Visitors who access these sites today are greeted with a brief message, informing them that the site has closed. Instead, they are conveniently redirected to a new pirate streaming site, as shown below.

**Some of the redirects**

“The site has been closed. To continue watching free movies, you will be redirected to other site *[insert domain here]* (managed by other team),” the brief message on these domains reads.

The redirection technique is similar to the one we saw when Fmovies and others switched to [new domain names](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-and-other-piracy-streaming-giants-switch-to-new-domains-240503/) in June. The main difference now, is the statement that the ‘redirecting’ domains are operated by a new team. Why this is happening now is not mentioned.

## The New Anonymous

Apparently, the sites’ former operators believe it’s important to stress that the new sites are managed by new people. That should be fine for most users, as the initial owners were anonymous anyway. Whether a site is operated by X or Y, shouldn’t matter to them.

Perhaps this message isn’t meant for users, but for the MPA, ACE, and others who are trying to bring the operation down? The recent shutdown of Fmovies suggests that enforcement efforts are paying off; rightsholders previously signaled that they had identified some of the people involved.

Whether this redirection strategy will be effective has yet to be seen. In a way, however, it’s quite telling.

The fact that identical messages appeared on all sites suggests that they are managed by the same group. At minimum, there is some coordination going on. This is also supported by the [overlapping](https://builtwith.com/es/relationships/fmoviesz.to) Google Tag Manager on these sites, which is installed for advertising purposes. Publicly available information confirms this.

The same line of code was also connected to Fmovies, which explains why these other sites are taking action now. With Fmovies offline, and all other sites down as well, the trouble should be over now, right?

The MPA and ACE are unlikely to walk away since they’re all too familiar with sites ‘changing’ ownership. Last year, anime streaming portal Zoro.to was [acquired by Aniwatch.to](https://torrentfreak.com/zoro-to-worlds-largest-pirate-site-suddenly-acquired-rebranded-230704/), which later rebranded to [HiAnime](https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-moghul-aniwatch-rebrands-to-hianime-240301/). These new sites are just as big of a target as the original.
