## Multiple schools hit by Vice Society ransomware attack

Christopher Boyd

January 14, 2023

Christopher Boyd

The real world impact of cybercrime rears its head once more, with word that [14 schools in the UK have been caught out by ransomware](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-63637883). The schools, attacked by the group known as Vice Society, have had multiple documents leaked online in the wake of the attack.

One of the primary schools highlighted, Pates Grammar School, was affected on or around the September 28, 2022. The school eventually realised that data had been stolen somewhere around the October 14, notifying the parents. Law enforcement are investigating, but this timeline of not knowing data had been exfiltrated for a week or two is sadly common.

## Schools: A recurring target

Vice Society is no stranger to school compromise, having most recently been in the news for threatening to [leak data from the LA Unified School District](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-leaks-data-stolen-from-lausd-school-system/). In that incident, the School District refused to pay up despite the threat of eventual data leakage should they not comply with the ransom demands.

Here, the same pattern of attack has been followed with data leaked after non-payment of the ransom. There’s going to be quite a bit of concern for parents and teachers alike, with sensitive data being thrown into the mix.

According to the BBC, the data includes:

* Passport scans of both pupils and parents which date back to 2011
* Contractual offers made to members of staff
* Headmaster’s pay and student bursary fund recipients
* Special Educational Needs (SEN) data

Other, unnamed confidential documents were seen which belong to a variety of other schools from across all parts of the UK. The responses to the attacks from the schools are a mixed bag. Some reported the attack to teachers but did not notify them that data had been taken. Others notified their IT department but not parents and pupils. One school reports roughly 18,680 documents having been stolen.

## The word from law enforcement

There’s no word if any of the schools affected paid the ransom and had their data leaked anyway, or if the ransomware gang stuck to its word and “only” leaked in cases of non-payment. As we’ve seen recently, cyber insurance is no guarantee of avoiding a ransomware pitfall either with refusal of payout being decided in a court of law.

Schools are a juicy target for ransomware affiliates—schools’ often lack both funding and IT expertise, which can mean they’re an easier target than sectors where funding for cybersecurity is more available. The impact on students can be immediate, with no access to teaching resources, cancelled exams, or even a total school shut down.

The FBI has already issued multiple alerts with regard to school attacks down the years, with a joint FBI / CISA alert dedicated to Vice Society [back in September of last year](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-249a):

> Over the past several years, the education sector, especially kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) institutions, have been a frequent target of ransomware attacks. Impacts from these attacks have ranged from restricted access to networks and data, delayed exams, canceled school days, and unauthorized access to and theft of personal information regarding students and staff…School districts with limited cybersecurity capabilities and constrained resources are often the most vulnerable; however, the opportunistic targeting often seen with cyber criminals can still put school districts with robust cybersecurity programs at risk.

The message is loud and clear: If you’re in education, you’re sadly a target for some of the most prolific ransomware groups around and ge...
