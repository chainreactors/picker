As October rolls around, it’s time to focus on cybersecurity. After all, it’s [Cybersecurity Awareness Month](https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month)—a perfect reminder to check in on the safety of your identity. If you’ve ever had your identity stolen or know someone who has, you understand how serious the problem is. From text scams to stolen passwords, criminals are finding new ways to steal personal information.

So, how can you protect yourself and your loved ones? Follow these four identity protection strategies, and you’ll be in a good position to [keep your digital identity safe](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/04/03/protecting-your-digital-identity-celebrating-identity-management-day/) and sound.

## 1. Get informed!

* **Learn about scams**Identity thieves use various tactics to trick people. Some of the most common scams include [phishing](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-phishing) emails where criminals pretend to be a trusted organization like your bank, and phone calls or texts from fake customer service representatives asking for personal details. Being aware of these tactics is your first line of defense.
* **Check with your bank**
  Most financial institutions have strict policies in place to protect your account. Get familiar with what your bank and credit card companies do to prevent identity theft. For example, many banks will never ask for your password or request sensitive information through email or text messages. Knowing their security protocols can help you spot a scam.

## 2. Know the warning signs

Cybercriminals are clever, and new scams pop up all the time. Here are a few things you should always be cautious about:

* **Unsolicited messages**
  Be wary of unexpected emails, phone calls, and text messages that ask for your personal information or password details. Scammers often impersonate legitimate companies to make their requests seem official. If you receive a suspicious communication, always reach out to the company directly through their official website or customer service line.
* **Too-good-to-be-true offers**
  If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Handle these communications with a healthy amount of skepticism. Offers like “free money” or “prizes” that require you to share your personal information are almost always scams. Look out for common warning signs, such as a sense of urgency. Scams will often pressure you to act quickly to claim your “reward.” When in doubt, pause and investigate the offer before responding. You can search online for the company or offer name to confirm its legitimacy.

## 3. Know what not to share

* **Social security number**
  Keep this number private. Only share it when absolutely necessary, such as with your employer or financial institutions.
* **Passwords**
  Never share your passwords with anyone. No legitimate company will ask for them.
* **Full date of birth**
  While some websites and services require your date of birth for verification, sharing it publicly—especially on social media—can increase your risk of identity theft. Consider only sharing part of the date, such as the month and day, and leave the year off your public profiles.
* **Credit card details**
  Be extra careful with your credit card information. Don’t email your credit card number or input it on suspicious-looking websites. Make sure you’re on a secure site (look for the padlock symbol in the address bar) before making any online purchase transactions.

## 4. Get proactive with your identity protection

* **Monitor your credit**One of the best ways to catch identity theft early is by keeping a close eye on your credit reports. Services like [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) let you monitor your credit activity for free. If you see any unfamiliar accounts or activities, report them immediately.
* **Invest in identity protection services**
  Companies like [Webroot](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium) offer services that monitor your personal information for any suspicious activity. These services can alert you if there’s a suspicious financial transaction on your accounts or if your data is found on the dark web.
* **Freeze your credit**
  If you’re not planning on applying for new credit anytime soon, consider freezing your credit. This prevents anyone from opening new accounts in your name. You can unfreeze your credit at any time, and it’s free to do so through major credit bureaus like [Experian](https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html), [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze?atvy=%7B%22248034%22%3A%22Experience+A%22%7D), and [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/).

As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, protecting your identity has never been more important. While October is Cybersecurity Awareness, it serves as a year-long reminder to remain vigilant about your personal information. By staying informed, recognizing potential threats, and using the right tools and services, you can safeguard yourself against identity theft. Remember, the best defense is a proactive one!
