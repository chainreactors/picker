## **Key Data**

* Threat actors immediately target new Truth Social users â Netcraft received more than 30 messages within hours of creating an account.
* Truth Socialâs structure gives threat actors easy access to target groups with more than 100,000 members.
* Advance Fee Fraud scams average $250, with some scammers asking for as much as $1,000 at once on Truth Social.
* Central European, French-speaking threat actor preys on global victims by impersonating trusted brands including: Spotify, Disney+, EasyPark, Sky, Netflix, and Google.

## **Overview**

Truth Social â the social media platform created by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) in 2022 â is being abused to deploy scams at scale, from phishing websites to investment scams, according to Netcraft analysis.

Case in point: **The Netcraft team received more than 30 scam messages within just a few hours of creating a single account on Truth Social.** And, the cost of falling for these scams can be high.

The [Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers) that 1 in 4 Americans who reported losing money to fraud since 2021 said it started on social media. During this same time period, reported losses to scams on social media hit $2.7 billion, far higher than any other method of contact. But this doesnât include the large portion of scams that go unreported â and only looks at the United States. The true cost of social media scams worldwide is likely billions, if not trillions.

Looking more closely at Truth Social, [Gizmodo explored consumer complaints](https://gizmodo.com/truth-social-users-are-losing-ridiculous-sums-of-money-to-scams-2000506604) filed with the FTC over the past two years. According to the research, the complaints about scams are âthe most shocking, if only because there are such large sums of money involved.â

This blog post details Netcraftâs initial analysis of threat actors and malicious campaigns being used on Truth Social to target its users. Netcraft continually searches for [fraudulent content on social media platforms](https://www.netcraft.com/solutions/by-service/social-media-protection/), disrupting and taking down phishing, fraud, scams, and cyber attacks.

## **Why Scammers May Target Truth Social**

In November, Truth Social saw [355,000 daily active users](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-03/trump-s-policy-posts-on-truth-social-fail-to-improve-traffic?embedded-checkout=true), up 3% from the prior month, according to Bloomberg. When a user joins Truth Social, they are prompted to join groups related to areas of interest and topics that users care about â and each group member can view a list of all other members.

Some of these groups have more than 100,000 members, providing threat actors with a rich source of information to identify and contact other users at scale. This makes it easy for scammers to simply pick a group, tailor a message targeting its members, and hit send. And, because users have opted into these groups, people may be less diligent about questioning information because of an existing confirmation bias.

At the same time, each post from a user is called a âTruthâ and users may be taking that quite literally. According to [previous reports from Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/18/key-facts-about-truth-social-as-donald-trump-runs-for-u-s-president-again/), the majority of those who use Truth Social (87%) say they expect the news and information there to be mostly accurate.

With easy access to curated member lists and users more likely to trust Truths, as named, Truth Social is a prime target for bad actors.

## **Criminal Conversations: The Prevalence of Conversational Scams**

In a single day, our U.S.-based Truth Social account received 40 unsolicited messages from scammers running a variety of scams.

Most of the attacks follow established peer-to-peer scam patterns, likely with multiple people responding to messages from each account on a rota. The scammer engages a victim in casual conversation and then begins the social engineering process in a way that creates interest from the victim.

All of the scammers we engaged claimed to be based across the United States. However, we observed individual scam accounts active at all hours, indicating that they are either AI-driven or based in other countries in different time zones. In our experience, scammers often start with questions and conversations regarding the location of their target, likely using physical location to build rapport with the victim and verify a victimâs vulnerability.

The first example below asks for an upfront fee to pay for the delivery of a package purportedly containing $20,000 in cash, with payment requested via Cash App. This scammer claimed to be in the same city as the victim â Dallas, Texas. They even look up the victimâs address and ask to meet in person in an effort to appear genuine.

Other prevalent types of scam on Truth Social include romance scams and investment scams â sometimes called pig butchering, where a threat actor builds trust with the victim and then grooms them into making a series of ultimately ill-fated crypto investments. In the example below, a threat actor directed us to contact them on WhatsApp to make an investment in a supposed cryptocurrency platform.
