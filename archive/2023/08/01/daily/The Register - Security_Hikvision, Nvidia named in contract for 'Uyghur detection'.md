Updated Video surveillance equipment maker Hikvision was paid $6 million by the Chinese government last year to provide technology that could identify members of the nation's Uyghur people, a Muslim ethnic majority, according to physical security monitoring org IPVM.

The payment was documented in a contract between China-based Hikvision and the Hainan Province's Chengmai County, which was obtained by IPVM.

"While the People's Republic of China (PRC) has sharply restricted access to sensitive documents such as this one, this shows that persecution of Uyghur ethnic minorities is ongoing and that Hikvision, in what the authorities called its 'standard configuration,' can and does supply this human rights-abusing software," IPVM's researchers [claimed](https://ipvm.com/reports/hikvision-uyghur-nvidia) last week.
