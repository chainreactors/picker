The cryptography that protects our privacy and security online relies on the fact that even the strongest computers will take essentially forever to do certain tasks, like factoring prime numbers and finding discrete logarithms which are important for [RSA encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem), [Diffie-Hellman key exchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange), and [elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) encryption. But what happens when those problems – and the cryptography they underpin – are no longer infeasible for computers to solve? Will our online defenses collapse?
