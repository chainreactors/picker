The Biden administration has [published](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/) its long-awaited **National Cybersecurity Strategy**, a document that lays out the White House's plan to improve the country's cybersecurity posture.

The role of the 39-page document [*[PDF](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf)*] is to provide a roadmap for lawmakers, federal agencies, and the private sector for dealing with online threats that may impact the national security of the United States.

The document groups strategies into five main "pillars," each with its own recommendations and goals:

1. **The defense of critical infrastructure** (establish new cybersecurity requirements/legislation for critical sectors, harmonize existing regulation, pass enforceable and cheap cybersecurity rules, expanding public-private collaboration to defend infrastructure, further integrations of various federal cyber centers to benefit from shared intel, updating incident response procedures)
2. **The disruption and dismantling of foreign threat actors** (pass new rules and procedures for going after threat actors, encouraging public-private partnerships in going after malicious actors—even for temporary collaboration cells, prevent US cloud infrastructure from being abused by threat actors, increase the speed of threat intel sharing and victim notification, increase actions against cybercrime and especially ransomware)
3. **Shaping the market to improve and drive/prioritize cybersecurity** (hold data stewards accountable, drive the development of secure IoT devices, shift liability to vendors for insecure software, use federal funds to encourage better security practices, use federal procurements to create accountability for cybersecurity, explore a federal cybersecurity insurance system)
4. **Strategic investments to boost cybersecurity resilience and R&D** (secure the technical foundation of the internet and its protocols, invest in federal cybersecurity R&D, prepare for a post-quantum future, make sure the clean energy sector is secure, develop secure digital identity solutions, invest into a cyber workforce)
5. **Forging international partnerships to pursue shared cybersecurity goals** (build international coalitions to counter threats, expand US’ ability to help allies, set global norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, secure global supply chains)

The document is a long-term plan, a framework, or a list of goals the US government wants to achieve rather than a set of predefined rules to follow. The White House will need Congress to pass laws to aid in reaching those goals.

A Biden administration official tells [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/02/national-cybersecurity-strategy-biden) they expect lawmakers to pump out laws based on the new strategy for the next ten years.

The document was put together by the White House's Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), which is expected to publish an implementation plan for the National Cybersecurity Strategy with finer details in the coming months.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**T-Mobile's alleged 100+ breaches:** An analysis of multiple Telegram channels reveals that three threat actors have claimed to have breached T-Mobile's backend network more than 100 times throughout 2022. According to infosec reporter *[Brian Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/)*, many of these breaches have been carried out by threat actors who provide account hijacking services and who needed access to T-Mobile's network to execute SIM-swapping attacks. Most of the breaches appear to have been carried out by phishing T-Mobile employees and gaining access to their internal accounts.

**Polish tax portal attacks:** Polish officials have blamed Russian hackers for [DDoS attacks](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Cyberatak-na-strone-podatki-gov-pl-8496933.html) that have taken down the government's national tax-filing portal this week.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Russia fines Wikipedia:** The Russian government has fined the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization behind the Wikipedia portal, 2 million rubles (~$27,000) for failing to delete "misinformation" about the Russian military and its invasion... oops... special operation in Ukraine. This marks the third fine Wikipedia has received in Russia since the country's invasion of Ukraine, according to *[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-court-fines-wikipedia-over-military-misinformation-2023-02-28/)*. Wikipedia said the recent fine was related to articles on its Russian language portal related to [Russian Invasions of Ukraine (2022)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83_%282022%29), [Battle for Kyiv](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2_%282022%29), [War Crimes during the Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B2%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83), [Shelling of Mariupol Hospital](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BB_%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5), [Bombing of the Mariupol Theater](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0), and the [Massacre in Bucha](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%91%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5).

**Secret Scanning reaches GA:** GitHub has made its Secret Scanning security feature generally available to all its users. The feature works by scanning GitHub source code repositories for any strings that look like API access tokens, secrets, or passwords and then notifying the repo owner and the API provider about the accidental leak. Secret Scanning currently supports more than 100 API token forma...
