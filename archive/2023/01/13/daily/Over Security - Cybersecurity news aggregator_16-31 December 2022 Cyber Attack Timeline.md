Welcome to the last cyber attacks timeline of 2022! A timeline that marks a sharp decline in the number of recorded events after four consecutive increases: 117 events in comparison to nearly 150 collected in the [previous timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2022/12/29/1-15-december-2022-cyber-attack-timeline/), it will be interesting to see if this is just a temporary effect (maybe less attacks surfaced given also the festive break) or the start of a new trend.

Less events, but a major influence by those characterized by ransomware, whose percentage is again beyond 30% and nearly ten points higher than the previous fortnight (35% vs. 25.8%, corresponding to 41 out of 117). In contrast, the exploitation of vulnerabilities characterized 5.9% of events (8 out of 141), almost half the value of the previous fortnight (10.2%).

### [1-15 March 2025 Cyber Attacks Timeline](https://www.hackmageddon.com/2025/09/05/1-15-march-2025-cyber-attacks-timeline/)

In the first timeline of March 2025, I collected 127 events with a threat landscape dominated by malware and ransomware…

The siege against crypto platforms continued also in these last days of 2022: the users of BitKeep suffered a cumulative loss of $8M worth in crypto assets through a trojanized app, and BTC.com was hit by a cyber attack resulting in the loss of $3M worth.

The end of 2022 was also characterized by a few massive breaches: for sure the one hitting Twitter (the private data of 400 million users were put on sale overshadowed the rest), but there were also other examples (despite unconfirmed in some cases) in Malaysia (Maybank, Astro, and the Election Committee) and India (Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation – IRCTC.)

Not so many cyber espionage campaigns in this timeline. Of course at least one targeting Ukraine (carried out by a threat actor dubbed UAC-0142 and targeting the users of the ‘DELTA’ situational awareness program), and two more targeting foreign policy experts in South Korea, and members of the Indian government, launched respectively by the North Korean threat actor Kimsuky and from a threat actor allegedly originating from Pakistan.

With regards to cyber warfare, the timeline recorded a couple of operations of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior carried out by a Russian troll farm (taken down by the Ukrainian law enforcement), and by the infamous group GhostWriter.

And of course the situation in Ukraine was behind several attacks launched by pro-Russian hacktivists, in particular Killnet and NoName057(16), even if in some cases it is really difficult to ascertain if the claims are true.

Even in this fortnight, the list is too long to be summarized in few words (this one in particular), so my suggestion is to enjoy the interactive timeline and the tabular format, and obviously thanks for sharing it, and supporting my work in spreading the risk awareness across the community. As always, don’t forget to follow [@paulsparrows](https://twitter.com/paulsparrows) on Twitter, or even connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsparrows), for the latest updates.
