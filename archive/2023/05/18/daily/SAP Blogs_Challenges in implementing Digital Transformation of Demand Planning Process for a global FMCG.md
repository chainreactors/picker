Having worked in the Demand Planning arena with FMCG companies for the last 3-4 years, I have come to realize that one size fits all does not work for defining the demand planning solution for an FMCG organization.

In a global CPG company, different countries have altogether different ways of working, and bringing them on a common template solution is a great challenge.

I have tried capturing some of the key challenges one faces while establishing the demand planning solution for customers:

**1.  Choosing Route to Market (Distribution Channel).**

In developing markets, Traditional Trade(TT) has been the conventional route to market for sales. But over the last decade, Modern Trade(MT) has gained a substantial portion of the business.

In developed markets, on the other hand, traditional trade has subsided long back and MT is the only option for getting your products to end consumers. Big retailers like Metro, Walmart, Costco, Tesco, and Target are buying directly from Companies and selling to the customers.

If a major share of the business is happening via Traditional Trade, forecast accuracy will certainly be better if sell-out history (Sales happening from distributor to end retailers) is leveraged for conducting Demand Planning. But we may run into a few roadblocks if forecasting is conducted using sell-out history.

* Getting accurate sell-out history from the distributor for a certain period would certainly be a challenge. Organizations do need an agreement signed with distributors to provide them with correct sell-out history periodically and a traditional distributor might not be technologically equipped to do that easily or maybe not be interested in sharing these details

* The distributor’s data will be in a different format and a large FMCG organization will be working with a lot of distributors. In addition to that, the distributor can create his material codes to run promotions at this end to retailers and there will be no corresponding material existing in the company's ERP system. Getting all this worked up and converting this data to FMCG’s system’s language will pose a major challenge.

If these difficulties can be worked upon, the statistical forecast generated on secondary sales will be far more accurate than what we will get by using Sell in History for traditional trade RTM.

**2. Getting Inputs for History Cleaning from Cross-Functional Teams.**

History cleaning is required to remove one-time events that change the nature of sales.  E.g. Demonetization in 2016 had a significant impact on sales in the Indian market but it would not have been a recurring event year on year. Similarly, the Coronavirus pandemic in 2020 would cause a major dip in demand this year for sure.

Also, other significant events like cannibalization of sales due to promotions, trade promotions not going as planned, etc. must be cleaned so that future forecast does not take  those surges and dips into account while generating a forecast

It is a crucial activity for getting a good statistical forecast and must be done with utmost care to get an accurate demand forecast as history is what forms the basis of generating statistical forecasts in the system for any retail organization.

Although the demand planner holds the responsibility for conducting history cleaning, still all the inputs for carrying out cleaning must be taken from various cross-functional teams like Sales, Markets, CP&A, and Finance.

Getting these inputs timely from them is always a challenge and if these inputs are required for a certain period in history, it makes it even more difficult if organizations don’t consider keeping the actuals.

Furthermore, if sell-out forecasting is being carried out, Inputs will be required from the distributor end which makes it even more difficult.

All these inputs are necessary and crucial to increase the accuracy of the demand forecast. Hence adequate processes and measures should be established to capture these events as and when they occur so that they are readily available when required for cleaning of sales history.

**3. Alignment of System Generated Baseline Forecast with Sales Teams**

When it comes to generating the baseline forecast or the bottom-up forecast number in demand planning,sales teams’ input is pivotal as they are the ones closer to markets and driving the generation of revenue for the organization.

So a major challenge comes in the alignment of statistical forecast numbers with sales and marketing tea...
