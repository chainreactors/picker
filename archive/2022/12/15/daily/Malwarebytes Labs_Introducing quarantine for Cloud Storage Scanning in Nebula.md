## Introducing Quarantine for Cloud Storage Scanning in Nebula

December 14, 2022

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

We’re excited to announce Quarantine for [Malwarebytes Cloud Storage Scanning (CSS)](https://www.threatdown.com/products/), a new feature which allows you to automatically quarantine threats found in your cloud storage repositories.

Malwarebytes Cloud Storage Scanning is an add-on service in Nebula that scans for malware on cloud storage repositories across supported cloud storage providers, using multiple anti-malware engines to monitor and protect the health of all your enterprise data.

By toggling on **Enable Quarantine** toggle in the Cloud Storage Scan configuration, malicious files are automatically quarantined to the configured folder. You can manage these detections from the **Storage Quarantine** page. For more information, see [Manage Cloud Storage Scanning quarantine in Nebula.](https://service.malwarebytes.com/hc/en-us/articles/10379213970067-Manage-Cloud-Storage-Scanning-quarantine-in-Nebula)

Let’s dive to learn more about how quarantine for Cloud Storage Scanning works.

## Configuring quarantine in a new Cloud Storage Scan

In Nebula, go to “**Settings**” and click “**Cloud Storage Scans**”. Here you can see existing scans and the providers being checked. Click “Add a Scan” to create a new scan. For our full article on how to configure Cloud Storage Scans in Nebula, [check our previous blog post](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/business/2022/08/introducing-malwarebytes-cloud-storage-scanning-how-to-scan-for-malware-in-cloud-file-storage-repositories).

![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file18403_252202_e.png)

In the **Quarantine** tab, toggle **Enable Quarantine** on to automatically move detected malware to a selected user’s storage.

![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file4328_252202_e.png)

Select a user to transfer all quarantined files to. A quarantine folder will be created in their cloud storage location.

![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file45576_252202_e.png)

Quarantined files will no longer be accessible to original owners, collaborators, or others with access.

Select the default tombstone message or customize it. A **tombstone file** is created and replaces the original file when it is quarantined. The tombstone file is designed to provide information or instructions for users.

## Manage Cloud Storage Scanning quarantine in Nebula

The **Cloud Storage Quarantine** page displays quarantined files from your cloud storage providers and allows you to manage them. Review the files detected by Cloud Storage Scans and moved to quarantine here.**![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file57778_252202_e.png)**

![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file20266_252202_e.png)

If the file is a false positive, select it and go to **Actions > Restore**. This will place the file back in its original location.

To delete the file from quarantine, go to **Actions > Delete**. The file is sent to the administrator’s trash in the cloud storage provider.
