## **Overview**

This blog post will provide an overview of common log sources in Azure and AWS, along with associated storage and analysis options.

At a high level, cloud-based incidents can be categorized into host-based compromises (that is, compromises primarily involving virtual machines hosted in the cloud) and identity-based or resource-based compromises (compromises primarily involving cloud-native services and identities). These scenarios often overlap depending on the scope of an incident, but the investigative approaches are distinct. For example, a compromise of a public-facing virtual machine for cryptocurrency mining purposes warrants disk acquisition and analysis, but the scope of the compromise may not extend into other resources or identities in the tenant. On the other hand, investigating an identity compromise relies heavily on tenant logs and may not involve any virtual machine artifacts if no hosts were targeted by the threat actor.

The steps below represent a high-level approach to investigating cloud-based incidents originating from a compromised identity. This process can be reversed if the investigation originates from a compromised system.

* Review log sources containing events that affect identity and access.
  + In Azure, these events would include the Azure Active Directory (AD) Audit logs and Sign-in logs.
  + In AWS, these events would be included in CloudTrail.
* Review resource logs, such as logs from virtual machine creation or storage account access. These logs indicate whether a resource has been created or destroyed, or whether data has been written or read from a storage bucket. There could be many other resource logs to review if they were configured ahead of time.
* Review network logs to investigate network communications within the virtual network(s). These might come from the cloud provider solution or third-party firewalls, depending on the environment.
* If needed, perform traditional host-based forensic analysis.

## **Overview of Logs**

### **Azure**

In Azure, logs are organized into five categories:

* **Tenant logs**: These contain information about operations conducted by tenant-wide servicesâ€”most notably, the Azure AD log, which contains audit logs, sign-in logs, and provisioning logs
* **Subscription logs**: Available under the 'Activity log' service, these contain information about resources being created, modified, or deleted.
* **Resource logs**: These can be generated by any resource, such as Network Security Groups (NSG) and Storage Accounts. Resource logs are disabled by default.
* **Operating System logs**: Generated by and collected from virtual machines or containers, these logs need to be configured manually.
* **Application logs**: These include custom logs enabled by the developer. As such, these need to be configured manually.

Azure provides four ways to collect or examine tenant, subscription, and resource logs:
