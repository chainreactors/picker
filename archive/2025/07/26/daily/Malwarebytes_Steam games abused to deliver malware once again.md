# Steam games abused to deliver malware once again

Posted: July 25, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

A cybercriminal known as EncryptHub (aka Larva-208) has [reportedly](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacker-sneaks-infostealer-malware-into-early-access-steam-game/) abused the online game platform Steam to distribute [information stealers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/info-stealers).

EncryptHub managed to sneak malicious files into the Chemia game files hosted on Steam. Chemia is an adventurous survival type of game that puts the player in a world ravaged by a catastrophic natural disaster… which is nothing compared to the real-world disasters that can be caused by information stealers.

Chemia has not been publicly released yet, but was available as an early access on Steam. Steam offers Early Access to certain games primarily as a development model that allows players to purchase and play games while they are still in progress, rather than waiting for a full official release. It helps developers to receive direct, ongoing feedback from the community which they can use to find bugs, balance gameplay, and improve features.

According to security researchers at the [Proactive Defense Against Future Threats (PRODAFT)](https://x.com/PRODAFT), the initial compromise took place on July 22, 2025. EncryptHub added a [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) downloader to the game files that runs alongside the actual application.

The downloader establishes persistence on the affected machine and distributes Fickle Stealer, HijackLoader, and Vidar.

Vidar is a Malware-as-a-Service information stealer which uses public networks such as social media, communication platforms—and Steam—as parts of its Command & Control infrastructure.

HijackLoader is a [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) loader used by attackers to load additional malware (such as Trojans like Danabot or the RedLine stealer) onto infected computers.

The Fickle stealer is a relatively new information stealer which uses PowerShell scripts to bypass User Account Control (UAC) and can steal sensitive files, system information, browser-stored data, [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) wallet details, and more.

As we explained many times before, information stealers can turn your life upside down. Depending on what is stored on the infected device the consequences can range from financial damage to [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft).

In another [case](https://www.pcmag.com/news/steam-used-again-to-trick-gamers-into-installing-malware) of abuse of the Steam platform, we saw a cybercriminal use a sniper video game to distribute malware to unsuspecting gamers. But that criminal didn’t circulate the malicious demo on Steam directly. Instead, the game’s Steam page featured a link to the developer’s external website promoting a demo that turned out to be malware.

A month before that, a game called [Pirat](https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware)[e](https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware)[Fi](https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware) was released on Steam, but turned out to be circulating malware amongst gamers.

With Steam’s huge userbase (over 100 million monthly acti...
