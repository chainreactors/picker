# SAP Business Network for Logistics

## New feature for the Carrier: Mark Freight document as Viewed

### SAP Release: October 2022

In the 'Review Freight Documents' app in the 'No Disputes' tab, you can now select one or more Freight Documents and choose the 'Mark as Viewed' button to mark a document as viewed.

**WHY USE?**

This functionality will allow better visibility of the worklist.
By marking Freight Documents as Viewed, you know exactly what Freights in ‘No disputes’ are still to be checked or to create a dispute.

##### Step 1 – Go to 'Review Freight Documents' app
