You want to break into cybersecurity? That’s AWESOME. I’ve been in the field for 20 years and I LOVE IT!

But embarking into a cybersecurity career can be overwhelming. There is just SO MUCH out there that parsing through it would be an endless task. This concise “cheat sheet” presents a solid 10-step approach to starting your career journey.

1. **Gain baseline knowledge**
   * If you don’t understand how the tech is supposed to wrok, you won’t understand when it’s doing things anomalously. Learn fundamentals of operating systems, networking, and using a command line. You don’t have to be a Linux admin or network engineer to move on to step 2, but get the fundamentals down and keep building your skills while you continue the process.
2. **Build a strong LinkedIn profile**
   * This is your digital resume. Many hiring managers will look you up when you are going for an interview. Plus, you can use it to start networking like a boss (step 9). Use Canva.com (for free!) for great, fast graphics for your bio pics, header images, and social posts.
3. **Stay informed about industry trends**
   * This is CRITICAL! You’ll be asked in any cyber job interview how you stay current. There are many ways, and it takes vigilance, but it is needed in this industry.

4. **Identify your desired role**
   * It’s far too much to learn everything, so find the job/role you have passion for and lean into it.
5. **Connect with role-specific communities**
   * Network and learn from people doing your desired role already. There are lots of Discord communities for all aspects of cyber.
6. **Acquire role-specific training**
   * Practical skills reign supreme for employers hiring, so getting those sweet, sweet, hands-on skills will be valuable.
7. **Tailor your resume to showcase your skills**
   * Use free ChatGPT to tune your resume for specific job postings and get all the benefits without the frustration and exhaustion of constantly tweaking your resume.
8. **Consider earning the Security+ certification**
   * This is very specific, but most HR will put it on entry-level cyber job requirements, so it can pay dividends.
9. **Network and hunt for job opportunities**
   * Fun fact — Many jobs are never advertised because people know people that can do the job, so they get the job. Focus on delivering value, engaging within, and ‘showing up’ for your professional network. Networking is immeasurably valuable.
10. **Ace the job interview**
    * You’ve done all the work; this should be the easiest part. If you want a confidence boost, use free ChatGPT to mock interview you, tailored for the job you’re going for and the person doing the interviewing!
