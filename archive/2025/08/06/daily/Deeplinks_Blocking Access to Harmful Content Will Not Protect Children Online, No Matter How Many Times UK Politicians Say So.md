Online services are also [required](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/consultations/category-1-10-weeks/statement-protecting-children-from-harms-online/main-document/volume-1-overview-scope-and-regulatory-approach.pdf?v=396663) to change their algorithms and moderation systems to ensure that content defined as harmful, like violent imagery, is not shown to young people.
