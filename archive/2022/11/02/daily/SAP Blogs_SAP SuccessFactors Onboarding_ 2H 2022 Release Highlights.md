Hi there,

Second half 2022 release is here!

This blog highlights key enhancements to SuccessFactors Onboarding. My other blogs on EC, RCM & LMS are already live, and you can go thru the below links:

* [SuccessFactors Employee Central](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/29/sap-successfactors-employee-central-2h-2022-release-highlights/)

* [SuccessFactors Learning](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/30/sap-successfactors-lms-2h-2022-release-highlights/)

* [SuccessFactors Recruiting](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/31/sap-successfactors-recruiting-2h-2022-release-highlights/)

To celebrate this most recent release, here’s SuccessFactors Onboarding look at some of the most interesting features and changes introduced since last time.

1. **Enhancements to Onboarding Dashboard (New)**: The new Onboarding Dashboard has been enhanced with new UI elements helping with the onboarding tasks.

These enhancements are as follows:

* Ability to view contact details of new hires and hiring managers by selecting the card next to their names.

* Ability to scan your tasks for new hires and take actions directly from the Onboarding Dashboard(New). If there are pending tasks in a task category assigned to you, a notification badge on the status button lets you know how many tasks you have for this new hire.

* Status of onboarding tasks are buttons now that can be used to start tasks assigned to you. In the Complete My Tasks popup, choosing each task takes you to the corresponding task details page to complete the task.

* The View Details button in each row on the Onboarding Dashboard (New) is replaced with arrow button for navigation to the task details page.

* Configuration Type: Universal

2. **Onboarding Pages Support OnInit Rules**: You can now apply onInit rules to Onboarding pages including New Hire Data Review, Personal Data Collection, and Rehire Data Review. The best thing is now you can also apply onInit rules on the Provide Additional Data page when the onboarding process is initiated from the Add New Hire to Onboarding page. You have turned on the switch in Onboarding General Settings > Business Rules Settings > Allow onInit Rules for Onboarding Pages.

* Configuration Type: Admin Opt-in

* ***Customer Community Idea***

**Note**: Rule context isn't supported for onInit rules. So, all existing onInit rules will take effect on Onboarding pages only after the switch is turned on

3. **Rehire with Old Employment from Onboarding Available in the Manage Pending Hires Tool:** You can now rehire a candidate using details of their previous employment in your organization when processing pending hires coming from Onboarding in the Manage Pending Hires tool.

* Configuration Type: Admin Opt-in

**Note:** The Rehire Inactive Employee (by ‘match’ in New Hire) permission allows you to view the details of former employees who are potential matches for rehire based on their old employment. Ensure that you provide this permission only to admins.

4. **Enhancements to Onboarding Responsible Groups:** SAP took the customers feedback yet again, enhanced the UIs of Onboarding General Settings and increased the limit of users in a responsible group.

List of enhancements made:

* When more than 10 groups are created, exceeded groups are hidden in the more option and you can choose to display all groups.

* Ability to search responsible groups by ID or name and sort responsible groups by name.

* Ability to add up to 200 people from roles, static users, and dynamic groups in one responsible group.

* Configuration Type: Universal

* ***Customer Community Idea***

**Note:** The limit still remains at 20 people for the responsible groups assigned to Form I-9 signature task and E-Verify task and If the selection criteria contain more than 200 people, only the first 200 are added as responsible users. These 200 people are fetched in the order in which they’re added.

5. **Enhanced Welcome Email Notification**: The welcome email notification now is sent to new hires if the onboarding process is restarted before the New Hire Data review step. Cheers! Customers have been waiting for this since the inception of new production. If the Onboarding process is restarted after Onboarding initiation and before the New Hire Data review step, then the welcome email notification is sent to new hires after completing the New Hire Data review step. In the previous version, the welcome email notification wasn’t sent to new hires when the process was restarted before the New Hire Data review step

* Welcome email notification is sent automatically only for the default process variant, Welcome Email ((ONB) External User Welcome Message Trigger. For customized process variant, you must configure the change by choosing Save and Validate and then choose Activate.

* This change is applicable only for the new onboarding process initiations.

* Remember to update updated the custom process variant in Process Variant Manager

* Configuration Type: Universal

* ***Customer Community Idea***

6. **Enhancements to Cancel Onboarding Process:** The error message that appears while cancelling the request for a new hire now shows details about the mandatory fields that can’t be blank. You no longer require Employee Central Foundation OData API (read-only and editable), and Employee Central HRIS OData API (read-only and editable) role-based permissions to cancel an onboardin...
