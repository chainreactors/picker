In this final blog of the series, we will discuss the importance of implementing effective risk-based remediation strategies to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited in your environment. In the earlier blogs, we covered how to operationalize [Qualys TruRisk™](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) and to effectively visualize and measure risk in your environment. Hope you had a pleasant holiday season and that you found the earlier blogs in the series on implementing risk-based vulnerability management with Qualys TruRisk™ to be helpful and informative.

## Focused Remediation

It is important to have a comprehensive and effective patch management process in place to ensure that vulnerabilities are remediated in a timely and efficient manner. [Qualys VMDR 2.0](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) and Qualys TruRisk™ can help streamline and automate the patch management process by providing risk-based prioritization of vulnerabilities and mapping them to the appropriate patches. The prioritization report allows you to view all of the prioritized vulnerabilities and their correlated patches, and you can create a new patch job or add the patches to an existing patch job for individual vulnerabilities or in bulk. Additionally, the prioritization report allows you to deploy all required patches for Windows or Linux for the prioritized vulnerabilities with a single action. By using Qualys VMDR 2.0 and Qualys TruRisk™ along with [Qualys Patch Management](https://www.qualys.com/apps/patch-management/), you can ensure that your patch management process is efficient and effective, helping you to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited in your environment.

## View Missing Patches

The prioritization report in [Qualys VMDR 2.0](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/) allows you to view all of the missing patches required to fix the prioritized vulnerabilities. The report provides patch and asset-level views of the missing patches, allowing you to see the patches that are missing on specific assets and view all vulnerable assets and their missing patches. This can help you identify which patches need to be deployed to address vulnerabilities and ensure that your patch management process is effective. You can then create new patch jobs or add the patches to existing patch jobs to deploy them to the relevant assets.

## Reduce Risk with Automated Remediation

It is important to have an automated patch management process in place to ensure that vulnerabilities are remediated in a timely and efficient manner. Proactive automation can further speed up the process of detection, prioritization, and remediation. [Qualys Patch Management](https://www.qualys.com/apps/patch-management/) allows you to automate the patch management process by creating zero-touch automation jobs that will automatically execute as soon as a new vulnerability with a high Qualys Detection Score is detected e.g:

```
Qualys Detection Score > 90
```

This can help you proactively address newly discovered vulnerabilities with the highest risk to your environment and improve the overall security of your systems. This helps to reduce MTTR for critical vulnerabilities.

By automating the patch management process and leveraging the insights provided by Qualys TruRisk™, you can effectively manage vulnerabilities and reduce the risk of exploitation in your environment.

Hope that the blog series on implementing risk-based vulnerability management with Qualys TruRisk™ was helpful and informative in helping you understand how to effectively use Qualys TruRisk™ to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, and implement effective remediation strategies. Implementing a risk-based approach to vulnerability management with Qualys TruRisk™ can help you prioritize vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of exploitation, allowing you to focus on the most critical vulnerabilities first.
