## Exploit Title: Sielco PolyEco Digital FM Transmitter 2.0.6 - Authentication Bypass Exploit
## Exploit Author: LiquidWorm
#
#
# Sielco PolyEco Digital FM Transmitter 2.0.6 Authentication Bypass Exploit
#
#
# Vendor: Sielco S.r.l
# Product web page: https://www.sielco.org
# Affected version: PolyEco1000 CPU:2.0.6 FPGA:10.19
# PolyEco1000 CPU:1.9.4 FPGA:10.19
# PolyEco1000 CPU:1.9.3 FPGA:10.19
# PolyEco500 CPU:1.7.0 FPGA:10.16
# PolyEco300 CPU:2.0.2 FPGA:10.19
# PolyEco300 CPU:2.0.0 FPGA:10.19
#
# Summary: PolyEco is the innovative family of high-end digital
# FM transmitters of Sielco. They are especially suited as high
# performance power system exciters or compact low-mid power
# transmitters. The same cabinet may in fact be fitted with 50,
# 100, 300, 500, 1000W power stage (PolyEco50, 100, 300, 500,
# 1000).
#
# All features can be controlled via the large touch-screen display
# 4.3" or remotely. Many advanced features are inside by default
# in the basic version such as: stereo and RDS encoder, audio
# change-over, remote-control via LAN and SNMP, "FFT" spectral
# analysis of the audio sources, SFN synchronization and much more.
#
# Desc: The application suffers from an authentication bypass and
# account takeover/lockout vulnerability that can be triggered by
# directly calling the users object and effectively modifying the
# password of the two constants user/role (user/admin). This can
# be exploited by an unauthenticated adversary by issuing a single
# POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and gain unauthorized
# access to the affected device with administrative privileges.
#
# Tested on: lwIP/2.1.1 (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip)
