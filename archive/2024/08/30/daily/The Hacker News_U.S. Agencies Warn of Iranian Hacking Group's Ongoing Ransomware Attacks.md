[![Iranian Hacking](data:image/png;base64... "Iranian Hacking")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPe_n8YxPhw_S9Bx-W16TInTWtxAccBIFMImF8erCisqZQDPG9QBZTTliTUUaX0AwSCmhlt1GKqtpvxVvWW5iU2qG1PWUlYW3iMhyapyuaNOANouXiwogDiAIUZbkxtQAGgZ9hIPxhhoYFy6zPjIKqQfRc35oBqiIaXpI4MU9hGGtBB_sUAeyag6oUuKp9/s790-rw-e365/iran-hackers.png)

U.S. cybersecurity and intelligence agencies have called out an Iranian hacking group for breaching multiple organizations across the country and coordinating with affiliates to deliver ransomware.

The activity has been linked to a threat actor dubbed [Pioneer Kitten](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/who-is-pioneer-kitten/), which is also known as Fox Kitten, Lemon Sandstorm (formerly Rubidium), Parisite, and UNC757, which it described as connected to the government of Iran and uses an Iranian information technology (IT) company, Danesh Novin Sahand, likely as a cover.

"Their malicious cyber operations are aimed at deploying ransomware attacks to obtain and develop network access," the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) [said](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/08/28/cisa-and-partners-release-advisory-iran-based-cyber-actors-enabling-ransomware-attacks-us). "These operations aid malicious cyber actors in further collaborating with affiliate actors to continue deploying ransomware."

Targets of the attacks include education, finance, healthcare, and defense sectors, as well as local government entities in the U.S., with intrusions also reported in Israel, Azerbaijan, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) to pilfer sensitive data.

The goal, the agencies assessed, is to gain an initial foothold to victim networks and subsequently collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors associated with [NoEscape](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/cisa-and-fbi-issue-warning-about.html), [RansomHouse](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/8base-group-deploying-new-phobos.html), and [BlackCat](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/exit-scam-blackcat-ransomware-group.html) (aka ALPHV) to deploy file-encrypting malware in exchange for a cut of the illicit proceeds, while keeping their nationality and origin "intentionally vague."

The attack attempts are believed to have commenced as early as 2017 and are ongoing as recently as this month. The threat actors, who also go by the online monikers Br0k3r and xplfinder, have been found to monetize their access to victim organizations on underground marketplaces, underscoring attempts to diversify their revenue streams.

"A significant percentage of the group's U.S.-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks," the agencies noted. "The actors offer full domain control privileges, as well as domain admin credentials, to numerous networks worldwide."

"The Iranian cyber actors' involvement in these ransomware attacks goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and strategize on approaches to extort victims."

Initial access is accomplished by taking advantage of remote external services on internet-facing assets that are vulnerable to previously disclosed flaws ([CVE-2019-19781](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2019-19781), [CVE-2022-1388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1388), [CVE-2023-3519](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3519), [CVE-2024-3400](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3400), and [CVE-2024-24919](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24919)), followed by a series of steps to persist, escalate privileges, and set up remote access through tools like AnyDesk or the open-source Ligolo tunneling tool.

Iranian state-sponsored [ransomware operations](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/iranian-hackers-using-new-powershell.html) are [not a new phenomenon](https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/iranian-agrius-hackers-targeting.html). In December 2020, cybersecurity companies [Check Point](https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/ransomware-alert-pay2key/) and [ClearSky](https://www.clearskysec.com/pay2kitten/) detailed a Pioneer Kitten hack-and-leak campaign called Pay2Key that specifically singled out dozens of Israeli companies by exploiting known security vulnerabilities.

[![Iranian Hacking](data:image/png;base64... "Iranian Hacking")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-cxM5CaNKpLmm8_eA632FVh0hdQnALATW7ONWAulb6iwUrPo_k1ll-y98mjvg29jDTcLyRpdDCvCxuBf6JnsbI8IP5ordN5JNe70OEN9uzz9hkAU7WIkYq1UO0lbm5FNFvLeA1WTMStJGoNLqp-sbK0mJ-fOKQTtG9-YhdwckRhaYW6NsrjI6oNgYbqxd/s790-rw-e365/ransomware.png)

"The ransom itself ranged between seven and nine Bitcoin (with a few cases in which the attacker was negotiated down to three Bitcoin)," ClearSky noted at the time. "To pressure victims into paying, Pay2Key's leak site displays sensitive information stolen from the target organizations and makes threats of further leaks if the victims continue to delay payments."

Some of the ransomware attacks are also said to have been conducted through an Iranian contracting company named Emennet Pasargad, according to [documents](https://thehackernews.com/2021/05/researchers-uncover-iranian-state.html) leaked by Lab Dookhtegan in early 2021.

The disclosure paints the picture of a flexible group that operates with both ransomware and cyber espionage motives, joining other dual-purpose hacking outfits like [ChamelGang](https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/chinese-and-n-korean-hackers-target.html) and [Moonstone Sleet](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/microsoft-uncovers-m...
