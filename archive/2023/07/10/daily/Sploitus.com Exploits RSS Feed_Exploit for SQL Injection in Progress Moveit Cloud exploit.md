# CVE-2023-34362
POC for CVE-2023-34362 affecting MOVEit Transfer

## Technical Analysis
A technical root cause analysis of the vulnerability can be found on the blog:

## Summary
- This POC abuses an SQL injection to obtain a sysadmin API access token and then uses that access to abuse a deserialization call to obtain remote code execution.

- This POC needs to reach out to an Identity Provider endpoint that hosts proper RS256 certificates used to forge arbitrary user tokens - by default this POC uses our IDP endpoint hosted in AWS.

- The exploit will default write a file to C:\Windows\Temp\message.txt. Alternative payloads can be generated by using the ysoserial.net project.

## Usage
