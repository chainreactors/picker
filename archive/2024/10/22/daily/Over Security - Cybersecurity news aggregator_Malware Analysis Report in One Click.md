Malware Analysis Report in One Click

***Editor’s note:**The current article was originally published on August 16, 2022, and updated on October 21, 2024.*

Malware analysis is a challenge as it is. But after your hard work on cracking a new sample, it is important to present all your results to the company and colleagues. And today, we will talk about how to write a malware analysis report in one click.

## How to write a malware analysis report?

To write a typical malware analysis report, you should cover the following points:

1. **Summary**. Provide the highlights of your research with the malicious program’s name, origin, and main characteristics.
2. **General information**. Include malware type, file’s name, size, and current antivirus detection capabilities. Don’t forget about [hashes](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-identify-malware-similarities/): MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SSDEEP. And if a sample has different family names, it’s worth mentioning them, too.
3. **Characteristics**. Write how the sample infects a system, self-preserves, distributes, communicates with servers, collects data, etc.
4. **Dependencies**. Note malware functionality with the required OS version, software set, executables and initialization files, DLLs, list of URLs, and scripts.
5. **Behavior activities.** Give a review of the behavior activities like what executable files malware drops, if it checks the language, runs injected code in another process, or changes any settings.
6. **Static information.** Code analysis results, headers information.
7. **Additional data**. Attach screenshots, logs, string lines excerpts, etc.
8. **IOCs**. Show indicators of compromise that are necessary for successful detection and future prevention.

## Get an automated malware analysis report with ANY.RUN

It’s essential to save and share your reports for further [cybersecurity strategy](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/build-cybersecurity/) and investigation. And [ANY.RUN sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_content=malware_analysis_report) allows you to do it effortlessly and with just one click.

You can download text reports with detailed information, get PCAP and SSL keys, check request/response content, copy malware config information from the memory dump, use the process graph and MITRE ATT&CK matrix. Besides that, you can export data in JSON format.

We took the [RedLine malware sample](https://app.any.run/tasks/f7206dc8-6f63-4914-bbcd-dc7a6a21728a?_gl=1*13p5qdz*_ga*NDY2MzI0NjQwLjE2NjAxMDg0MzU.*_ga_53KB74YDZR*MTY2MDIyMjU0Mi43LjEuMTY2MDIyMzgxNS42MA../) to show all report examples.

## 1. **Text reports**

Our HTML report is a one-click option to get all data about a sample. It’s a ready-made solution, so you don’t need to write a malware report by yourself. Information is displayed conveniently, so you can easily find whatever you need.

You can also adjust the document online, share and print it. Also, get the report via API.

The text report includes all data from the task:

* created processes
* events and files in the registry
* information about network activity
* IOCs
* screenshots
* process behavior graph

Depending on your goal, you can customize an HTML report and choose what sections to include.

## 2. **JSON** reports

Download a summary of all task information in JSON format. You can parse the maximum information with this file and analyze precisely the data you need. Then include it in the final report to show all malware footprints.
