Threat actors are no strangers to [targeting critical sectors](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/securing-the-nations-critical-infrastructure-action-plans-to-defend-against-cyber-attacks/) to get what they want and the healthcare industry has long worn a target on its back. Exacerbated by the [COVID-19](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/healthcare-and-cybersecurity-in-the-time-of-covid-19/) pandemic and its subsequent variants, hospitals and clinics have seen alarming rates of attacks in recent years with more incidents directly leading to patient endangerment.

A recent [study](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/newsroom/press-releases/new-ponemon-institute-study-finds-cyberattacks-cause-more-twenty-percent) found that cyberattacks have significantly strained healthcare providers, resulting in the following:

* More than 20% of providers surveyed reported experience with common attacks including cloud compromise, ransomware, supply chain, [business email compromise](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/business-email-compromise-bec/) (BEC), and [phishing](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing-scams/)
* Cyberattacks have caused delayed procedures and tests, increased complications in care, and longer patient stays for 57% of the providers surveyed
* Cyberattacks have cost an average of $4.4 million in 2022 with productivity losses totalling $1.1 million

Life-critical services and patient care are at stake when threat actors take aim at healthcare organizations. This post explains why hospitals and clinics of all sizes are so susceptible to cyberattacks and what CISOs and technical leaders can do to build up their cyber defense strategies.

## Understand the Shifting Nature of Ransomware

Medical service providers present two attractive opportunities to financially-motivated cybercriminals: service disruption and data theft.

### Exploiting the Fear of Service Disruption

Over the past few years, [ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/how-ransomware-attacks-are-threatening-our-critical-infrastructure/) attacks have been the direct cause of many major disruptions in healthcare service. By locking out medical staff from accessing their critical tools and databases, ransomware has been responsible for [canceled surgeries](https://www.route-fifty.com/public-safety/2022/05/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-put-patients-risk/367117/), [delayed cancer treatments](https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e13620), and even an ongoing lawsuit on what is being called the [first death by ransomware](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/baby-died-due-ransomware-attack-hospital-suit-claims-rcna2465). In November 2022, for example, the [Brooklyn hospital group](https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/it-network-crash-at-brooklyn-hospitals-with-ties-to-hochul/) was thrown into chaos as services were disrupted across its patient care facilities in the wake of a cyber attack.

Victims from this sector are [reportedly](https://assets.sophos.com/X24WTUEQ/at/4wxp262kpf84t3bxf32wrctm/sophos-state-of-ransomware-healthcare-2022-wp.pdf) most likely to pay the ransom with 61% of providers having paid out compared to an average of 46% from other industry verticals. Ransomware operators know that medical facilities face devastating consequences should they lose access to their systems.

Though CISA and law enforcement groups have issued [warnings](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Ransomware_Response_Checklist_508.pdf) against paying ransoms, each minute without access can result in extremely dangerous situations for patients needing care. As such, threat actors continue to beleaguer hospitals, long-term care facilities, private clinics and more, marking them as high-profile targets.

### Medical Data Is In High Demand

Some ransomware threat actors have understood that service disruption can be minimized by organizations that implement a good backup and disaster recovery model. File-locking can be devastating to the unprepared, but it can be mitigated against with a degree of planning.

However, hospitals and clinics especially hold mass amounts of sensitive data on their clients – data that is easily sold on [dark marketplaces](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/more-evil-markets-how-its-never-been-easier-to-buy-initial-access-to-compromised-networks/) and used for identity theft and fraud.

The high worth  of private patient information ranging from contact details and social insurance numbers to payment data and Protected Health Information (PHI) has driven up the rate of attacks on healthcare organizations.

Attacks on healthcare from a data theft point of view has become a fast growing issue, with [297 known attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/cyberattacks-us-hospitals-mean-higher-mortality-rates-study-finds-rcna46697) occurring last year. In one incident in October 2022, [Hive ransomware](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hive-attacks-analysis-of-the-human-operated-ransomware-targeting-healthcare/) operators stole sensitive files from [LCMHS](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/louisiana-hospital-suffered-a-ransomware-attack/) (Lake Charles Memorial Hospital) belonging to 270,000 patients. The stolen data included medical records, health insurance information and payment information. Some patients’ social security numbers were also exposed.

Payment data like credit card numbers can be frozen and replaced, but medical history such as test results, diagnoses, and treatment plans cannot be removed or canceled. This data, in the hands of an opportunistic threat actor, can mean long-reaching damage for affected patients. When private health data is hacked, victims may find themselves at the mercy of targeted ransom demands and blackmail attempts.

Recognizing that data extortion can be both [more profitable and less resource-intensive](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/ransoms-without-ransomware-data-corruption-and-other-new-tactics-in-cyber-extortion/), some threat actors have moved to extortion-only methods. Disaster recovery plans cannot mitigate this threat, and effective defense requires having [trusted security software](https://www.sentinelone.com/platform) in place that can prevent and detect initial access before data is stolen.

## Outdated Systems Bear Many Low-Hanging Fruits of Access

For threat actors, outdated environments and lack of advanced security features spell opportunity for breach. In a [notification](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2022/220912.pdf) to medical provider leaders, the FBI highlighted the risk that older, unpatched medical devices bring to digital systems used in hospitals and clinics.

Due to the highly specialized nature of technology in healthcare, the high cost of implementing and maintaining new systems hinders many small and medium-sized providers from upgrading regularly. Many healthcare organizations must work within limited budgets and may not have prioritized the need to update older systems.

However, when the security angle is factored into the intrinsic value of such equipment, there’s a strong argument for reassessing budgetary priorities in favor of accelerating th...
