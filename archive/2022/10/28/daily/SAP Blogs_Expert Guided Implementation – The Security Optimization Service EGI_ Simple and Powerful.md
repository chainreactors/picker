The SOS EGI: simple and powerful as Victoria Carroll explains.

Kathryn Rennard, Global Topic Owner – Security in SAP Enterprise Support Value Maps, interviews Victoria Carroll from the SAP Data Science, Automation & Technology team.

---

#### **Victoria, you are one of the SAP experts that deliver the Security Optimization Service EGI.  Can you first explain what an “EGI” is?**

An Expert-Guided Implementation (EGI) is a delivery methodology from SAP that balances and blends virtual classroom training with practical hands-on experience.  An expert, such as myself, delivers these sessions and is available for questions and guidance throughout, making the empowerment experience effective and meaningful.

#### **How is an EGI different from standard training offered by SAP?**

An EGI is a multi-day workshop with each day beginning with a 1-2 hour virtual **Empowerment** session where the instructor explains and shows the activities that need to be done.  Each afternoon, the participants **execute** the demonstrated steps within their own project environment putting the theory immediately into practice.  Throughout the EGI, the participants have direct access to the trainer as an **Expert-on-Demand** to support them remotely as necessary.  It is this combination that makes the EGI so special.

The content builds day-upon-day so that by the end of the training, the participant has successfully completed the class objective with a verified setup in their own environment, has developed a solid understanding of the material, and is comfortable and confident to repeat the activities as and when required.

#### **What is the SAP Security Optimization Service?**

The SAP Security Optimization Service (SOS) is a deep dive security analysis of an SAP system in a customer’s landscape.

Depending on the SAP Solution, there can be up to 300 different checks in the SOS that reflect SAP best practices and recommendations.  The focus of the service is on both internal and external system security:

* To improve the internal security, system settings, customizing settings, and many critical authorizations are checked.

* External security is improved by checking the accessibility of the system and the authentication methods used.

The outputted SOS report identifies potential gaps with various security risk severities and (importantly) includes recommendations to reduce, mitigate or counter the vulnerabilities.

#### **What is the value of the SAP Security Optimization Service?**

Security touches everything from the design of a new system, its implementation, and then the ongoing maintenance and operational activities.  The SOS is an excellent starting point for technical basis administrators, security and compliance teams, to review that security is in line with SAP best practices.

Analysis is the key to this value and the heart of the service.  Visibility offers the insight to take appropriate measures to:

* Decrease the risk of a system intrusion

* Ensure the confidentiality of business data

* Ensure the authenticity of users

* Substantially reduce the risk of costly downtime (perhaps due to wrong user interaction if the user is over-privileged)

#### **How often should an SOS be performed?**

SAP suggests executing an SOS annually for all applicable productive systems at a minimum.  Core system more frequently.  Other scenarios include:

* After maintenance activities, such as an upgrade

* As part of an implementation project or GoLive

* In preparation for an internal or external security audit

#### **If SAP can deliver an SOS for a customer, why is the EGI necessary?**

Although SAP experts can deliver an SAP Security Optimization Service for you, it must be scheduled with a minimum 4-week advance request, with additional days for completion, delivery, and review.  To make this information readily accessible, SAP created the capability for customers to analyze their own systems using their SAP Solution Manager system in a simple guided self-service form.

This 4-day Expert Guided Implementation guides you through the steps to configure the session as a self-service for use upon demand using your inhouse resources.  Furthermore, it can be customized to your specific needs and context, in other words: you can exclude well-known power users with extensive access that are risk-approved for use within your organization.  Ultimately, this allows customers to analyze ABAP technology, Java technology and SAP HANA systems as needed… with immediate results and recommendations!

SAP Enterprise Support and PSLE customers can use the full functional scope of SAP Solution Manager which includes this functionality as standard (i.e. there are no additional license costs).

#### **What do you cover in this EGI?**

During the EGI, we cover the necessary **pre-requisites** to ensure a smooth experience.  The pre-requisites differ based on the SAP system being analyzed, and each of the scenarios is reviewed.

We cover how to properly use the optional **questionnaire** to sharpen the focus on the real risks (the unknowns) whilst rem...
