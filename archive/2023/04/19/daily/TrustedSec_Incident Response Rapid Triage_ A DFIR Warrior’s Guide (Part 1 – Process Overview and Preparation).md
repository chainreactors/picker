In this series, I will be discussing how to handle an incident with the speed and precision of a DFIR warrior. With a rapid triage mindset, you'll be able to assess the situation quickly and efficiently, just like a Jiu-Jitsu practitioner sizing up their opponent before delivering a devastating submission. You will have the tools to identify the type and severity of the attack, isolate the affected systems, and implement countermeasures to contain the damage—all in a fraction of the time it previously took you.

Part 1 of this series focuses on three (3) critical components that are often forgotten once an incident has been declared: following an incident triage process, centralized incident analysis document preparation, and ongoing communication requirements.

This Incident Response rapid triage process will incorporate the following aspects:

* Incident setup preparation
  + Centralized analysis documentation
  + Incident communication and reporting
* Critical incident objectives
* Key security solution access
* Windows system processing
  + Windows event log
  + $MFT and $UsnJrnl journal
  + Registry hives
  + Memory image
* Network data processing
  + Firewall
  + DNS
  + Proxy\web filter
  + NetFlow
  + PCAP

*Disclaimer: This process does not cover all triage aspects when responding to an incident scenario, but from my experience, it does focus on the most critical components during the first few hours of the Incident Response.*

This process does not utilize any paid tools and does not take into consideration a centralized DFIR collaboration setup or anything high-speed. The targeted audience for this blog post is analysts utilizing local tools or portable forensic virtual machines. A scenario to envision: an Incident Response consultant blindly jumping into a compromised network and either working onsite exclusively out of their go-bag or working completely remotely and visually disconnected from the client environment. That being said, this process could also be used as a stepping stone to build out a significantly more robust incident triage playbook that could be used by any organization's Incident Response team.

So, whether you're a seasoned DFIR pro or just starting out within Incident Response, hopefully you will uncover some useful insights.

*Let's do this!*
