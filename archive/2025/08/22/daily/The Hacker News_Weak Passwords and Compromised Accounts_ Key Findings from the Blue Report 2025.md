As security professionals, it's easy to get caught up in a race to counter the latest advanced adversary techniques. Yet the most impactful attacks **often aren't from cutting-edge exploits, but from cracked credentials and compromised accounts**. Despite widespread awareness of this threat vector, Picus Security's **Blue Report 2025** shows that organizations continue to struggle with **preventing password cracking attacks** and **detecting the malicious use of compromised accounts**.

With the first half of 2025 behind us, **compromised valid accounts remain the most underprevented attack vector**, highlighting the urgent need for a **proactive approach focused on the threats that are evading organizations' defenses.**

## A Wake-Up Call: The Alarming Rise in Password Cracking Success

The **[Picus Blue Report](https://hubs.ly/Q03CLGfh0)** is an annual research publication that analyzes how well organizations are preventing and detecting real-world cyber threats. Unlike traditional reports that focus solely on threat trends or survey data, the Blue Report is based on **empirical findings from over 160 million attack simulations** conducted within organizations' networks around the world, using the **[Picus Security Validation Platform](https://www.picussecurity.com/security-validation-platform)**.

In the **Blue Report 2025**, Picus Labs found that **password cracking attempts succeeded in 46% of tested environments**, nearly doubling the success rate from last year. This sharp increase highlights a fundamental weakness in how organizations are managing – or mismanaging – their password policies. **Weak passwords** and **outdated hashing algorithms** continue to leave critical systems vulnerable to attackers using **brute-force** or **rainbow table attacks** to crack passwords and gain unauthorized access.

Given that password cracking is one of the **oldest and most reliably effective attack methods**, this finding points to a serious issue: in their race to combat the latest, most sophisticated new breed of threats, **many organizations are failing to enforce strong basic password hygiene policies while failing to adopt and integrate modern authentication practices into their defenses**.

### **Why Organizations Are Failing to Prevent Password Cracking Attacks**

So, why are organizations still failing to prevent password cracking attacks? The root cause lies in the **continued use of weak passwords** and **outdated credential storage methods**. Many organizations still rely on easily guessable passwords and weak hashing algorithms, often without using proper salting techniques or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

In fact, our survey results showed that **[46% of environments](https://hubs.ly/Q03CLGfh0)** [had at least one password hash cracked](https://hubs.ly/Q03CLGfh0) and converted to cleartext, highlighting the inadequacy of many password policies, particularly for **internal accounts**, where controls are often more lax than they are for their external counterparts.

To combat this, organizations must **enforce stronger password policies**, **implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users**, and **regularly validate their credential defenses**. Without these improvements, attackers will continue to compromise valid accounts, obtaining easy access to critical systems.

### **Credential-Based Attacks: A Silent but Devastating Threat**

The threat of **credential abuse** is both pervasive and dangerous, yet as the **Blue Report 2025** highlights, organizations are still **underprepared** for this form of attack. And once attackers obtain valid credentials, they can **easily move laterally**, **escalate privileges**, and **compromise critical systems**.

**Infostealers** and **ransomware groups** frequently rely on stolen credentials to **spread across networks**, burrowing deeper and deeper, often **without triggering detection**. This **stealthy movement** within the network allows attackers to **maintain long dwell times**, undetected, while they **exfiltrate data at will**.

Despite this ongoing and well-known issue, organizations continue to prioritize perimeter defenses, often leaving **identity and credential protection** overlooked and under-funded as a result. This year's Blue Report clearly shows that **valid account abuse** is at the core of modern cyberattacks, reinforcing the urgent need for a stronger focus on **identity security** and **credential validation**.

### **Valid Accounts (T1078): The Most Exploited Path to Compromise**

One of the key findings in the [Blue Report 2025](https://hubs.ly/Q03CLGfh0) is that **Valid Accounts (MITRE ATT&CK T1078)** remains the **most exploited attack technique**, with a truly concerning **98% success rate**. This means that once attackers gain access to valid credentials, whether through **password cracking** or **initial access brokers**, they can swiftly move through an organization's network, often bypassing traditional defenses.

The use of **compromised credentials** is particularly effective because it allows attackers to **operate under the radar**, making it harder for security teams to detect malicious activity. Once inside, they can **access sensitive data**, **deploy malware**, or **create new attack paths**, all while seamlessly blending in with legitimate user activity.

### **How to Strengthen Your Defenses Against Credential Abuse and Password Cracking**

To protect against increasingly effective attacks, organizations should **implement stronger password policies** and enforce **complexity requirements**, while eliminating outdat...
