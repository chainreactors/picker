# Android threats rise sharply, with mobile malware jumping by 151% since start of year

Posted: June 30, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) threat landscape in the first half of 2025 has entered a new phase. An era marked not just by volume, but by coordination and precision. Attackers are no longer simply throwing [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) at users and hoping for results. They’re building ecosystems .

Recent Malwarebytes threat research data reveals a sharp rise in mobile threats across the board, with malware targeting [Android devices](https://www.malwarebytes.com/android-antivirus) up 151%.

We’ve seen a 147% increase in [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware), a broad category of apps that collect user data without consent, with a notable spike in Feb and March. In fact, the February/March levels represent nearly a 4x multiplication of the baseline.

Perhaps even more alarming is a 692% spike in SMS-based malware between April and May, a jump that we can’t just chalk up to coincidence. It could be due to seasonal scams like those we always see around [tax season](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/04/urgent-reminder-tax-scam-wants-to-phish-your-microsoft-credentials), which hit consumers hard this year, or widespread campaigns like [toll fee scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/05/new-warning-issued-over-toll-fee-scams), which also come in surges.

These numbers reflect a shift in strategy: Attackers are scaling operations, fine-tuning delivery, and exploiting both human psychology and systemic weak points. Take Spyloan, for example, a threat that lures targets with incredible loan conditions (low rates, no pre-check) but ends up stealing from desperate people. We saw a significant spike in May of this predatory app, which could well signal a resurgence for the summer. We’ll continue to monitor this uptick.

Banking [Trojans](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan) and [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware) are now outpacing more traditional nuisances like [adware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware) and [riskware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/glossary/riskware), and what’s changed is the level of sophistication. Threat actors are actively distributing malware through both official and unofficial app channels, often cloaking malicious apps behind layers of legitimacy.

Fake financial tools, predatory loan apps, and cleverly disguised “updates” aren’t just slipping through the cracks, they are being engineered with that objective in mind. Peaks in their activity often coincide with periods of personal stress, like tax season or holiday travel, suggesting a methodical approach to targeting.

As Sr. Director, Research and Development, Online Platforms at Malwarebytes, Shahak Shalev explains:

> Attackers know we trust our mobile devices implicitly—we bank on them, authenticate with them, store our entire digital lives on them. Now attackers are amping up the volume and sophistication of mobile threats. When spyware jumps 147% in five months, that tells us attackers are moving beyond simple scams to building sustainable criminal enterprises. They’re playing the long game now — developing monetization strategies for every type of data they can harvest; every user behavior they can [exploit](https://www.malwareby...
