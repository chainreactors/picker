This article shows you how you can perform SAP Commissions Service Health Check regularly and how to consume it daily. This feature will help you to improve the availability of your SAP Commissions tenant Service and send an alert when service is DOWN to all communication channels ( Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, MS Teams, PagerDuty .. etc)

No matter how well you plan, you will always need to be prepared to deal with unforeseen and unforeseeable events.so Introducing Health Check API for your SAP Commissions in K8 tenant

### When Should We Use Health Checks?

When we have Health Checks, you can create very granular, specific checks for certain services, which helps us greatly when diagnosing issues with Commission application tenant infrastructure, as we can easily see which service/dependency is performing poorly. SAP Commissions application may still be up and running, but in a degraded state that we can’t easily see by simply using the application, so having Health Checks in place give us a better understanding of what a healthy state of your application looks like.

Instead of relying on your Admin users reporting an issue with the application, we can monitor our application health constantly and be proactive in understanding where your application isn’t functioning correctly and make adjustments as needed.

### An example:

**Downtime** can arise due to certain crucial parts of your application breaking, thereby bringing down the whole system. For instance, if the database crashes, SAP Commissions application will no longer be able to properly service most requests. The best way to minimize this is to have data about running servers, giving us room to react before anything goes wrong.

### Alerts

You can still set up alerts based on the type of HTTP responses or JSON parameter - UP or DOWN to send quickly to different communication channels which you would be using daily and that gets info to your operations team to act on it or Raise Support ticket immed.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/04/2023-04-15_11-47-48.gif)

## Advantages of Health Check

1. Improved User Experience: Regular application or portal health checks can help ensure that users are having a positive experience when accessing the portal. This can include verifying that website navigation is functioning properly, that all links are working, and that content is up-to-date and relevant.

2. Improved Performance: Regular health checks can help identify potential performance issues or areas of improvement, such as slow loading times, data access bottlenecks, or inadequate server resources. This can help to ensure that the application or portal is running optimally.

3. Increased Security: Regular health checks can help identify potential security vulnerabilities, such as outdated software or weak passwords. This can help prevent malicious attacks and data breaches.

4. Reduced Maintenance Costs: Regular health checks can help reduce the amount of time and money required for routine maintenance and updates, as potential issues can be identified and addressed before they become major problems.

## SAP Commissions Health Check API Endpoint

| --- |
| **Health Check Service is available only in SAP Commissions K8 running on Google Cloud Platform.** **This blog information content is applicable only for tenants starting with \*\*\*\*.app.commissions.cloud.sap** |

A simpler way to track an API is to create a single route that responds with a simple “**UP**” or “**DOWN**” message to indicate whether key parts of our application are working or not. This could be useful when debugging often cryptic client-side errors.

The health endpoint can be queried like so:![2024-04-11_22-59-35.png](/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/95267i7F7BAF67BAFBCB48/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 "2024-04-11_22-59-35.png")
Or by calling the more compact version:

```
$ curl -S https://xyzy.app.commissions.cloud.sap/tm/v1/ping

{
"status": "ok"
}
```
