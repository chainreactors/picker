# How a scam hunter got scammed (Lock and Code S06E17)

Posted: August 24, 2025
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

If there’s one thing that scam hunter Julie-Anne Kearns wants everyone to know, it is that no one is immune from a scam. And she would know—she fell for one last year.

For years now, Kearns has made a name for herself on TikTok as a scam awareness and education expert. Popular under the name [@staysafewithmjules](https://www.tiktok.com/%40staysafewithmjules), Kearns makes videos about scam identification and defense. She has posted countless profile pictures that are used and repeated by online scammers across different accounts. She has flagged active scam accounts on Instagram and detailed their strategies. And, perhaps most importantly, she answers people’s questions.

In fielding everyday comments and concerns from her followers and from strangers online, Kearns serves as a sort of gut-check for the internet at large. And by doing it day in, day out, Kearns is able to hone her scam “radar,” which helps guide people to safety.

But last year, [Kearns fell for a scam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/scam-hunter-scammed-by-tax-office-impersonators), disguised initially as a letter from HM Revenue & Customs, or HMRC, the tax authority for the United Kingdom.

Today, on the Lock and Code podcast with host David Ruiz, we speak with Kearns about the scam she fell for and what she’s lost, the worldwide problem of victim blaming, and the biggest warning signs she sees for a variety of scams online.

> “A lot of the time you think that it’s somebody who’s silly—who’s just messing about. It’s not. You are dealing with criminals.”

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
