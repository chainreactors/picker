Recent weeks have seen [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) catapult to the front of social media attention in Infosec circles after a flurry of tweets and postings appeared demonstrating how [OpenAI’s](https://openai.com/) ChatGPT can be utilized to automate and assist in various cybersecurity tasks.

In this post, we show how ChatGPT can bring value to reverse engineers and malware analysts, both those just entering the field as well as more experienced professionals. We will give specific examples and highlight some of the pitfalls for the following reverse engineering and malware analysis challenges:

* Learning how to use reverse engineering tools more effectively
* Teaching yourself assembly language
* Understanding how source code translates to disassembly
* Writing POC source code quickly
* Translating between instruction sets
* Comparing language or platform specific conventions
* Analyzing code segments in malware samples
* Identifying malicious activities in code
* Speculating on function purposes and objectives
* Understanding vulnerabilities and exploit code
* Automating reverse engineering tasks

## Getting the Most Out of ChatGPT

Before we start, there are a few things to bear in mind when using ChatGPT.

First, ChatGPT has been trained using publicly available data. Its abilities to provide accurate and up-to-date answers are no better than the accuracy and relevance of its training data. For example, ‘help’ questions on rapidly developing applications may refer to older versions than those the user has to hand. Similarly, code excerpts on evolving languages like Go, Rust and Swift, may use APIs or conventions that have already been superseded.

Even on topics that appear to be relatively well-established, ChatGPT’s output is very much ‘the thoughts of the crowd’, not ‘irrefutable facts’. Naturally, those two may often overlap, but it’s not necessarily always the case. Thus, think of ChatGPT’s output as the opinion of a well-informed guide that you need to confirm for yourself rather than the arbiter of truth on any given topic.

Second, ChatGPT does not provide what we might call ‘deterministic’ answers: it may give different answers to the same or similar questions at different times, and when asked in different ways. This can be used to advantage: rewording and refining a question can lead to better answers. The ‘Regenerate response’ option at the end of each answer can kick ChatGPT into providing more detail, and adding context to the question can help make answers more relevant.

With those caveats in mind, let’s start exploring how ChatGPT can help us solve some common reverse engineering and malware analysis challenges.

## 1. Learn How To Use Reverse Engineering Tools More Effectively

Software tools usually come with varying degrees of built-in help, and what they lack is usually made up for by dedicated user forums and Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, Stack Exchange and others. ChatGPT adds another avenue for getting rapid help on reverse engineering tools.

Whether you are using [IDA Pro](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/alphagolang-a-step-by-step-go-malware-reversing-methodology-for-ida-pro/), [Ghidra](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/a-guide-to-ghidra-scripting-development-for-malware-researchers/), [Radare2](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/the-art-and-science-of-macos-malware-hunting-with-radare2-leveraging-xrefs-yara-and-zignatures/), Hopper, Cutter or some other reverse enginering platform, ChatGPT can help. While all these platforms contain their own built-in help functions, if the issues have been covered in ChatGPT’ss training model, you may find its ability to answer specific questions relative to your own use case a faster way to get things done.

## 2. Teach Yourself Assembly Language

When it comes to the basics of assembly and memory management techniques of programming languages and platforms – topics that any prospective reverse engineer should be familiar with – ChatGPT excels at conveying relevant information.

For example,  ChatGPT provides informative answers to inquiries about the basics of function invocation and the related stack memory management activities.

We can ask ChatGPT to be more or less verbose in its output. Here for example, we would like to get a visual representation of a stack frame but without the chatter.

Assembly code is platform- and compiler-specific. If an assembly-related question issued to ChatGPT does not include specificalities related to a platform (i.e., instruction set) or a higher-level language from which assembly is compiled, ChatGPT provides relevant disclaimer information to properly position the answer.

This provides a good learning experience, especially since a user can continue the conversation and issue additional questions that contain platform or compiler specificalities for further details. An assembly student could benefit significantly by continuously conversing with ChatGPT on a given topic so that ChatGPT could cover more angles as the conversation progresses.

Another way in which ChatGPT can assist conquering assembly is by translating high-level code that the user is familiar with to assembly code. This bolsters learning by mapping familiar concepts to assembly. We observed that ChatGPT handles well a variety of topics, including non-trivial concepts that are crucial when it comes to learning assembly, such as pointers and function pointer invocations. ChatGPT’s responses typically include commented assembly code, which further increases the learning effect.

## 3. Understand How Source Code Translates to Disassembly

As malware analysts, much of the time we are looking at malware through the eyes of a disassembler. Experience and knowledge of a programming language are vital here, but ChatGPT can help us to learn how known source code looks in a disassembler, and how code changes are reflected in disassembly. Novices can use this to theorize about what some disassembled code might be doing by writing their own source code and seeing if it is suitably similar to the disassembly they are looking at. This can help less experienced analysts develop their understanding about malicious code.

## 4. Write PoC Source Code Quickly

ChatGPT can even help us to write the source code we need to test our theories. For example, we can ask the AI the following questions:
