# ACE & MPA Continued to Scoop Up Pirate Domains in Bulk During Q2 2025

In Q2 2025, anti-piracy coalition Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment continued to 'seize' domains in bulk, adding to the world's largest collection of former pirate domains maintained by the MPA. While the archive contains countless unique and memorable domains, many with interesting and informative backstories, new additions illustrate typical responses to site blocking measures and very little else.

No surprise then that both are considered priority anti-piracy targets to be blocked, tampered with, seized by law enforcement, or sacrificed when anti-piracy groups get a little too close.

Courts are also known to transfer ownership of domains in copyright lawsuits, or if the parties remain on speaking terms, a private agreement can have a similar effect. The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment and the Motion Picture Association have amassed more domains previously used for piracy than any other group in history.

## ACE: Domain Hunters

Pirate domains are ‘seized’ through various legal means to ensure they aren’t used for the same purpose again. They’re ultimately transferred to the Motion Picture Association, which still has decades-old examples such as isoHunt.com in its archives.

Relics like these are unlikely to see action anytime soon but have proven useful in the past.

The MPAA’s ‘You Can Click But You Can’t Hide’ campaign in 2003 saw pirate domains like [LokiTorrent.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20050210215106/http%3A//www.lokitorrent.com/) briefly converted into online PSA billboards. A similar concept is operational today but is substantially more sophisticated than its predecessors.

There are no veiled threats on the thousands of domains seized by ACE over the last few years; just a seizure notice followed by a redirect to the ACE portal, where visitors can discover more about ACE members and learn why consuming legal content is a better, safer choice than the alternative.

## ACE/MPA Builds on a Solid Q1 2025

As [reported in April](https://torrentfreak.com/ace-mpa-quietly-seized-dozens-of-pirate-domains-in-q1-2025-250419/), ACE domain seizures were numerous in the first quarter of 2025. Our count of around 80 domains is an estimate based on information from various sources since no official figures are made available. In Q2 2025, over 110 domains were commandeered by MPA/ACE, redirecting millions of unsuspecting visitors to its anti-piracy portal.

In many ways the seizure list for Q2 2025 paints a fairly typical yet dismal picture of how ISP domain blocking fuels endless hopping from domain to domain as sites deploy the most obvious countermeasure. Some domains are later handed over to ACE in bulk, marking the end of the site. For other platforms that simply means starting the process all over again, in preparation for the next time, and the time after that.

While ACE/MPA hasn’t shown particular interest in Italy-focused streaming brand *Altadefinizione*, its domains wouldn’t look out of place when compared to those of counterparts Calcio and Calciostreaming in the list above.

How many domains the site has burned through circumventing blocking measures in Italy is unclear but there are at least 900 domains with similar branding and with the addition of just a single character, at least 900 more become available – ad infinitum. In the near future, this could become standard practice for the majority of large sites.

## A Messy Environment

In addition to reliance on data from third-party sources to determine seizures, there are several complications that could lead to more or less being counted in a period overall.

Some pirate operators appear to direct their domains towards the ACE portal seemingly voluntarily, with historical records showing a few domains attempting to use MPA DNS for short unexplained periods. Some domain extensions also present challenges when trying to determine links to a particular site and in a relatively small number of cases, that ultimately proves impossible.

Since pirates tend to register domains for the shortest time possible, MPA renewals of expiring domains that look very much like dozens of others it also controls (and dozens of newcomers it does not) can make the checking process a chore, even for a few outliers.

Once treated as prized possessions, domains are now considered consumables; register, rinse out, and then replace – often with a second-rate, confusingly similar copy, also to be dumped in the not-too-distant future.

## Transparency

With domain seizures and site blocking measures on an upward trajectory, and transparency alluded to but rarely provided, tracking with any degree of accuracy is becoming more difficult. Eventually it will only be possible for those with access to the data and/or interested parties in a position to commit significant resources.

Finally, like most websites these days, visitors to the ACE portal are subject to tracking. In practical terms, that’s likely to be of limited concern compared to the undocumented extras available at whichever pirate site people were originally hoping to visit, or indeed, most search engines and shopping platforms available today. Nevertheless, it’s still valuable data.

Access to data is important, but currently extremely one-sided.
