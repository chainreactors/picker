You can ask questions about the tool or OSINT in general and I will be more than happy to help.

I can't believe it's already fifth season of Offensive OSINT, paraphrasing Community - "Four seasons and a movie", this is the last season of Offensive OSINT, which focuses on the OSS and I'm not sure if it will be finished.

Alpha version was released at the end of January and around 300 people signed up for the project, what is very satisfying based on my advertising and amount of Twitter followers.

I have met interesting people and made a solid connections in variety field of cyber security and intelligence. In addition, since first release, Open Source Surveillance went through completely new phase including graphical interface, modules & sources or backend stability.

Enough of the story, let's talk about the tool finally.
