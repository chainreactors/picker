As much as I’d love to, we’re not here to talk about baked goods. Cookies are commonly used on websites and an essential component of the modern-day internet. However, they can pose a risk to your privacy and personal information.

In today’s post we’re going to explore what cookies are, why websites use them, how they work in your browser, and how to mitigate risk. Let’s dig in!

## What is a cookie?

In the simplest of terms, **a cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device whenever you visit a website**. These tiny pieces of data are stored as a text file and used to help a website remember information about you — for example, your browsing preferences or login information.

Any data that is stored in a cookie is created by the web server whenever you visit a site. It’s labeled with a unique identifier that helps the server and website know what information to serve to you.

## How do cookies work?

When you visit a domain, the web server sends a cookie to your device or computer which is then stored by your browser. Every time you visit that domain, your browser passes that same cookie back to the server to identify you. It then delivers an experience tailored to your previous browsing history.

## Why do websites use cookies?

Cookies are used by websites for a number of reasons.

* **Personalization:** Cookies help a website remember your personal information and provide experiences based on your preferences. For example: a website might store a cookie to remember that your preferred language is Spanish and automatically deliver Spanish content whenever you visit the domain.
* **Convenience**: Enabling cookies can make it easier for users to access accounts. For example, a website might store a cookie with your login information so you don’t need to enter your credentials every time you go to the site.
* **Tracking:** Marketers and webmasters often use cookies to track and analyze how many users navigate to different pages and interact with the domain. Often, this information is then used to enhance the website’s performance or understand user behavior.
* **Targeted Ads:** Cookies are often used to display ads based on browsing history. For example, if you visit a website to research an upcoming family cruise vacation, a cookie might be used to show you ads for cruise ships on other websites.

But not all cookies are created equal. Let’s examine the differences between them.

## What are the different types of cookies?

There are two common types of cookies that websites use: **persistent cookies** and **session cookies**.

### Persistent cookies

A persistent cookie is used for authentication and to personalize your browsing experience. These cookies contain information about sign-on credentials, settings, theme selections, and language preferences.

Remember that time when you came back to Amazon to complete your shopping and saw old items still in your cart? That’s a great example of how a website might store information about your browsing history in a persistent cookie and retrieve it for you at a later date.

### Session cookies

A session cookie is created by the web server and used to store information about your browsing session. Also known as non-persistent cookies or transient cookies, these server-specific cookies are stored in a temporary memory location instead of a location on your device. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted as soon as your session is done.

As soon as you launch a web app or website, your browsing session starts and a session cookie is created by the server. This session cookie stores details about your movements around the website and tracks user inputs. As soon as your session ends, the session cook...
