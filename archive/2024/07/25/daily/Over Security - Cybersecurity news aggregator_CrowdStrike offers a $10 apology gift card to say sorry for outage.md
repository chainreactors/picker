# CrowdStrike offers a $10 apology gift card to say sorry for outage

CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm [that crashed millions of computers with a botched update](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/19/what-we-know-about-crowdstrikes-update-fail-thats-causing-global-outages-and-travel-chaos/) all over the world last week, is offering its partners a $10 Uber Eats gift card as an apology, according to [several](https://x.com/1337ice_cream/status/1815958499496472859) [people](https://x.com/mark_ledain/status/1816144068466160114) [who](https://x.com/david__exe/status/1815908023296221372) [say](https://x.com/christappin/status/1816039053357375720?s=46&t=lLf2YRXhv7kG_Tw6dp_nCA) [they](https://x.com/JohnnySorenson3/status/1816145260738744369) [received](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1eao0fn/crowdstrike_sent_me_10_as_a_thanks/) the gift card, as well as a source who also received one.

On Tuesday, a source told TechCrunch that they received an email from CrowdStrike offering them the gift card because the company recognizes “the additional work that the July 19 incident has caused.”

“And for that, we send our heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience,” the email read, according to a screenshot shared by the source. The [same email](https://x.com/64uni_lions/status/1815928437774995555) was also posted on X by someone else. “To express our gratitude, your next cup of coffee or late night snack is on us!”

The email was sent from a CrowdStrike email address in the name of [Daniel Bernard](https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-crowdstrike/executive-team/daniel-bernard/), the company’s chief business officer, according to a screenshot of the email seen by TechCrunch. According to [one post](https://x.com/david__exe/status/1815908023296221372) on X, in the United Kingdom the voucher was worth £7.75, or roughly $10 at today’s exchange rate.

On Wednesday, some of the people who posted about the gift card said that when they went to redeem the offer, they got an error message saying the voucher had been canceled. When TechCrunch checked the voucher, the Uber Eats page provided an error message that said the gift card “has been canceled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.”

CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci confirmed to TechCrunch that the company sent the gift cards.

“We did send these to our teammates and partners who have been helping customers through this situation. Uber flagged it as fraud because of high usage rates,” Benacci said in an email.

On Friday, CrowdStrike released a faulty update that rendered around 8.5 million Windows devices unusable, [according to Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/). The update caused the affected computers to be stuck at the infamous “blue screen of death,” or BSOD, a bright blue error screen with a message that is shown when Windows crashes or cannot load because of a critical software failure.

The outage caused delays at airports in Amsterdam, Berlin, Dubai, and London, and [across the United States](https://x.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1814268813879206397). It also caused [several](https://www.beckersspine.com/orthopedic-spine-practices-improving-profits/60138-hospitals-halt-non-urgent-surgeries-amid-global-it-outage.html#:~:text=Hospitals%20across%20the%20U.S.%20postponed,affecting%20computers%20and%20servers%20worldwide.) [hospitals](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-german-hospitals-cancel-elective-operations-citing-global-it-outage-2024-07-19/) to halt surgeries, and paralyzed countless businesses all over the world.
