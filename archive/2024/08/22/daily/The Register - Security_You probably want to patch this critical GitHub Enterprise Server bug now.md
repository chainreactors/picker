## Unless you're cool with an unauthorized criminal enjoying admin privileges to comb through your code

A critical bug in GitHub Enterprise Server could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a user account with administrator privileges and then wreak havoc on an organization's code repositories.

The good news is that there's a fix. The Microsoft-owned code hosting service addressed the 9.5 CVSS-rated flaw tracked as [CVE-2024-6800](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-6800) in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) versions [3.13.3](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.13/admin/release-notes#3.13.3), [3.10.16](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.10/admin/release-notes#3.10.16), [3.11.14](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.11/admin/release-notes#3.11.14), and [3.12.8](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.12/admin/release-notes#3.12.8).

Orgs running a vulnerable instance of GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES), GitHub's self-hosted version, will likely do well to download the update ASAP as miscreants are likely already scanning for this CVE.
