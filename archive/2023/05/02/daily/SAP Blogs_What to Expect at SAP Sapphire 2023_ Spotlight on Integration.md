This year’s event will have a spotlight beaming on **Integration**!

Because now, more than ever, integration is the key to solving fundamental business problems. When adopted strategically, integration can bridge silos across applications, data, and processes, helping facilitate enterprise agility and business model flexibility. It can provide a foundation for applying intelligence, enabling digital interactions, and creating the connected digital experiences that employees want, business partners need, and customers expect.

[Integration topic sessions](https://go2.events.sap.com/SAPSapphire/Orlando/2023/agb/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=312&sf=580&locale=en_US) will be both customer-led and SAP-lead at the Orlando event, including:

* Innovate Now with a Modern Integration Platform

* Simplify Landscapes and Gain Agility with A Comprehensive API Strategy

* Automate Business Processes Faster with a Versatile Integration Foundation

* Fast Track Your Journey to the Cloud
