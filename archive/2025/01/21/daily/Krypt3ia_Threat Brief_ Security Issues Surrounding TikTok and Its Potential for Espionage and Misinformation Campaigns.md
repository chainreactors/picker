**Date:** January 20, 2025

**Compiled by:** Krypt3ia

### **Executive Summary**

TikTok, a social media platform owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of cybersecurity concerns due to its potential use as a tool for espionage, data harvesting, and disinformation campaigns. These concerns stem from its ownership, links to the Chinese government, and technical forensics evaluations of the app. Governments worldwide, including the United States, have raised alarms over TikTok’s ability to collect user data on a massive scale, track user behavior, and possibly promote narratives favorable to Beijing. Below is a detailed analysis of these issues, based on research from cybersecurity experts, forensics evaluations, and open-source intelligence (OSINT).

### **Ownership and Governance Risks**

#### **Concerns Around ByteDance and CCP Influence**

ByteDance, headquartered in Beijing, operates under China’s regulatory framework, including the National Intelligence Law (2017). This law mandates that Chinese companies and citizens cooperate with intelligence agencies when requested. This legal obligation raises significant concerns that TikTok data could be accessed by the Chinese government for espionage or other national interests.

#### **Government and Military Bans**

• The U.S., Canada, the EU, India, and Australia have restricted or banned TikTok on government and military devices due to national security concerns.

• India outright banned TikTok in 2020, citing concerns about data security following skirmishes with China.

• The U.S. passed the **RESTRICT Act**, a legal framework to address risks posed by foreign-controlled technologies, targeting TikTok as a primary concern.

#### **ByteDance Internal Practices**

Reports from **The New York Times**, **Forbes**, and whistleblower allegations have indicated that ByteDance employees in China have had access to U.S. user data. One such incident, dubbed “Project Texas,” involved ByteDance attempting to create an independent U.S.-based data storage system via Oracle; however, this effort has not assuaged critics.

### **Forensics Evaluations of TikTok**

#### **Technical Findings**

Independent analyses of TikTok’s application by cybersecurity firms and researchers have revealed several technical security concerns:

#### **Extensive Data Collection:**

TikTok collects:

• Geolocation data (even when location services are disabled).

• Keystroke patterns (raising concerns about potential keylogging capabilities).

• Device metadata, such as IMEI numbers, SIM details, and network information.

#### **Code Obfuscation:**

TikTok’s codebase contains obfuscated routines that make it difficult for security analysts to evaluate its full functionality. This obfuscation has raised red flags about the app’s true intentions and whether malicious payloads or backdoors could be deployed.

#### **Permissions Abuse:**

Researchers from **Citizen Lab** and **Penetrum** have found that TikTok requests permissions unrelated to its primary function, including microphone access, clipboard data, and detailed sensor information, such as accelerometer and gyroscope data.

#### **Behavior Similarities to Malware:**

Evaluations by **Talos Intelligence** and **Abuse.ch** suggest TikTok behaves in a manner similar to some spyware, gathering sensitive user data far beyond what’s typical for most social media apps.

#### **Comparisons to Western Apps**

While Western apps like Facebook and Instagram also engage in data collection, TikTok’s connections to the Chinese government, combined with its data harvesting at scale, make it a unique geopolitical threat.

### **Espionage Potential**

**User Data as an Intelligence Asset**

TikTok collects an extensive amount of user data, including:

• **Behavioral data:** Time spent watching specific videos, search histories, likes, and content interactions.

• **Location tracking:** Continuous monitoring even when not using the app.

• **Demographic profiling:** Age, language, device type, and application usage patterns.

This wealth of data could be exploited in several ways:

• **Targeting Government or Corporate Officials:** Through advanced analytics, TikTok could profile users of interest, such as government personnel, corporate executives, or individuals with access to sensitive information.

• **Facilitating Phishing Campaigns:** Data from TikTok could help design spear-phishing attacks using behavioral insights about high-value targets.

#### **Potential for Cross-App Tracking**

TikTok has been accused of bypassing app-tracking restrictions implemented by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms. Research indicates TikTok may utilize device-level fingerprinting techniques to continue monitoring users across applications, raising further concerns about its ability to compromise user privacy.

### **Misinformation and Disinformation Campaigns**

#### **Content Moderation Concerns**

TikTok’s algorithm for promoting content is opaque and has raised fears that it could amplify Chinese state narratives or suppress dissenting views. Evidence has been documented of:

• **Censorship:** Content critical of the Chinese government, such as posts about the Hong Kong protests or Uyghur detentions, has reportedly been suppressed.

• **Algorithmic Manipulation:** The platform could artificially amplify content favorable to Beijing, particularly during geopolitical events such as Taiwan-related crises or U.S. elections.

#### **Deepfake and Propaganda Dissemination**

With TikTok’s popularity as a video-based platform, it is highly suited for the dissemination of **deepfakes** and propaganda. State actors could use TikTok to distribute convincing disinformation, such as manipulated videos of politicians or falsified event footage.

#### **Influence on Youth and Public Opinion**

TikTok’s dominance among younger audiences makes it a powerful tool for shaping narratives. By curating content, TikTok could influence political opinions, exacerbate societal divisions, or discourage civic engagement in adversarial nations.

The intelligence community in multiple countries, particularly in the **United States**, has weighed in on TikTok and expressed significant concerns regarding its potential for national security threats. The concerns largely center around data collection, Chinese government influence, and the platform’s ability to influence public opinion. Below are some key statements and assessments from intelligence agencies and officials:

### **U.S. Intelligence Community Assessments**:

**FBI**

• **Christopher Wray, FBI Director (November 2022):**

Wray testified before Congress and warned about TikTok’s potential risks, stating:

• The app could be used by the Chinese government for **espionage** purposes, including collecting sensitive personal data of millions of users.

• TikTok poses risks of **manipulating content and influence operations**, potentially allowing Beijing to subtly shape public discourse in the U.S.

• He emphasized concerns about **algorithmic manipulation**, which could allow ByteDance to suppress or amplify certain narratives.

**ODNI (Office of the Director of National Intelligence)**

• ODNI has included TikTok in broader discussions about **China’s digital espionage strategy**, which prioritizes data collection on a massive scale.

• In its **Annual Threat Assessment (2023)**, ODNI highlighted TikTok’s role in providing Beijing access to a vast trove of data that could be used to influence foreign citizens or profile individuals ...
