[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

You don’t need me to tell you that security is constantly changing and that more change is on its way. The enthusiastic adoption of new AI systems will inevitably lead to more demands on cybersecurity teams. Not only will these systems need protecting against the same threats which affect current systems, but also against new types of threats that target AI models. We can only expect that attacks designed to subvert AI models and get them to function in ways detrimental to their operators’ interests will become more effective and beneficial to attackers over time.

The good news is that we can expect AI enabled security systems to help protect against attacks, detect incursions, and orchestrate the remediation of affected systems. However, we must not overlook the fact that people will remain involved and invested in the outcome. Within this AI powered future will be CISOs who will be held responsible for the security of systems. There will also be many analysts tasked with keeping systems operating correctly while trying to anticipate and protect against forthcoming malicious campaigns.

Although we may not be able to predict the nature of attacks in this distant future, we can predict some of the skills that will be necessary to beat these attacks. Threat intelligence skills will be vital to equip future cyber security professionals not only to understand the goals of the threat actors that they face but to situate their attacks within the context of these goals. Armed with this understanding, security teams will be able to make better decisions regarding the allocation and prioritization of resources to best defend against attacks.

Developing threat intelligence skills within the cyber security professionals of tomorrow begins today. Training up people who are early in their careers and students yet to begin their careers is one of the best investments we can make to build resilience against future threats.

To help skill up future analysts, my colleagues and myself in collaboration with Cisco’s Networking Academy have developed an [introductory course](https://www.netacad.com/modules/threat-intelligence-101) to threat intelligence. This course is free for all, only registration is required, and is intended to give an overview of the domain for someone without prior knowledge which can be used as a starting point for further study or employment.

For those looking to develop a threat intelligence program as part of their cyber security strategy, we are hosting a technical seminar at Cisco Live EMEA on Sunday February 9th. The session, “Establishing a Threat Intelligence Program, Why its Necessary, What to Expect and How to Go about it [TECSEC-2003]”, will present how managers can set-up a threat intelligence team as part of their arsenal against the bad guys and what can reasonably be expected.

### The one big thing

One pointer to the nature of future threats against AI systems is a technique used in spam that [Talos recently blogged about](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/seasoning-email-threats-with-hidden-text-salting/). Hiding the nature of the content displayed to the recipient from anti-spam systems is not a new technique. Spammers have included hidden text or used formatting rules to camouflage their actual message from anti-spam analysis for decades. However, we have seen increase in the use of such techniques during the second half of 2024.

### Why do I care?

Parsers which are required for computers to understand text content, view the world very differently from humans. The human eye ignores text in miniscule font or can’t detect black letters on a black background, but this is not necessarily the case for parsers. Where the human eye sees readily readable text, the parser can see the gibberish that spammers have included to confuse them. Potentially the opposite is also true with humans seeing gibberish, but language parsing software seeing readable text.

Being able to disguise and hide content from machine analysis or from human oversight is likely to become a more important vector of attack against AI systems as they become a larger part of our lives.

### So now what?

Fortunately, the techniques to detect this kind of obfuscation are well known and already integrated into spam detection systems such as Cisco Email Threat Defense. Conversely, the presence of attempts to obfuscate content in this manner makes it obvious that a message is malicious and can be classed as spam.

### Top security headlines of the week

Another incident of an undersea telecommunications cable being cut in the Baltic was encountered. ([CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/26/europe/latvia-baltic-undersea-cable-intl-latam/index.html)). Organisations need to plan for the effects of a major telecommunications outage or internet bandwidth restriction affecting their business.

Three members of Russia’s GRU have been placed under sanctions for their suspected role in conducting cyber attacks against Estonia in 2020 ([SecurityAffairs](https://securityaffairs.com/173555/security/eu-sanctions-russias-gru-unit-29155.html)). Threat actors might try to hide their identities but eventually they will be discovered and held to account for their actions.

A botnet consisting of infected IoT devices is behind the largest ever DDoS attack ([Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/01/22/mirai-ddos-botnets-iot/)). Small network connected devices can easily be overlooked as part of a cyber security strategy, but they can be compromis...
