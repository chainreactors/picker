In episode 59 of the AI Fix, our hosts ponder whether AIs need a ‚Äúdisagreement dial‚Äù, Mark wonders what he could do with an AI-powered ‚Äúdrug design engine‚Äù, Graham plays Wolfenstein instead of working, a robot graduates from high school, and a popular rock group is unmasked as an AI fever dream.

Graham explains why Grok thinks it‚Äôs Mecha Hitler, and Mark reveals which AI is most likely to betray you.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
