# dev

maldev obviously

please note - most of the tools in this repo are *not* completed in a way that they are meant to be deployed on operations. For example, pthandles currently enumerates EVERY process handle and thread handle on a system. You probably would want to target a specific process, etc... on an op. So please review the code, use the program and understand what it does, then snip out the code you need, or modify the tool to fit your use-case. These "tools" should be basically known good code snippets for accomplishing certain malware-dev related tasks.

TODO:
Proper table of contents and READMEs for all contents.
