In our continuous endeavor to serve our SAP Partner & internal ecosystem, we from SAP S/4HANA Cloud Expertise Services Team are glad to share an abstract from the fourth session in the form of Community Live on 23rd Feb 2023. This session was intended to provide our partners and internals an opportunity to have an open mic session directly with our experts on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition. This session was targeted for all those business technology enthusiasts from our partners and internal ecosystem who are interested and looking forward to help our customers together in their journey of [Business Transformation using the RISE with SAP package](https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html?video=26e7f3d3-ca7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff&source=social-Global-small-business-by-sap-LINKEDIN_COMPANY-MarketingCampaign-SME_GeneralBusiness-unspecified-risewithsap-spr-4497748622&campaigncode=CRM-MM21-MIM-MM21SOC) based on SAP’s implementation methodology – [SAP Activate](https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/) for [SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition](https://www.sap.com/india/products/s4hana-erp/technical-information/private-cloud.html). This blog-post caters as a Question-Answer transcript of the session conducted for which the recordings can be found on the [Partner Edge portal](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/psd/2022/sep/e_oe_te_w_samf_27264.html) (needs PartnerEdge login).

As we all know by now, that **[RISE with SAP](https://www.sap.com/india/products/rise.html#packages)** provides a seamless and easy path for transforming an organization from traditional and legacy ERP systems to a modern, cloud based and an intelligent suite of software which caters for next generation business operations for an Intelligent & Sustainable Enterprise. The focus of this session being an open discussion between partners, internals and SAP experts on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition for **new implementations**, we were able to get insights on variety of questions from our partners. Our speakers were also able to provide clarifications on their doubts and questions during the 60 mins session. We also use this forum to look into the challenges which our partners and internals face and try to feed it back into our product teams in order to further fine-tune the gaps if relevant.

To cater questions on SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition – we called in experts from various areas like SAP Activate, Solution Management, Project Excellence, Partner Solution Center and Partner Engagement and Experience Center. The below slide shows the speakers of the sessions.

Speakers for the community live 4th session

Also due to the vastness of the topics in implementing SAP S/4HANA Cloud – Private Edition, we decided to confine this session only on topics which revolve around SAP Activate for **new implementation** scenarios and not around system conversions, migrations and selective data transitions. To make the 60 mins most relevant on the topic of SAP Activate for our audience we chose the topics around project management, project methodology, fit-to-standard project delivery, phases, deliverables & concepts, cloud mindset, organizational change management, transformation, tools, enablement and adoption. The deep dive topics which require in-depth techno-functional expertise were not in the focus of this session and we might plan to bring such topics in the future for our community live session going forward. Hence the below slide shows the guardrails which we put into our session to provide a precursor to our audience.

***Question 1: What ALM tools is recommended for private cloud implementation and operations?***

**Answer** -> We would recommend to consider the usage of SAP Cloud ALM. If you are a net new customer or partner the SAP Cloud ALM can be highly beneficial. If the customer-partner has an established footprint in SAP Solution Manager, then you can continue using the Solution Manager. Due to great functionalities available in SAP Cloud ALM now as compared to last year, Private edition is now well suited to be used for SAP Cloud ALM. Also SAP Activate is fully embedded into the SAP Cloud ALM, hence tasks like creating project tasks, assigning requirements to consultants and utilizing the accelerators are tightly coupled in the SAP Cloud ALM - which provides an immediate kick start for you project. Also the Cloud ALM operations aspect are very easy and ready to use for post Go-Live situations.

***Question 2: Whats the difference between the scope of SAP ACTIVATE methodology in SAP S/4HANA On premise vs SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private and Public Edition. Also from the ALM point of view, will the methodology change.***

**Answer** -> Very simply, there is a good consistency in the SAP Activate Phases and deliverables as well as activities for SAP Activate Roadmap for On Premise and Private Edition as well as Public Edition.
