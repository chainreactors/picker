# Boosting telcos’ 5G cyber resilience

## ZTE reveals its open, transparent approach to minimizing cyber security risks in telecommunications networks

Sponsored Feature The widespread, global deployment of 5G telecommunications equipment and systems is already well underway. The GSMA forecasts that by 2025, 29 percent of the mobile connections in Europe – including those linking mission-critical infrastructure such as remotely operated power grids – will be made through 5G.

But unlike previous network generations of 3G/4G LTE infrastructure, 5G uses new network slicing technology that divides one physical network into multiple logical networks to provide communications services. That can theoretically make it more vulnerable to hacking due to the fact that the initially embedded security mechanisms depend on older 3GPP definitions, though these are continually evolving and being transposed to ETSI standards.

To that end, telecommunications companies, mobile network operators (MNOs) and other communication service providers are already taking advantage of the security controls inherited from 3G/4G. And they are now supplementing them with purpose built 5G security controls to enhance their network and service security processes, while simultaneously introducing best practices and policies to deliver the necessary resilience.

The ultimate objective for these operators is to implement end-to-end security frameworks across all layers and domains which will keep them one step ahead in terms of the technological innovation required to thwart possible cyber-attacks. "Clearly, telcos and MNOs must continuously improve operational defensive capabilities, including active/online defense, attack mitigation and incident response," says Giuseppe Bianchi, Professor at Università di Roma Tor Vergata. "Indeed, they are already paying crucial attention to these issues so as to adequately protect their infrastructure."

But Bianchi also urges operators to significantly improve their ability to prevent cyber threats, rather than just defend against them. "Beyond the adoption of secure design methodologies, which is more of a concern for manufacturers and service developers than operators, prevention is primarily concerned with two crucial areas: security assurance and cyber threat intelligence (CTI)," he emphasizes. "Regarding security assurance...
