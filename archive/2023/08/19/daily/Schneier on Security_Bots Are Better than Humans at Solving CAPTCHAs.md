## Bots Are Better than Humans at Solving CAPTCHAs

Interesting research: “[An Empirical Study & Evaluation of Modern CAPTCHAs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12108.pdf)“:

> **Abstract:** For nearly two decades, CAPTCHAS have been widely used as a means of protection against bots. Throughout the years, as their use grew, techniques to defeat or bypass CAPTCHAS have continued to improve. Meanwhile, CAPTCHAS have also evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming increasingly difficult to solve for both bots (machines) and humans. Given this long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is critical to investigate how long it takes legitimate users to solve modern CAPTCHAS, and how they are perceived by those users.
>
> In this work, we explore CAPTCHAS *in the wild* by evaluating users’ solving performance and perceptions of *unmodified currently-deployed* CAPTCHAS. We obtain this data through manual inspection of popular websites and user studies in which 1, 400 participants collectively solved 14, 000 CAPTCHAS. Results show significant differences between the most popular types of CAPTCHAS: surprisingly, solving time and user perception are not always correlated. We performed a comparative study to investigate the effect of experimental context ­ specifically the difference between solving CAPTCHAS directly versus solving them as part of a more natural task, such as account creation. Whilst there were several potential confounding factors, our results show that *experimental context* could have an impact on this task, and must be taken into account in future CAPTCHA studies. Finally, we investigate CAPTCHA-induced user task *abandonment* by analyzing participants who start and do not complete the task.

Humans using robot tool developed by humans do better than humans not using robot tool.

Just get adequate Captcha’s

There are some simple logical puzzles AIs are still failing at

‘https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02361-7

> In a test consisting of a series of brightly coloured blocks arranged on a screen, most people can spot the connecting patterns. But GPT-4, the most advanced version of the AI system behind the chatbot ChatGPT and the search engine Bing, gets barely one-third of the puzzles right in one category of patterns and as little as 3% correct in another, according to a report by researchers this May.

This race is pretty fun to speculate about. Maybe have a web of trust for people.

I just hope it doesn’t end with corporations or governments the only ones who can prove I’m not a bot.

Sometimes I rebel by doing a CAPTCHA wrong over and over.

Good. Maybe if bots manage to decimate Captcha, it will disappear! I absolutely have to access a site before I do those !@#$ Captcha things. They are an abomination and need to just go away!

@ My Probation Officer…, ALL,

Re : The odds are not a deterrent.

> “I can’t imagine myself participating in any competition against say a 100 or 500 people on the other side, of course, one can always try but the outcome in nearly all, if not in every single case will be pretty obvious”

Actually people play those odds or a lot worse many times every day, every day, and they almost always get away…

Yes I know your gut is telling you I am wrong, but have a think about malware developers and those that deploy it. Likewise all the online fraud/theft.

It’s many billions a month every month in total but so little gets reported or logged by authorities let alone investigated that we realy don’t know how much… As somebody pointed out blockchain and crypto-coins gives a very low side estimate…

Now consider the number of “common convicted criminals” in jail in your local population. Estimates say that the number of citizens not in prison v criminals in prison is somewhere between 750 to 3500 depending on which part of the world you live… The statistics from actuaries say ost petty crooks have to committ crime two or three times a week…

The number of bodies odds makes no difference to the criminals, they just keep going.

“Select all images that contain a fire truck”… and now we know who to blame when a Tesla on autopilot crashes into such a truck.

Captcha’s is one tool in the toolbox to protect public sites from abuse. And they still are an effective one.

> Good. Maybe if bots manage to decimate Captcha, it will disappear! I absolutely have to access a site before I do those !@#$ Captcha things. They are an abomination and need to just go away!

Here is a thought “one-old-conservative” – stop re-using passwords. Stop putting your birthyear in your username. Or just stop using the internet. And we wouldn’t need captcha’s to assist in protecting your online accounts.
