## Introduction to NTUSER.DAT

### What is NTUSER.DAT?

NTUSER.DAT is a user-specific registry hive that stores configuration information, application settings, and user behavior artifacts. It is essentially a snapshot of a user’s environment and activities.

**File Location and Lifecycle:**

* Found at: C:\Users\[Username]\NTUSER.DAT
* Loaded into memory during user login and mapped to HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER (HKCU) in the Windows Registry.
* Unloaded and saved back to disk at user logoff or system shutdown, though updates can occur throughout the session.

**Note:** Newer [MSIX based applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-behind-the-scenes#registry) often have app specific hives for NTUser.dat. They exist at **%localappdata%\Packages\<APPID>\SystemAppData\Helium** with a name of **User.dat**. This means artifacts can be tied back to a specific app and user.

### Why it matters:

NTUSER.DAT provides crucial insight into what users did on the system — which programs they ran, what files they accessed, which folders they opened, and how they interacted with the GUI. This makes NTUser.dat forensics a cornerstone in both incident response and criminal investigations.

## Forensic Importance

| Info | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| **User Attribution** | As a per-user hive, each NTUser.dat file is uniquely tied to an individual account. This supports the identification of which specific user performed certain actions and in some cases in which application for the case of app specific registry hives. |
| **Behavioral Analysis** | NTUser.dat artifacts can tell a story about how a user interacts with the system over time — how often certain apps are used, whether removable devices were accessed, or what documents were recently opened. |
| **Malware + Persistence Analysis** | NTUser.dat is a prime target for malware authors to establish persistence via startup keys. It’s also useful for identifying signs of compromise where malware executes within user context. |
| **Time-Based Correlation** | This means the file type will not appear in the jump list data. For example, LibreOffice will not record a file being opened in the jump list if it has no extension or has a .exe extension — even if it’s just a text file. |
| **User Context vs. System Context** | NTUser.dat reflects changes and activity initiated under the user context, as opposed to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE or system-wide settings. This distinction is critical for distinguishing user-driven activity from background processes. |
| **Evidence of Intent** | Since NTUser.dat tracks voluntary user activity—such as typed paths, recently opened files, and executed applications—it can be especially powerful in investigations that require demonstration of intent or deliberate action. |

## Key Artifacts & Registry Locations

| **UserAssist** | |
| --- | --- |
| **Location** | ``` NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist ``` |
| **Purpose** | Provides evidence of execution for .lnk files or PE files that have a GUI component |
| **Key Data** | Full path, execution count, last execution timestamp, focus time, focus count, and user initiating file execution |
| **Notes** | * Interpreting UserAssist data on Windows 10+ is more difficult due to entries showing up without having been executed. Ex. Using “jump to file location” from Windows start menu. * Registry hive owner should be interpreted as the user that initiated the process and not the user account the process ran as. * Data will not be recorded if user opts out of Windows trackin...
