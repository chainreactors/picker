OK – your WordPress site is hacked. Now what? Questions we frequently get from new users are, “Why was my WordPress site hacked?” and “What should I do after a WordPress hack?”

Of course, these are reasonable questions to ask; it’s extremely frustrating to find out that your site has been compromised and you need to tackle a malware infection or increase security controls. Surely you’d want to understand *why* and *how* to quickly deal with your hacked WordPress site.

However — while all websites are susceptible to hacks, certain errors *could* be increasing the vulnerability of your website. In this post, we’ll delve into a few of the main reasons why WordPress gets hacked and how it happens. We’ll also cover some common red flags and signs of a hacked WordPress environment, and what to do if your WordPress was hacked. This will help you to recognize potential mistakes, effectively recover from a hack, and take measures to safeguard your site from future attackers.

## Why does WordPress get hacked?

WordPress powers [over 43% of all websites](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) on the web, translating into hundreds of millions of websites worldwide. This popularity makes it a prime target for hackers, particularly websites that are not well-secured or contain known software vulnerabilities.

That being said, we need to make an important distinction: **WordPress is not the only CMS platform targeted by hackers**. In fact, to varying degrees all websites on the internet are prone to hacking attempts.

### Understanding the hacker’s motive

Hackers have a wide range of motivations for their illicit activities. Some are merely novices learning to exploit less secure sites. Others might have more nefarious intentions, such as [distributing malware](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html), launching attacks on other websites, sending spam, or using compromised domains for [black hat SEO](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/02/what-is-black-hat-seo.html).

Some attackers focus on stealing sensitive data such as personal information, credit card numbers, or login credentials. These can be sold on the dark web or used to commit fraud and identity theft. Others may simply be looking to [disrupt services](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) or [make a political statement](https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/03/what-is-website-defacement.html).

However, it’s important to note that not all hackers are motivated by illicit gains or malicious intent. Some hackers, often referred to as “white hat” hackers, exploit vulnerabilities in order to expose them and help improve the system’s security.

Regardless of the motive, the outcome of a hack is almost always detrimental to the website owner. It can lead to lost data, reputation issues, and even legal consequences if sensitive customer information is compromised.

## Key reasons why WordPress gets hacked

Now that we understand the motivations behind a hack, let’s take a look at some of the key reasons **why WordPress gets hacked**.

1. [Unpatched WordPress core, plugins & themes](#unpatched-software)
2. [Weak passwords and usernames](#weak-passwords)
3. [Unprotected WordPress admin panels](#unprotected-wordpress-admin)
4. [Improper isolation in shared server environments](#improper-isolation)
5. [Unrestricted access to wp-config](#unrestricted-access-wp-config)

Let’s go over these reasons in closer detail.

### 1. Unpatched WordPress core, plugins & themes
