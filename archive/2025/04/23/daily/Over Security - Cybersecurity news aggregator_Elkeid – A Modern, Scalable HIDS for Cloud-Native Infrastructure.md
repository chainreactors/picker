# Elkeid – A Modern, Scalable HIDS for Cloud-Native Infrastructure

**Elkeid** is a high-performance, open-source Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) built by ByteDance to secure Linux workloads across cloud, container, and hybrid environments.

If tools like [OSSEC](https://www.darknet.org.uk/2006/05/ossec-hids-open-source-host-based-intrusion-system/) or Snort feel dated in your K8s stack or Falco is too noisy, Elkeid offers a modern alternative with eBPF-based syscall monitoring, Kafka-backed pipelines, and plugin-driven detection logic.

Think: cloud-native HIDS meets event-driven XDR.

### Why Elkeid?

Elkeid was developed to protect ByteDance’s massive infrastructure. Now open-sourced under Apache 2.0, it delivers:

* Kernel-level telemetry via eBPF, Netlink, and ptrace
* Scalable architecture using Kafka, MongoDB, and Redis
* Plugin-based detection with Go and Lua support
* A rules engine for suspicious behavior, persistence, privilege escalation, and more
* Elastic deployment across containers, cloud VMs, and edge hosts

It fills the gap between SIEM noise and raw audit logs with detection logic that actually works in modern infrastructure.

### What It Detects

Elkeid detects behavior such as:

* Suspicious parent-child process chains
* Shells spawned inside containers
* Reverse shells, bind shells, and privilege escalation attempts
* Persistence indicators such as crontab tampering or systemd injection
* Anomalous syscalls from non-root users

These events are ingested into Kafka, analyzed by the Elkeid Detector, and visualized via a real-time dashboard or exported to your own alerting stack.

Elkeid provides context beyond what most open-source HIDS can—correlating process lineage, syscall flow, and container identity.

### Architecture Overview

Elkeid is agent-based and modular by design.

* **Elkeid Agent**: Installed on every endpoint, container, or node. Collects telemetry and pushes to Kafka.
* **Detector**: Evaluates events against custom rules and plugins.
* **Controller**: Manages rules, plugins, and policies.
* **Dashboard**: For alerts, logs, and visibility.
* **Infra Dependencies**: Kafka, Redis, and MongoDB handle event flow and state.

This structure allows Elkeid to scale horizontally with your workloads—whether a dozen VMs or a global container fleet.

### Installation and Setup

Elkeid is not a plug-and-play tool, but the setup is straightforward if you’re comfortable with container orchestration.

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/bytedance/Elkeid
cd Elkeid/demo
docker-compose up

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1  2  3 | git clone https://github.com/bytedance/Elkeid  cd Elkeid/demo  docker-compose up |

### Final Take

Elkeid is a serious contender in the next generation of host-based detection. It’s cloud-native, plugin-friendly, and built for scale.

If you’re operating a modern stack—especially Kubernetes or containerized workloads—Elkeid is worth testing. It gives you insight, context, and detection without relying on flaky heuristics or black-box engines.

For the price of zero, you get ByteDance-grade endpoint telemetry and a flexible rule engine.
