## The “Incriminating Video” Scam

A few years ago, scammers invented a new phishing email. They would claim to have hacked your computer, turned your webcam on, and videoed you watching porn or having sex. BuzzFeed has an [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/poojashah1/new-email-scam-house-address-sc) talking about a “shockingly realistic” variant, which includes photos of you and your house—more specific information.

The article contains “steps you can take to figure out if it’s a scam,” but omits the first and most fundamental piece of advice: If the hacker had incriminating video about you, they would show you a clip. Just a taste, not the worst bits so you had to worry about how bad it could be, but something. If the hacker doesn’t show you any video, they don’t have any video. Everything else is window dressing.

I remember when this scam was first invented. I calmed several people who were legitimately worried with that one fact.

I don’t have a webcam or a mic. So I’ve always just deleted those emails.

My wife had one of these recently, two weeks after an education Zoom conference she was on was hacked and pornography replacing the education lectures. This was almost certainly a coincidence. The email came from her email address, which the hacker claimed was proof he had infiltrated our system – no images of our building though. The hacker said we were watching all this on ‘one of our devices’, had he infiltrated our system he would have known what device was used. Obviously neither of us were in the least bit worried and just erased it immediately.

When there’s sufficient photo or video footage of you in the web, attackers create deep-fakes to blackmail you with that. Of course you’ll claim it’s fake, but who wouldn’t?

I occasionally get these, but they demand crypto as payment. Among the people I know, the intersection of (1) those who would fall for this scam, and (2) are capable of setting up bitcoin without asking a friend for help, who would them (hopefully) calm them, is empty.

This type of scam will die as soon as deep fakes cannot be distinguished from real footage anymore. Might as well let them publish the real thing then.

With regards,

> “BuzzFeed has an article talking about a “shockingly realistic” variant, which includes photos of you and your house—more specific information.”

Photos of your “house” is often obtained via Google…

As for finding your address, in the UK there is a register at “Companies House” that has a list of every company you have ever been an officer, as well as all the adresses you’ve ever used in relationship to any company.

Thus When Microsoft failed to do something they should have done the Managing Director of Microsoft got a visit, all the vehicles were photographed and the ownership was checked and checked on an insurance database.

From that point on checking financial details was fairly easy.

Work that took around half a day to do.

Using a US database filled by Meta and Google gave a wealth of other information (some deliver to your home companies put other information up…

Presenting her with the details one by one kind of convinced her that the employees at Microsoft had better pull their fingers out…

The reason I mention all this is two fold,

1, It’s what Debt collection agencies do as a normal activity.

2, People don’t realise just how much information they hemorrhage into these commercial databases via social media and the like.

But there is a third aspect which is once your home address is known getting photos or video of the occupants is trivial and they do not have to be in very high resolution.

Because AI systems can “fill in” to more or less any resolution these days.

Back last century I had a falling out with one part of my family because they stuck up a “family tree” that had lots of details and they also put up photos of family members.

I went absolutely ape about it and I was basically told I was being “paranoid”…

Three decades later was I just guessing the future or paranoid?

Let me put it this way, such information has value, and my experience since the early 1980’s is people will make money any which way they can…

So the reality was as far as I was concerned,

“Even with protective legislation and regulation, certain types of people would collect information. And the more legislation and regulation the higher the price they would ask for it… And there are always those who will hunt it out no matter what the cost or legality as their form of “due diligence”…

For instance in the UK anyone who has been a member of a Union has their details stored away in a US database run by one of “The three GOP families”…

As our host @Bruce has noted technology advancements make attack capability considerably easier.

AI now allows what to the average human eye and ears are 100% accurate fakes…

The thing is that few when presented with these fakes realise they are fakes. And that is where Cognitive Bias leaps in and people will believe what they want to believe irrespective of factual evidence to the contrary.

And mud once thrown tends to leave it’s mark…
