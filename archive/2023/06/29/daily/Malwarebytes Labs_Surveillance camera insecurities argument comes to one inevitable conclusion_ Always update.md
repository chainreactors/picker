# Surveillance camera insecurities argument comes to one inevitable conclusion: Always update

Posted: June 28, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Chinese-made surveillance cameras find themselves in a spot of controversy, after a BBC investigation [uncovered flaws in devices](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65975446) during several brand tests.

Surveillance and webcam vulnerabilities are common, and we’ve covered them many times on our blog. What’s interesting with this story is that its being presented as some sort of potential threat to national security and infrastructure. From just one of the comments provided to the BBC:

> “We’ve all seen the Italian Job in our youth, where you bring the whole of Turin to a halt through the traffic light system. Well, that might have been fiction then, it wouldn’t be now.”

All very dramatic, but we’ve yet to see The Italian Job play out in real life. Even so, many devices manufactured by one firm, Hikvision, are used by many local councils across the UK. They’re also used to monitor Government buildings. If a device is vulnerable, it’s definitely worth trying to figure out the scale of the problem. With this in mind, what kind of numbers are we talking about?

According to the BBC, a large-scale freedom of information campaign set in motion by Big Brother Watch tried to find out. No fewer than 4,510 Freedom of Information requests were filed with various public bodies between August 2021 and January 2022. 1,289 responses came back, with 806 of those confirming the use of Hikvision or, another brand mentioned by the BBC, Dahua cameras. Of the 806, 227 local councils and 15 police forces use Hikvision, with 35 local councils making use of Dahua.

That’s certainly a lot of cameras. What risk was discovered?

The BBC asked experts to try and compromise a Hikvision camera under test conditions, though specifics are hard to come by. Is “a test network with no [firewall](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall) and little protection” an accurate reflection of a local council or Government network? Is it fair to assume the manufacturer would be at fault for organisations not applying updates and patches dating back 6 years?

I ask this, because the results with the tested (six year old) camera found a vulnerability from 2017. The testers claim the flaw as “a back door that Hikvision built into its own products”, with somewhere in the region of 100,000 cameras online “still vulnerable” to this issue. Which means that a lot of organisations actually are failing to update their devices.

Having compromised the camera and gaining access to visuals, testers now established if they could access the Dahua cameras by forcing their way into the software controlling them. Once again, they were able to do it and this time gained access to the camera’s microphone.

In both cases, vendors claimed to have patched both of these vulnerabilities soon after the issues came to light. In fact, Hikvision [released an open letter](https://www.hikvision.com/content/dam/hikvision/uk/marketing-portal/catalogues/Letter-to-partners-BBC-Broadcast-26.06.23.pdf) to those responsible for the investigation. It reads:

> To claim that this stunt has uncovered a [security breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) or an intentional [backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor) in June 2023 is ...
