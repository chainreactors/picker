Maybe it is because I worked in the automotive industry, that I like comparisons with automotive things. Therefore I also like the similarity between car driving and Data Literacy.

What is Data Literacy?
> *Data literacy is the ability to read, write and communicate data in context, with an understanding of the data sources and constructs, analytical methods and techniques applied, and the ability to describe the use case application and resulting business value or outcome.*
>
> - [Gartner, 2022](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-literacy)

Data Literacy can be the glue, to bring all your data activities together and make them work in the company. Data Literacy is, on the one hand, a personal competence but for a company to enable data literacy is partly another thing altogether. To make it work in a company it needs to be considered as part of a overarching data strategy. A **data strategy** should include the following parts:

* A clear **vision** and **goals** undertandable to your employees and aligned with the corporate strategy

* A **target operating model** making your strategy work

* A [**data architecture**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/02/data-architecture-with-sap-sap-data-warehouse/) that alignes your business capabilities to create value from data

* A [**data governance**](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/06/03/data-strategy-with-sap-data-governance/) for guardrails and responsibilities to minimise risks and provide guidance

* A [**data culture**](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/21/data-strategy-with-sap-data-culture/) allowing Data Literacy to be effective and make your data perform

So many things have to come together, but still, Data Literacy is something that is related to all aspects and cannot be started early enough!

## Data Literacy - as simple as driving a car?

So a first question is often - Where am I with Data Literacy in my company? If available you could work with a maturity model but sometimes a few simple questions are also a good indicator:

* Do business people and IT people speak about the same things when it comes to data? Or do they just think they do?

* Is Data Literacy part of your job descriptions?

* Do you see that decisions being justified with data but not based on data?

* If you see data initiaitives do you see fancy 3D pie charts and focus on classic reporting instead of predictive or advanced analytics?

## A look in the rear view mirror

I like to work with the following graph, which I first saw [here](https://timoelliott.com/blog/2018/04/predictive-is-the-next-step-in-analytics-maturity-its-more-complicated-than-that.html). Many traditional companies (compared to start-ups or data-first companies) start here and over time take their way from left to right.

*Fig. 1: Data Journey - What happened?*

SAP is here in the perfect place delivering the technology directly in the operational system e. g. via [S/4HANA Embedded Analytics](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/08/analytics-in-s4hana-real-shape-of-embedded-analytics-and-beyond-embedded-analytics/), integrating data from different sources with [SAP BW/4HANA](https://community.sap.com/topics/bw4-hana) or [SAP Data Warehouse Cloud](https://community.sap.com/topics/data-warehouse-cloud) and give end users tools like [SAP BusinessObjects BI](https://community.sap.com/topics/bi-platform) or [SAP Analytics Cloud](https://community.sap.com/topics/cloud-analytics) to make use of the data.

This approach is very common and helpful. It shows you what happend and is able to help you make better decision, optimise processes and evaluate risks. From my understanding 60-70 % of Data & Analytics projects and activities happen here. Most organisations are able to deliver here.

Data Literacy is here to help you make better use of this data and technologies. Besides understanding how the tools works and how you "get your current numbers out of the system" it is also important to have transparency and making it easy to get access to your relevant data assets and reports. Very often this is not so easy. Why?

* Do you have an overview about all the data and reports in your company?

* Do you know the meaning of a new data source or key figures all the time?

* Is there a common understanding of terms and how data is produced?

* How can...
