# Why blocking ads is good for your digital health

Posted: June 28, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Online content is largely powered and paid for by advertising. Almost every site you visit, every forum you browse, and even the online stores you buy things from is an advert extravaganza, and they don’t just stop at showing cool offers for shirts at 50% off. The scaffolding the adverts sit on goes out of its way to track you, tie you to clicks, associations, and more. More adverts, tailored to your theoretical interests, then start to follow you around across other sites. Sometimes, it’s not very sophisticated: Ever searched for the one and only quarter height stepladder you’ll ever buy in your life? Congratulations, every advert is a stepladder.

Sadly, dozens of stepladder adverts are far from your only concern. We’re going to explain why running an ad blocker is a good thing for your digital health, and highlight all of the ways things can go wrong with ads enabled.

Adverts are the biggest of business, with billions of ad impressions per month. Individual companies can rack up billions of impressions just for their own ads, before you try and figure out overall tallies. Disney and Amazon had [a total of 40bn impressions between them](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266882/us-online-advertisers-ranked-by-impressions/) in the first quarter of 2020, and Google is pretty much [powered by advertising](https://fourweekmba.com/google-advertising-contributed-to-less-than-80-in-revenue-in-q1-2023-vs-q1-2022/):

> Google is an attention merchant that – in 2022 – generated over $224 billion (almost 80% of revenues) from ads (Google Search, YouTube Ads, and Network sites.

If you want some idea of the scale of advertising you’re subjected to on a daily basis, things are only moving up. Recent research by Lunio claims that, on average, people [might have seen between 500 and 1,000 ads a day in the 1970s](https://lunio.ai/blog/strategy/how-many-ads-do-we-see-a-day/). By 2007, when [adware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware) vendors dropping ad-spewing installers was common and ad affiliate networks in meltdown was a daily occurrence, it was estimated at 5,000. By 2021, it was an average of 6,000 to 10,000 per day.

You have adverts and pop ups on your phone. You have advertising on your video game console dashboard. There’s another batch of stepladder adverts on your desktop. Your [IoT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/iot) home hub either plays an occasional ad or is plugged into some other service you use to buy things from.

Your television? Well, it might be one of the upcoming models where the TV is free in return for built in adverts [constantly playing on a smaller screen](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1658072615267827713). This is probably as good a place as any to remind you to always read the small print, however:

Some of the most common types of advertising you’ll encounter include:

* **Pay per click (PPC)**. Advertisers pay publishers every time an advert is clicked.
* **Affiliate marketing**. With this form of marketing, the creator of a product avoids taking up the marketing slack. Instead, it is essentiall...
