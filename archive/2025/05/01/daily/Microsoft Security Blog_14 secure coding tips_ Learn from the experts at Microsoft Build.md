Hey friends! If you are a developer, you know that writing clean and efficient code is just the starting point. Now, with AI playing a bigger role, secure coding isn't just a 'nice-to-have'‚Äîit's a must. Whether you're building web apps, working on cloud services, or adding AI to your projects, keeping your code safe is just as important as getting it out the door.

At Microsoft Build 2025, we‚Äôre bringing together some of the most influential security engineers, researchers, and developers to share practical tips and modern best practices to help you ship secure code ‚Äî faster.

Here are 14 quick secure coding tips that will make you a better, more security-savvy developer ‚Äî and the [security sessions @Build](https://aka.ms/SecurityatBuild) where you can learn more from the experts:

##### **üéØ 1. Secure AI from the start**

Discover how to deliver intelligent apps without sacrificing security. This session covers how to protect against threats across code, secrets, dependencies, and even LLMs. Learn how to use Threat Modeling early in the product lifecycle to identify, assess and address security risks. You‚Äôll learn about developer-focused security tools to deploy with confidence without context switching.

**Learn more:**

* Session: ‚ÄúShift Left: Secure Your Code and AI from the Start‚Äù
* With Mark Russinovich, CTO, Deputy CISO and Technical Fellow, Microsoft Azure; Marcelo Oliveira, VP, Product Management, GitHub; Neil Coles, Principal Security Engineer

##### **üß™ 2. Use the Wisdom from the Past**

Michael Howard - author of the original secure coding book back in 2003 and now a senior director in the Microsoft Red Team - reflects on 25 years of secure code, how the practice has developed and current challenges in secure development. Get ready¬† for an end-to-end secure coding journey from Bill Gates anecdotes and tips for how you in 2025 can code securely to meet today's security threats.

**Learn more:**

* Session: ‚ÄúReflections on 25 years of writing secure code‚Äù
* With Michael Howard, Senior Director, Red Team

##### **üìè3. Lock down the data**

Microsoft is releasing a set of Purview APIs (+SDK) that will allow partners and customers to integrate their custom AI apps with the Microsoft Purview ecosystem for enterprise grade Data Security and Compliance outcomes. Join this demo session to get the latest.

**Learn more:**

* Session: ‚ÄúBuild secure and compliant AI applications with Microsoft Purview‚Äù
* With Arpitha Dhanapathi, Principal Product Manager

##### **üîö4. Think about security from start to finish**

Security can be challenging at the best of times, especially when it‚Äôs not your full-time job. In this session, we walk you through the end-to-end deployment of a secure AI application, all the way from identities, VNETS, NSGs, key vault through to prompt shields and data labelling. If you‚Äôve ever felt overwhelmed by trying to do the right thing by security but didn‚Äôt know where to start, this session is for you!

**Learn more:**

* Session: ‚ÄúDeploying an end-to-end secure AI application‚Äù
* With Sarah Young, Principal Security Advocate & Pamela Fox, Principal Cloud Advocate

##### **ü§ñ 5. Play dev-ils advocate**

To keep pace with evolving AI risks, organizations need tools to effectively test their AI systems, simulate adversarial attacks, and uncover weaknesses before bad actors can exploit them. Learn how the AI Red Teaming Agent in Azure AI Foundry can help your organization run automated scans for safety risks so you can leverage Microsoft's deep expertise to scale and accelerate your AI development with Trustworthy AI at the forefront.
