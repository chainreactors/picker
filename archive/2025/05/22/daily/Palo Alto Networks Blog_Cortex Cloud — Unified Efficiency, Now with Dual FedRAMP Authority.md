[Mean time to resolution (MTTR)](/blog/tag/mean-time-to-resolution-mttr/)

In a testament to its commitment to secured and streamlined cloud security, Cortex® Cloud has already [achieved FedRAMP High and Moderate authorizations](/blog/cloud-security/cortex-cloud-stands-alone-to-secure-mission-critical-workloads-with-fedramp-high-and-moderate/) since launching in February 2025. This significant milestone positions Cortex Cloud as the only CNAPP in the FedRAMP Marketplace holding both High and Moderate designations, underscoring its unique ability to cater to the diverse security needs of the U.S. government.

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is the government's rigorous standard for assessing, authorizing and continuously monitoring cloud services. By achieving both High and Moderate authorizations, Cortex Cloud demonstrates its adherence to stringent security controls, paving the way for federal agencies to confidently adopt its innovative platform.

## Unlocking Efficiency Through a Unified Security Platform

At a time when government agencies are [prioritizing modernization and efficiency](/blog/2025/03/making-every-dollar-count-federal-cybersecurity/), Cortex Cloud offers a powerful, unified solution. As the next generation of Prisma® Cloud, it transcends traditional, siloed security tools by integrating best-in-class cloud detection and response (CDR) with industry-leading, cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) capabilities. This platform-centric approach delivers measurable benefits:

* **Streamlined Procurement –** By choosing Cortex Cloud with FedRAMP High authorization to secure your environment, agencies can bypass the complexities and delays of redundant security assessments.
* **Reduced Complexity and Risk –** By integrating security across the entire cloud lifecycle (from code to cloud to SOC) Cortex Cloud eliminates the operational overhead and potential vulnerabilities associated with managing disparate security tools.
* **Enhanced Operational Efficiency –** The unified platform provides comprehensive visibility and context, enabling security teams to prioritize risks effectively, automate responses and reduce the mean time to respond (MTTR) to threats.
* **Intelligent Risk Reduction –** Cortex Cloud's cloud posture security capabilities offer agentless visibility and intelligently group-related issues, empowering security teams to focus on the most critical risks with minimal effort.
* **Proactive Threat Prevention –** Stop attacks in real-time with cloud detection and response (CDR) maintaining the integrity and availability of government systems, as breaches are prevented before impacting mission-critical operations.
* **Securing the Application Lifecycle –** Cortex Cloud's application security features enable agencies to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the software supply chain, preventing risks from ever reaching production.

## Meeting Diverse Government Needs with a Single, Powerful Platform

The dual FedRAMP High and Moderate authorizations empower Cortex Cloud to address a wide spectrum of government requirements:

* **FedRAMP High –** For the most sensitive, unclassified data where compromise could severely impact national security, economic stability or public safety. Cortex Cloud meets over 400 rigorous security controls for mission-critical applications.
* **FedRAMP Moderate –** For federal information where loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability would have serious adverse effects. Cortex Cloud adheres to over 300 security controls, suitable for a broad range of data, including PII.

Furthermore, Cortex Cloud's GovRAMP High and Moderate certifications highlight its commitment to serving state and local governments with equally robust and efficient cloud security solutions.

## Driving Productivity and Cost Savings

The U.S. government's focus on maximizing efficiency and productivity aligns perfectly with the benefits offered by Cortex Cloud's unified platform. By consolidating security functions and providing intelligent insights, Cortex Cloud helps agencies:

* **Optimize Resources –** Security teams can operate more efficiently, focusing on strategic initiatives rather than managing a complex web of point solutions.
* **Improve Security Outcomes –** Comprehensive visibility and integrated threat intelligence lead to a stronger security posture and reduced risk of costly breaches.
* **Accelerate Cloud Adoption –** Agencies can confidently embrace the scalability and flexibility of the cloud while maintaining the highest security standards.

Cortex Cloud's FedRAMP High and Moderate authorizations are more than just certifications; they represent a commitment to providing government agencies with an efficient, unified and highly secure cloud security platform. By streamlining operations, reducing complexity and delivering comprehensive protection, Cortex Cloud empowers the U.S. government to achieve its modernization goals while safeguarding its most critical assets.
