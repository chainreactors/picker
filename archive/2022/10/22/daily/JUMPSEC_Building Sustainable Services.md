Arguably the biggest challenge facing the cyber security industry today is the shortage of skilled professionals. The worldwide skills gap is much reported and debated, with many organisations feeling the strain of not enough viable candidates to fill their vacant positions in an area that is seeing significant expansion in many organisations who are rightly beginning to take cyber security seriously. The numbers vary across sources, but most estimate the number of unfilled cyber security positions today in the millions worldwide.

However, the root of the problem is not the availability of incoming candidates, but the ability to retain skilled and experienced employees. More colleges and universities than ever are offering cyber security courses, and online learning programmes continue to make cyber security fundamentals more accessible than ever – a far cry from how many older professionals today first cut their teeth in the industry. But ultimately, no certification or e-learning is a substitute for hands-on experience. Whilst there are more people attempting to enter the industry than ever, specialist disciplines and mid-level positions continue to pose a challenge in terms of recruitment and retention.

**It can take anything from six months to a year for a new cyber security analyst to become fully proficient, whilst the typical lifetime of a security practitioner working in a typical operating model is around 2 years – leaving only a narrow window in which the employee can add real value to the company.**

The data tells us that skilled and experienced professionals are leaving the industry due to burnout and disillusionment. In the UK, the cybersecurity workforce reportedly shrank by 65,000 last year and according to a study from earlier this year, 1 in 3 current cyber security professionals are planning to change professions. According to ISACA’s State of Cybersecurity 2022 report, published in March, the top reasons for cyber security professionals leaving their jobs included being recruited by other companies (59%), poor financial incentives in terms of salary or bonus (48%), limited promotion and development opportunities (47%), high levels of work-related stress (45%), and lack of management support (34%).

When discussing the skills shortage, many by default think of businesses struggling to recruit for their internal cyber security vacancies. But this is equally challenging for specialist providers of consulting and managed cyber security services. Businesses are increasingly reliant on third-party managed services, particularly mid-size organisations where outsourcing to a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) represents a much more commercially viable solution with considerably less up-front investment.

**The global managed security services market size was valued at $22 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $77 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14% from 2021 to 2030 – a sizeable chunk of the projected total cyber security market size of $376 billion.**

For many MSSPs, resource scarcity is driving comparatively higher rising costs of employment, which in turn is contributing to an unheal...
