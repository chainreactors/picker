# Borderless Vigilantism: The Nativist US Militias Entering Mexico

February 21, 2023

Run all the way back!” shouts Jeremiah ‘Jay’ Shivers to a terrified, unarmed man whom he threatens at gunpoint. Shivers is an affiliate of a nationalist militia, and “back” means Mexico. But a geolocation indicates that, in his bid to strengthen the US’ southern border, Shivers crossed it himself.

This is one of at least four instances in which members of Shivers’ militia group, or their drones, crossed into Mexican territory and uploaded evidence to Telegram. These four videos have now been geolocated by Bellingcat.

Shivers’ outfit, Veterans on Patrol (VoP), has employed a variety of aggressive anti-immigrant tactics in recent years. Situated in Pima County, Arizona, the group is reportedly one of dozens which targets migrants on US soil.

Veterans on Patrol isn’t the only militia to have spoken candidly about cross-border operations — though this June 2022 video, and separate footage from November 2021, appear to be among the first independently verified evidence for them. VoP members contacted by Bellingcat for this article have also confirmed that they have entered Mexico “exactly where the criminals enter illegally”.

*An instance of VoP’s reported leader Michael “Lewis Arthur” Meyer seemingly promoting extranational militia activity on Telegram.*

Beyond his stint with the border militia, VoP volunteer Jeremiah Shivers was active with several far-right movements and events. Business Insider [reported](https://www.businessinsider.nl/photos-who-were-the-protesters-who-showed-up-to-the-justice-for-j6-rally-in-dc/) his presence at a September 2021 ‘Justice for J6’ rally in Washington DC, held in support of the rioters who stormed the US Capitol Building on January 6.

After Shivers’ [death](https://www.dcourier.com/news/2022/aug/20/obituary-jeremiah-daniel-shivers/) from cancer in July 2022, the VoP-affiliated Telegram channel seen above mourned “the most fierce VoP volunteer to ever storm into Mexico”.

The tactics employed by Shivers and his comrades raise a plethora of legal issues, not least the ramifications of violent altercations within Mexican territory.

In the US and Mexico, naturalised citizens and undocumented migrants alike are [afforded basic rights and protections](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights#police-or-ice-are-at-my-home), which could be jeopardised by violent extremists now on both sides of the border.

Last month, United States Senators Ed Markey, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker released a [letter](https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/senators_letter_to_the_biden_administration_on_vigilante_groups_at_the_southern_us_border_-_january_2023pdf.pdf) imploring Attorney General Merrick Garland, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner Troy Miller to further investigate vigilante activity by Veterans on Patrol.

Their concerns surround VoP’s verified activity intercepting unaccompanied minors along the US-Mexico border and possible violations of a [US law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/912) which prohibits individuals from impersonating agents of the federal government. Notably absent, however, is any mention of extranational activity by VoP or any other paramilitary group.

“To date, nine patriots and one documentary crew have crossed into Mexico to disrupt the cartel”, reads the Telegram post containing the aforementioned video of Shivers.

“They eliminated the border… so we will just take territory in Mexico one mountain at a time”, continued the post. “Either the Mexican military seals their side off, or Veterans on Patrol will.”

## **Who are Veterans on Patrol?**

Veterans on Patrol is a nativist militia which has been active in Arizona since 2015. Founded as a [support network](https://whyy.org/segments/offering-homeless-vets-social-support-first-housing/) for homeless veterans, VoP maintained camps in Tucson and Phoenix to aid disaffected communities while forging [relationships](https://tucson.com/news/local/armed-patrols-aim-to-protect-homeless-vets-women/article_fbfe3644-f847-5218-803f-17869537bc97.html) with organisations across the far right. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an independent civil rights watchdog, the group has been under the continued leadership of Michael Meyer, also known by the name ‘Lewis Arthur’. Christian nationalism and nativism are central tenets of the militia’s worldview.

The SPLC writes that VoP [shifted its focus](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/veterans-patrol) in 2018 to address [human trafficking](https://tucson.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/steller-column-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-catches-fire-despite-lack-of-evidence/article_b6b6c798-22a3-5ccb-9fb2-99cdccfc73d9.html), particularly of migrant children. In recent years, VoP’s associates have [reportedly](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/us/border-qanon-arizona.html) embraced conspiracy theories which incite extranational vigilantism and militant activity; in the spring of 2022, QAnon adherents travelled to Arizona in support of the militia’s activities.

This month a report by the Tech Transparency Project, a non-profit campaign to demand accountability from big tech platforms, [claimed](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/border-militias-use-facebook-spread-migrant-conspiracies) that VoP continues to recruit volunteers and appeal for material support from its thousands of [supporters in online forums](https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/border-militias-use-facebook-spread-migrant-conspiracies), most notably Telegram and Facebook.

## **Geolocating the Footage**

In the footage from June 2022, Shivers pans across a desert landscape to show his location on the spine of a prominent ridge, made clear by steep drops flanking a rocky trail. Before he focuses the camera on a sprawling collection of dark tarpaulins and blankets, a set of nondescript peaks become visible in the...
