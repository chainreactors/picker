**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: code-projects Online Exam Mastering System 1.0 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
# Google Dork: inurl:/exam/feedback.php
# Date: 2025-04-19
# Exploit Author: Pruthu Raut
# Vendor Homepage: https://code-projects.org/
# Software Link: https://code-projects.org/online-exam-system-in-php-with-source-code/
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on: XAMPP on Windows 10 / Kali Linux (Apache + PHP 7.x)
# CVE : CVE-2025-28121

# Description:
# code-projects Online Exam Mastering System 1.0 is vulnerable to a Reflected XSS vulnerability in feedback.php via the "q" parameter.
# The application fails to sanitize user input properly, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

# Vulnerable URL:
# http://localhost/exam/feedback.php?q=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20valuable%20feedback

# PoC (Proof of Concept):
# Payload:
http://localhost/exam/feedback.php?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>

# Steps to Reproduce:
# 1. Host the application locally using XAMPP or a similar stack.
# 2. Open the vulnerable URL with the payload in a browser.
# 3. The JavaScript alert will be executed, demonstrating reflected XSS.

# Impact:
# - Account takeover via stolen cookies if a privileged user clicks the malicious link.
# - Full control of victim’s session context if exploited properly.
# - Can be chained with social engineering to target administrators.

# Mitigation:
# - Use `htmlspecialchars()` or a proper encoding mechanism to sanitize user input.
# - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
# - Avoid reflecting unsanitized GET parameters into the HTML response.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_cam...
