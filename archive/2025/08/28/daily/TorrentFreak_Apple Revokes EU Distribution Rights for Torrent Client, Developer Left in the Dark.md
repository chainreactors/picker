# Apple Revokes EU Distribution Rights for Torrent Client, Developer Left in the Dark (Updated)

Under EU law, Apple is required to give its users more freedom to install apps that are not listed in the official App Store. This allows for easier access to software that's typically prohibited by Apple, including the popular iTorrent BitTorrent client. The iTorrent client built a steady user base over the past year, but that came to an abrupt end when Apple decided to revoke the developer's alternative distribution rights.

This breakthrough was a direct result of the EU’s Digital Markets Act ([DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act)) that went into effect last year, requiring Apple to allow apps to be installed through third-party stores.

[AltStore Pal](https://altstore.io/) is one of the most popular altstores in the EU. Soon after it launched, two torrent clients were [made available](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/224724/eerste-ios-torrentclients-komen-beschikbaar-voor-europese-iphone-gebruikers.html): iTorrent and qBitControl. This was a notable milestone that AltStore actively [promoted](https://www.threads.com/%40altstoreio/post/C90CNunJIY8/) on social media.

AltStore PAL assured its users that these apps were put through a vetting process to ensure that they are secure. And indeed, in the months that followed, many people installed and used the torrent clients without problems.

## Apple Bars iTorrent Distribution

*Update: After publication, Apple responded with an explanation after publication. We have an [update below](#update), confirming that the decision was not torrent-related.*

While alternative app stores operate independently and are required by EU law, Apple is still in a position to exert some control. This became apparent a few weeks ago, when [iTorrent](https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent) users suddenly ran into trouble when installing the app.

In July, several users [complained](https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent/issues/401) that they were unable to download iTorrent from AltStore PAL. Initially the cause of the problem was unclear but the app’s developer, XITRIX, later confirmed that Apple itself had stepped in.

Apparently, Apple had revoked the developer’s “alternative distribution” right, which is required to publish apps in alternative stores, including AltStore PAL.

*Rights revoked*

Given Apple’s [long history](https://torrentfreak.com/apple-bans-bittorrent-software-090511/) of [banning](https://torrentfreak.com/apple-boots-bittorrent-app-from-iphone-store-101006/) torrent apps from its own store, it’s tempting to conclude that the company stepped in for the same reason here. For now, however, there’s no confirmation that’s indeed the case.

## Developer Responds

Speaking directly with TorrentFreak, iTorrent developer Daniil Vinogradov (XITRIX) says that Apple did not reach out to him regarding the revocation of his alternative EU distribution rights.

Soon after the issues appeared, Vinogradov sent a support request to Apple seeking clarification, but that wasn’t helpful either. Instead, Apple responded with a generic message related to App Store issues.

After another follow-up last week, Apple informed the developer that their escalation team is looking into it, but nothing further. “I still have no idea if it was my fault or Apple’s, and their responses make no sense,” Vinogradov says.

## AltStore in the Dark, Apple remains quiet

AltStore PAL is not responsible for the issues, but it has also sprung into action. Co-founder Shane Gill informs TorrentFreak that they requested clarification from Apple but are still in the dark about the company’s reasons to intervene.

“I can confirm that we are in communication with Apple about this issue. We’ve told them what’s going wrong, and they said they’re looking into it, but we haven’t gotten any further information as of yet,” Gill says.

For now, there is no evidence that the ‘BitTorrent’ link is the cause of the problem. According to Gill, Apple has never provided AltStore with any guidelines or warnings on specific app categories.

Apple has not responded publicly yet either. When we reached out, the company asked us to call them, but our call went unanswered. The same applies to the follow-up requests we sent via email over the past few days.

While there may be a perfectly logical explanation for iTorrent’s revoked rights, Apple’s handling of the matter so far only fuels speculation. Some might even argue that the lack of transparency in revoking distribution rights violates the letter or the spirit of the EU’s Digital Markets Act.

**Update August 28:** A day after publication, Apple informed us that the distribution rights (notarization) were revoked due to sanctions-related rules.

“Notarization for this app was removed in order to comply with government sanctions-related rules in various jurisdictions. We have communicated this to the developer,” Apple told us.

No further context was provided, but the developer purportedly had a Russian developer account, despite living in Malta.
