## Tracking World Leaders Using Strava

Way back in 2018, people noticed that you could [find secret military bases](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/29/strava-problem-fitness-app-locate-worlds-most-powerful-people) using data published by the Strava fitness app. Soldiers and other military personal were using them to track their runs, and you could look at the public data and find places where there should be no people running.

Six years later, the problem remains. *Le Monde* [has](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2024/10/27/how-emmanuel-macron-can-be-tracked-watch-the-first-episode-of-stravaleaks_6730708_7.html) [reported](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/10/28/biden-and-trump-put-in-danger-by-secret-service-agents-watch-the-second-episode-of-stravaleaks_6730825_133.html) [that](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/29/putin-s-bodyguards-go-on-runs-near-palace-he-denies-owning-stravaleaks-episode-3_6730915_4.html) the same Strava data can be used to track the movements of world leaders. They don’t wear the tracking device, but many of their bodyguards do.

So, we go from tracking celebrities by their private planes (Celebrity Private Jet Tracker), to military deployments and world leaders through the Strava use of their personnel.

This is a side-channel attack that can be extended endlessly.

VIPs affect their environment because of their entourage and changes in behavior of the local population. The US president travels with their own “army”, but most other VIPs will depend on local security and services.

Someone, somewhere will find a way to follow VIPs by the way they stir up local services and their employees, like preferred transportation and chauffeurs. If a VIP wants a certain type of flower arrangement, or other personal service, in their residence, it should be possible to look out for that changing.

**Six degrees of the cyber age**

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation>

I thought we had talked about this a decade or more ago when those first systems that produced “relationship maps/charts” appeared, that authorities had great hopes would find every terrorist in existence.

As it turns out it appears terrorists must be either somewhat smarter or less connected.

The data to do this sort of connection is in so many databases of “third party business records” that get sold left right and center to anyone with a few dollars in hand, that I’m surprised it’s news any more.

Unfortunately all the *Le Monde* articles are behind a paywall.

Seems like this relies on being able to figure out who the bodyguards are and their profiles. I guess it’s about the same as being able to figure out where someone is by looking at their social media posts, just a bit easier.

Anyways, in my opinion more of an issue on the users’ side than the app’s side, unless users are not intending to share their locations. But looking at the purpose of the app, it seems sharing your location is the point.

@ Winter, ALL,

With regards,

> “Someone, somewhere will find a way to follow VIPs by the way they stir up local services and their employees…”

Not just “VIPs” remember Law Enforcement have grabbed “crime bosses” when large orders for pizza have been placed to feed not just the “boss” but the “entourage” as well.

It’s not just the “carbon” that leaves an easily seen “footprint”… one “boss” was caught because the vehicles they and their entourage were moving in effectively drained a small local gas station, and word got out fairly quickly.

There are even stories about the start of the first gulf war and the Pentagon. Apparently so many “take outs” were ordered most fast food outlets in the area knew that the “midnight oil” was being burnt and the “starters gun” had been fired.

But the opposite applies sometimes. Back in WWII prior to D-Day apparently Patton had two or more “ghost divisions” forming his “Ghost Army”. In reality just over a thousand talented soldiers running around the South East corner of Kent etc, creating much noise and disturbance to fool the Germans,

It might not be that these users are intentionally sharing their location data with the public. I have used Strava, as well as other similar apps, to track my own runs. I expect this data to be private and only accessible to myself.

The problem here is that companies are trying to make everything “social”. It often is done by default.

Another example is the peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. By default it publicly shares every transaction you make. You have to explicitly go in and change your settings from the default public mode to private, which seems crazy. Who wants to see every payment their friends make to other random people? And who wants to share their own payment details publicly?

@ Colin Bennett, ratwithahat,

With regards,

> “The problem here is that companies are trying to make everything “social”. It often is done by default.”

Err not quite.

The companies are trying to make everything “profit”, and is the default behaviour.

Thus,

1, The costs of storing data are minimised.

2, The costs of making data available are minimised.

So the data is stored in an “all in silo” and the code to access it has minimal –if any– security.

Thus anyone wanting to get to the whole data set for any way to get an illicit ad...
