### Steam Phishing: popular as ever

A month or so ago a friend of mine received the following message on Steam from someone in their Friends list (they were already friends):

The two links are different and refer to a Gift Card on Steam's community platform. As you might have noticed, the domain is not related to Steam at all, but rather is an attempt at phishing.

 The URLs are:

> *ste**r**mco**r**mmunity[.]com/gift-card/
> steamco**u**mmun**i**ity[.]com/gift-card/*

The differences are subtle enough that you may just miss it. When you click on the link, you are redirected to a 'Summer Gift Marathon'.

Once you log in to the fake Steam website, your credentials are stolen and will be used to spread more phishing, likely steal your inventory items and so on.

Other phishing sites related to this campaign are:

steam-pubgvn[.]top
steamauthconnection[.]store
steamcommnunity[.]com
steamcommunitay[.]com
steamcommunitfy[.]com
steamcommunitihy[.]icu
steamcommunitiny[.]com

stearncommunjty[.]com
stearncommunnity[.]com
stearncomnunity[.]com
stearncornnunity[.]com
steeamcommunitty[.]com
unevwsteeamcommunitty[.]com

New ones do pop up from time to time, so stay vigilant.

## **Tips**

Only log in on the legitimate Steam community website, this being <https://steamcommunity.com/>. An extra tip is to **bookmark the legitimate site**, so even if you do get a message like this, you can go straight to your bookmark and search what you need from there.

If someone new tries to add you as a Friend and immediately sends a message like the above, alarm bells should start ringing.

If someone already on your Friends list suddenly sends a random message with an even more random link out of the blue, cue the alarm bells again.

If you want to check the website out in a safe manner, then you can use [URLscan.io](http://URLscan.io), which will give you a verdict of the website as well as an image preview. In addition, you can use [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to review a website's reputation.

Note that an 'all clean' does not necessarily mean it is. Caution above all!

Follow Steam's Account Security [Recommendations](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6639-EB3C-EC79-FF60%20) to stay safe.
