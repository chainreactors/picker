Continuing a long-standing annual tradition, today we publish our list of the most popular torrent sites at the start of 2025. Ranked by traffic estimates, we see that YTS remains on top, closely followed by 1337x and anime torrent site NYAA. TorrentGalaxy ends up in fourth place, despite ongoing troubles.

YTS remains at the top of the list in 2025, as the torrent indexer continues to draw millions of visitors per day.

That’s quite an achievement considering the legal troubles the site has faced in the past, plus the fact that it only features movies.

There is little innovation in the torrent landscape as the list of popular torrent sites remains largely unchanged. There are a few positional changes, but the list consists of the same names as last year.

We have limited the list to globally available English-language torrent sites, which means that sites such as Rutracker.org, Maxitorrent.net, and Zamunda.net are not included, even though they have substantial traffic numbers.

Finally, we have to stress that the yearly ranking is based on single domain names. If proxy sites and alternative domains were taken into account, The Pirate Bay and others would rank higher.

Below is the full list of the top ten most-visited torrent site domains at the start of 2025. The list is based on various traffic reports. Please note that this list is created as a historical record, to keep track of the popularity of these sites over time.

*We do not recommend or endorse using any of these sites. Aside from copyright infringement concerns, some are known to link to malicious ads and other dubious practices, at least incidentally. BitTorrent technology itself is not illegal but may only be used to share content with permission from the rightsholder.*

### 1. YTS.mx

![YTS logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/ytslogo.jpg)

YTS.mx is the unofficial successor of the defunct YTS or YIFY group, which shut down a few years ago.

YTS has been the target of several lawsuits in the U.S. over the past few years. The operator signed a consent judgment and agreed to [hand over user data](https://torrentfreak.com/yts-operator-helped-movie-companies-catch-a-pirating-user-200817/) to rightsholders. As a result, several YTS users received settlement requests or were sued instead.

**Last year #1**

### 2. [1337x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1337x)

![1337x logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/1337xlogo.jpg)

1337x offers a wide variety of torrents. The site [banned](https://torrentfreak.com/torrent-site-1337x-bans-yts-user-data-200820/) official YTS releases after the above-mentioned controversy.

**Last year #2**

### 3. [NYAA.si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaa_Torrents)

![NYAA logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/nyaa.jpg)NYAA.si is a popular resurrection of the anime torrent site [NYAA](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/nyaa/). While there is fierce competition from alternative pirate streaming sites, the torrent portal continues to do well, climbing two positions compared to last year.

**Last year #3**

### 4. TorrentGalaxy.to

![tgx](https://torrentfreak.com/images/tgx.png) [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/torrentgalaxy/) was [sold to a new owner in 2024](https://torrentfreak.com/torrentgalaxy-has-a-rough-start-under-new-owners-241017/) and suffered technical issues and repeated downtime. Despite these problems, it maintained its fourth place.

The site has a dedicated group of uploaders and an active community. In addition to torrents, TorrentGalaxy also makes some releases available for streaming.

**Last year #4**

5. [The Pirate Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay)

![Pirate Bay logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/tpb-piratebay-thepiratebay-logo.jpg)After celebrating its [20th anniversary](https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary-230919/) last year, [The Pirate Bay](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/the-pirate-bay/) has now dropped to the fifth spot. The [new Pirate Bay TV series](https://torrentfreak.com/pirating-the-pirate-bay-tv-series-is-ironically-difficult-241108/) in Sweden did little to raise its traffic.

The Pirate Bay continues to operate from its .org domain but is also available through many proxies. If all proxy domains were counted, the notorious torrent site would still battle for the first spot in this list.

**Last year #5**

### 6. [FitGirl Repacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitGirl_Repacks)

![fitgirl repacks logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/fitgirl-repacks.jpg)[FitGirl Repacks](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/fitgirl/) is by no means a traditional torrent site. It is the home of a popular repacker who releases slimmed-down cracked versions of popular games, which keeps download times to a minimum.

FitGirl, who we [interviewed](https://torrentfreak.com/meet-fitgirl-the-repack-queen-of-pirated-games-200604/) in 2020, publishes torrents on other sites too but also offers magnet links of their own, which is why we included the site here.

A few days ago, the United States Trade Representative listed FitGirl Repacks in its list of [most notorious pirate sites](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-trade-representative-lists-the-most-notorious-piracy-threats-250108/) for the first time, adding extra legal pressure.

**Last year #6**

### 7. EZTVx.to

![EZTV logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/eztvlo.png)EZTVx.to is a controversial TV-torrent distribution group that hijacked the [EZTV](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/eztv/) brand from the original group, which was forced to shut down soon after.

The site still has some decent traffic, mostly from loyal TV-show followers who haven’t jumped on the streaming bandwagon. The site recently moved to a new .to doamin.

**Last year #8**

### 8. Skidrow & RELOADED

![skidrow](https://torrentfreak.com/images/skidrow-300x90.png)Skidrow and RELOADED (skidrowreloaded.com) are two iconic game-cracking groups. This likely served as inspiration for the people running Skidrowreloaded.com, which is a blog-style release site featuring popular game releases.

The site’s X account has been banned, but the domain itself remains online, keeping the seventh spot after last year’s debut.

**Last year #7**

### 9. LimeTorrents

![limetorrents logo](https://torrentfreak.com/images/limetorrents.jpg)LimeTorrents.lol has been around since 2009. Like many other entries in this list, it is blocked by ISPs in countries around the world, which seems to hurt overall traffic somewhat. It dropped out of the top 10 last year but made...
