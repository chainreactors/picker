## The Inability to Simultaneously Verify Sentience, Location, and Identity

Really interesting “systematization of knowledge” [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02202.pdf):

> “SoK: The Ghost Trilemma”
>
> **Abstract:** Trolls, bots, and sybils distort online discourse and compromise the security of networked platforms. User identity is central to the vectors of attack and manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties of identity—sentience, location, and uniqueness—that cannot be simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many fully-decentralized systems—whether for communication or social coordination—grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy.

I think this conceptualization makes sense, and explains a lot.

… Sentience, Location, and *Uniqueness*?

I suggest that with so many nation states trying to control opinion anmd argument about current affairs, “centralized trust” is a high risk concept.

@ ALL,

**“The Inability to Simultaneously Verify Sentience, Location, and Identity”**

A Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for a new century and problem domain.

No I don’t want to make AI Security sound like the new Quantum Mechanics, but that title sure draws some threads across.

@ ALL,

The paper introduction begins with a quote that effectively describes a loss of importance or relavance in a world increasingly not based on a shortage of information but an avalange of the irrelevant and effectively false information.

In a way it’s describing the issue of,

“One can fool some men, or fool all men in some places and times, but one cannot fool all men in all places and ages.”

(translation of, Jacques Abbadie 1864).

But in more modern times, what people tend to forget more often than they should is that extracting usefull information is a reductive process of lifting a signal out of what we call for want of a better name “noise”, which is it’s self a multiplicity of signals.

It’s well known to engineers that noise is it’s self a signal comprised of signals that are combined and at a certain point cease to be strictly meaningfull as individual signals at a point or time in space, thus are only amenable to statistical evaluation. Thus the techniques of statistical mechanics can be used as a simplification.

From a single point of observation the signals are like individual particles that go behind the broad effect we call “Brownian Motion”.

However the important thing to remember is that the noise I perceive at point A is not the same noise you perceive at point B. Thus a desired signal can be lifted from the noise if there is a way to synchronise all the different measurments[1].

Thus with multipoint observations “statistical mechanics” nolonger applies as it does at a single point of observation.

This is “known knowledge” that people need to move from one domain to another.

This paper defines it’s domain as being one or more points on the Internet trying to determin from received signals if the originator possesses,

1, Sentience

This is not the best way to go about things.

If we look at finding enemy agents in WWII certain techniques were developed to solve the last two issues of Location and Uniqueness as Sentience was considered a given. The techniques have been called “Find, Fix, Finish”.

It did not take long for Sentience to become an issue. As a method of defence the “operator” would set up an automated system that ran on a time switch that transmitted a tape. That way they could be safely away from the transmitter. Or as in some cases it was used as a “duck decoy/call” where the hunting forces got drawn into an ambush and got “Finished” themselves as “Dead Ducks”. Thus to protect themselves trying to establish if the operator was real became of importance to the hunting forces.

The same game started playing out with airwarfare in the cold war as radar and similar systems developed. It was not long befor “Electronic Counter Measures”(ECM) were developed. Initially it was “false echo” systems that had a similar effect to “chaff/window” that used halfwave length rsonators made out of foil. Where each one of the hundreds launched gave a false echo atlrast as strong as an aircraft. Thus “Electronic counter counter measures”(ECCM) had to be developed, these worked on the fact that “ECM Pods” were always at a single location and that could be worked out using an offset receiver system. In essence the signal at Receiver B was identical other than a time delay to the prime Receiver A, which it would not be the case if there were multiple signals…

I don’t need to say how ECM-ECCM-ECCCM developed into an “arms race” of it’s own.

Thus there are many lessons to “port” from the “Electronic Warfare”(EW) domain into the Internet domain.

But also consider the aim of the attacker is to get a message across in a small region. If they are to obvious it fails as their transmitters get recognised for what they are.

This is where MIMO LPI systems come into the picture. In general MIMO is used to hide the “message” by using “synthetic noise” so the mess...
