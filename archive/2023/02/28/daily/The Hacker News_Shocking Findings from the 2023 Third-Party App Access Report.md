Spoiler Alert: Organizations with 10,000 SaaS users that use M365 and Google Workspace average over 4,371 additional connected apps.

SaaS-to-SaaS (third-party) app installations are growing *nonstop* at organizations around the world. When an employee needs an additional app to increase their efficiency or productivity, they rarely think twice before installing. Most employees don't even realize that this SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity, which requires scopes like the ability to read, update, create, and delete content, increases their organization's attack surface in a significant way.

Third-party app connections typically take place outside the view of the security team, are not vetted to understand the level of risk they pose.

Adaptive Shield's latest report, [Uncovering the Risks & Realities of Third-Party Connected Apps](https://www.adaptive-shield.com/saas-to-saas-3rd-party-app-risk-report-2023?utm_source=The%20Hacker%20News&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=thn_therisksandrealitiesofthirdpartyconnectedapplications.1), dives into the data on this topic. It reviews the average number of SaaS-to-SaaS apps organizations have, and the level of risk they present. Here are the top 5 findings.

## Finding #1: Connected Apps Run Deep

The report focuses on Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 (M365), as it paints a clear picture of the scope of applications that are integrating with the two applications.

On average, a company with 10,000 SaaS users using M365 has 2,033 apps connected to its suite of applications. Companies of that size using Google Workspace have more than three-times the amount, averaging 6,710 connected applications.

Even smaller companies aren't immune. The report found that companies using M365 average 0.2 applications per user, while those using Google Workspace average 0.6 applications per user.

## Finding #2: The More Employees, the More Apps

In contrast to most growth curves, the research shows that the number of apps per user doesn't level off or plateau once reaching a critical mass of users. Rather, the number of applications continues to grow with the number of users.

As seen in figure 1, companies using Google Workspace with 10,000-20,000 employees average nearly 14,000 unique connected applications. This continued growth is shocking to security teams, and makes it nearly impossible for them to manually discover and manage the high volume of applications.

## Finding #3: SaaS-to-SaaS App Risk is High

When third-party apps integrate with core SaaS apps, they gain access using an OAuth process. As part of this process, applications request specific scopes. These scopes hand over a lot of power to the apps.

[![Third-Party App Access Report](data:image/png;base64... "Third-Party App Access Report")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjisGvsSJCuAvwshTBMZa25NDaPoVl7mNFgydMHdSqzrnpi4MMPa2cuTXtBm_PQ8QPcuBmDdH1Q_zFtPlG8r3TW04FT2qA1XIXD9-ElvvCv0pgvm9uRFWoIcpGVG7hF1DdsniFjIJuYsh1xcie0Ibi6EBlNm5oCK1G4SEi6ZZS9mhPLvzKCNG1s_Qmr/s790-rw-e365/gmail.png)

Among high-risk scopes, 15% of M365 applications request the authority to delete all files that the user can access. It gets even scarier in Google Workspace applications, where 40% of high-risk scopes receive the ability to delete all Google Drive files.

As shown in this permission tab, the application explicitly requests permission to see, edit, create, and delete all Google Docs documents, Google Drive files, Google Slides presentations, and Google Sheets spreadsheets.

For security teams accustomed to controlling the data, permission sets like these are unsettling. Considering that many applications are created by individual developers who may not have prioritized security in their software development, these permissions provide threat actors with everything they need to access and steal or encrypt company data. Even without a threat actor, a bug in the software can have disastrous consequences for a company's data.

## Finding #4: Connected Apps Also Have Tremendous Breadth

While the report deep dives into the big two SaaS apps, it does also release research into Salesforce (and Slack). Salesforce averages 41 integrated apps per instance. The implication of this is noteworthy.

Salesforce is primarily used by a small subset of the company. In that regard, it's similar to Workday, Github, and ServiceNow, which are used by HR, developers, and finance teams. A typical company with 10,000 employees has over 350 SaaS applications in its stack, many of which are used by smaller departments like the apps discussed here.

Assuming Salesforce is typical of similar applications, those 350 apps integrating w...
