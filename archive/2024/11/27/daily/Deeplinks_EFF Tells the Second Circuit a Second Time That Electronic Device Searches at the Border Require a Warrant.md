EFF, along with ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties Union, filed a second [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-smith-2d-cir-amicus-brief) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit urging the court to require a warrant for border searches of electronic devices, an [argument](https://www.eff.org/issues/border-searches) EFF has been making in the [courts](https://www.eff.org/cases/alasaad-v-duke?type=document#related-content) and [Congress](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/10/come-back-warrant-congress-should-pass-protecting-data-border-act) for nearly a decade.

The case, *[U.S. v. Smith](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1542577607294049710)*, involved a traveler who was stopped at Newark airport after returning from a trip to Jamaica. He was detained by border officers at the behest of the FBI and his cell phone was forensically searched. He had been under investigation for his involvement in a conspiracy to control the New York area emergency mitigation services (“EMS”) industry, which included (among other things) insurance fraud and extortion. He was subsequently prosecuted and sought to have the evidence from his cell phone thrown out of court.
