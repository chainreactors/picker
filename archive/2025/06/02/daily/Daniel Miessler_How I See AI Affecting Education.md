# How I See AI Affecting Education

By default AI will magnify gaps between good and bad students

![AI Effect on Education Gap](https://danielmiessler.com/images/ai-education-split-screen.png)

I've got a one-liner for what AI will do to education.

And it'll be the same [with everything else](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/great-bifurcation). But I want to be clear about something:

*I’m not saying this is how it should be, or how it could be, or how I intend for it to be*.

I’m actually working on a system for how this can *not* be the case—where we can have AI close the gap rather than widen it.

What I’m saying is: this is what’s happening now—by default. In education, but also everywhere else AI touches.

AI, [just like reading](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/ai-becoming-reading), is a powerful tool for self-improvement. But like all such tools, they’re mostly used by people who are into self-improvement.

So the real game is getting more people into that self-improvement culture and mindset.
