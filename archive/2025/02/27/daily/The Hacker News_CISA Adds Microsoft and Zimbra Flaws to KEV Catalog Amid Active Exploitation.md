[![KEV Catalog](data:image/png;base64... "KEV Catalog")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhH8pFU8YfCkEwsQ745qpiB6X2gHc15WEv9fmFVLxABOAhz_VPS3w3vIcpGzIZ4QbBJIQsSeVV6albcR0RP1e-Iyx9pZemw9FyFwp5nWqDOsuLheNnSWLXAOgiBIJ0_I9Mt4WvmSiiSGTGYWdEjbaP7pKkpjjcN9pjrAmvFs_20dHJt-VSGUt_jl6MG58Y7/s790-rw-e365/cisa.png)

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Tuesday [placed](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/25/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) two security flaws impacting Microsoft Partner Center and Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities ([KEV](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.

The vulnerabilities in question are as follows -

* **[CVE-2024-49035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-49035)** (CVSS score: 8.7) - An improper access control vulnerability in Microsoft Partner Center that allows an attacker to escalate privileges. (Fixed in [November 2024](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/microsoft-fixes-ai-cloud-and-erp.html))

* **[CVE-2023-34192](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34192)** (CVSS score: 9.0) - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Synacor ZCS that allows a remote authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the /h/autoSaveDraft function. (Fixed in [July 2023](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories) with version 8.8.15 Patch 40)

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

Last year, Microsoft acknowledged that CVE-2024-49035 had been exploited in the wild, but did not reveal any additional details on how it was weaponized in real-world attacks. There are currently no public reports about in-the-wild abuse of CVE-2023-34192.

In light of the development, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies are mandated to apply the necessary updates by March 18, 2025, to secure their networks.

The development comes a day after CISA [added](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/two-actively-exploited-security-flaws.html) two security flaws impacting Adobe ColdFusion and Oracle Agile Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
