Proxmox offers various constructs for building virtual networks. We’ll focus on using bridges to emulate physical links, as we did in UNetLab v1.

Linux bridges handle frames differently:

* Broadcast frames are forwarded to all ports.
* Multicast frames are forwarded to a subset of ports.
* Peer-to-peer frames are not forwarded.
* All other frames are forwarded to all ports.

Key files in the
[Linux Kernel sources](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/net/bridge)
 are **br\_input.c** and **br\_sysfs\_br.c**.

In **br\_input.c**, the **br\_handle\_frame** function decides whether to forward or discard frames based on the destination MAC address. Frames with destination **0x01** are always discarded. A
[mask](https://interestingtraffic.nl/2017/11/21/an-oddly-specific-post-about-group_fwd_mask/)
 called **fwd\_mask** affects the function’s outcome in some cases.

We aim to introduce the mask concept for the **0x01** case as well.

In **br\_sysfs\_br.c**, the **set\_group\_fwd\_mask** function sometimes prevents evaluating the **group\_fwd\_mask**. We will modify this to always evaluate the mask.

With a modified kernel, you can control the **/sys/class/net/vmbr1/bridge/group\_fwd\_mask** mask to enable or disable forwarding any packet. Our modified kernel allows values up to **65535**, forwarding any frame, achieving our goal.
