![Evilginx 3.2 - Swimming With The Phishes](/content/images/size/w2000/2023/08/evilginx32-3.png)

Welcome back!

I've recently managed to find some free time to work on [reverse proxy support for the latest Google updates](https://twitter.com/mrgretzky/status/1686807176143061000) and in the process I've made several additions to the Evilginx code base, which I think some of you will find useful.

To start, I wanted to give a big shoutout to Daniel ([@dunderhay](https://twitter.com/dunderhay)) for [publishing a great post on how he used Evilginx](https://research.aurainfosec.io/pentest/hook-line-and-phishlet/) to phish the Microsoft 365 ADFS environment and how he even made his modifications to succeed!

Evilginx is getting more love this year than in the last couple of years and I'm very happy about it. I have big plans for Evilginx, which I will announce soon, but first I wanted to give you a rundown of what the latest 3.2 update consists of.

[Download Evilginx 3.2 - GitHub](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2)

I will start with the most significant changes.

## Dynamic Redirection on Session Capture

One of the behaviours, that annoyed me when using Evilginx, was the fact that sometimes it was not possible to immediately redirect the phished user to the configured `redirect_url`, once all session tokens were captured. Evilginx could only redirect the browser once the targeted website attempted to navigate to a different page, on its own.

It made redirects not work on single-page applications. I learned it first-hand during the development of the Training Lab for my [Evilginx Mastery](https://academy.breakdev.org/evilginx-mastery) course. The main page of the lab changes its contents dynamically and never navigates to a different URL. This means that once session tokens are captured by Evilginx, the tool is unable to redirect the user to `redirect_url` address.

In the 3.2 update, I've managed to solve the problem with injected JavaScript sending out HTTP long polling requests on every proxied page, to retrieve session capture status directly from the Evilginx proxy server in real-time. Evilginx will inject its own JavaScript code on every HTML page load, which will be responsible for querying `https://<phish_domain>/s/<phish_session_id>` infinitely. Evilginx proxy server will respond with a JSON structure, containing the `redirect_url` value only when the session is successfully captured. Otherwise, the connection will time out after 30 seconds and will be retried afterwards. Long polling allows Evilginx to let the injected script know that the session was captured immediately when it happens.

The script will then change the `window.location` URL to the retrieved `redirect_url` value, redirecting the user to a preconfigured page address. Redirection should now work great within [Evilginx Mastery](https://academy.breakdev.org/evilginx-mastery) Training Lab.

Instead of HTTP long polling, I could've used WebSockets, but I wanted to keep it simple without the need to rely on external libraries, which would need to be injected as well.

## Temporary Lure Pausing

![](https://breakdev.org/content/images/2023/08/image-1.png)

Imagine a situation - you're on a phishing engagement and finally get to send out your phishing lures. Once the emails start arriving at the target inbox, the mailbox server opens them one by one and scans the HTML content of every phishing URL. The mail server then determines emails as phishing and they are sent to quarantine.

There are many ways to prevent automated scanners from seeing the content of your phishing pages, but the most straightforward method would be to simply hide your phishing pages for a brief moment, right before you send out the emails. Enough to hide their content from automated scanners, but not from the targeted user.

Now you can easily [hide your lures](https://help.evilginx.com/docs/guides/lures#pause) from prying eyes by pausing them for a specific time duration with:

```
lures pause <id> <time_duration>
```

The best part is that you don't have to worry about unpausing a lure manually. Once the pause period expires, the lure with become active again and you will get a notification about it in the terminal. The pause state also persists between Evilginx restarts.

## Interception of HTTP Requests

I found out that sometimes it would be useful to be able to block some of the proxied requests or have them return custom responses, without the proxied requests ever reaching the destination server.

Now you can detect specific requests within the new `intercept` section in your phishlets, which will match specific URL paths on domains within your `proxy_hosts` list. Once the request matches your filters, you will be able to detour the request and return your response with a custom HTTP status code.

```
intercept:
  - {domain: 'www.linkedin.com', path: '^\/report_error$', http_status: 200, body: '{"error":0}'', mime: "application/json"}
  - {domain: 'app.linkedin.com', path: '^\/api\/v1\/log\/.*', http_status: 404}
```

In the example above, any request to `https://www.linkedin.com/report_error` will be intercepted and will return HTTP status `200` with response body `{"error":0}` and MIME type `application/json`.

The second entry will make sure that all requests to `https://app.linkedin.com/api/v1/log/<whatever>` will return `404 Not Found` HTTP response.

## Redirect URL Added to Phishlets

Sometimes for the phishlet to work properly and to not interrupt the phished user's experience, it needs to redirect the user's browser right after session tokens are successfully captured. For now, the redirect would happen only if `redirect_url` was specified for the lure, used with the phishing engagement.

At times, it is important to have a default `redirect_url` specified, especially if we want the user to be redirected to the home page of the phished website, by design. Sometimes the redirection to the home page will happen automatically, but sometimes it needs to be enforced.

From this Evilginx version, you can [set a default `redirect_url` in the phishlet](https://help.evilginx.com/docs/phishlet-format#header) you are creating to make sure the phished user is redirected, once session tokens are captured, even if `redirect_url` has not been set up for the given lure.

## Unauthorized Request Redirects Per Phishlet

First of all, I've changed the name `redirect_url` from global config to `unauth_url`, to better illustrate its purpose and so it doesn't get confused with `redirect_url` set up in phishlets or lures.

**IMPORTANT!** Keep note that the URL you set for unauthorized request redirects may reset itself after the update, due to the name change.

Unauthorized URL or `unauth_url` holds the URL address where visitors will be redirected if they open any URL on the phishing domain, which doesn't correspond to any valid URL or if the lure is currently paused.

So far, it was possible to set up `unauth_url` globally, which would provide the same URL to redirect to for all active phishlets. With 3.2 you can now override the global `unauth_url` by specifying a value for each phishlet with:

```
phishlets unauth_url <phishlet> <url>
```
