*Aachen/Amsterdam/Utrecht, September 2, 2025*

We are pleased to announce a successful collaboration initiative between INFORM and ThreatFabric, proudly endorsed by Rabobank. Driven by a deep mutual understanding of online fraud prevention and a shared vision to protect the financial ecosystem and its customers, this collaboration marks a significant step forward in the fight against financial crime for all parties involved.

As innovation drivers, INFORM and ThreatFabric combined their expertise in a comprehensive, layered approach - covering every aspect of the online customer journey, from initial login through to back-end financial transactions. On September 23, ThreatFabric and INFORM will jointly host a Fraud Prevention webinar sharing their experiences on this subject.

Anton Jan Cozijnsen, Area Lead External Fraud Detection at Rabobank, states: *“By working closely with our innovation partners ThreatFabric and INFORM, Rabobank can now protect our customers very early in their online journey. We adapt our protection to address every conceivable fraud scenario.”*

Cengiz Han Sahin, CEO of ThreatFabric, adds: *“Fraud and scams are more than just financial losses: victims lose their savings, confidence, and trust. That’s why we’re thrilled to collaborate with INFORM on this project. Their expertise in financial risk, combined with our SDK-based fraud platform, creates a powerful synergy. Together, we can stop fraud before any money ever leaves the account.”*

Roy Prayikulam, SVP Risk and Fraud at INFORM, comments: *“Thanks to our long-standing partnership with Rabobank and ThreatFabric’s innovative approach, we are excited to proactively prevent fraud early in the customer journey and enable Rabobank’s clients to enjoy a secure and seamless banking experience.”*

## How it works:

* ThreatFabric’s SDK-based Fraud Risk Suite (FRS) identifies early indicators of fraud - such as device risks, remote access tools, bot activity, and behavioral or identity-related anomalies - from the moment a user logs in.
* These insights are seamlessly integrated into INFORM’s RiskShield, a real-time, hybrid AI-powered multi-channel platform that enriches the data with a wide range of contextual signals.
* This enables financial institutions to proactively detect and respond to fraud attempts before any harm is done.

## Why it’s important:

Financial service providers face increasing pressure to modernize and optimize their systems in a continuously evolving regulatory landscape. To meet growing market demands for effective and efficient fraud prevention and AML compliance, they require specialized expertise and proven solutions that can adapt to both operational challenges and shifting regulatory expectations.

## Webinar Notice:

On September 23, experts from INFORM and ThreatFabric will discuss the topics covered in this release in a free webinar. Further information and registration are available here:
