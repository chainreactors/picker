# AI-powered content farms start clogging search results with ad-stuffed spam

Posted: May 4, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A [recent study](https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/newsbots-ai-generated-news-websites-proliferating/) by NewsGuard, trackers of online misinformation, makes some alarming discoveries about the role of [artificial intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) in content farm generation. If you’ve previously held your nose at the content mill grind, it’s probably going to become a lot more unpleasant.

Content farms are the pinnacle of search engine optimisation (SEO) shenanigans. Take a large collection of likely underpaid writers, set up a bunch of similar looking sites, and then plaster them with adverts. The sites are covered with articles expressly designed to float up to the top of search rankings, and then generate a fortune in ad clicks.

If you’ve ever searched for something and walked into a site which spends about 4 paragraphs slowly describing your question back to you before (maybe) answering it, congratulations. I share your pain.

The worst part about this kind of content production is that in recent years many otherwise legitimate sites now write like this too. The pattern to look out for is as follows:

* A paragraph or two describing your problem back to you as if you’re ten years old.
* A paragraph break with a large advert.
* Another 3 paragraphs which may or may not answer your question.

On top of that, sites don’t just populate with reasonable, genuine questions. They now fill up with ludicrous questions, or answer the questions badly. Not only is garbage like this unhelpful itself, it also keeps you away from the good stuff.

This is the current state of play before we throw AI-generated content into the mix. What did NewsGuard find?

49 news and information sites which appear to be “almost entirely written by artificial intelligence software”. There’s a broad spread of languages used on these sites, ranging from Chinese and Tagalog to English and French. This helps ensure the content is being seen by as many people as possible, as well as clogging up search engines that little bit more. Some of the key points:

* Lack of disclosure of ownership / control, making it hard to assess bias or possible political leanings.
* Topics include entertainment, finance, health, and technology.
* “Hundred of articles per day” published on some of the sites.
* False narratives are pushed by some of the sites.
* High advertising saturation.
* Generic names like “News Live 79” and “Daily Business Post”.

As for the actual written content itself, it is said to be filled with “bland language and repetitive phrases”. This is one of the key indicators of AI-generated content. Additionally, many of the sites began publishing just as the various content creation AI tools, tools like [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security), started to be used by the public. Quite a coincidence!

Other strong indicators include:

* Phrases in articles which are often used by AI in response to prompts. One example given is “I am not capable of producing 1500 words… However, I can provide you with a summary of the article”.
* No bylines given for authors. Reverse image searches for a handful of supposed authors reveal that images have been [scraped](https://web.archive.org/web/20230412032...
