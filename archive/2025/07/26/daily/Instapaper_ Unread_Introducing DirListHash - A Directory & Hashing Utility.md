Here's another quick script made out of partial necessity. DirListHash is a simple Python script that takes a folder as input and traverses the folder and subfolders and files and creates a listing of all items with some metadata such as path, size, MAC timestamps.

It also has the options to provide hash values for all, either SHA1, MD5 or both. For output options it currently supports CSV and SQLite.

The script is currently only commandline based but if a GUI is needed later I don't think it should be difficult to provide. Compiled EXE provided alongside the code.

### [StartMe Up (Forensic Edition)](https://www.stark4n6.com/2020/12/startme-up-forensic-edition.html)

As part of my own benefit I created a Start.Me page for a bunch of FOSS forensic tools and utilities that I currently have in my toolkit. I've also included RSS feeds for blogs I follow as well as YouTube channels and some other links to sites I frequent. You can access it at startme.stark4n6.com Â or preview it below (embedding on Blogger isn't the best). If anyone has suggestions on more items to add or links please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @KevinPagano3 . \*Cues The Rolling Stones\*

### [Chrome Network Action Predictor, Preloading all your Webpages](https://www.stark4n6.com/2021/02/chrome-network-action-predictor.html)

One of the useful features Chrome has had for a long is text prediction. When you start to search for something Google attempts to predict what you are looking for. This works for not only keywords but also for previous URLs that you may have visited. Figure 1: Sample Google search with predictions The toggle for preloading webpages in the current build of Chrome (88) can be found under: Settings > Privacy and security > Cookies and other site data Figure 2: Preload pages toggle in Chrome Settings Well of course Google is tracking it all in a database. You can find it at the following path: Windows: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network Action Predictor Android: data\data\com.android.chrome\app\_chrome\Default\Network Action Predictor We don't get specific timestamps on when a hit was registered but we do get insight into what the user was typing out to get to a specific keyword or search. We also get the amount of hits and misses that specifi...
