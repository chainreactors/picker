# Official EU Website Exploited to Advertise Shady IPTV Services

The European Commission's Eurostat website has been exploited by third parties who used it to advertise shady IPTV services. The straightforward SEO 'hack' aimed to rank well for various IPTV-related searches, including the top position for "best IPTV providers of 2025". To make matters worse, it confused AI, leading it to suggest that the EU was offering IPTV advice

The report covered many unlicensed IPTV services, including VolkaIPTV, GenIPTV, and King365TV, noting that these are merely the tip of the iceberg.

“There are likely to be thousands of pirate IPTV apps and services in the world. The pirate IPTV landscape is complex and difficult to penetrate because it typically involves multiple layers of restreaming and reselling,” the European Commission wrote at the time.

The EU is not wrong; it has been aware of the pirate IPTV problem for a while and actively supports research and enforcement actions to counter the threat.

Yet, despite these efforts to identify and curb illegal services, a significant vulnerability emerged closer to home. The European Commission’s own technical infrastructure was exploited to boost shady IPTV sales. That’s a serious problem.

## Eurostat Website Promotes IPTV

While researching IPTV services this week, our attention was drawn to a PDF document uploaded to the Eurostat portal. Eurostat is the department at the Commission that provides high-quality statistics and data about Europe to the EU and its member states.

The document we spotted does not fall into this category. Instead, it provides an overview of the “best” IPTV services for 2025. This includes a prominent link to “get started now”, which directs visitors to portugueseiptv[.]pt.

Whether this link directs visitors to a ‘real’ IPTV service or an outright scam isn’t immediately clear, but it’s best avoided in any case.

The service promises access to a wide variety of live sports, +18,000 channels, and +98,000 VOD titles for less than $60 per year. This includes Netflix content, Disney, the Premier League, NFL, [and much more](https://torrentfreak.com/images/loads.jpg). Needless to say, it sounds too good to be true.

## SEO Hack

This PDF file was one of many. A quick search for more matches on Eurostat’s website revealed that several had been posted on Eurostat’s website two weeks ago, all trying to promote IPTV services.

This type of scam is not new. Vulnerabilities in the upload functionalities of reputable websites are often abused for pirate scams, a problem the EU has encountered before. That said, IPTV-related ‘hacks’ are relatively rare.

The goal of these PDFs is to rank high for popular search terms and phrases. This typically leads people to access the documents. Those who don’t immediately recognize these as scams might even be inclined to click the included links.

## EU’s Best IPTV Services?

In this case, the PDF appeared as the first result for several key search terms and phrases, including “best IPTV providers of 2025,” as shown below.

Making matters even more confusing, Google’s AI overview [interpreted](https://torrentfreak.com/images/european-commission-recommend-iptv.jpg) the PDF document as an official EU stance, blending the information into a response when we asked about the EU’s IPTV recommendations.

“HyperStream Plus is known for its high-speed, low-buffer service with 4K support, ViewFlex IPTV is popular for its family-friendly and international language packages, and BlueWave IPTV is praised for its stability and user-friendliness,” the response read.

Before writing up our findings, we alerted Eurostat to the problem, allowing it time to address the issue. After all, these SEO hacks are a vulnerability and a potential security risk.

This morning, Eurostat informed us that the issue was identified and quickly fixed. And indeed, the PDFs no longer appear on its website. But if history is any guide, similar hacks will undoubtedly appear on other websites.
