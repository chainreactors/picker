## Friday Squid Blogging: Chinese Squid Fishing in the Southeast Pacific

Chinese squid fishing boats are [overwhelming](https://en.mercopress.com/2023/02/16/ecuador-and-peru-fighting-a-losing-battle-with-china-on-giant-squid-fishing-in-the-southeast-pacific) Ecuador and Peru.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@ vas pup, ALL,

Re : Hypersonic flight.

> “Hypersonic missiles differ from conventional ballistic weapons in ways that make them harder to catch by missile defense systems. It comes down to speed and altitude.”

As with all things it’s more complicated than that[1].

One issue is anti-misiles have to fly faster than the missiles they are targeting by several times.

What a lot of people don’t realise is that plasma build up just like a space craft on reentry, causes a radio-blackout for the hypersonic missile therefore it can not use radar or radio to know where it’s target is.

Whilst this is not much of an issue when attacking land based fixed and hardened targets, it makes a significant difference if the target is mobile at 50kph or more.

The “flare” from the plasma does not need to be seen by radar it has a fairly easily identifiable emission spectrum visable in space. So it can be detected relatively easily thus mobile vehicles can just “scatter” as a first order defence mechanism. Even relatively slow moving ships can get out of the way if the missile has a conventional munitions payload.

We are aware that China has thought on this issue, and their aircraft launched hypersonic missiles have been designed for nuclear warheads as they are used as long range “stand-off” weapons.

Hence we know both the US and Chinese have researched into laser anti-weapons for ship defence, that have already been deployed. Such laser weapons can also be used offensively and they have been observed “lighting up the sky” in the South China Sea.

Thus new “tactics” are going to need to be developed for these new weapons and I suspect Russia will be at best a long way behind not just China and the US, but other Western nations such as France and UK both of whom see them as next generation lucrative arms exports as do their “partners”.

[1] Have a look at the first such design of hypersonic missile, cslled “Pluto” designed in the 1960’s by the US and scrapped for various reasons (not just becsuse it was an unshielded nuclear reactor pumping out organic killing neutron radiation).

If you remember back a few years ago Russia tried to develop it’s own Pluto and one of the early flights went badly wrong and radiation levels all over Europe went up so we had a good idea of what Russia was upto without needing any “secret intelligence”.

Journalist Matt Taibbi said he was protecting the identity of a source by refusing to give the date of first contact with that source: “Taibbi began to say he couldn’t reveal that information when Garcia insisted she simply needed a date.”

How easy is it to fine the source, if you have that information, the date? I’d say, if you are the government, pretty easy. So Taibbi is right that giving out the date might be tantamount to disclosing a source.

SVB will be interesting.

Normally, you do not take control of a bank in the morning.

Australia’s current commonwealth ombud, Iain Anderson, has called for an increase in investigatory powers for the statutory office, including the equivalent of a standing right of entry and search of government electronic records and IT systems like other oversight inspectorates.
