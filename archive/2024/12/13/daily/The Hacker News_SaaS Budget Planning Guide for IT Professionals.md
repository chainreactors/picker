SaaS services are one of the biggest drivers of OpEx (operating expenses) for modern businesses. With [Gartner projecting $247.2 billion in global SaaS spending this year](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-05-20-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-surpass-675-billion-in-2024#:~:text=While%20cloud%20infrastructure%20and%20platform,total%20%24247.2%20billion%20in%202024.), it's no wonder SaaS budgets are a big deal in the world of finance and IT. Efficient SaaS utilization can significantly affect both the bottom line and employee productivity.

In this article, we'll break down this topic that sits at the intersection of finance and IT and walk through what SaaS budget planning is, why it matters, and how you can avoid common SaaS budgeting mistakes.

Are you planning Your 2025 Budget? You're likely wasting 25% of your SaaS spend—ready to reclaim it?

## **What is SaaS budget planning?**

SaaS budget planning is the process of creating budget plans for SaaS expenses within an organization. The process typically involves collaboration between finance, IT, and SaaS application owners.

On the surface, that sounds pretty simple. However, SaaS budgeting comes with some unique quirks and "gotchas" that can prove costly if you're not careful. Understanding SaaS value, measuring utilization, and complex SaaS pricing models and contracts can make SaaS budgeting challenging. The right combination of strategy, collaboration, and SaaS budgeting tools can help organizations address these challenges.

## **Why SaaS budgeting is important**

Effective SaaS budgeting is important because it helps organizations become efficient with their SaaS investment. A relatively conservative estimate from TechCrunch suggests [SaaS spending per employee ranges from $1,000 to $3,500](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/22/how-cfos-can-reduce-saas-spend-by-30-in-these-tough-times/).

While it's true that a significant portion of SaaS spending is beneficial and enhances employee productivity, the objective of SaaS budgeting isn't to eliminate SaaS expenses entirely. It's to ensure that every dollar spent on SaaS contributes maximally to your organization's return on investment (ROI). And, when you couple those numbers with a [Flexera report that suggests 33% of SaaS spending is waste](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/report-companies-waste-1-3-or-more-of-their-it-budget/), you have a real opportunity for meaningful savings.

"A seemingly tight budget often signals untapped savings. With a strategic software asset management approach, backed by data and expertise, you can uncover these savings and reinvest them in projects that advance the company's growth strategy," says Raksha Matthias, Director of [Software Asset Management at Softchoice](https://www.softchoice.com/solutions/IT-asset-management/software-asset-management/asset-optimization-assessment). "That's what smart SaaS spending is about. It's more than choosing low-cost solutions—it's about ensuring these solutions optimize your IT budget to solve broader business problems."

With that in mind, organizations that spend tens of thousands of dollars or more on SaaS licenses have started creating [SaaS spend management strategies](https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/saas-spend-management-strategy), to ensure they stay on track.

Otherwise, you could risk serious waste related to:

* Unused SaaS applications
* Wasted licenses
* Duplicate SaaS solutions
* Missed savings opportunities

Creating a SaaS budget is just one part of that overarching strategy

## **How to create a SaaS budget**

Once you've recognized the need for a SaaS budget, it's time to create one.

Here are the five high-level steps to do just that.

### **1. Understand your business needs**

SaaS licenses should provide solutions specific to your business problems. You should begin your SaaS budgeting process with a thorough understanding of end-user needs and business context. Without a grounding in context, it can be easy to make SaaS spending decisions that are penny-wise and pound-foolish.

For example, cutting $10,000 of license costs for a premium wireframing tool might look good in a spreadsheet, but if it slows product development down by weeks, it's probably a bad business decision.

### **2. Create a SaaS inventory**

One of the best parts about SaaS is how easy it is to get started. If you have a credit card and an email, you can be up and running with a SaaS tool in minutes. Unfortunately, that's also why SaaS-based [shadow IT](https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/what-is-shadow-it) is so prevalent. Well-intentioned employees can quickly find solutions to business problems and add another SaaS expense that isn't visible to IT.

Of course, it can be challenging to get started if you've never created a SaaS inventory before. The table below summarizes 10 essential elements of a solid SaaS inventory.
