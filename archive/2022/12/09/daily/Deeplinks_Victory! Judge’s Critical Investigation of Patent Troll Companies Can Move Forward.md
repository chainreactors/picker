In recent months, Delaware-based U.S. District Court Judge Colm Connolly [started an inquiry into some patent trolling companies](https://www.eff.org/el/deeplinks/2022/12/judges-investigation-patent-trolls-must-be-allowed-move-forward) that have filed dozens of lawsuits in his court. Last month, lawyers for the patent troll companies appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, seeking to shut down the investigation.

Those events led EFF to file an [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/files/2022/12/01/22-2_eff_amicus.pdf), in which we stood up for the public’s “right … to know who is controlling and benefiting from litigation in publicly-funded courts.” We filed this brief together with two other organizations that work with us on patent transparency issues, [Engine Advocacy](https://www.engine.is/) and [Public Interest Patent Law Institute](https://www.piplius.org/).

Today, the Federal Circuit accepted our brief, and [denied the petition](https://www.eff.org/files/2022/12/08/44_-_order_denying_nimitz_writ.pdf) filed by patent troll Nimitz Technologies that sought to halt the investigation. The Federal Circuit panel called out strong language in [Judge Connolly’s Memorandum](https://www.eff.org/files/2022/12/01/conno...
