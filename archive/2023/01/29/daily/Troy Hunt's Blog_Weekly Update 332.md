# Weekly Update 332

28 January 2023

Breaches all over the place today! Well, this past week, and there's some debate as to whether one of them is a breach, a scrape or if the term just doesn't matter anyway. Plus, we've been kitchen shopping, I'm helping friends out with connected doorbells and other random but somehow related things this week. Enjoy 😊
