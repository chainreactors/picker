## Winner, Name that Ware July 2025

The Ware for July 2025 is a Vernier Lab Pro. While researching the ware with FETguy, we noticed that the OEM for the product is probably Inventec, which also made a line of [products for TI calculators](http://www.datamath.org/Graphing/JPEG_TI-Presenter.htm) at the time. That particular OEM design team applied its design language in several products. I’ll give the prize to Jin who got the exact make and model of the board. Congrats, email me for your prize!
