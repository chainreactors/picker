# Weekly Update 447

12 April 2025

I'm home! Well, for a day, then it's off to the other side of the country (which I just flew over last night on the way back from Dublin ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for an event at the Microsoft Accelerator in Perth on Monday. Such is the path we've taken, but it does provide some awesome opportunities to meet up with folks around the world and see some really interesting stuff. Come by if you're over that way or if you're on the east coast of Aus, I'll be at [NDC Melbourne](https://ndcmelbourne.com/?ref=troyhunt.com) only a couple of weeks later. And somewhere in the midst of all that, we'll get this HIBP UX rebuild finished...
