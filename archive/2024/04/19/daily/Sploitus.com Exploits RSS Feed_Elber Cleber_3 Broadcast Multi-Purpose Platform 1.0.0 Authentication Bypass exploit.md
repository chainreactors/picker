Elber Cleber/3 Broadcast Multi-Purpose Platform 1.0.0 Authentication Bypass

Vendor: Elber S.r.l.
Product web page: https://www.elber.it
Affected version: 1.0.0 Revision 7304
1.0.0 Revision 7284
1.0.0 Revision 6505

Summary: Cleber offers a powerful, flexible and modular hardware and
software platform for broadcasting and contribution networks where
customers can install up to six boards with no limitations in terms
of position or number. Based on a Linux embedded OS, it detects the
presence of the boards and shows the related control interface to the
user, either through web GUI and Touchscreen TFT display. Power supply
can be single (AC and/or DC) or dual (hot swappable for redundancy);
customer may chose between two ranges for DC sources, that is 22-65
or 10-36 Vdc for site or DSNG applications.

Desc: The device suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability through
a direct and unauthorized access to the password management functionality. The
issue allows attackers to bypass authentication by manipulating the set_pwd
endpoint that enables them to overwrite the password of any user within the
system. This grants unauthorized and administrative access to protected areas
of the application compromising the device's system security.
