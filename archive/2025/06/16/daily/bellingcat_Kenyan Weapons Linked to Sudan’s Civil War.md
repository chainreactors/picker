# Kenyan Weapons Linked to Sudan’s Civil War

June 15, 2025

* [Conflict](/tag/conflict)
* [Kenya](/tag/kenya)

Bellingcat and our partners at Kenya’s Daily Nation have identified Kenyan-labelled crates of ammunition inside an alleged RSF depot close to the recently recaptured Sudanese capital Khartoum.

Although we couldn’t independently verify the contents of every crate identified, tins with ammunition matching the labels on the crates were found nearby among the captured weapons displayed by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).

The confirmation of ammunition crates inside Sudan raises new questions about Kenya’s involvement in the conflict following a high-profile visit by Rapid Support Forces [leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo to Nairobi](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/world/africa/sudan-rsf-paramilitaries-kenya-charter-government-civil-war.html) earlier this year.

In response to the visit, the Sudanese government [banned all imports from Kenya](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg815277g5o) amid a perception of close ties between the Ruto government and General Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti.

The Kenyan government defended the decision to host Hemedti, stating that their aim was to [promote dialogue and peace](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/national/article/2001517252/mudavadi-tells-diplomats-kenya-not-taking-sides-in-sudan-conflict) and emphasising the importance of engaging all parties involved in the conflict.

While the Kenya Ordnance Factories Corporation (KOFC) states on its [website](https://www.kofc.co.ke/products.htm) that it produces small arms ammunition, it does not indicate manufacturing higher-calibre 14.5×114 mm cartridges and the Chinese-made HE PP87 mortar bombs identified in this investigation.

Our partners at Daily Nation reached out to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of Kenya to ask about the crates we identified and how they ended up in Sudan. We also asked whether it was Kenyan government policy to supply ammunition or weapons to the Rapid Support Forces and how this comports with the government’s public commitment to facilitating peace and dialogue in Sudan.

In its response, the Ministry of Defence said it did not recognise the crates or labels on them and distanced itself from the allegations. Its answer appears to be limited to nationally produced ammunition only as well as internal protocols. It didn’t mention if Kenya has done any imports, international transfers or diversions of the weapons or ammunition in question. A statement that leaves key concerns about the Sudan connection unclear.

“Upon examination of the photographs provided, we wish to state that we do not recognize the crates nor the inscriptions on them.

The Kenya Ordinance Factory Corporation and, by extension, the Ministry is alive to the sensitive nature of the ammunition it manufactures, and as a result, it has clear records of its supplies within and beyond Kenya. Alongside this, and to guarantee public safety, audits of the factory’s operations are frequently conducted by the managing and external oversight authorities.

The Ministry of Defence, therefore, distances itself from the allegations you sent earlier.

Further, we remain fully committed to upholding the rule of law and continue to operate strictly within the mandate granted by the Constitution and applicable authorizations.”

Justin Lynch, Managing Director of the Conflict Insights Group and a Sudan researcher, told Bellingcat the discovery of the crates is further evidence of Kenya’s political and logistical support for the RSF.

## A Country at War, Awash with Foreign Weapons

Sudan is in the midst of an ongoing civil war between two rival factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

The stash of ammunition crates located near Sudan’s capital was filmed by Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers who took part in the final push to retake the city from the RSF who have controlled Khartoum and its surrounding cities for much of the civil war.

The SAF declared it had [retaken the final areas of resistance](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/20/sudans-army-declares-khartoum-state-completely-free-of-paramilitary-rsf) in Khartoum, its twin city of Omdurman, and the neighbouring city of Bahri on May 20, stating the three areas were now completely free of RSF forces.

The re-taking of the capital has led to much footage and images being released. Including footage that appears to show supplies used by the RSF.

A 2005 UN arms [embargo](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15817.doc.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com) remains in place prohibiting any country from supplying weapons to Darfur, Sudan, an area that has seen intense fighting since the outbreak of the civil war.

However both [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2024/07/new-weapons-fuelling-the-sudan-conflict/) and Human Rights Watch have identified weapons produced in [China, Iran, Russia, Serbia and the UAE](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/09/fanning-flames) being used in the conflict.

The Sudanese government brought a case [before the International Court of Justice in The Hague](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze176ryw54o) in May, accusing the UAE of complicity in genocide for its role in suppor...
