### üö® Top Headlines

# **Chinese Cyberspy Possibly Launching Ransomware Attacks as Side Job**

**Summary:** Tools typically employed by Chinese cyberespionage groups have been used in a recent ransomware attack, likely by an individual hacker, Symantec notes in a fresh report.

The toolset includes a legitimate Toshiba executable deployed on the victims‚Äô systems to sideload a malicious DLL that deploys a heavily obfuscated payload containing the PlugX (aka Korplug) backdoor.

According to Symantec, the custom backdoor was previously linked to [Mustang Panda](https://www.securityweek.com/long-running-chinese-espionage-campaign-targets-telecom-firms-in-asian-country/)(aka Earth Preta), a Chinese espionage group, and has never been used by threat actors in other countries.

# **Fraud-as-a-Service allows cybercriminals to launch complex attacks with minimal skills**

Summary: User-friendly fraud kits that enable amateurs to execute complex attacks against thousands of accounts in minutes are widely available on the dark web according to the latest 2024 Report on Global Identity Fraud from [AU10TIX](https://www.au10tix.com/).

FaaS platforms provide all the tools, templates and automation that fraudsters need, including deepfake generators to create synthetic selfies and videos, botnets to automate mass-scale account creation and takeover, and phishing kits for email and web-based scams.

# **The Rise of Non-Ransomware Attacks on AWS S3 Data**

Summary: A sophisticated ransomware gang, Codefinger, has a [cunning new technique](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/01/13/codefinger-encrypting-aws-s3-data-without-ransomware-sse-c/) for encrypting data stored in AWS S3 buckets without traditional ransomware tools. Instead, they exploit the AWS server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C), extorting payment in exchange for the encryption key.

Unlike conventional ransomware, the malicious actors don‚Äôt exfiltrate any data. Instead, they mark the encrypted files for deletion within seven days, putting organizations under pressure to pay the ransom or lose their data for good.

Summary: Threat hunters have shed light on a new campaign targeting the foreign ministry of an unnamed South American nation with bespoke malware capable of granting remote access to infected hosts.

The activity, detected in November 2024, has been attributed by Elastic Security Labs to a threat cluster it tracks as REF7707. Some of the other targets include a telecommunications entity and a university, both located in Southeast Asia.

# **U.S. adversaries increasingly turning to cybercriminals and their malware for help**

Summary: Governments of the United States‚Äô chief adversaries in cyberspace, especially Russia, have increasingly been relying on cybercriminals and their tools to advance their goals, according to a Google report published Tuesday.

There‚Äôs long been overlap between government and criminal cyber operators, but governments are now enjoying the benefits of collaboration and borrowing more ‚Äî both for the general boons they can provide, but also in response to some specific conditions, the Google Threat Intelligence Group report concludes.

### Healthcare:

# **Is AI a Friend or Foe of Healthcare Security?**

Summary: Some say artificial intelligence (AI) has changed healthcare in ways we couldn‚Äôt have imagined just a few years ago. It‚Äôs now used for everything from paperwork to helping doctors make better diagnoses. But like any new tech, there are risks involved.

Currently, AI is both a potent defense mechanism and an attacker enabler. Therefore, the question that must be asked is clear: Is AI an enemy or a friend of cybersecurity in healthcare? Honestly, the answer is both.

### Notable APT Activities:

# **Salt Typhoon strikes again ‚Äì more US ISPs, universities and telecoms networks hit by Chinese hackers**

Summary: Salt Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor best known for recently breaching almost a dozen telecom providers in the US, has struck again, hitting not just American organizations, but also those from the UK, South Africa, and elsewhere around the world.

The latest intrusions were spotted by cybersecurity researchers from Recorded Future, which said the group is targeting internet-exposed web interfaces of Cisco‚Äôs IOS software that powers different routers and switches. These devices have known vulnerabilities that the threat actors are actively exploiting to gain initial access, root privileges, and more.
