Black Hat/DEF CON At the opening of Black Hat, the largest security shindig in the Hacker Summer Camp week ahead of DEF CON and BSides, the opening keynote speaker suggested the current state of AI slightly favors defenders over attackers, but he warned that was not a given for much longer.

"I do believe that AI is the key [in security] because that's one of the few fields where defenders are ahead of the attackers," Mikko Hyppönen, [outgoing](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/04/mikko_hypponen_drone/) chief research officer for Finnish security firm WithSecure, told the audience.

"All the cybersecurity companies here will tell you how extensively they use generative AI in their products. Yes, attackers are using AI as well, but they're only beginning. We've only seen fairly simple attacks with AI so far. It will change, but right now, I would claim we are ahead."
