# Mortal Kombat ransomware forms tag team with crypto-stealing malware

Posted: February 17, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

An “unidentified actor” is making use of these two malicious files to cause combo-laden mayhem on desktops around the world, according to [new research](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-mortalkombat-ransomware-and-laplas-clipper-malware-threats/) from Talos.

The tag-team campaign serves up ransomware known as Mortal Kombat, which borrows the name made famous by the video game, and Laplas Clipper [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), a clipboard stealer. Depending on the flow of infection, targets can expect to find a demand for payment to unlock encrypted files *or* sneaky malware looking to grab [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) details from system clipboard functions.

These attacks have been taking place since December 2022 and have no specific target, with small and large organisations affected, as well as individuals. The infection chain is kick-started by an email harbouring a malicious attachment.

The email is cryptocurrency themed, and claims that a payment of yours has “timed out” and will need resending. Given how long it can take some cryptocurrency payments to be processed, this is likely to raise the curiosity of recipients.

The email comes with a dubious zip attachment containing a BAT loader that begins the infection process when it’s executed. The BAT loader kicks off a chain of events that results in the download and execution of the ransomware *or* the clipper malware, from one of two URLs. (The analysis by Talos does not include how it decides which to deploy, so it could be targeting or just random chance.)

It’s like a choose your own adventure game gone horribly wrong.

## Laplas Clipper

Laplas Clipper is a [form of Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/trojan-clipper), and it takes a very smart approach to cryptocurrency theft. Regular clipboard-swiping malware waits for a user to copy a cryptocurrency address (which looks like a long password) and then switches it out for an address owned by the scammer. The end result is that the victim sends their payment to the attacker instead of the intended recipient.

Laplas switches out to wallet addresses which [look similar to the correct, intended destination](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-clipboard-hijacker-replaces-crypto-wallet-addresses-with-lookalikes/). Rather than carrying a stack of addresses with it, it phones home, contacting its Command and Control (C2) server via [HTTP](https://www.malwarebytes.com/zero-day) GET for a close match.

It’s also able to generate imitation addresses for a wide variety of cryptocurrencies including Monero, [Bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin), Ethereum, Solana, and even Steam trading URLs. This is, of course, very bad news for people who do a lot of wallet address copying and pasting.

In this instance, it creates both persistence on the infected machine via the AppDataRoaming folder and a Windows scheduled task which means Clipper activates “every minute for 416 days”. This essentially grants non-stop monitoring of a system. It then acts as mentioned above, switching out genuine wallet addresses for bogus imitations.

Malwarebytes detects Laplas Clipper as [Trojan](https://www.malwarebytes.com/trojan).Clipper.
