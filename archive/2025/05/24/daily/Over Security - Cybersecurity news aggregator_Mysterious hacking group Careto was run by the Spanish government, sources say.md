# Mysterious hacking group Careto was run by the Spanish government, sources say

## Kaspersky researchers discovered Careto (aka The Mask) more than a decade ago, and privately concluded it was run by the Spanish government.

More than a decade ago, researchers at antivirus company Kaspersky identified suspicious internet traffic of what they thought was a known government-backed group, based on similar targeting and its phishing techniques. Soon, the researchers realized they had found a much more advanced hacking operation that was targeting the Cuban government, among others.

Eventually the researchers were able to attribute the network activity to a mysterious — and at the time completely unknown — Spanish-speaking hacking group that they called Careto, after the Spanish slang word (“ugly face” or “mask” in English), which they found buried within the malware’s code.

Careto was never publicly linked to a specific government. But TechCrunch has now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto’s espionage operations.

When Kaspersky [first revealed the existence of Careto](https://mashable.com/archive/kaspersky-lab-the-mask-careto) in 2014, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment,” with its stealthy malware capable of stealing highly sensitive data, including private conversations and keystrokes from the computers it compromised, much akin to [powerful government spyware today](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#spyware-commercial-government). Careto’s malware was used to hack into government institutions and private companies around the world.

Kaspersky avoided publicly blaming who it thought was behind Careto. But internally, according to several people who worked at Kaspersky at the time and had knowledge of the investigation, its researchers concluded that Careto was a hacking team working for the Spanish government.

“There was no doubt of that, at least no reasonable [doubt],” one of the former employees told TechCrunch, who like other sources in this story agreed to speak on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

Careto is one of only a handful of Western government hacking groups that has ever been discussed in public, along with U.S. government units such as [Equation Group](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/19/snowden-docs-link-nsa-to-equation-group-hackers/), widely believed to be the U.S. National Security Agency; the [Lamberts](https://therecord.media/security-firm-kaspersky-believes-it-found-new-cia-malware), believed to be the CIA; and the French government group known as [Animal Farm](https://securelist.com/animals-in-the-apt-farm/69114/), which was behind the [Babar](http://vice.com/en/article/meet-babar-a-new-malware-almost-certainly-created-by-france/) and [Dino](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dino-french-malware-targeting-iran-searches-for-specific-data-and-steals-it/) malware. In a rare admission, Bernard Barbier, former head of the French intelligence service DGSE, [publicly confirmed](https://medium.com/%40msuiche/nsa-hacked-france-in-2012-414d8de4bdcf#.t9e09wox7:~:text=Barbier%20also%20confirms,the%20developer.%20%23OPSECFAIL) the French government was indeed behind Babar.

The Spanish government now joins this small group of Western government hacking groups.

Early in its investigation, Kaspersky discovered that the Careto hackers had targeted a particular government network and systems in Cuba, according to a second former Kaspersky employee.

It was this Cuban government victim that sparked Kaspersky’s investigation into Careto, according to the people speaking with TechCrunch.

“It all started with a guy who worked for the Cuban government who got infected,” the third former Kaspersky employee, with knowledge of the Careto investigation, told TechCrunch. The person, who referred to the Cuban government victim as “patient zero,” said that it appeared the Careto hackers were interested in Cuba because during that time there were members of the Basque terrorist organization ETA in the country.

Kaspersky researchers noted in a [technical report published after their discovery](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/03/20133638/unveilingthemask_v1.0.pdf) that Cuba had by far the most number of victims per country at the time of the investigation into Careto’s activities, specifically one unnamed Cuban government institution, which the report said showed “the current interest of the attackers.”

This Cuban government victim would prove key to link Careto to Spain, according to the former Kaspersky employees.

“Internally we knew who did it,” the third former Kaspersky employee said, adding that they had “high confidence” it was the Spanish government. Two other former Kaspersky employees, who also had knowledge of the investigation, said the researchers likewise concluded Spain was behind the attacks.

The company, however, decided not to disclose it. “It wasn’t broadcast because I think they didn’t want to out a government like that,” a fourth former Kaspersky researcher said. “We had a strict ‘no attribution’ policy at Kaspersky. Sometimes that ...
