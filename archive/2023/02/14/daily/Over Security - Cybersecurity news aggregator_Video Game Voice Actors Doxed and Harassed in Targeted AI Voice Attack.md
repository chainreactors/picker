Artificial intelligence-generated voices are already being used to harass ordinary people, with online trolls creating the voices and then having them read out victim’s home addresses and posting the results online, according to four victims Motherboard spoke to. All of the victims of this particular campaign are voice actors who have worked on video games in the past.

The news highlights the potent threat posed by AI-generated voices for anyone who has recordings of their voices available online. Podcasters, YouTubers, and streamers are just some of the other sorts of people that could feasibly be targeted by such attacks in the future. Motherboard previously reported how 4chan members created synthetic replicas of celebrities’ voices, [including in one case an Emma Watson replica reading Mein Kampf](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs). That sort of attack now extends to people who aren’t as high profile as Hollywood celebrities.

“Hello, this is Abbey [name] speaking,” a sound clip posted to Twitter using a fake voice of an actor called Abbey says. Motherboard withheld some actors’ last names, including Abbey’s, at their request. The synthetic voice then reads out Abbey’s home address, and adds “I live in the [homophobic slur] city that is Los Angeles. Yes, that does also mean I live in California, the most [racist slur] state in the USA. Personally speaking, killing [racist slur] and [sexually abusive act] children is completely fine.”

The harassers posted similar audio clips on Twitter which included the home address and fake voices of at least three other actors. Zane has worked on *Fallout 4* mods; Tom worked on *Poppy Playtime*. They also posted the address of another actor called Michael. The Twitter accounts created to share these peoples’ private information also retweeted another video using an AI-generated voice, this time in the style of Agent 47 from the Hitman games.

“I basically just saw I was tagged in a post, and the immediate thing I noticed was my home address, so I was surprised to say the least,” Tom told Motherboard in an email. “Then I registered it had the racist rhetoric, framed as inflammatory as possible in such a way an internet troll might do. From what I gathered, it was bait from the get go, trying to get a rise out of voice actors who had publicly expressed concerns about AI.” Last week [Motherboard reported](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d37za/voice-actors-sign-away-rights-to-artificial-intelligence) on raising concerns inside the voice actor industry about clients asking actors to sign the rights to their voices away so more material could be generated with AI later.

Twitter has removed one offending tweet and suspended one related profile. But in multiple cases Twitter has failed to take down the tweets, despite them clearly violating [Twitter’s policy on the publication of private information](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information). Tom said “What was the bigger frustration was how ineffective Twitter’s support system was in removing the post. Regardless of the stolen identity, private information posted publicly and the racist slurs, Twitter’s support system deemed the post and the account as perfectly fine.” Twitter has gutted its communications department; Elon Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

In some of the tweets including the home addresses, the harasser claims that the audio was generated by an AI-voice company called ElevenLabs. Last month [Motherboard reported](https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7mww/ai-voice-firm-4chan-celebrity-voices-emma-watson-joe-rogan-elevenlabs) that 4chan members appear to have used ElevenLabs to create the au...
