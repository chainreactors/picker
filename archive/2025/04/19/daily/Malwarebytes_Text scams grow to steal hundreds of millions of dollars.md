# Text scams grow to steal hundreds of millions of dollars

Posted: April 18, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Text scams alone cost US citizens at least $470 million in 2024, according to new data from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Because many scams go unreported, though, this dollar amount might be considerably more. The FTC [illustrated](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2025/04/top-text-scams-2024) this with a graph comparing the reported losses to the number of reports.

This demonstrates that not only the damage per reported incident went up considerably, but also the total amount of damage. It also implies that a lot of incidents went unreported since we find it hard to believe that the number of scams might have declined—all it takes is a look at any single week in news coverage on Malwarebytes Labs to find stories on new scams, old scams, repeated scams, and the no-good scammers behind them.

## Top 5 text scams

While scams reach us in many ways, the FTC focused on text scams in their report. This are the five main culprits:

1. [Package delivery problems](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/04/usps-your-package-could-not-be-delivered-text-is-a-smishing-scam). These are usually [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) expeditions aimed at the target paying a small amount for a redelivery, but while they are paying, their credit card details or other sensitive data are stolen.
2. [Phony job opportunities](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/task-scams-surge-by-400-but-what-are-they). These often come in the form of task scams, but the main story line is that a scammer posing as a recruiter gets the victim to pay for something they “need” to get the job done, or to steal the victim’s personal data.
3. Fake fraud alerts. The [fake alerts](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/scareware) come as texts about so-called suspicious activity or about a big purchase the victim didn’t make. These texts often look like they’re from a bank or large retailer. The scammers offer help and then pressure people into moving money out of their accounts to supposedly keep it safe, when in reality it goes straight to the scammers.
4. [Toll fee scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/08/sms-scammers-use-toll-fees-as-a-lure). These attempts come as an unexpected text message linking to a website pretending to belong to one of the US toll authorities, such as E-ZPass. The texts usually create a sense of urgency by telling you there is only a limited time left to act or there will be dire consequences. Typically the scammers are out to steal [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) and/or payment details.
5. Wrong number scams. An unexpected message that looks innocent enough from someone you don’t know but they act as if they know you. The idea is to get the target to tell them they’ve got a wrong number and with that engage them in a conversation, which may lead to [romance scams](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/romance-scams-costlier-than-ever-10-percent-of-victims-lose-10000-or-more), [pig butchering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/pig-butcherin...
