### 1. Nmap

* Nmap (Network Mapper) is a popular open-source tool for network exploration, management, and security auditing.
* In the context of bug bounty, Nmap helps to identify the hosts and services running on a target network, which is an important initial step in determining potential attack surfaces.
* Additionally, Nmap can be used to perform port scans to determine which ports on a target system are open, closed, or filtered, which can also provide valuable information for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
* Nmap also provides a wealth of information about the underlying operating system and the services running on a target system, which can be useful in further vulnerability analysis and exploitation.

### 2. Google Dorks:

* Google Dorks are advanced search queries that can be used to uncover sensitive information that is publicly accessible on the internet. In the context of bug bounty, Google Dorks can be used to find sensitive information such as login pages, administrative panels, and other sensitive data that could be vulnerable to attack. The Google Dorks can also be used to find unsecured databases, file upload forms, and other web applications that could be vulnerable to various types of attacks.

### 3. Shodan:

* Shodan is a search engine that allows users to search for specific types of internet-connected devices and services.
* In the context of bug bounty, Shodan can be used to identify targets that may have vulnerabilities, such as misconfigured web servers, unsecured IoT devices, and more.
* Shodan can also be used to gather information about a target’s IP addresses, operating systems, services, and more, which can provide valuable information for vulnerability analysis and exploitation.

### 4. Burp Suite:

* Burp Suite is a comprehensive web application security testing platform that includes various tools for performing various types of security testing, such as web application scanning, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation.
* In the context of bug bounty, Burp Suite can be used to perform a comprehensive security assessment of a target application, identify potential vulnerabilities, and even automate the exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.

### 5. Sqlmap:

* Sqlmap is an open-source tool for automating the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* In the context of bug bounty, Sqlmap can be used to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in target web applications, which can allow an attacker to access and manipulate sensitive data stored in a target database.

### 6. Dirb:

* Dirb is a command-line tool for automating the process of brute-forcing directories and files on a web server.
* In the context of bug bounty, Dirb can be used to identify hidden files and directories on a target web server, which can contain sensitive information or vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

### 7. Metasploit:

* Metasploit is a widely used framework for developing and executing security exploits.
* In the context of bug bounty, Metasploit can be used to automate the process of exploiting known vulnerabilities and obtain a shell on a target system, which can provide an attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

### 8. OWASP ZAP:

* OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) is a popular open-source web application security testing platform that includes various tools for performing various types of security testing, such as web application scanning, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation.
* In the context of bug bounty, OWASP ZAP can be used to perform a comprehensive security assessment of a target application, identify potential vulnerabilities, and even automate the exploitation of identified vulnerabilities.

### 9. Censys:

* Censys is a search engine for internet-connected devices that allows users to search for specific types of devices and services, gather information about their IP addresses, and more.
* In the context of bug bounty, Censys can be used to gather information about a target’s IP addresses, operating systems, services, and more, which can provide valuable information for vulnerability analysis and exploitation.
* Censys can also be used to identify specific types of internet-connected devices that may have vulnerabilities, such as unsecured IoT devices, which can be targeted for exploitation.

### 10. Github:

* Github is a popular platform for hosting and collaborating on open-source software projects.
* **In fact, Github has multiple tools written by various Experts**
* In the context of bug bounty, Github can be used to find sensitive information such as hardcoded secrets, API keys, and other sensitive data that may have been accidentally committed to a Github repository.
* Github can also be used to find open-source software projects that may contain vulnerabilities, which can then be reported as part of a bug bounty program.
