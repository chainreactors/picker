# How a cybersecurity researcher befriended, then doxed, the leader of LockBit ransomware gang

## Jon DiMaggio used sockpuppet accounts, then his own identity, to infiltrate LockBit and gain the trust of its alleged admin, Dmitry Khoroshev.

10:05 AM PDT · August 9, 2024

Earlier this year, an international coalition of law enforcement agencies [took control of the dark web site of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/us-uk-authorities-claim-seizure-of-lockbit-ransomware-gangs-dark-web-leak-site/), replacing its content with the now-familiar message from the authorities: “This site is now under the control of law enforcement.” The operation didn’t disrupt the group’s operation for too long, [with the gang launching a new site](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/26/lockbit-ransomware-takedown-now-what/) shortly after the takedown.

But then, on May 6, the authorities updated LockBit’s old site page and [announced that they would be revealing the identity](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/06/police-resurrect-lockbits-site-and-troll-the-ransomware-gang/) of LockBit’s administrator. “Who is LockBitSupp?” read a box on the site, which also included a 24-hour countdown.

When cybersecurity researcher [Jon DiMaggio](https://x.com/Jon__DiMaggio) saw the announcement, he immediately wondered: Do the cops have the same guy I have identified?

For the last couple of years, DiMaggio, who is a researcher at the cybersecurity firm Analyst1, had developed a relationship with LockBitSupp — first pretending to be a budding cybercriminal interested in joining the gang, then as himself. And, in the end, DiMaggio was able to figure out LockBitSupp’s real identity before it was publicly revealed by the authorities.

On Friday, in a talk at the hacking conference Def Con in Las Vegas, DiMaggio told the whole story of his relationship with LockBitSupp, detailing how he gained his trust using a made-up persona, and then kept the relationship going even after DiMaggio [publicly revealed](https://analyst1.com/ransomware-diaries-volume-1/) that he had infiltrated the gang and tricked LockBitSupp into giving up details of the operation to him.

“Our relationship had a bunch of ups and downs,” DiMaggio said during a preview of his presentation, which he gave to TechCrunch ahead of the conference.

At first, DiMaggio explained that he created a series of sockpuppet accounts to approach people who appeared to have direct relationships with LockBitSupp, as well as observe their interactions. The goal during this phase was to create a cybercriminal persona that had some sort of history and connections in the underground, which would make it easier to appear credible when reaching out directly to LockBit and its administrator.

“The important part of this was monitoring those conversations that appeared irrelevant. The ones where they had their guard down, where they were just talking s—t with other hackers. It allowed me to see the things they liked and the things they disliked. It gave me some context into their political views,” said DiMaggio. “All those things that I needed to build before I could engage because if I just went into this, and I started asking questions related to attacks and their operation, it’d be pretty obvious that I was a researcher.”

DiMaggio said his initial attempt to join the gang was rejected, but he kept talking to LockBitSupp, with whom he started to have a direct and friendly relationship. From then on, DiMaggio said he focused on LockBitSupp, cracking jokes with him, casually posing questions about details of his operation, such as questions on different elements and types of attacks, how to choose among them, how to negotiate with victims, and how to establish what’s the right ransom demand depending on the victim company.

Then, in January 2023, DiMaggio [wrote a long report about his findings](https://analyst1.com/ransomware-diaries-volume-1/) during his undercover research, and essentially burned all his fake cybercriminal personas. DiMaggio said he thought this would be the end of his relationship with LockBitSupp. Instead, the criminal ringleader appeared to have taken it lightly, posting in forums that he wished DiMaggio had shown him on yachts with women, enjoying his life as a high-flying cybercriminal. That, itself, was interesting to DiMaggio.

“The person that I know, while he certainly is motivated by money, he is not a flashy person, he’s not the type of person I would expect to be obsessed with material items,” said DiMaggio. “So there was a vast contrast in his demeanor and persona that he presented on these forums versus the person that I talked to one on one.”

Then, DiMaggio said that LockBitSupp started using his LinkedIn photo as their avatar in hacking forums as a way to poke fun at DiMaggio. “This was very much a cat-and-mouse game, and honestly LockBit loved playing this game with me as much as I loved playing it with them,” said DiMaggio.

At one point in early August of last year, DiMaggio decided to troll LockBitSupp in public. As a joke, [he posted on X claiming he was going to release new research](https://x.com/Jon__DiMaggio/status/1687085919679954946) into the ransomware group, and that if LockBitSupp wanted ...
