What is Cyber Threat Intelligence?

## Threat Intelligence in Cybersecurity

[Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-to-use-cyber-ti/) (CTI) — often referred to as “Threat Intelligence” or “Threat Intel” — is the practice of gathering and analyzing data to identify, understand, and counter existing and potential threats.

**In cybersecurity, threat intelligence serves a similar function to reconnaissance in military operations**. It provides insights into the specific threats facing your organization, the [TTPs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malware-ttps-explained/) attackers are likely to employ, and the [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malconf-in-ti-lookup/) that can help in detection.

The intelligence can be either:

* Strategic, looking at long-term trends and emerging threats.
* Operational, concerned with TTPs and effective defense strategies.
* Or tactical, focusing on immediate IOCs like IP addresses or file hashes.

## What makes threat intelligence a crucial aspect of your cybersecurity?

The malware threat landscape is highly dynamic, with some estimates indicating that a new malware variant is released every minute.

Beyond keeping up with these rapid changes, your organization may also face targeted threats from APT groups. These actors typically deploy custom attacks tailored specifically to exploit vulnerabilities in your organization.

Even if you have strong SOC, DFIR and CSIRT teams, a purely reactive approach isn’t enough. You need current, context-rich intelligence from external sources to drive effective responses. Threat intelligence provides:

* **Proactive defense**: Integrating IOCs such as hashes and IP addresses from [threat feeds](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/inside-cyber-threat-intelligence-feeds/) allows you to update SIEM, firewall, and EDR rules. This enables early detection and automated blocking of known threats before they penetrate the network.

* **Faster incident response**: During a breach, aligning indicators of intrusion with TTPs, and linking those TTPs to an attacker or threat profile, is crucial. This approach allows the CSIRT team to quickly understand the attacker’s tactics and pinpoint vulnerable systems, facilitating faster containment and remediation.

* **Better strategic planning**: CTI gives CISOs and Intel analysts critical data on threats tailored to your organization, both emerging and persistent. This data helps shape a security strategy focused on the most likely threats you’ll encounter.
