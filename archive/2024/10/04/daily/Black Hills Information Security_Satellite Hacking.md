Hacking a satellite is not a new thing. Satellites have been around since 1957. The first satellite launched was called Sputnik 1 and was launched by the Soviet Union. It was a simple machine that sat in space at LEO (Low Earth Orbit). The only thing it could do was send radio signals back to the ground stations they set up. After three weeks, the thing died. But this was just the beginning.

It did not take long for satellites to advance. Just two years later, the first successful weather satellite launched from the US, providing the first television images of weather patterns. Two years after this, the first active communications satellite was created and was known as the Telstar 1. This satellite could send pictures, relay television, handle telephone calls, and fax signals. The next giant milestone for satellites was the 1993 launch of the Iridium satellite constellation. This was the first satellite phone network. The final milestone for satellites was the introduction of broadband internet services. This was done in 2005 by Hughes Space and Communications Company and marked the beginning of commercial satellite-based internet services.

Satellite technology is not stopping here either. One big advancement in the security realm of things is quantum communication. This technology uses quantum key distribution (QKD), which uses quantum mechanics to securely distribute encryption keys. Satellites that have QKD will send entangled photon pairs to the ground station, where they are received and measured to create a secret key between the two.

As of this writing, there is a working theorem known as the Quantum No-Cloning Theorem that says that it is impossible to clone quantum states. Hypothetically, this makes the key shared impossible to decode. Another new technology that is in the works is space-based solar power (SBSP). This involves the collection of solar energy in space that is then transmitted back to Earth with microwave or laser beams. (Crazy to think how we could be getting energy in the future from microwave beams.)

With all this talk about the history and future of satellites, what about the security of their systems? The very first impactful hack on a satellite was done on the British Sky Broadcasting’s satellite system. It was an impressive feat that combined a plethora of different techniques to avoid detection.

One of the methods they used was the use of backdoors. The attackers exploited systems that had low security and used backdoors to keep access and control over internal networks without detection. To continue to avoid being discovered, custom malware was used to bypass common antivirus software and intrusion detection systems. Once the attackers were in this deep, they deployed packet sniffers to pick up on data being sent through the network. They captured vital information such as passwords and other sensitive information.

To top off this attack, the attackers used multiple proxy chains to mask their identity and made it impossible to tell who was responsible for this attack. This successful attack caused data theft, operational disruption, and financial costs. Think about how long they could have been “sniffing” data on the network and just how much information they were able to gather from this attack.

How about a more recent attack? In 2022, Starlink services were offered to Ukraine to aid them in their war. Russia was not a huge fan of this, so, in response, they started lodging an attack on the Starlink network. The goal was to jam the network so that it was unable to offer internet services to the Ukrainian government. This worked briefly, but Elon Musk is known for hiring the best of the be...
