In episode 25 of The AI Fix, humanity creates a satellite called Skynet and then loses it, Graham folds proteins in the comfort of his living room, a Florida man gets a robot dog, Grok rats on its own boss, and a podcast host discovers Brazil nuts.

Graham meets an elderly grandmother who‚Äôs taking on the AI scammers, our hosts learn why Google is listening to phone calls, and Mark looks at how OpenAI and Anthropic are preparing to prevent ‚Äúlarge scale devastation‚Äù by their own AIs.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
