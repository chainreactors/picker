![Understanding SSRF](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Understanding-SSRF-820x385.png)

In our daily interactions online, trust is a fundamental currency. We trust servers to handle our data, process our requests, and reliably deliver content. But what happens when that trust is abused and turned against the server itself? What if an attacker could trick your server into becoming an unwitting accomplice, abusing its privileged position to launch attacks from within the perceived safety of your own network?

This is the core danger of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), a vulnerability that has earned its own spot in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Unlike attacks that target the end-user’s browser, SSRF sets its sights on the server, abusing its functionality to pivot, scan, and attack resources that should be unreachable from the outside world.

Below we’ll go over how SSRF attacks work using practical examples, detail its potential impact, from data exfiltration to full cloud environment compromise, and lay out a defense strategy for developers and website owners to protect their infrastructure.

## What is Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)?

To understand SSRF, let’s use an analogy:

Consider a simple web application that offers a helpful “Convert Webpage to PDF” service. A user provides a URL of a public news article, and the company’s server visits that URL, fetches the content, and renders it as a downloadable PDF. This server, for performance and security reasons, sits inside the company’s internal network.

Now, let’s say an attacker uses this feature. Instead of providing a URL to a public news article, they submit a URL that points to an internal company resource, like

```
http://internal.example.com/HR/Employee-Salaries-2025.html
```

The server, processing the request, sees a URL and proceeds as instructed. Because the server itself is inside the network, it has privileged access to the internal page. It fetches the sensitive salary page, renders it into a PDF, and hands the finished document right back to the attacker. The server was tricked into using its trusted position to exfiltrate confidential data.

Server-Side Request Forgery is precisely this. It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce a server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing. The application is “forging” a request on the server’s behalf.

Because the malicious request originates from the application’s own server, it can often bypass firewall rules and access internal, non-public resources, turning a trusted server into a malicious proxy.

## How Does an SSRF Attack Work?

SSRF vulnerabilities typically arise when a web application fetches a remote resource based on a user-supplied URL, without properly validating that URL. Common examples of such functionality include:

* Generating a PDF or image preview from a web page.
* Importing a user’s profile picture from a URL.
* Querying a third-party API for data (e.g., a stock ticker).
* Using webhooks to notify other services of an event.

Let’s walk through a common scenario. A web application offers a feature to import a user’s avatar from a URL. The user provides a link to their picture, the server fetches it, and sets it as their profile image.

A legitimate request might look like this:

```
https://example.com/avatar/importer?url=https://some-image-host.com/user_pic.jpg
```

The server-side code might do something like this (in simplified PHP):

```
<?php
// Get the URL from the user input
$imageUrl = $_GET['url'];

// Fetch the content from the URL
$imageData = file_get_contents($imageUrl);

// ... process and save the image …
?>
```

The `file_get_contents()` function takes the user-supplied URL and makes a request to it. In a normal use case, this works fine. But an attacker sees an opportunity. What if they supply a URL that points not to an image, but to an internal service?

The attacker submits the following URL:

```
https://example.com/avatar/importer?url=http://localhost/admin
```

The server, running the vulnerable code, receives this request. The `$imageUrl` variable becomes `http://localhost/admin`. The server then makes a request to its own internal `/admin`...
