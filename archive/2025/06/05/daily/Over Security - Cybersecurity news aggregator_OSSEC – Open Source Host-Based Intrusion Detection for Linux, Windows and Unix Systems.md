# OSSEC – Open Source Host-Based Intrusion Detection for Linux, Windows and Unix Systems

June 2, 2025

In a world obsessed with eBPF, AI anomaly detection, and XDR platforms with $3/endpoint pricing, it’s easy to overlook tools that have been defending systems since before most security startups even existed.

![OSSEC - Open Source Host-Based Intrusion Detection for Linux, Windows and Unix Systems](https://www.darknet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OSSEC-Open-Source-Host-Based-Intrusion-Detection-for-Linux-Windows-and-Unix-Systems-640x427.jpg)

**OSSEC** is one of them.

Still used in banks, data centres, and embedded Linux environments around the world, OSSEC is a **lightweight, extensible host-based intrusion detection system** (HIDS) that offers log analysis, file integrity monitoring, rootkit detection, and real-time alerting—without needing a PhD or a SaaS account.

---

## What Is OSSEC?

**OSSEC** (Open Source Security) is a free, open-source HIDS that performs active monitoring of systems by analysing logs, checking file integrity, monitoring rootkits, and triggering custom alerts.

It follows a **centralised client-server architecture**:

* The **agent** runs on monitored systems (Linux, Windows, macOS).
* A **central manager** aggregates events, applies rules, and triggers alerts.
* Output can be forwarded to SIEMs or local notification systems.

## Key Capabilities

* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** – Detects unauthorised changes to sensitive system files.
* **Log-Based Detection** – Analyses logs from syslog, SSH, sudo, auth, Windows Event Logs, etc.
* **Rootkit Detection** – Periodic scans for known rootkits on Linux/Unix.
* **Agentless Monitoring** – Collect logs over SSH/SNMP from routers, firewalls, and network devices.
* **Active Response** – Automatically triggers preconfigured actions when a rule is hit (e.g., block IP, restart service).
* **Custom Rules Engine** – Tune detection to avoid noise or target-specific threats.

## Installation (Example: Ubuntu/Debian)

curl -O https://bintray.com/ossec/ossec-hids/download\_file?file\_path=ossec-hids-3.6.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf ossec-hids-3.6.0.tar.gz
cd ossec-hids-3.6.0
sudo ./install.sh

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1  2  3  4 | curl -O https://bintray.com/ossec/ossec-hids/download\_file?file\_path=ossec-hids-3.6.0.tar.gz  tar -xvzf ossec-hids-3.6.0.tar.gz  cd ossec-hids-3.6.0  sudo ./install.sh |

You’ll be prompted to select:

* Local/agent/server mode
* Email for alerting
* System integration options

Manager and agent install scripts are also available for automation and deployment at scale.

## Real-World Deployments

OSSEC has been integrated into:

* Managed security appliances (like AlienVault USM)
* National CERT implementations for FIM and log analysis
* Air-gapped and classified environments due to its minimal footprint

It’s also still referenced in CIS Benchmarks and STIG hardening guides as a compliant HIDS solution.

---

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**

* Lightweight and agent-based
* Cross-platform (Linux, BSD, Windows, macOS)
* Easily extendable with scripts
* Agentless mode for network gear
* Still under maintenance (as of 2024)

**Cons**

* No built-in GUI or dashboard (CLI only)
* Can be noisy without tuning
* Not built for container or cloud-native workloads
* The rule engine can be complex for beginners

## Conclusion

OSSEC is not new, but that’s precisely why it’s still trusted.

If you want a reliable HIDS for log monitoring, file integrity, and basic active response that works across platforms and doesn’t require you to hand over your telemetry, **OSSEC** remains a solid option.

Ideal for:

* Compliance-focused environments
* Legacy or embedded systems
* Teams that want control and simplicity over dashboards and subscriptions
