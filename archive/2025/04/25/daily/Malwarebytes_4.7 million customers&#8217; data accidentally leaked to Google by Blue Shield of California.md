# 4.7 million customers’ data accidentally leaked to Google by Blue Shield of California

Posted: April 24, 2025

Blue Shield of California leaked the personal data of 4.7 million people to Google after a Google Analytics misconfiguration. The tech giant may have used this data for targeted advertising, according to Blue Shield, which is one of the largest health insurers in the US.

In a [data breach notice](https://news.blueshieldca.com/notice-of-data-breach) on its website, Blue Shield says it had begun notifying “certain members of a potential [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) that may have included elements of their protected health information.”

Blue Shield a nonprofit health insurer serving nearly 6 million members, used Google Analytics to monitor how customers interacted with its websites to improve services. However, a configuration error in Google Analytics allowed sensitive member data to spill to Google Ads, potentially exposing customer data for almost three years. This likely included protected health information.

Blue Shield stated, “Google may have used this data to show targeted ad campaigns to individual members.”

The transmission of data took place between April 2021 and January 2024. The leaked information includes various details such as the type of health insurance plan, postal code and city, gender, family size, account [IDs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/internet-safety-tips-for-kids), names of insured persons, and search queries related to finding a doctor, which could reveal members’ health concerns or needs.

Blue Shield said there was no leak of other types of [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii), such as [Social Security numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web), driver’s license numbers, or banking or credit card information.

After discovering the leak, Blue Shield said it reviewed all its websites to ensure no other tracking software was sharing protected health information with third parties.

Usually in a data breach we can point at cybercriminals that went out of their way to obtain the data. In this case, a simple misconfiguration shared data with an entity—that already knows so much about us—that then used the information for targeted advertising.

Maybe this case can serve as a cautionary tale about using analytics tools in areas where misconfigurations can lead to severe privacy violations, especially when sensitive data is involved.

Blue Shield is notifying all customers who may have accessed their member information on the potentially impacted Blue Shield websites during the relevant time frame.

## Protecting yourself after a data breach

There are some actions you can take if you are, or suspect you may have been, the [victim of a data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know).

* **Check the vendor’s advice.** Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what’s happened and follow any specific advice they offer.
* **Change your password.** You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a [strong password](https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password) that you don’t use for anything else. B...
