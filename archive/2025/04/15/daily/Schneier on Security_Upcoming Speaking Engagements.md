@ Bruce, ALL,

So revealing trade secrets of the Silicon Valley Mega corps üòâ

That is their ‚Äú5 Step AI business plan‚Äù of mass surveillance by,

‚ÄúBedazzle, Beguile, Bewitch, Befriend and Betray‚Äù

To turn all users into their product by stealing the users and their acquaintances privacy.

Though Microsoft appears to have forced an extra Step/level in the model‚Ä¶

By building Co-Pilot and Recall in every place possible in Win-11

Whilst we might quite rightly call this step/layer ‚Äúbefoul‚Äù, they would probably say ‚Äúbedeck‚Äù.

But there is also a large element of ‚Äúbedevil‚Äù in this step‚Ä¶ Because Microsoft have also pretty much ensured that,

‚ÄúYou have to give a path back to their MotherShip to siphon your privacy down‚Äù

By forcing the use of their over priced rent seeking cloud for a users computer to even work‚Ä¶

@ Bruce, ALL,

Kings College London is holding a

‚ÄúFestival of Artificial Intelligence‚Äù

Or ‚ÄúAI Week‚Äù in May from Tue 20th to Sat 24th. with quite a number of interesting and open lectures / talks both ‚Äúin person and online‚Äù,

<https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/series/the-kings-festival-of-artificial-intelligence-20-24-may-2025>

On that may be of considerable interest to some of this blogs readers is,

**Bletchley Park and AI**

It‚Äôs ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù so just read,

<https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/bletchley-park-and-ai>

As many readers here will know Bletchley Park has quite a reputation and is widely considered one of the birthplaces of computing and automated cryptographic analysis. Most know that Alan Turing who is credited with the design of the fundamental theoretical computing engine worked there with other prominent figures such as Gordon Welchman who amongst many things came up with the fundamentals of ‚ÄúTraffic Analysis‚Äù and what went on to become the Internet. There are several others who worked at or with Bletchley Park during WWII and became pioneers in communications and of artificial intelligence that are so important to our modern Western World.
