How to Analyze Malware in ANY.RUN Sandbox: Eric Parker’s Guide

Recently, **Eric Parker**, a cybersecurity expert and YouTuber, released a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4QqAKrBpMY) on ANY.RUN’s [interactive sandbox](?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=eric_analysis&utm_term=110924&utm_content=linktolanding/). We recommend you take a look at his tutorial, as it offers a step-by-step guide on how to use the service and save time on reverse engineering.

Here’s our overview of the key highlights from the video.

## About malware analysis in a sandbox

Sandboxing is a crucial process in cybersecurity that lets professionals analyze malware in a controlled environment. Sandboxes provide a safe space to upload and examine potentially malicious samples without compromising your actual system.

ANY.RUN’s sandbox offers interactive analysis, providing users with a real-time view of how malware behaves and allowing them to engage with the system and samples just like on a standard computer.

## Setting up a sandbox environment

Eric began by highlighting various settings of ANY.RUN that can be adjusted for different scenarios, including:

**MITM Proxy**: This setting is particularly useful for intercepting and analyzing network traffic, such as HTTP requests made by the malware. This allows you to track how the malware communicates with command and control (C2) servers and gather more detailed information about its actions.

**FakeNet**: This option is effective if you’re worried about malware with worm-like capabilities, allowing detection of network shares or interactions with non-functional command and control servers.

**Operating System Customization**: ANY.RUN offers a variety of OS options, from older versions of Windows (7/32-bit, 7/64-bit) to the latest [Windows 11](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows11-uac-bypass/). [Linux](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/linux-malware-analysis-cases/) users can also run samples for cross-platform analysis.

For legacy malware, using an older OS might be necessary for full compatibility. Eric recommends experimenting with different OS options based on the malware sample.

**Pre-installed soft set**: Choose the [Development soft set](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/pre-installed-dev-tools/) to access additional software in the VM for analysis of complex threats. It includes Python, x64bg, Wireshark PE, and more.

[**Privacy Settings**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/privacy/): You can choose whether your analysis results are public or private. If you’re working with sensitive malware samples that could contain proprietary information, this feature ensures confidentiality.

**Duration Control**: For malware that delays execution (e.g., with sleep functions), you can extend the sandbox runtime to capture the full scope of its behavior.

## Sandbox analysis of Zombie malware

In the video demonstration, Eric used a sample he suspected of being malware. ANY.RUN’s sandbox quickly identified warning signs, detecting file replacements and abnormal behaviors indicative of malware infection.

Key points in the analysis:

* **File overwriting**: The malware replaced files with an executable payload. In the example, the malicious EXE was found to overwrite legitimate system files and create numerous temporary files.

* **File dumping**: One of ANY.RUN’s most valuable features was the ability to dump files mid-execution, making it easier to analyze malware that uses packing or encryption to conceal its malicious a...
