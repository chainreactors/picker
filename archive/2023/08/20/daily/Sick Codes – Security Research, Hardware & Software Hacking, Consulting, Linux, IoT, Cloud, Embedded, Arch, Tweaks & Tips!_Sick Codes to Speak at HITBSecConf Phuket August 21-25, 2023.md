## Exploring Critical Hardware Vulnerabilities in the Power Sector (Solar)

Sick Codes, an Australian hacker and cybersecurity researcher, will be delivering a highly anticipated talk that delves into the untapped yet critical sector which is distributed Industrial Control Systems. The presentation, originally delivered as the Keynote at Cyphercon 2023, has been significantly revised, given massive shifts in the knowledge, awareness, and research into the sector, that is residential and commercial solar systems.

In the current geopolitical climate, with rising tension in a number of regions, we have observed near willful ignorance of particular topics, especially when it comes to self-governance, ownership, and each nation’s own plan, and the threat of expanding that plan beyond a nation’s territory.

nations near-out “chip wars” With the potential for severe consequences in the event of an attack on the energy sector, Sick Codes’ presentation promises to shed light on significant yet often overlooked security concerns.

This talk will cover a range of critical issues, including ripple detectors, negative power demand, load shedding, and complex topics that are deliberately overlooked by many nations, due to the size of the situation.
