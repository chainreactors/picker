The UK's data protection watchdog says it plans to fine a managed software provider to the NHS £6.09 million ($7.7 million) for failings that led to a 2022 ransomware attack.

Reading the press release, we've never seen the word "provisionally" appear so many times in such a short bit of copy, but the Information Commissioner's Office's (ICO) really sought to hammer home the fact that nothing is set in stone and the ultimate punishment will be decided after the vendor has had its say on the matter.

That vendor is Advanced Computer Software Group; you may remember it from *El Reg* stories published almost two years ago to the day. Advanced pulled its systems offline on August 4, 2022, in an incident that was eventually attributed to LockBit, back in its heydey which has thankfully [now ended](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/31/five_months_after_lockbit/).
