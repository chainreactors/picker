# The Have I Been Pwned Alpine Grand Tour

02 May 2025

I love a good road trip. Always have, but particularly during COVID when international options were somewhat limited, one road trip ended up, well, ["extensive"](https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1336432552177856513?ref=troyhunt.com). I also love the recent trips Charlotte and I have taken to spend time with many of the great agencies we've worked with over the years, including the FBI, CISA, CCCS, RCMP, NCA, NCSC UK and NCSC Ireland. So, that's what we're going to do next month across some very cool locations in Europe:

![](https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/05/2025-05-02_15-30-22.jpg)

Whilst the route isn't set in stone, we'll start out in Germany and cover Liechtenstein, Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria. We have [existing relationships with folks in all but one of those locations](https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/government/) (France, [call me!](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/)) and hope to do some public events as we recently have at [Oxford University](https://www.youtube.com/live/lfQb8o4xQdQ?ref=troyhunt.com), [Reykjavik](https://www.facebook.com/troyahunt/posts/pfbid02ynTW49jqDkHjksLFUdFdpNMJMJR8ap6xSTEr7Kfc7sq1qP1kjK9eueR4gesVwpKUl?__cft__[0]=AZXoy2ZQKBfJ2z5pgJYtskiHTxzHaeLYG3eAj1kZ8EJfp6yOt4d4x4P3FzHUiNhiudAr41GKsI-wfRvwwNXrbPThQYdXuEwZlh2OHkUTNGrDytTtSLmYOuV1wKiesIRGILBqUrVBAXplo6cqEdpSwSjp8afCtdHtBjxVmXGmLLk4D1IJtp5EEF5N7zig1UZizrk&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) and even [Perth](https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1912061067595006217?ref=troyhunt.com) back on (almost) this side of the world. And that's the reason for writing this post today: if you're in proximity of this route and would like to organise an event or if you're a partner I haven't already reached out to, please [get in touch](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/). We usually manage to line up a healthy collection of events and assuming we can do that again on this trip, I'll publish them to [the events page](https://www.troyhunt.com/2025events/) shortly. There's also a little bit of availability in Dubai on the way over we'll put to productive use, so definitely reach out if you're over that way.

If you're in another part of the world that needs a visit with a handful of HIBP swag, let me know, there's a bunch of other locations on the short list, and we're always thinking about what's coming next üåç
