My inaugural blog post went live [on April 21, 2020](https://soatok.blog/2020/04/21/welcome-to-soatok-blog/). This post is scheduled to go live on Sunday, July 21, 2024.

If you are reading this post, then at least 1,552 days have transpired since my first blog post went live.

The [Confederacy lasted from February 6, 1861 to May 9, 1865](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America), which is 1,551 days total.

Which means my furry nonsense objectively has much more staying power than the Confederacy!

Hooray to furries, bloggers, programmers, and math nerds!

## How shall we celebrate?

Me? It’s a Sunday. I’m probably going to be sleeping in.

## Is there a point to this post?

No, not really.

I just wanted to have a little bit of fun and make some queer nerds smile.

There’s no deeper insight to be had from this entry. Maybe my next one will be less random.
