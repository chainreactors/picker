# Malwarebytes Premium Security earns “Product of the Year” from AVLab

Posted: April 30, 2024
 by [Malwarebytes Labs](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/malwarebyteslabs)

After blocking 100% of “in-the-wild” [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) samples that were deployed in multiple, consecutive third-party tests conducted by the AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation, Malwarebytes Premium Security has earned “Product of the Year.”

The recognition cements Malwarebytes Premium Security’s [perfect](https://avlab.pl/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/product-of-the-year-2024-report.pdf) [record](https://avlab.pl/en/results-november-2023/) of [repeatable](https://avlab.pl/en/results-september-2023/), [trusted](https://avlab.pl/en/results-july-2023/), and [proven](https://avlab.pl/en/results-may-2023/) [protection](https://avlab.pl/en/results-march-2023/) for [users](https://avlab.pl/en/results-january-2023/). It also comes alongside an additional AVLab certification for “Top Remediation Time.”

The latest results are part of AVLab’s regular “Advanced In-The-Wild Malware Test.”

For the March 2024 evaluation, AVLab tested 459 unique malware samples against 13 cybersecurity products. Malwarebytes Premium Security detected 459/459 malware samples, with a remediation time of 20 seconds—a full 13 seconds faster than the industry average.

[ThreatDown](https://www.threatdown.com/), powered by Malwarebytes, also participated in AVLab’s March evaluation, where it similarly blocked 100% of malware samples with a remediation time of 17 seconds.

Three cybersecurity vendors failed to block 100% of the malware samples deployed: Bitdefender, ESET, and Panda.

AVLab’s evaluations, which are performed every other month by a team of cybersecurity and information security experts, are constructed to test and compare cybersecurity vendors against the latest malware that is currently being used by adversaries and threat actors. To ensure that the organization’s evaluations reflect current cyberthreats, each round of testing follows three steps:

1. **Collecting and verifying in-the-wild malware**: AVLab regularly collects malware samples from malicious and active URLs, testing the malware samples to understand their impact to networks and endpoints.
2. **Simulating a real-world scenario in testing**: To recreate how a real-life cyberattack would occur, AVLab uses the Firefox web browser to engage with the known, malicious URLs collected in the step prior. In the most recent test, AVLab emphasized the potential for these URLs to be sent over instant messaging platforms, including Discord and Telegram.
3. **Incident recovery time assessment**: With the various cybersecurity products installed, AVLab measures whether the evaluated product detects a malware sample, when it detects a sample, and how long it took to detect that sample. The last metric is referred to as “Remediation Time.”

Malwarebytes is proud to receive “Product of the Year” and “Top Remediation Time” from AVLab, and is thankful to the third-party tester for its important work in the industry.
