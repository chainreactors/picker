[![Microsoft Outlook Flaw](data:image/png;base64... "Microsoft Outlook Flaw")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTvmefaxQb8fJmt-33PHxsJPwDA1hCsjgoQgXtKInXBPiaBAR-pII_ITGw0GZntE4iN7GhXXne3OwQLZ9f5vZbVJ8Hw-N3h7Ahs0gVflvU4JqH7leHNR9n377obI7DXEdFhRK6L3ZNjFu0g4mtUPx08JvE9rZFaZfCm-_Z7MzcVma9p3XeFNuSxbO9XZLS/s790-rw-e365/russia.png)

Czechia and Germany on Friday revealed that they were the target of a long-term cyber espionage campaign conducted by the Russia-linked nation-state actor known as [APT28](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/apt28-hacker-group-targeting-europe.html), drawing condemnation from the European Union (E.U.), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the U.K., and the U.S.

The Czech Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), in a statement, said some unnamed entities in the country have been attacked using a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook that came to light early last year.

"Cyber attacks targeting political entities, state institutions and critical infrastructure are not only a threat to national security, but also disrupt the democratic processes on which our free society is based," the MFA [said](https://mzv.gov.cz/jnp/en/issues_and_press/press_releases/statement_of_the_mfa_on_the_cyberattacks.html).

The security flaw in question is [CVE-2023-23397](https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/microsoft-warns-of-kremlin-backed-apt28.html), a now-patched critical privilege escalation bug in Outlook that could allow an adversary to access Net-NTLMv2 hashes and then use them to authenticate themselves by means of a relay attack.

Germany's Federal Government (aka Bundesregierung) [attributed](https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975226/2276130/ec59e50158ff9ba014025ba5abbfe6ec/2024-05-03-attribution-of-a-russian-cyber-campaign-data.pdf) the threat actor to a cyber attack aimed at the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party using the same Outlook vulnerability for a "relatively long period," allowing it to "compromise numerous email accounts."

Some of the industry verticals targeted as part of the campaign include logistics, armaments, the air and space industry, IT services, foundations, and associations located in Germany, Ukraine, and Europe, with the Bundesregierung also implicating the group to the 2015 attack on the German federal parliament (Bundestag).

APT28, assessed to be linked to Military Unit 26165 of the Russian Federation's military intelligence agency GRU, is also tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the names BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Forest Blizzard (formerly Strontium), FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422.

Late last month, Microsoft [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/russias-apt28-exploited-windows-print.html) the hacking group to the exploitation of a Microsoft Windows Print Spooler component (CVE-2022-38028, CVSS score: 7.8) as a zero-day to deliver a previously unknown custom malware called GooseEgg to infiltrate Ukrainian, Western European, and North American government, non-governmental, education, and transportation sector organizations.

NATO [said](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_225230.htm) Russia's hybrid actions "constitute a threat to Allied security." The Council of the European Union also chimed in, [stating](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/05/03/cyber-statement-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-continued-malicious-behaviour-in-cyberspace-by-the-russian-federation/) the "malicious cyber campaign shows Russia's continuous pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace."

"Recent activity by Russian GRU cyber group APT28, including the targeting of the German Social Democratic Party executive, is the latest in a known pattern of behavior by the Russian Intelligence Services to undermine democratic processes across the globe," the U.K. government [said](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/united-kingdom-joins-partners-in-condemnation-of-malicious-cyber-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services-uk-government-statement).

The U.S. Department of State [described](https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-condemns-malicious-cyber-activity-targeting-germany-czechia-and-other-eu-member-states/) APT28 as known to engage in "malicious, nefarious, destabilizing and disruptive behavior" and that it's committed to the "security of our allies and partners and upholding the rules-based international order, including in cyberspace."

Earlier this February, a coordinated law enforcement action [disrupted](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/us-government-disrupts-russian-linked.html) a botnet comprising hundreds of small office and home office (SOHO) routers in the U.S. and Germany that the APT28 actors are believed to have used to conceal their malicious activities, which, among others, comprised the exploitation of CVE-2023-23397 against targets of interest.

According to a report from cybersecurity firm Trend Micro this week, the third-party criminal proxy botnet dates back to 2016 and consists of more than just [routers from Ubiquiti](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/cybersecurity-agencies-warn-ubiquiti.html), encompassing other Linux-based routers, Raspberry Pi devices, and virtual private servers (VPS).
