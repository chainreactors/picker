The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday announced charges against a 36-year-old Yemeni national for allegedly deploying the Black Kingdom ransomware against global targets, including businesses, schools, and hospitals in the United States.

Rami Khaled Ahmed of Sana'a, Yemen, has been charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of intentional damage to a protected computer, and one count of threatening damage to a protected computer. Ahmed is assessed to be currently living in Yemen.

"From March 2021 to June 2023, Ahmed and others infected computer networks of several U.S.-based victims, including a medical billing services company in Encino, a ski resort in Oregon, a school district in Pennsylvania, and a health clinic in Wisconsin," the DoJ [said](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/yemeni-man-charged-federal-indictment-alleging-he-sent-black-kingdom-malware-extort) in a statement.

Ahmed is accused of developing and deploying the ransomware by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server known as ProxyLogon.

The ransomware worked by either encrypting data from victims' computer networks or claiming to steal that information from the networks. Post encryption, the ransomware dropped a ransom note on the system and directed the victim to send $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency address controlled by a co-conspirator.

Victims were also allegedly asked to send proof of the payment to a Black Kingdom email address. The ransomware is estimated to have been delivered on about 1,500 computer systems in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Also tracked under the name Pydomer, the ransomware family has been previously linked to attacks taking advantage of Pulse Secure VPN vulnerabilities ([CVE-2019-11510](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/06/black-kingdom-ransomware.html)), Microsoft [revealed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/25/analyzing-attacks-taking-advantage-of-the-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/) in late March 2021, noting that it was the first existing ransomware family to capitalize on the ProxyLogon flaws.

Cybersecurity vendor Sophos [described](https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/black-kingdom-ransomware-hunting.html) the Black Kingdom strain as "somewhat rudimentary and amateurish in its composition," with the attackers leveraging the ProxyLogon vulnerability to deploy web shells, which were then used to issue PowerShell commands to download the ransomware.

It also said the activity bears all the hallmarks of a "motivated script-kiddie." Then later that August, a Nigerian threat actor was [observed](https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/cybercrime-group-asking-insiders-for.html) attempting to recruit employees by offering them to pay $1 million in Bitcoin to deploy Black Kingdom ransomware on companies' networks as part of an insider threat scheme.

If convicted, Ahmed faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for each count. The case is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with assistance from the New Zealand Police.

The charges come amid a raft of announcements from U.S. government authorities against various criminal activities -

* The DoJ [unsealed](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ukrainian-national-extradited-spain-face-conspiracy-use-ransomware-charge) an indictment charging Ukrainian citizen Artem Stryzhak with attacking companies using [Nefilim](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/experts-expose-farnetworks-ransomware.html) ransomware since becoming an affiliate in June 2021. He was arrested in Spain in June 2024 and extradited to the United States on April 30, 2025. If convicted of the charge, Stryzhak faces up to five years' imprisonment.
* Tyler Robert Buchanan, a British national suspected of being a member of the notorious Scattered Spider cybercrime group, was [extradited](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/alleged-scattered-spider-member-extradited-to-u-s/) from Spain to the United States to face charges related to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Buchanan was [arrested](https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/uk-hacker-linked-to-notorious-scattered.html) in Spain in June 2024. Charges against him and other Scattered Spider members were [announced](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/5-scattered-spider-gang-members.html) by the US in November 2024.
* Noah Michael Urban, another Scattered Spider member who was arrested in January 2024, [pleaded guilty](https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2025/04/04/palm-coast-man-linked-to-scattered-spider-cybercrime-gang-pleads-guilty-to-charges-related-to-cryptocurrency-theft/) to similar charges earlier in early April 2025. He also agreed to pay $13 million to 59 victims as part of his plea agreement. The arrests notwithstanding, Scattered Spider has been [observed](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/scattered-spider-2025/) using updated phishing kits mimicking Okta sign-in portals and a new version of [Spectre RAT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.spectre) to gain persistent access to compromised systems.
