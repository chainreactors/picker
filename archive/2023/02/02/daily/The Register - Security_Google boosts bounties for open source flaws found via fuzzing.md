Google sweetened the potential pot to $30,000 for bug hunters in its open source OSS-Fuzz code testing project.

On Wednesday, Google [increased bounties](https://bughunters.google.com/about/rules/5097259337383936/oss-fuzz-reward-program-rules) for fuzzing coverage projects (up to $5,000 per project), and added rewards for some [FuzzBench](https://google.github.io/fuzzbench/) integrations. For the latter, contributors can claim a prize up to $11,337 for such integrations "that show significant improvement over existing fuzzers."

Additionally, researchers can earn money for integrating new sanitizers into OSS-Fuzz. The new sanitizers must find at least two legit vulnerabilities in an open source project, and the max payout for this new rewards category is also $11,337.
