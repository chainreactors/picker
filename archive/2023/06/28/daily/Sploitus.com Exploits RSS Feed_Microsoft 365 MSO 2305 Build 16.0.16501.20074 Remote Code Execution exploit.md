attack on the victim's computer. The attacker can trick the victim to
open a malicious web page by using a malicious `Word` file for
`Office-365 API`. After the user will open the file to read it, from
the API of Office-365, without being asked what it wants to activate,
etc, he will activate the code of the malicious server, which he will
inject himself, from this malicious server. Emedietly after this
click, the attacker can receive very sensitive information! For bank
accounts, logs from some sniff attacks, tracking of all the traffic of
the victim without stopping, and more malicious stuff, it depends on
the scenario and etc.
