# First Look: New HIPAA Security Rules for ePHI

January 8th, 2025

The Office for Civil Rights (OCR), at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) aimed at updating the [HIPAA Security Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html). The changes new HIPAA security rules for ePHI proposed by the OCR, which is responsible for the definition and enforcement of the Security Rule, are designed to strengthen the cybersecurity measures required by healthcare organizations – particularly as they pertain to the handling of electronic protected health information (ePHI).

As well as combatting the increasing frequency *and* sophistication of cybersecurity threats (e.g., ransomware), the NPRM aims to enhance the protection of ePHI by ensuring the healthcare industry keeps pace with the increasing number of digital solutions and their associated security challenges.

In this post, we look at the new HIPAA security rules for ePHI, including what the proposal entails, its potential implications, and how healthcare providers, payers, and suppliers can best navigate these new regulatory requirements in the future.

### **What Do the New HIPAA Security Rules for ePHI Contain?**

In essence, the NPRM introduces a more robust framework to enhance the security of the critical [infrastructure](https://luxsci.com/blog/infrastructure-requirements-for-hipaa-compliance.html "infrastructure") in which healthcare organizations store and process ePHI.

To this end, under the new proposal, companies must develop, or revise, a technology asset inventory and a network map that conveys the movement of sensitive patient data and ePHI throughout their IT ecosystem. Additionally, this must be implemented on a consistent basis, i.e., at least once annually every 12 months or whenever the healthcare company alters their infrastructure or operations in a manner that may affect ePHI.

Key components of the new HIPAA security rule notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen cybersecurity for ePHI include:

**1. Enhanced Risk Assessments and Management**

The NPRM emphasizes comprehensive risk management, requiring organizations to conduct more detailed assessments of potential threats to ePHI. Risk assessments under the newly proposed HIPAA security notice must now:

* Consider emerging cyber risks, through the collection and analysis of up-to-date threat intelligence, to ensure *proactive* threat mitigation as well as reactive measures.
* Include a written assessment that contains:
* A review of your company’s technology asset inventory and network map
* The identification of potential vulnerabilities within the organization’s IT infrastructure.
* The identification of all reasonably anticipated threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (i.e., t[he CIA triad](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-CIA)) of ePHI.
* The risk level for each identified threat and vulnerability, based on the likelihood of its occurrence and its potential danger to ePHI.

****2. Improved Incident Response and Reporting****

Regardless of how vigilant healthcare companies are in implementing mitigations against cyber threats, the breadth and depth of malicious actors’ arsenals make security breaches almost inevitable nevertheless. Consequently, under the proposed rulemaking, organizations must develop updated and more comprehensive incident response plans that enable the rapid identification and containment of security breaches, including:

* **Identifying** a threat
* **Containing** the threat
* **Mitigating or remediating** the threat
* **Recovering** from the event
* **Learning** from the breach and strengthening your security surrounding ePHI accordingly

****3. Regular Testing of Security Measures****

To ensure continued HIPAA compliance and protect ePHI from new threats, companies will need to regularly test and evaluate their cybersecurity measures. This not only aligns with the need for companies to carry out periodic risk assessments but also shortens the windows, i.e., time between tests,  in which malicious actors can infiltrate your infrastructure.

You can read the full details of the [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) announcement of the new HIPAA security notice for ePHI [here](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/hipaa-security-rule-nprm/factsheet/index.html).

### **The Implications of the New HIPAA security Rules for ePHI**

One of the core implications of the NRPM is that the OCR is removing the distinction between “required” and “addressable” implementation specifications – making them all required, aside from a few specific, limited exceptions.

To maintain HIPAA compliance, healthcare companies will have to, at the very least, conduct fresh risk assessments to determine if their current IT infrastructure meets the standards of the new HIPAA security notice for ePHI. In most cases, companies will have to invest in additional infrastructure, digital solutions, *and* training (with the addition of skilled personnel also being a possibility) to enhance their cybersecurity posture.

Naturally, healthcare companies will incur additional costs, both in monetary terms and technology and resources needed, to enhance their cybersecurity posture in accordance with the NRPM. However, these costs pale in comparison to those associated with non-compliance, which include financial penalties and compromised trust from your patients and customers.
