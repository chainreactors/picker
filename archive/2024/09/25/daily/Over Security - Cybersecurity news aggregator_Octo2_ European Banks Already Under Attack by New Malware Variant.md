## Octo2: European Banks Already Under Attack by New Malware Variant

24 September 2024

### Jump to

Octo (ExobotCompact) is a notable malware family on the current mobile threat landscape. It dominates the tables of the number of unique samples observed by ThreatFabric in the current year.

In light of this, the discovery of a new version, named “Octo2” by its creator, could potentially shift the threat landscape and the Modus Operandi of the actors behind it. This report uncovers details about the current state of the malware family, highlights updates, and makes predictions for the future of the Octo (ExobotCompact) malware family.

Key takeaways of the discovery:

* A new variant (named **Octo2**) of Octo, currently the most widespread malware family, has been released by the original threat actor
* The malware developers took action to increase the stability of the remote action capabilities needed for Device Takeover attacks
* New Octo2 campaigns have been spotted in European countries
* Octo2 contains sophisticated obfuscation techniques to ensure the Trojan stays undetected, including the introduction of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)

## From Exobot to Octo2: A Brief History of the Family

![Slide1-Sep-20-2024-10-16-01-2033-AM](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slide1-Sep-20-2024-10-16-01-2033-AM.png?width=3840&height=2160&name=Slide1-Sep-20-2024-10-16-01-2033-AM.png)

The first samples of the [Exobot](/blogs/exobot_android_banking_trojan_on_the_rise) malware family were seen in 2016. At that time, it was a banking trojan capable of performing overlay attacks and controlling calls, SMS, and push notifications.

In 2019, a new version of Exobot called “ExobotCompact”, was promoted on underground forums as a lightweight version retaining most of the features of its predecessor.

After a break, in 2021 a new variant of ExobotCompact was discovered. Some AV vendors dubbed it “Coper”; however, ThreatFabric analysts were able to track and prove the connection with the original ExobotCompact. Furthermore, in 2022 the first mentions of a mysterious mobile malware family “Octo” appeared on underground forums. An actor with the nickname “Architect” claimed to be the owner of Octo, but showed little activity on the forums, providing only a few details about the malware itself. ThreatFabric was able to “connect the dots” and, based on the limited information shared by the owner, proved that [Octo is a new name for ExobotCompact](/blogs/octo-new-odf-banking-trojan).

Since 2022, our Mobile Threat Intelligence team has observed increasing activity from Octo and its operators. More campaigns have been spotted in the wild, and more actors have gained access to this malware family, attracted by its extensive capabilities, including continuously updated remote access features.

In 2024, several notable events affected the mobile threat landscape, some related to Octo. First, **the source code of Octo was leaked**, resulting in multiple forks launched by other threat actors. The leak of the source codes was likely one of the main reasons behind the second notable event in the story of Octo: a new version, Octo2, was released by the original threat actor.

## Targeting European Countries - and More in the Future

For the past years of monitoring the activity of Octo, ThreatFabric has observed campaigns of previous variants in multiple regions all over the world. The "customers" of Octo Malware-as-a-Service were seen running campaigns targeting Europe, the USA, Canada, the Middle East, Singapore, and Australia.

When promoting the update, the owner of Octo announced that Octo2 will be available for users of Octo1 at the same price with early access. We can expect that the actors that were operating Octo1 will switch to Octo2, thus bringing it to the global threat landscape.

Our research showed that Octo2’s settings contain traces of multiple applications and apps being on the radar of the actors. This conclusion is based on the list of package names received from the C2 as a part of the initial setup as “**block\_push\_apps**” setting. It means that once Octo2 detects a push notification from one of the apps on the list, it will intercept it and not show it to the victim. The presence of the app on the list means that it is of interest to cybercriminals, and they are already preparing to attack its users. This is likely a default setting prepared by the developers.

Our Threat Intelligence shows that the first samples of Octo2 discovered in the wild were seen in **Italy, Poland, Moldova,** and Hungary. These samples from the first campaigns observed were masquerading as **Google Chrome, NordVPN,** and**“Enterprise Europe Network”** applications. However, as we said previously, we can expect threat actors behind Octo2 to not limit their activity and continue targeting users of mobile banking all over the world.

In the Octo2 campaigns that were spotted by ThreatFabric, we observed [Zombinder](/blogs/zombinder-ermac-and-desktop-stealers) serving as the first stage of the installation: upon launch, Zombinder will request the installation of an additional “plugin” which is, in fact, Octo2, thus successfully [bypassing Android 13+ restrictions](/blogs/droppers-bypassing-android-13-restrictions#zombinder_also_bypasses_restricted_settings).

## New Features and Improvements

Malware developers and actors who sell their malware as a service have the same challenge as legitimate software businesses: how to differentiate their "product" from their competitors' offerings? In the case of Octo, conscious of the source code leakage, the competition is even more challenging - improve your own "product" to make it more popular than the previous version, which has now involuntarily become a competitor with a price point of zero!

It's therefore no surprise that Octo2 received several significant updates compared to previous variants. Most of the changes are focused on increasing the stability of remote control sessions while performing Device Takeover attacks, and improving **anti-detection and anti-analysis techniques.** Improvements include:

* **Increased RAT stability.**

  The developers of Octo2 updated the RAT capabilities of the malware to increase the stability and decrease connection latency during remote sessions. They introduced a specific remote session setting “**SHIT\_QUALITY**” (sic) that c...
