The debate over banning TikTok in the United States brings a mix of concerns regarding national security, misinformation, and freedom of expression, as well as considerations about its role in community building, creativity, and entertainment. Here are some of the key points from the discussions:

### Pros of Banning TikTok

**National Security Threat**: Critics argue TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security by potentially serving as a tool for the Chinese Communist Party to access and manipulate Americans’ data and influence culture and politics.

**Misinformation Spread**: The platform is accused of being rife with dangerous misinformation, from promoting harmful activities to spreading false political claims. Its role as a primary information source for younger generations heightens concerns about its impact on public opinion and behavior.

**China’s Geopolitical Influence**: Some advocates for a ban emphasize the importance of a tough stance against China to safeguard U.S. national interests, citing espionage activities and the need to protect citizens from foreign surveillance and influence.

### Cons of Banning TikTok

**Comparable Data Practices with U.S. Companies**: Investigations into TikTok’s data practices suggest it does not collect more user data than other major U.S. social networks, which also gather extensive personal information. Critics of a ban argue for broader industry regulation rather than targeting a single company.

**Impact on Businesses and Creativity**: TikTok provides significant opportunities for businesses to enhance their brands and for individuals to express creativity and build communities. Its easy-to-use video creation tools and vast music library foster a unique space for creativity and innovation.

**Potential for Education and Skill Acquisition**: Beyond entertainment, TikTok serves as a platform for learning new skills and knowledge across various domains, from cooking and DIY projects to educational content on diverse subjects. This aspect underscores its role in facilitating personal growth and exploration.

**Networking and Community Building**: The app’s algorithm-driven recommendations help users discover and connect with others who share similar interests, making it a powerful tool for forming new friendships and fostering a sense of community among users worldwide.

The discussion around TikTok’s ban reflects broader debates about digital privacy, the role of social media in society, and geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. As this conversation evolves, it’s clear that the decision to ban or not ban TikTok carries wide-reaching implications beyond the app itself. That said, let’s talk about the realities of what is happening today here in the U.S. following the vote on banning TikTok.

***Brass tacks; it’s all just politics and posturing.***

***The realities are these:***

**TikTok is just one venue of many** (albeit a very popular one) for misinformation and disinformation for launching these kinds of campaigns, not only for China, but, anyone who might want to stand up a campaign using the application and network. Banning TikTok will have a negligible effect on the flow of disinformation and is in fact a pointless argument to make.

**Banning TikTok will NOT stop people from using it here in the U.S**., I know Congress and the House are full of olds but, have they never heard of proxies? The application will just be used by bypassing networks and allowing access, I mean, I even doubt the US could try to unilaterally block their IP spaces from the US, period, I mean, we aren’t Russia or China with that kind of control over the net.

**The privacy argument is also a red herring**. While China would and does already, have a lot of access to U.S. people’s data, this banning them would mean nothing. They already have access to everyone’s data that uses the app already and frankly, we all give up our privacy daily to any number of companies outside the country as well as in the U.S.

**Network access and potentials for abuse by China**, as well are a runaround. If the U.S. is really worried about what China can access and what damage they could do, I recommend that the government really look at just how much tech is fabricated in China and then sold here in the states. I’d also hasten to add they should really look at all the grey market tech as well that might also have implants built into chip sets etc. TikTok, is not a clear and present danger in this way. The one caveat I would make though, is that anyone in the military or government should NOT have the TikTok app on their work devices. This is something already forbidden and was a right move.

I guess, what I am trying to say is this; “SERENITY NOW!” … Though, I have little hope of that happening, for you all though, don’t get all caught up in the rhetoric. Sure, China is a threat, but, TikTok is not the problem, there are many many more that are by far more dangerous, but all we are seeing is the bread and circuses being blasted at us by the Senate and House amplified by a failing media to really report appropriately on the real issues.

Ok, you can all go back to your TikTok teen dance videos….
