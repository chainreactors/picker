![Security For Everyone - 2023 Update](/content/images/size/w2000/2023/08/20230323_203941--1-.jpg)

It has been a while since I've done any form of blog post, and for the most part, it has been because I've been busy doing a myriad of other things.

However, one of the common issues I've spotted in recent times is that security, for the most part, is a pain ( yes, I work in it, and computers are the scum of the earth!). Still, a stand-out item is the rise in scams, phishing, account takeovers, lack of general security knowledge for Joe or Jane public, and the unfortunate timings of events.  Why the random intro paragraph, Andy? Well, a few of my close friends and connections have been subject to various scams and phishing attacks over the last few months, and while I wrote zero to technical hero a few years ago now (with the last post being just under a year ago), you can read all four here:)

But there are new apps and new techniques, and the series needed a bit of a refresh. I will go through some of the steps you can take as an individual to secure the accounts that mean the most to you. If you have a website, here are some tips that give you some options to set up a more secure setup; now, if you are reading this and are a security professional, you may well disagree with the suggestions that I am making but hear me out; **nobody** ***outside*** **the security community cares about what we think.**

Chapter 3 in my ZTH series dove into security advice and my top 5 tips at the time for improving your security approach to things; now, a lot of that advice is largely the same but with some changes. At a high level, the top 5 in that post were as follows:

1. Use Multi Factor/2-factor authentication
2. Don't use the same password everywhere
3. Be vigilant about emails and links sent to you on social media
4. Install Updates
5. Be careful with how much information you share online.

Rather than deep diving into each of them, the critical two here are passwords and MFA/2FA, Do not share passwords and consider using a password manager or, in some cases, a password book, as you're more likely to be phished or attacked digitally than you are to be robbed, so if you use a password book to write your stuff down at home then so be it, it's not the advice everyone is going to give you but if it works for you do it. I would prefer you used a solution that was easy for you and thus easier to manage than overcomplicate things.

Multi-Factor(MFA)  is a pain on its own, but the security benefits it adds are worth their weight in gold; here are a few of the common apps people use nowadays and how to enable MFA.

#### Instagram & Facebook

To manage your Instagram and Facebook MFA settings, navigate to the meta accounts dashboard here; [https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password\_and\_security](https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password_and_security?ref=blog.zsec.uk)

You can also access this menu from within Instagram by clicking the burger menu at the top right of your profile, then navigating to settings and privacy and then accounts centre, which takes you to the above URL, whereby the settings will be the same as described below.

This will direct you to a page similar to the following:

![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-4.png)

From here, navigate to Two-Factor Authentication and select whichever account you want to enable MFA on;

![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-5.png)

Each has several options available, such as app, SMS-based, key-based and other methods:

![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-7.png)

Once enabled, each time you log into meta services such as Instagram and Facebook, you'll be prompted for a 2FA/MFA token in addition to your password, thus satisfying what you have; an MFA token and something you know; a password for authentication.

#### TikTok

For TikTok, navigate to your profile in the app then, click the menu at the top right, then navigate to settings and privacy -> Security -> 2-step verification as shown:

#### Twitter/X/whatever it is called this week.

1. Navigate to 'settings and privacy'
2. Click on security and account access -> Security.
3. Navigate to Two-factor authentication as shown below on desktop and mobile:

![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image.png)![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-1.png)![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-2.png)

Select an authentication app and download Google authenticator or one of the many other authentication apps for MFA management; follow the steps on the screen and make sure you make a note of the backup keys the app gives you(you'll need these if you ever forget your MFA token or lose access).

#### Emails

I've picked three of the most common email providers and shown how to setup MFA on them. However, the process is generally the same across them all; if your provider is not listed here, typically navigating to settings and finding security settings will point you in the right direction for enabling multi-factor.

##### Gmail

1. Open your Google Account.
2. Navigate to the [Two-Factor Authentication Section](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome?ref=blog.zsec.uk)
3. Select "Getting Started"

![](https://blog.zsec.uk/content/images/2023/08/image-3.png)

##### O365/Live/Outlook/Hotmail

Navigate to your Microsoft Account and select Security Basics; [https://account.microsoft.com/security](https://account.microsoft.com/security?ref=blog.zsec.uk)

1. Select ****More security options****.
2. Under ****Two-step verification****, choose ****Set up two-step verification**** to turn it on, or choose to ****Turn off two-step verification**** to turn it off.
3. Follow the instructions.

This will enable MFA/2FA across all of your MS services and cover Outlook, Office 365, Hotmail and Live along with any Xbox or game services too.

##### AOL

For AOL, navigate to [https://login.aol.com/myaccount/personalinfo](https://login.aol.com/myaccount/personalinfo?ref=blog.zsec.uk) then click on security and scroll down till you see 2 step verification:

Click on manage and choose an option, the suggested option is to use an authenticator app but phone-based authentication also works as it is better than nothing:

Combine MFA with a unique password per app, and you're onto a winner; coming up with passwords can be hard, but the advice more and more is passphrases,...
