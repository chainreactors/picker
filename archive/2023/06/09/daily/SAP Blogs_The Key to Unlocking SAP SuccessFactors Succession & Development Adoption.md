Balancing the needs and aspirations of people with the ever-changing needs of an organization is by no means a small feat when we consider how much has changed for organizations over the last few years. We’ve seen dramatic shifts in workforce culture, employee expectations have changed, and traditional ways of how a job is defined and how work gets done is being reconstructed.

If we think specifically about driving an organization's future success while prioritizing employee experiences what comes to mind for you? I was recently reading a Forbes [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2023/04/24/creating-a-culture-for-succession-planning/?sh=7213a56f3ac6) titled "Creating a Culture for Succession Planning" and Mark Samuels, Forbes Council member, shared "Leadership is ultimately about legacy, and legacy is ultimately about leaving the organization better off than its current state. This means your direct reports must surpass you in skill and contribution". To leave an organization better-off than we found it with employees who have exceeded their potential is something special and requires intentional actions, planning and the right technology and tools to enable smarter and faster decision making.

**THE KEY**! To support your organization's journey for future success while meeting employee needs, check out the **refreshed** [Adoption Playbook on SAP SuccessFactors Succession & Development](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2021-02-70907-explore-succession-planning/index.html?chapter=0) to learn about the solution features, functionality, access links to demo's, best practices documentation, research and more (*refreshed June 2023*).

With the human experience management solutions from SAP, organizations can create a more engaged workforce and build robust bench strength for a successful future.
