Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2023-27572)
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the
victim's session, thus perform all actions, exfiltrate information, etc. In
order to exploit this vulnerability the attacker will have to trick the user
into visiting a manipulated URL.

2) Missing Authentication (CVE-2023-27572)
Logfiles can be downloaded without prior authentication, once the correct URL
is known. This allows an attacker to gain further information about the usage
of the device.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2023-27572)
The following URL has to be visited by the victim in order to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code.

http://$IP/https_redirect.php?page=%22;alert(document.domain);var%20dummy=%22

2) Missing Authentication (CVE-2023-27572)
The following HTTP request will return the log file of the device without
checking for a valid session cookie.
