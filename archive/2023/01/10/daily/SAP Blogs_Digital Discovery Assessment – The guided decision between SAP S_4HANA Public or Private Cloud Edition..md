# **Why Digital Discovery Assessment?**

Deciding on the right operating model for SAP S/4HANA is one of the hardest decisions companies currently have to make.

Do I stay on-premise, move to Private Cloud Edition, or go to a highly standardized Public Cloud Edition?

Many customers find it particularly difficult to decide between the public and private cloud editions. The criteria in the choice are diverse and highly interrelated.

Some of the criteria to consider when making a choice are, for example, extensibility, cost, infrastructure and, above all, the range of functions.

In order to cleanly analyze the functional scope - especially when comparing public and private cloud editions - SAP provides the Digital Discovery Assessment Tool (DDA).

With the help of this tool, companies can work together with a partner to take an in-depth look at the topics of scope, the integration of applications and the localization of scope items.
The DDA follows 4 simple steps to simplify the analysis.

# **The 4 steps of the Digital Discovery Assessment**

The starting point of the "Supply Chain of Selling" begins with the entry of some customer-specific information (such as industry or similar). In this first overview, the further course of the assessment is later secured and displayed. Here, companies can find all aspects of the assessment in one central location.

## **STEP 1: Selection of IT solutions**

As soon as the company's central information is stored in the tool, the participants can begin with the assessment. In a first step, they select the required solutions they want to look at.

The standard products shown in Figure 2 can easily be considered in the scoping process. However, additional IT products - especially from third-party providers - can also be entered.
This provides a good overview of the company's possible target architecture at the start.

## **STEP 2: Preselection packages**

Since far more than 650 scope items are available for the Public Cloud Edition, SAP provides corresponding preselection packages for selecting the scope items.

A distinction is made here between 4 different areas. These areas are:

***1. Baseline***

The Baseline package contains important end-to-end processes for companies, especially for the areas of finance, sales and procurement. For example, SAP already delivers the end-to-end processes "Invoice to Cash", "Order to Fulfill", "Record to Report" and "Procure to Receipt" with this package.

***2. Finance Led ERP***

The Finance Led ERP package includes the most important standard processes for enterprise financial management - preconfigured best practices that help companies run an administrative SAP S/4HANA system. It also includes some procurement and sales functions.

***3. Service Centric ERP***

With the third Preselection Package, SAP puts a focus on service. The package thus includes central SAP best practices for financial management and thus for the operation of an administrative ERP system, but also, above all, project-, service- and some industry-related functions.

***4. Product Centric ERP***

The product-centric package - also called Produce and Sell Standard Products (PSSP) - offers a very product-oriented selection of SAP Best Practices. This solution contains all the key functions for manufacturing companies and the sale of produced goods from stock.

Depending on which of these four areas best suits the customer's needs and specific requirements, a large number of scope items are pre-selected by activating the package.
It is important to note here that companies can also select multiple packages.

If none of the packages fit the company's specific needs, this step can also be skipped.

**STEP 3: Localization and Availability of Best Practices**

In principle, SAP Best Practices in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Edition are available in 43 country versions. It is important to note that this does not apply to all Best Practices, however, and that some Best Practices are not available in some countries.

To take this into account in the analysis, companies can link the respective entities of the company to the countries in the DDA.

Once this is done, a list is obtained with the information on which of the selected scope items is available in which country.

## STEP 4: Scope Definition

In the next step, companies select the actual scope items of the respective Line of Business (LoB) of SAP S/4HANA.

To do this, they can choose from 16 different LoBs and simply select the relevant scope items in each case to add them to your scope.

For each scope item there is a short information, a direct jump to the Best Practice Explorer and the possibility to directly select a priority and a phase (for the planning of the later implementati...
