A set of radio devices and technologies are opening the doorway to new and revolutionary forms of communication. These have the potential to break down the over-reliance on traditional network hierarchies, and present collaborative alternatives where resistance to censorship, control and surveillance are baked into the network topography itself. Here, we look at a few of these technologies and what they might mean for the future of networked communications.

The idea of what is broadly referred to as [mesh networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking) isn’t new: the resilience and scalability of mesh technology has seen it adopted in [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N.) and [IoT](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/keeping-your-smart-home-secure-private#using_zigbee_zwave) protocols for decades. What’s new is [cheap](https://heltec.org/product-category/lora/) [devices](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) that can be used without a radio license to communicate over (relatively) large distances, or **LO**ng **RA**nge, thus the moniker [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa).

Although using different operating frequencies in different countries, LoRa works in essentially the same way everywhere. It uses [Chirp Spread Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp_spread_spectrum) to broadcast digital communications across a physical landscape, with a range of several kilometers in the right environmental conditions. When other capable devices pick up a signal, they can then pass it along to o...
