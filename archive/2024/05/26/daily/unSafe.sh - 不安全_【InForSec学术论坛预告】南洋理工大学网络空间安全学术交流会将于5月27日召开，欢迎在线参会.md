**Host：Liu  Yang**

**BIO：**

Dr. Yang Liu obtained his bachelor and ph.d degree in the National University of Singapore in 2005 and 2010, respectively. In 2012, he joined Nanyang Technological University as a Nanyang Assistant Professor. He is currently an associate professor, director of the cybersecurity lab, Program Director of HP-NTU Corporate Lab and Deputy Director of the National Satellite of Excellence of Singapore. In 2019, he received the University Leadership Forum Chair professorship at NTU.

Dr. Liu specializes in cyber security and software engineering. His research has bridged the gap between the theory and practical usage of formal methods and program analysis to evaluate the design and implementation of software for high assurance and security. By now, he has more than 250 publications in top tier conferences and journals. He has received a number of prestigious awards including MSRA Fellowship, TRF Fellowship, Nanyang Assistant Professor, Tan Chin Tuan Fellowship, and 10 best paper awards and one most influence system award in top conferences like ASE, FSE and ICSE.

**Duan Haixin**

**Title: Cyber-Cannon: Coordinating Cloud Services for Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) Attacks**

**Abstract:**

Cloud services, with their robust resources, have enhanced network services by increasing their reliability and security. For example, Content Delivery Networks(CDNs), one of the most popular cloud services,  have been deployed widely as the best practice  against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Great power of cloud service must come with great responsibilities; however, great power with great vulnerabilities, could  be potentially abused or even transformed into the weapon of  mass destruction in the cyberspace.

In this context, Professor Duan and his team have undertaken extensive research in recent years. They have conducted  deep examinations of security vulnerabilities in cloud services, especially Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and Domain Name System(DNS). They have shed light on how attackers could ingeniously misuse these resources to construct potent offensive tools. Additionally, they have proposed solutions for patching these vulnerabilities and mitigation  to enhance the security of some cloud services such as DNS and CDN.

Professor Duan envisions that their research could spark some thoughtful discussion  to ensure that the powerful cloud  becomes a powerful protection rather than a huge threat.

**Bio :**

Haixin Duan is a professor at the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University. Focusing on network security, Professor Duan's teaching and research encompass critical areas such as the security of Internet infrastructure, including the domain name system(DNS),  Web and CDN, public key infrastructures and cloud services.

Together with his team, professor Duan has found a lot of critical vulnerabilities of DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, CDN and Web PKI, which impact many leading internet companies and open source vendors like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Akamai, CloudFlare, Apache, ISC and etc. Their research has helped the leading companies or open source communities to fix their vulnerabilities, and led IETF and other organizations to update protocol standards to enhance security.

Prof. Duan publishes their findings in top security conferences (USENIX Security, Security&Privacy, CCS and NDSS) and won several best paper awards in CCS, NDSS and DSN. As the co-founder of Blue-Lotus Team(Once a famous CTF team based in Tsinghua), InForSec (an International Forum for Security Research), and DataCon (a data security competition), prof. Duan has always been an active contributor to the Chinese community of security research and education.

**Gao Debin**

**Title: Source-to-Bytecode Signature Generation for Insecure Method Identification on Android**

**Abstract:**

We propose MtdScout, a novel cross-layer, method-level clone detection tool for Android apps. MtdScout generates bytecode signatures for flawed source methods using compiler-style interpretation and abstraction, and efficiently matches them with target app bytecode using signature-mapped search trees. Our experiments using ground-truth apps show that MtdScout achieves the highest accuracy among three tested clone detection tools, with a precision of 92.5% and recall of 87.2%. A large-scale experiment with 23.9K apps from Google Play demonstrates MtdScout’s effectiveness in complementing both LibScout and CryptoGuard by identifying numerous false negatives they missed due to app shrinking, method-only cloning, and inherent timeouts and failures in expensive taint analysis. Additionally, our experiment uncovers four security findings that highlights the disparities between MtdScout’s method-level clone detection and package-level library detection.

**Title: The Need of Testbeds for Cyber-Physical System Security**

**Abstract:**

Critical infrastructure becomes a strategic target in the midst of a cyber war. Governments are investing significantly in response to the risks and challenges while researchers and vendors are aggressively developing and marketing new technologies aimed at protecting critical infrastructure. In this talk, I will briefly describe the framework and features of a cyber-physical system (CPS) which serves as the core to provide critical services in different industrial domains. Then I will discuss the challenges we face and the approaches we can take to defend against cyber attacks. I will elaborate the need of CPS testbeds for testing and validating cybersecurity solutions in a safe and realistic environment, and also compare different types of CPS testbeds. Finally I will introduce the fully operational industrial grade CPS testbeds in iTrust.
