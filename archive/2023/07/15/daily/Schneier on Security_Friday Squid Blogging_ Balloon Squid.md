## Friday Squid Blogging: Balloon Squid

Masayoshi Matsumoto is a “master balloon artist,” and he made a [squid](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/05/new-animals-by-masayoshi-matsumoto/) (and other animals).

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

AI image generators are now requiring an invisible watermark which was previously optional. Originally designed for copyright purposes, it is now being used to identify generated pictures and possibly trace their source.

@ Mr. Peed Off

identify generated

This should be done with all AI generated content image or text. Include the source and the name rank and serial no. of the particular AI. Then AI training poisoning by AI output could be avoided. Also, distribute an app that reads this sigil so the internetz user can automatically skip that machine trash, and look at only human trash. … But wait …

@SpaceLifeForm
Maybe Microsoft’s certificate(s) weren’t stolen, maybe they were sold without MS’s knowledge. Shouldn’t issuing CA’s have limited storage and retention of key mat?

@ SpaceLifeForm, name.withheld…, ALL,

Re : With the key to the Kingdom…

> “Storm-0558 It may be Silicon Turtles”

The joys of highly hierarchical power structures when “a root of trust” walks out the door. From that point down if it’s in your pocket, you are the one eyed man in the Kingdom of the blind.

The real question about the alledged attackers, is,

“If they knew the attack would be short lived, what did they do with the time they had?”

Microsoft appears to be either unknowing, or keeping it very quiet for some reason not yet known.

I suspect it could be both, as they keep looking to prevent it being a “Foot hold situation”… Microsoft likewise don’t want others who could have been effected taking flight or pushing for pecuniary award.

As you know I’ve maintained my “cloud is a bad idea for most reasons” stance for many years now… likewise my view on crypto-signing not just of code etc but trust in both the specific and general. This event just shows my reasoning valid on both views yet again for the umpteenth time…

Only this time is it the forth or eighth circle those who pushed have entered? Having passed unheaded the warning,

“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate”

For those so blighted this is not a “Devine Comedy”, but a “hellish inferno”, that could seem eternal.

So these guys have been in action for two years in some way or another and MS just sat there watching?

After the turtle has bolted is a dandy time to think about buzzwords or defense. A hardened cynic would know that MS cannot be allowed to crash and burn, it would take the whole nation with it …

@ name.withheld.for.obvious.reasons

MS is their own CA.

Maybe they just really screwed up their process.

Maybe there is/was an insider that has/had access.

Suspect still existing insider.

I’ve been wondering over the past few months if it’s possible to have too much security.

To wit, I’ve got a gmail account, as will a lot of others, and Google got heavy on me a short while back, asking me to set...
