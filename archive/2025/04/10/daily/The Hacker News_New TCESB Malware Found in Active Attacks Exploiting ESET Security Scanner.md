[![TCESB Malware](data:image/png;base64... "TCESB Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8vLR5N5pZ5QLBjJQVILvDFvE9DFlOWIQwl6DPI_0luxV9z7dhS2g1k06PLJ0J7tPavzAH2s0C0ehfUr4x_roXStXNMF_jr9ldOUKZZfD0bSJ0fajYgJ25xJQhuz5_EUgBsKQXh3JPSt7WPEUBQfrCXnUipO0OMokxdIwVCmjEoccBYBshgl-ggTyyv-GW/s790-rw-e365/malware.jpg)

A Chinese-affiliated threat actor known for its cyber-attacks in Asia has been observed exploiting a security flaw in security software from ESET to deliver a previously undocumented malware codenamed **TCESB**.

"Previously unseen in ToddyCat attacks, [TCESB] is designed to stealthily execute payloads in circumvention of protection and monitoring tools installed on the device," Kaspersky [said](https://securelist.com/toddycat-apt-exploits-vulnerability-in-eset-software-for-dll-proxying/116086/) in an analysis published this week.

[ToddyCat](https://thehackernews.com/2022/06/new-toddycat-hacker-group-on-experts.html) is the name given to a threat activity cluster that has targeted several entities in Asia, with attacks dating all the way back to at least December 2020.

Last year, the Russian cybersecurity vendor [detailed](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/russian-hacker-group-toddycat-uses.html) the hacking group's use of various tools to maintain persistent access to compromised environments and harvest data on an "industrial scale" from organizations located in the Asia-Pacific region.

Kaspersky said its investigation into ToddyCat-related incidents in early 2024 unearthed a suspicious DLL file ("version.dll") in the temp directory on multiple devices. The 64-bit DLL, TCESB, has been found to be launched via a technique called [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-security) to seize control of the execution flow.

This, in turn, is said to have been accomplished by taking advantage of a flaw in the [ESET Command Line Scanner](https://help.eset.com/ees/8/en-US/advanced_cmd.html), which insecurely loads a DLL named "version.dll" by first checking for the file in the current directory and then checking for it in the system directories.

It's worth pointing out at this stage that "[version.dll](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia/library/version.dll-D88DF43A86F4A7C1ED4138CCDACD43BF.html)" is a legitimate [version-checking and file installation library](https://strontic.github.io/xcyclopedia/library/version.dll-9B7352ED51D3A31D617A84A616771865.html) from Microsoft that resides in the "C:\Windows\system32\" or "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\" directories.

A consequence of exploiting this loophole is that attackers could execute their malicious version of "version.dll" as opposed to its legitimate counterpart. The vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2024-11859](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11859) (CVSS score: 6.8), was [fixed](https://support.eset.com/en/news8772-eset-endpoint-antivirus-and-eset-endpoint-security-for-windows-version-12020450-have-been-released) by ESET in late January 2025 following responsible disclosure.

[![TCESB Malware](data:image/png;base64... "TCESB Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDS_lQIIAb6JS_puGoHHPqhj2MJxzLRevQlobR5ndEkLLyj9kjEgf-Qc60ObvK1MBzr-jCdz0loJIEkoOssuO7aRc76FLgSxHkpzKWihyz2a2UK5Xc-8C4MCl4wv2eKXJa7sD4xss_0vRdWSgX5JkDeOKTas671C6Q0rUy3O96igXhIcmeNFQl2a3O4_yq/s790-rw-e365/eset.png)

"The vulnerability potentially allowed an attacker with administrator privileges to load a malicious dynamic-link library and execute its code," ESET [said](https://support.eset.com/en/ca8810-dll-search-order-hijacking-vulnerability-in-eset-products-for-windows-fixed) in an advisory released last week. "This technique did not elevate the privileges, though – the attacker would have already needed to have administrator privileges to perform this attack."

In a statement shared with The Hacker News, the Slovak cybersecurity company said it released fixed builds of its consumer, business, and server security products for the Windows operating system to address the vulnerability.

TCESB, for its part, is a modified version of an open-source tool called EDRSandBlast that includes features to alter operating system kernel structures to disable notification routines (aka [callbacks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/callback-objects)), which are designed to allow drivers to be notified of specific events, such as process creation or setting a registry key.

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

To pull this off, TCESB leverages another known technique referred to as bring your own vulnerable driver ([BYOVD](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/medusa-ransomware-uses-malicious-driver.html)) to install a vulnerable driver, a Dell DBUtilDrv2.sys driver, in the system through the Device Manager interface. The DBUtilDrv2.sys driver is susceptible to a known privilege escalation flaw tracked as [CVE-2021-36276](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000190106/additional-information-regarding-dsa-2021-152-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-an-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability-in-the-dell-dbutildrv2-sys-driver).

This is not the first time Dell drivers have been abused for malicious purposes. In 2022, a similar privilege escalation vulnerability ([CVE-2021-21551](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000186019/dsa-2021-088-dell-client-platform-security-update-for-an-insufficient-access-control-vulnerability-in-the-dell-dbutil-driver)) in another Dell driver, dbutil\_2\_3.sys, was also [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/hackers-exploiting-dell-driver.html) as part of BYOVD atta...
