# How Barcelona became an unlikely hub for spyware startups

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

11:00 PM PST · January 13, 2025

Toward the end of 2023, an Israeli security researcher from Tel Aviv said that he was approached on LinkedIn with an opportunity to work abroad with “good pay.” He said that the company’s HR department told him that it was a “legitimate” offensive security company that was starting from scratch in Barcelona, Spain.

But during the whole recruiting process, the researcher recounted to TechCrunch, things felt a bit off.

“The whole secrecy was very weird. Some employees that interviewed me didn’t use their full names, they took super long to reveal where the company even is, let alone its name. Why is it such a secret if everything’s legit?” the researcher told TechCrunch. “It seems like a company that might get sanctioned in the future, and things might get dirty.”

When he spoke to the company’s chief technology officer, the researcher said that he was told something along the lines of, “We will only have legit customers and unlike other companies won’t sell to shady nations.”

Alexey Levin, the hiring CTO and a former researcher at the sanctioned spyware maker NSO Group, told the researcher that the company trying to hire him was called Palm Beach Networks and that it develops everything from the zero-day exploits used for compromising devices to the spyware implant itself, referring to the surveillance software that gets installed on a target’s device, according to the researcher.

The researcher said that Levin also told him that Palm Beach Networks had at least one U.S. government customer. (Levin did not respond to a request for comment.)

But why found a spyware startup in Barcelona, which just years earlier [was at the center of a wide-reaching political scandal](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/lawyer-allegedly-hacked-with-spyware-names-nso-founders-in-lawsuit/) where Spanish government officials used spyware to target local politicians who pushed for independence? The researcher said that company employees told him that it was because living in the city is similar to living in Israel, that there are [good tax benefits](https://marfourlaw.com/beckham-tax-law/) and good weather.

Those are some of the reasons why in the last couple of years, Barcelona has become an unlikely hub for spyware companies, according to multiple people who work in the offensive cybersecurity industry who spoke with TechCrunch, as well as business records we have seen.

Having Barcelona become a crucial regional outpost for offensive cybersecurity companies puts the spyware problem squarely on the doorstep of Europe, which has [a fractious relationship with surveillance tech](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/11/europe-pegasus-investigation/), due to scandals in [Cyprus](https://www.icij.org/investigations/cyprus-confidential/spyware-firm-intellexa-hit-with-us-sanctions-after-cyprus-confidential-expose/), [Greece](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/us-sanctions-founder-of-spyware-maker-intellexa-for-targeting-americans/), [Hungary](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/hungarian-journalists-targeted-with-pegasus-spyware-to-sue-state), and [Poland](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/02/poland-arrests-former-spy-chief-in-pegasus-spyware-probe/) — all involving Israeli spyware makers.

“It is a concerning development if a major city in Europe becomes a hub for spyware makers,” Natalia Krapiva, the legal counsel at nonprofit Access Now, which specializes in investigating and researching spyware, told TechCrunch. Krapiva said that the spyware business “goes hand in hand with corruption and abuse of power.”

“Spanish citizens, media, and policymakers should be carefully scrutinizing these businesses in terms of whether their operations are consistent with national and EU laws and whether the Spanish government may be involved in abusing their surveillance tools, especially given Spain’s history with Pegasus,” said Krapiva.

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, where he and his colleagues have for more than a decade investigated abuses carried out with spyware tools, also expressed concern. Scott-Railton noted that in the past, there have been cases of spyware abuse not only against human rights activists and dissidents in nondemocratic countries like Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, [but also against U.S. diplomats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/israel-nso-pegasus-hack-us-diplomats/) and targeted individuals, including politicians and citizens within Europe’s borders.

“This will add fuel to the fire of Europe’s spyware crisis. If experience is a guide, it’s only a matter of time before this tech winds up used by customers against Spain’s allies and EU partners,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Governments that allow this industry to flourish take a gamble with their own secret capabilities and human capital. These capabilities tend to drain outwards, including to potential future adversaries, once mercenary spyware and exploit developers come to town and start hiring.”
