## tl;dr

* Out-of-band (OOB) communications are alternative systems or technologies that allow responders to collaborate, coordinate, and inform during an incident.
* OOB should not use any existing, normal infrastructure.
* OOB should provide email, voice, and real-time communications capabilities; mass one-way communications to employees, clients, and the public; and file storage.
* Ensure that your OOB solution meets any internal legal requirements.
* Set up OOB before an incident occurs.
* Test your OOB platforms.

Communications are critical during an incident. If you cannot coordinate, collaborate, and inform actions and information about an incident, the incident response will eventually fail. Normally, this isn’t an issue, as organizations have resources like Microsoft 365 email, SharePoint, Slack, and Teams to use to communicate with each other. However, what happens when those technologies are unavailable? That is where OOB communications come in.

OOB communications are alternative technologies that are utilized outside of your normal, existing communications systems to allow response teams to collaborate during an incident. It is important to note that these technologies are **outside****of your existing infrastructure**–they are systems that you do not use daily and are not tied to your current communications systems or infrastructure. In other words, if you use M365 and Active Directory, then Teams is not OOB and neither is anything that uses AD authentication. OOB needs to be completely separate.

## **When is OOB needed?**

OOB communications are commonly used when existing communications are *unavailable,* or they either are, or are suspected to be, *untrustworthy*. Examples of situations that could make systems unavailable include a vendor outage, a severe storm, a ransomware event, or a DDOS attack. During these times, OOB provides a backup to the existing systems’ functionality.

Communications are considered untrustworthy if you are no longer confident that their confidentiality or integrity is intact. This often occurs either during an incident where the threat actor has successfully compromised your communications systems (usually email or chat) or when the possibility exists that they may have. Since you should keep your incident response actions confidential, organizations should automatically go OOB once an incident reaches a high severity level or if they have indicators that their communications systems have been compromised.
