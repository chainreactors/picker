The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned of two similar spear-phishing campaigns, one originating from Russia, the other from Iran.

The NCSC has attributed the campaigns to a Russia-based group called SEABORGIUM and the Iran-based [TA453](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/15/charming_kitten_ta453_expands_targets/) group, also known as APT42. The threat groups target individuals working in academia, defence, government, non-government organisations, and think-tanks. Politicians, journalists and activists are also a target in an attempt to gather sensitive information.

“These campaigns by threat actors based in Russia and Iran continue to ruthlessly pursue their targets in an attempt to steal online credentials and compromise potentially sensitive systems,” [warned](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-cyber-experts-warn-of-targeted-phishing-attacks-from-actors-based-in-russia-and-iran) NCSC director of operations Paul Chichester.
