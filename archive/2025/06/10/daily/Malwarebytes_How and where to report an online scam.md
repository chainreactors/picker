# How and where to report an online scam

Posted: June 9, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

If you’ve been scammed it’s really important to report it, if you can, in order to help prevent others falling for the same scam, and give authorities a chance to catch the criminal who did it.

The methods in which to report a scam varies according to the country you’re in, the platforms you’re using, and the outcome of the scam, so here are the most common methods you may need. Remember to report to both the authorities and the platforms the scammers are using.

## How to report a scam in the United States

* **Report to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3):** File a complaint online at [ic3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/) as soon as possible. This is the main hub for cybercrime reports and helps with investigations and to gather intelligence about scams and the people behind them. Rapid reporting can also help support the recovery of lost funds.
* **Contact local law enforcement:** If you lost money, you should also file a report with your local police department.
* **Notify your bank or credit card company:** Inform them about the fraud in order to freeze accounts or reverse charges where possible.

## How to report a scam in Canada

* **Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC):** Call 1-888-495-8501 or report [online](https://antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/report-signalez-eng.htm#a1a). The CAFC collects fraud reports nationwide and coordinates with law enforcement and the National Cybercrime Coordination Centre (NC3).
* **Local police:** Report the scam to your local police department, especially if you lost money.
* **Credit bureaus:** It is advisable to contact Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada to order a free credit report immediately and ask that a fraud alert be put on your file.
* **Financial institutions:** Notify your bank or credit card issuer immediately, but also to the financial institution that transferred the money in case that’s a different one.

## How to report a scam in the United Kingdom

* **Action Fraud:** Report online at [actionfraud.police.uk](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) or call 0300 123 2040 (Monday to Friday, 8 am to 8 pm). Action Fraud is the national reporting center for fraud and cybercrime. It collects reports about fraud on behalf of the police in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. For fraud in Scotland please report it directly to Police Scotland.
* **Local police:** For urgent matters or ongoing threats, contact your local police. If the police decide not to investigate your case as a crime, you might still be able to get compensation or money back by bringing a civil case yourself. Talk to a solicitor or asset recovery agent to find out more.
* **Financial institutions:** Alert your bank or credit card company to suspicious transactions.

## Reporting scams on popular platforms

In all countries it’s also helpful to report on the platforms where the scam took place or was initiated. Use built-in reporting tools on platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp to report scam accounts or messages:

### WhatsApp

* Open the chat with the suspicious business or individual.
* Tap the business name or contact info at the top.
* Scroll down and select **Report Business** or **Report Contact**.
* Block the contact to stop further messages. The last five messages in the chat will be sent to Wh...
