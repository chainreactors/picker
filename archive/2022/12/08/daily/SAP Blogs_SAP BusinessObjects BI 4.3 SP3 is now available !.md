### ***We are excited to announce the release of the 3rd Service Package for SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.3!***

SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.3 is definitely the place to go!

As SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.2 reaches the end of mainstream maintenance by the end of this year (2022), with the Priority1 support ending in 2024, we warmly encourage our customers to take advantage of this release to adopt BI 4.3. Upgrading from previous versions is simple, it can be considered an update, and with SP03 you get the best feature set of all available versions.

This release is a bit special. Not only it allows us to deliver a whole set of new features in the DATA domain, but we also continue to further integrate SAP BusinessObjects into the new world of cloud platforms, and to focus on a better productivity & usability by delivering your most urgent improvement requests.

**The complete list of innovations and enhancements is impressive.**

Let us uncover what you can expect from this release!

## Focus Innovation Areas for Web Intelligence

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/43SP3-2.png)

Like for the SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.3 SP02, three key areas of focus and emphasis make up the SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.3 SP03 release.

The first one, and main focus area for this release, offers a complete set of functionalities enabling data modeling, and is composed of three capabilities:

* The “Data Preview Mode”: it is not a new feature as it used to exist into the WebI Rich Client (WRC) BI 4.2 but was previously named the “Data Manager”. It allows you to consult your query result. By integrating this capability directly into the BI 4.3 SP03, we have taken the opportunity to enhance the concept. Not only will you be able to preview your queries, objects to gain confidence in your data, but you will also be able to navigate into your data by using Facets, in order to display the unique occurrence of your objects, and to cross them with any measures.

* “Prepare and Transform your Data”: the second capability is directly linked to the first one, as, while consulting and exploring your data in the preview mode, you have now the possibility to transform them in one click. By doing so, you will immediately enrich and transform your data stored into the WebI microcube, without the need to create additional variables.

* The “Combine Flows of Data”: finally, we have drastically enhanced the capability to synchronize your queries. You can combine your flows by using three operators. “Append”, “Left join” and “Right join” are now supported, and more will be added in the future. By doing so, you will generate a virtual cube with only the objects that matter from a report designer perspective. The original queries and objects will be automatically hidden to your end users.

Then, with the second focus area, we are pushing again the integration capabilities of BOBJ. In the previous SP02, we gave the ability to access your data and files stored in your corporate Google Drive from the SAP BusinessObjects platform. With the SP03, we are adding the possibility to do the same but with Microsoft OneDrive: you can now use your data and files stored in this drive to create Web Intelligence documents, but also to automatically push information into this drive thanks to the BI Platform Scheduler.

In addition of that, to push furthermore the integration capabilities, the ODATA feature exposed in the previous SP02 has been enriched. We propose a new entry point in the ODATA URL that will let you access directly the list of entities (report elements and cubes) composing a WebI document.

Finally, the last area of improvement concerns the end us...
