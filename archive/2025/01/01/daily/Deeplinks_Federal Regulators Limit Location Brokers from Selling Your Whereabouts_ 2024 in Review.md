The opening and closing months of 2024 saw federal enforcement against a number of [location data brokers](https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers) that track and sell users’ whereabouts through apps installed on their smartphones. In January, the Federal Trade Commission [brought](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/01/ftc-bars-x-mode-selling-sensitive-location-data) successful enforcement actions against [X-Mode Social](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-joined-commissioner-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-commissioner-alvaro-bedoya-0) and [InMarket](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/ftc-order-will-ban-inmarket-selling-precise-consumer-location-dataa), banning the companies from selling precise location data—a first prohibition of this kind for the FTC. And in December, the FTC [widened its net](https://www.404media.co/ftc-bans-location-data-company-that-powers-the-surveillance-ecosystem/) to two additional companies—[Gravy Analytics (Venntel)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-takes-action-against-gravy-analytics-venntel-unlawfully-selling-location-data-tracking-consumers) and [Mobilewalla](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-takes-action-against-mobilewalla-co...
