# How to switch off Apple Intelligence on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

Apple released new software updates on Monday, including iOS 18.3, which automatically opts users into [Apple Intelligence](https://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-intelligence/), at least for newer devices.

Unlike what the tech industry seems to think, [or wants to believe](https://bsky.app/profile/malwaretech.com/post/3lgldhxasrc26), not everyone wants generative AI features enabled by default on their devices. You may want to switch off the new AI features because you are concerned about the AI industry’s [impact on the environment](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about#:~:text=But%20when%20it%20comes%20to,becoming%20scarce%20in%20many%20places.) or some of the [political views](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/13/sam-altman-and-jeff-bezos-are-the-latest-billionaires-to-donate-1m-to-trump-fund/) of the industry’s top players, or you just don’t think it works very well right now — something that has so far [been](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/17/apple-suspends-ai-generated-news-alert-service-after-bbc-complaint) [proven](https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/) [true](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/apple-intelligence-features-can-also-summarize-breakup-texts-for-you/) with Apple Intelligence, so much so that there’s [an entire subreddit dedicated to its fails](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleIntelligenceFail/).

We are here to help you switch off Apple Intelligence from your devices, a process which should be the same for iPhones, iPads, and Macs — and it’s relatively straightforward.

Go to **Settings** on iOS, or **System Settings** on Mac, and then tap or click on **Apple Intelligence.**

On Mac, if it’s switched on, turn it off by clicking on the toggle. You may also want to switch off Siri here as well.

You will have to confirm you want to stop using Apple Intelligence in a dialog that will open once you click on the toggle.

On iOS, when you open the **Settings** app, scroll down to **Apple Intelligence & Siri** and tap on the toggle to turn it off. You can turn off Siri here too, which we suggest for privacy and security reasons, [especially related to Siri on the lock screen](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-siri-lock-screen-attacks/).

It’s worth noting that Apple has designed its AI features to be privacy-minded, [with a system and infrastructure that the company calls Private Cloud Computer](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/24/apple-will-pay-security-researchers-up-to-1-million-to-hack-its-private-ai-cloud/). In practice, this means no personal data ever touches the company Apple Intelligence servers.
