The US Department of the Treasury has admitted that miscreants were in its systems, accessing documents in what has been called a "major incident."

A letter [shared by Reuters](https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25472740-letter-to-chairman-brown-and-ranking-member-scott/) with the Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs described the sequence of events. On December 8, the Treasury was notified by BeyondTrust that a key used for remote technical support had been pilfered, meaning that a threat actor could access some Departmental Office workstations and unclassified files.

Agencies including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been working with the Treasury to understand the incident. Third-party forensic investigators have also been called in.
