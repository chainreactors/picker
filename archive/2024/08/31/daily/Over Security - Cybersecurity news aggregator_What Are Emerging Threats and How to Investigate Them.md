What Are Emerging Threats
and How to Investigate Them

An emerging threat is a new or evolving cybersecurity risk that is particularly challenging to defend against due to the lack of intelligence on its attack methods, strategies, and techniques.

These threats can take various forms, from sophisticated malware to unconventional attack vectors. They also often exploit new vulnerabilities or technologies that can bypass current security measures.

## Characteristics of Emerging Threats

Unlike persistent threats, which are well-known and have existing defenses, emerging threats:

* Involve new techniques, tools, or exploits that have not been widely seen before.

* Evolve continuously, with attackers continually refining their methods to evade detection and countermeasures.

* Can be difficult to predict, making them challenging to defend against.

* May have much more serious implications for victims.

## Why Organizations Need to Monitor Emerging Threats

Many organizations are not equipped to handle emerging threats due to a lack of awareness, resources, or expertise. Such threats can disrupt their operations, lead to data breaches, and cause financial losses. They can also damage a company’s reputation and have a negative impact on customer trust.

To protect their assets, businesses need to stay informed about emerging threats and take proactive measures.

## How Threat Intelligence Lookup Helps Collect Information on Emerging Threats

One of the services that help organizations learn about new threats is [Threat Intelligence (TI) Lookup](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/introducing-any-run-threat-intelligence-lookup/) from [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=emerging_threats&utm_term=130824&utm_content=linktolanding).

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/imagea-1024x572.png)

The service is powered by a global community of 400,000 security experts who submit thousands of samples to the ANY.RUN sandbox for analysis every day.

Through this process, large volumes of [indicators of compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs) and other threat data are extracted and sent to Threat Intelligence Lookup, making it accessible to users for searching and gathering fresh info on malware and phishing threats.

TI Lookup allows users to:

* Search through the latest malware and phishing threat data

* Refine your searches using over 40 different search parameters and combinations, including wildcards

* Get quick results, each with a corresponding sandbox session

* Use [YARA Search](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/yara-search-guide/) with a built-in rule editor

* Integrate with your security systems using API

## Examples of Emerging Threats and How to Investigate Them with TI Lookup

### 1. New Phishing Threats

Attackers are constantly finding new ways to make their phishing attempts convincing.

By abusing legitimate services, mimicking popular websites, and crafting believable lures, criminals attempt to trick users into engaging in the target activity like revealing their credentials or installing malware on their systems.

### Example: Abuse of SES Accounts by Tycoon 2FA Phish-kit

Recently, ANY.RUN researchers [spotted a phishing campaign](https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1818972716659093913) exploiting compromised Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) accounts to distribute phishing emails.

The attack chain began with an email from Amazon SES, which then redirected the victim through various domains, including social networks and news outlets like India Times, to the final page requesting their credentials.

Using a TI Lookup query featuring a string used in phishing URLs combined with the abused domain, we can find more samples and relevant t...
