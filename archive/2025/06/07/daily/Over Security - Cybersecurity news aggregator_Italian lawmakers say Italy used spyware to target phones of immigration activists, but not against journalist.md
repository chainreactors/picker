# Italian lawmakers say Italy used spyware to target phones of immigration activists, but not against journalist

An Italian parliamentary committee confirmed that the Italian government used spyware made by the Israeli company Paragon to hack several activists working to save immigrants at sea. The committee, however, said its investigation concluded that a prominent Italian journalist was not among the victims, leaving key questions about the spyware attacks unanswered.

The Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic, known as COPASIR, [published a report](https://documenti.camera.it/_dati/leg19/lavori/documentiparlamentari/IndiceETesti/034/004/INTERO.pdf) on Thursday that concluded a months-long inquiry into the use of Paragon’s spyware, known as Graphite, across Italy. Israeli newspaper Haaretz [first wrote about the report](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-06-05/ty-article/.premium/italy-admits-activists-were-hacked-with-israeli-spyware-but-not-journalists/00000197-3ff4-d079-ab97-7ff5bd8a0000).

In January, [WhatsApp began sending notifications to around 90 of its users](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/), alerting them that they may have been targeted with Paragon’s spyware. [Several](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/) [people](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/new-target-of-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/) in Italy [came forward](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/another-person-targeted-by-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/) after receiving the notifications, prompting a scandal in Italy, which has a long history of hosting [spyware](https://www.vice.com/en/article/hacking-team-is-dead/) [companies](https://www.vice.com/en/article/government-spyware-maker-doxes-itself-by-linking-to-its-site-in-malware-code/), as well as its government’s [own](https://www.vice.com/en/article/malware-hunters-catch-new-android-spyware-raxir/) [spyware](https://www.vice.com/en/article/prosecutors-suspend-cy4gate-government-spyware-used-in-whatsapp-phishing-attacks/) [uses](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/spyware-maker-caught-distributing-malicious-android-apps-for-years/) [and](https://www.vice.com/en/article/rcs-lab-government-spyware-infects-a-computer-in-this-leaked-demo-video/) [abuses](https://www.vice.com/en/article/hackers-hid-android-malware-in-google-play-store-exodus-esurv/).

Since then, COPASIR has investigated the allegations with the goal of clarifying exactly what happened.

COPASIR specifically investigated the targeting of [Luca Casarini](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/new-target-of-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/) and [Giuseppe Caccia](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/another-person-targeted-by-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/), who both work for [Mediterranea Saving Humans](https://mediterranearescue.org/en), an Italian nonprofit with the mission of rescuing immigrants who try to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In both their cases, the committee concluded that they were lawfully targeted by Italian intelligence agencies as part of investigations related to the alleged facilitation of illegal immigration into the country.

But the COPASIR committee concluded there was no evidence that [Francesco Cancellato](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/journalist-targeted-on-whatsapp-by-paragon-spyware-i-feel-violated/), a journalist who also received a notification from WhatsApp warning him he had been a target of Paragon’s spyware, had been targeted by Italy’s intelligence agencies.

The committee wrote that its representatives were able to query the intelligence agencies’ spyware database and audit logs for Cancellato’s phone number, and did not find any relevant records. The committee said it also did not find evidence of any legal requests to spy on Cancellato from the country’s top prosecutor’s office, nor from the Department of Information for Security, or [DIS](https://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/chi-siamo/organizzazione/dis), a top Italian government department that oversees the activities of the country’s two intelligence agencies, the AISE and AISI.

The report noted that Paragon has foreign government customers that could potentially target Italians, leaving the door open that this may be how the targeting of Cancellato’s phone can be explained. COPASIR did not provide any evidence to support this theory.

Cancellato is the director of [Fanpage.it](http://fanpage.it/), an Italian news website that is [known for several investigations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops), including one on [the youth-wing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/fanpage-the-italian-website-that-went-from-gossip-to-award-winning-scoops) of the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. That investigation revealed that, in private, the members made racist remarks and chanted fascist so...
