## Highlighted changes

* New dataprovider method to fetch current funding rates.
* Improved behavior when using `funding_rates` as informative pairs.
* Improved “short download-data” runs by using a different parallel method.
* Improved okx download-data speed (300 candles instead of 100 per call).
* Reduced false-positives due to delayed entries for `lookahead-analysis` by forcing market orders.
* Support nested dicts and lists in webhook messages.
* New `DelistFilter` to remove delised pairs from your pairlist (currently supports only binance).
* Add `--enable-dynamic-pairlist` to backtesting / hyperopt - which can (in combination with ShuffleFilter) shuffle your pairlist at each candle.
* freqUI:
  + Fix anoying bug in chart tooltip.
  + Added z-settings to markArea functionality to control if your areas are behind or in front of the Chart.

⚠️ This will be the last release where we will provide pre-built armhf (32bit) images. This will only impact older raspberry PI's - which will now have to install natively.
