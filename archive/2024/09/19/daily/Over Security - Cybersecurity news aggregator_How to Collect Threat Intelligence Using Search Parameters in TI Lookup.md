How to Collect Threat Intelligence Using Search Parameters in TI Lookup

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=search_params_ti&utm_term=180924&utm_content=linktolanding/)‘s [Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=search_params_ti&utm_term=180924&utm_content=linktolookuplanding) is a valuable resource for security professionals searching for information on the latest cyber threats.

One of the key features of Threat Intelligence Lookup is its extensive search capabilities. The service offers over 40 different search parameters that can be combined to form specific queries. These parameters allow you to filter and refine your search results based on various criteria, such as [IOCs](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/how-we-process-iocs/), behavioral indicators, and other relevant information.

Let’s explore each search parameter and provide examples of how they can be used in your investigations.

## **About Threat Intelligence Lookup**

[Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=search_params_ti&utm_term=180924&utm_content=linktolookup) is a centralized platform for threat data exploration, collection, and analysis.

At the core of Threat Intelligence Lookup lies a global network of over 400,000 security experts. These individuals actively contribute by submitting suspicious samples to the ANY.RUN sandbox for advanced analysis on a daily basis.

The submission process generates a wealth of valuable threat data, including indicators of compromise (IOCs), which are then extracted and integrated into Threat Intelligence Lookup.

Thanks to its integration with ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox, users can access real-time search results, each one linked to a corresponding sandbox session, enabling in-depth analysis of the identified threats.
