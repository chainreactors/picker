##### By Byron V. Acohido

When Tennisha Martin, a veteran software quality assurance analyst, sought to move over to a security team a few years ago, the doors should have been wide open, given the [much-ballyhooed cybersecurity skills shortage](https://www.csoonline.com/article/651940/the-global-cybersecurity-skills-shortage-still-crazy-after-all-these-years.html).

***Related:** [Modernizing security training](https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/why-security-awareness-training-needs-to-modernize)*

Instead, she ran into a rigid wall of shortsightedness. So, Martin taught herself ethical hacking skills and then founded  [Black Girls Hack](https://www.blackgirlshack.org/) to guide others down the trail she blazed.

As [Black Hat USA 2024](https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/7-sessions-not-to-miss-at-black-hat-usa-2024) rolls into high gear next week, BGH is thriving. The non-profit boasts 2,500 members globally (all genders and races) and has lined up top-tier corporate backers, led by Microsoft and Google, to back its programs.

What’s more, it is putting on a content-rich conference, [SquadCon 2024](https://blackgirlshack.org/event-5495307/), in parallel with Black Hat, at [The Industrial Event Space](https://www.theindustrialvegas.com/) in Vegas mid next week.

I had the chance to visit with Martin and BGH group leaders Tammy Hinkle and Rebekah Skeete; we discussed how BGH fosters a confidence-building community. Members get access to resources such as training vouchers and tools like [RangeForce](https://www.rangeforce.com/). And the only requirement is to “not be a jerk,” Martin says. For a full drill down, give a listen to the [accompanying podcast](http://acohido%20pulitzer%20prize-winning%20business%20journalist%20byron%20v.%20acohido%20is%20dedicated%20to%20fostering%20public%20awareness%20about%20how%20to%20make%20the%20internet%20as%20private%20and%20secure%20as%20it%20ought%20to%20be./).

BGH’s emphasis on diversity has the potential to be a game changer. In a hyper-interconnected operating environment, grasping the context of legit vs. malicious connections, on the fly, is vital.

So how much might a diverse security team contribute to staying on top of context in such a highly dynamic environment?  I’ll keep watch and keep reporting.
