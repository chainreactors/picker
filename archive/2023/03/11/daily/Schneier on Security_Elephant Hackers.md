## Elephant Hackers

An elephant uses its right-of-way privileges to [stop sugar-cane trucks](https://twitter.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1632667168461533184) and grab food.

@ Bruce, ALL,

> ‚ÄúAn elephant uses its right-of-way privileges‚Ä¶‚Äù

It‚Äôs not just elephants that do this.

Anyone been to where any crearure of more than a modicum of cognative ability is either revered or protected in some way?

You see it happening with temples and monkeys.

In a well known European Holiday Destination cats were protected and the feral population effectively replaced rats in the ecology.

Oh and in Holland ‚Äúcyclists‚Äù have some very strong priveledges compared to motorists.

I‚Äôll let a Dutch national tell you the consequences of that üòâ

They can probably hear those trucks from miles away with their magic feet and bone structure. So how do you bribe an elephant?

@ ResearcherZero

Re : Bribes that work‚Ä¶

> ‚ÄúSo how do you bribe an elephant?‚Äù

Easy, but first a short story that @JonKnowsNothing can probably comment on üòâ

Some years ago now, I used to communicate with a lady in California who had two apparently unconnected occupations,

1, Owner operator of a horse ranch.

She however would always point out they were very much alike.

As I realy do not like horses ‚Äìor many humans for that matter‚Äì I used to quip ‚ÄúIs that because they are half mad, untrustworthy, and no one with any sense would let then twixt their legs?‚Äù

To make her point though, she used to point out that in her experience both horses and humans were so much alike, because they were easy to bribe with food treats. She would then pause reflectively for a moment before saying ‚ÄúWhich is just as well‚Ä¶ because it would be so unkind to use a crop on a horse‚Äù.

The elephants have normalized this hack with their size.

@Clive, All

re: *Horses v Humans*

I can safely say a horse will sell their freedom for a bucket of grain.

Humans, however, sell their freedom for invisible electronic imprints of varying lengths.

Horses go for the tangible. Humans go for the intangible.

Horses do not believe in Pie In The Sky, they only believe in Hay In The Bin.

Humans on the other hand, go to great lengths to increase the number of Pie In The Sky rewards they are willing to accept.

Horses know ‚ÄúThere is no spoon‚Ä¶‚Äù; Humans are still working on it. (1)

1) ‚ÄúThere is no spoon‚Äù sequence from The Matrix movies.

What‚Äôs really interesting about this? It sounds like our species and elephants are learning to share the geographical areas with some degree of harmony.

That has to be good. One hopes we humans don‚Äôt decide we can‚Äôt / won‚Äôt share the geography, and take out the big guns. One hopes individual elephants won‚Äôt do things to attack humans, and humans learn how to coexist without provoking attacks.

@ResearcherZero

I don‚Äôt know how to bribe an elephant, but I know how to stop them from charging\*.

\*In theory. I was a kid when my Dad told me the trick and I have never needed to try it.

Not sure if Bruce included any animal examples in his new book ‚ÄúA Hacker‚Äôs Mind‚Äù but if not they sure seem to display same tendencies of gaming a rules-system as humans do.
