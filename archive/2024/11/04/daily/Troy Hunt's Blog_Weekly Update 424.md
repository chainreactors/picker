# Weekly Update 424

03 November 2024

I have really clear memories of listening to the Stack Overflow podcast in the late 2000's and hearing Jeff and Joel talk about the various challenges they were facing and the things they did to overcome them. I just suddenly thought of that when realising how long this week's video went for with no real plan other than to talk about our HIBP backlog. People seem to love this in the same way I loved listening to the guys a decade and a half ago. I'll do one of these with Stefan as well over the course of this month, let us know what you'd like to hear about ðŸ˜Š
