![Fake Spam Plugin Uses Victim’s Domain Name to Evade Detection](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fake-Spam-Plugin-Uses-Victims-Domain-Name-to-Evade-Detection-820x385.png)

During our investigation of an SEO spam infection (spam content designed to manipulate search engine results), we discovered a nicely crafted plugin that named itself after the infected domain, helping it evade detection. While this tactic was simple, it easily blended in with other legitimate plugins, making it harder to spot during the troubleshooting process.

The plugin was designed to appear harmless, with a folder name that mimicked the site’s domain. This unique customization made the plugin easy to overlook, as it appeared to be a legitimate component made specifically for the site. Once active, the plugin injected spam content into the site, often targeting search engines to manipulate rankings. The plugin would only activate under certain conditions, such as when a search engine crawler was detected, which further hid its presence from regular users.

This piece of malware is focused on sticking around unnoticed. By changing the plugin name to match the site and tweaking how it behaves, the attackers that crafted this malware make it easy to slip past basic detection and stay active on a compromised site much longer. This allowed the attackers to deliver Cialis SEO spam.

Now that we know the goals of this malware and how it evades detection, let’s review the code itself.

## Code Location and Analysis

First, let’s take a look at the location of the malware. We will be utilizing an example domain to protect the privacy of our client. See the location below:

```
wp-content/plugins/exampledomain-com/exampledomain-com.php
```

The plugin name uses the victim’s second-level domain, ***example***, then adds a dash followed by the top-level domain, ***.com***. The only file in this directory is then placed with the same naming conventions as the folder name itself.

Now we can look at the code itself. The file is very large and obfuscated with many declared variables, so only certain parts of the code will be displayed. See below for the first obfuscated code section:

### Obfuscated Code Part 1:

![obfuscated code part 1](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/obfuscated-code-part-1.png)

***Note:** This is only a partial snapshot of the code.*

The first section of code begins with a comment block that mimics a legitimate WordPress plugin header. Each time this malware is injected, the header details are customized to reflect the specific domain it has infected, giving the appearance of a genuine plugin. To protect our client’s privacy, the actual domain name has been replaced with an example domain. Next, let’s take a look at the second part of the obfuscated code:

### Obfuscated Code Part 2:

![obfuscated code part 2](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/obfuscated-code-part-2.png)

***Note:** This is only a partial snapshot of the code.*

In this second section, there are thousands of variable assignments which are broken up into many small parts. This is a typical obfuscation technique and something we see often in malware samples. Later in the file, these variables will be combined, decoded, and executed.

Instead of writing out commands directly, the attacker scatters letters, numbers, and symbols across hundreds of variables and then slowly stitches them together into real code using complex concatenation. This can make the code hard to understand or detect with automated tools. This is a very common tactic in WordPress infections, especially in plugins pretending to be legitimate.

## Decoded Malware and Its Function:

The content below will be broken down into four main parts:

### Part 1:

This first chunk of code starts the malicious process by first setting up a function that downloads files from an external host, then fetching remote content by pretending to be a browser.
