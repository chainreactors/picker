# New Email Tracking Features Deliver More Accurate Engagement Insights

October 14th, 2024

Today, we’re excited to announce two new reporting features designed to help healthcare organizations improve reporting accuracy and the overall effectiveness of their email campaigns. The new features offer deeper insights into Apple Mail and Google email performance by distinguishing between opens and clicks performed by human actions and automated events — and by giving users control over how these events are reflected in LuxSci email campaign reporting.

Let’s dive into what these features are and how they can help you get more precise data from your healthcare email marketing and communications efforts.

### **Feature 1: Enhanced Open and Click Tracking – Human vs. Automated**

One of the biggest challenges in email tracking today is the rise of automated systems that pre-load images and scan links in emails. Automated systems can trigger open or click events without the recipient actually interacting with the email, leading to inflated and misleading open/click rates.

With LuxSci’s new **enhanced open and click tracking**, you can now tell whether Apple Mail and Google emails (Gmail and Google Workspace) were opened or a link was clicked by a human or by an automated system. This crucial distinction allows you to have a much clearer picture of actual user engagement.

Here’s how it works:

* When emails are sent with open tracking enabled, a small tracking image (also known as a pixel) is embedded in the email. When that image is loaded, the system tracks the email as “opened.”
* Similarly, links in the email are encoded to track clicks. If a recipient clicks a link, it triggers a “clicked” event, but these events can also be triggered by automated systems.
* LuxSci’s enhanced open and click tracking feature analyzes these events and reports whether the actions were performed by a human or an automated system, helping you sift through false positives.

### **Feature 2: Suppressing Automated Events in Your Reporting**

In addition to tracking the source of open and click events, LuxSci’s second new feature gives you the option to **exclude automated events** from Apple Mail and Google email from your email engagement statistics altogether. This setting, available in account-wide outbound email settings, is a powerful tool for ensuring the accuracy of your reports and understanding true user engagement.

Here’s how it works:

* Automated opens and clicks can be removed from email reporting for better accuracy. For example, if a security bot clicks a link, that event will be logged, but it won’t mark the email as “clicked” in your statistics.
* Your open, click, and click-through rates can be set to only reflect real human actions, making these metrics much more reliable for evaluating campaign performance and actual patient engagement.

### **Why These Features Matter for Healthcare Email Marketing**

For healthcare organizations, reliable metrics are essential. Emails often carry critical information related to patient care, transactions, or marketing, and understanding who is engaging with your content is critical to ongoing improvement and long-term success. At the same time, automated actions can inflate your open and click rates, leading to inaccurate conclusions about your email performance.

LuxSci’s new features give you the power to:

* **Track email engagement with precision**: Know the difference between human engagement and automated actions, so your metrics reflect reality.
* **Customize your reporting**: Decide whether you want to include or suppress automated events in your reports.
* **Improve deliverability strategies**: By analyzing which emails are genuinely opened or clicked by real people, you can fine-tune your email campaigns to maximize their effectiveness.
