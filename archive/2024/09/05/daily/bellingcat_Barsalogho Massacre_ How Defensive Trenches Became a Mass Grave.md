# Barsalogho Massacre: How Defensive Trenches Became a Mass Grave

September 4, 2024

* [Burkina Faso](/tag/burkina-faso)

**WARNING: This report contains references to killings and graphic violence that some readers might find distressing.**

Videos circulating online show the moment militants killed more than 100 unarmed residents digging defensive trenches in Barsalogho, Burkina Faso, last month.

Footage shows those killed lying in trenches dug to protect their town.

Satellite images also reveal that extensive new trenches were dug around Barsalogho immediately after the massacre.

According to [Collectif Justice Pour Barsalogho](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20240828-burkina-faso-apr%C3%A8s-l-attaque-de-barsalogho-un-collectif-fustige-les-erreurs-de-l-arm%C3%A9e) (CJB), a collective formed by residents in the aftermath of the attack, civilians were forced by the Burkinabè army to dig the trenches on Saturday morning, August 24, when they came under attack from Al Qaeda-affiliated Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). Bellingcat was not able to independently verify this claim.

The CJB described the army’s inability to prevent the massacre as a “bitter failure.”

The videos filmed by JNIM show militants shooting at unarmed people, and dozens of bodies scattered along the trenches.

JNIM claimed it killed 300 people affiliated with the Burkinabè military. The exact number of people killed and wounded has still not been confirmed by the government, with early reports suggesting [hundreds were killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/i-saw-horrible-things-burkina-faso-massacre-survivor-describes-bloodshed-2024-08-30/).

Military officials [met with some victims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baLsSAdTtLk) in nearby Kaya after the attack, but neither the government nor the military has been forthcoming about events. More than a week after the massacre, the country’s president Ibrahim Traoré, has yet to release an official statement about the attack, although the Presidential Office released a [report](https://www.presidencedufaso.bf/attaque-terroriste-a-barsalgho-des-emissaires-des-presidents-nigerien-et-malien-temoignent-leur-compassion-et-leur-solidarite-au-peuple-burkinabe/) on Wednesday outlining that Malian and Nigérien officials had expressed solidarity with the victims.

Bellingcat geolocated footage filmed by JNIM militants during the attack and analysed satellite imagery showing the growth of the trenches around the town.

## Motorcycles Approach

On the morning of Saturday August 24, armed men on motorcycles approached the outskirts of Barsalogho, where scores of people were digging defensive trenches.

Bellingcat obtained and geolocated four videos that all appear to have been filmed by the same JNIM militant: one showing them approaching the trenches, one upon arrival at the trenches, and another two showing executions and dead bodies in the trenches.

Bellingcat found that a fifth video [circulated online](https://x.com/TheNewsTrending/status/1827816750215496121), allegedly showing the aftermath of the attack, was actually filmed in Melgué, Mali, where [JNIM fighters are also present](https://t.me/departamente/4206).

A sixth video circulated online shows several men digging trenches, but we have so far been unable to verify its location or time.

The first video reveals the beginning of the JNIM attack, showing more than twenty motorcycles charging towards the trenches. Bellingcat geolocated this footage to the east of Barsalogho, roughly following the road from Nyanga. As they approach, some militants dismount from the motorbikes to follow on foot. The militants are heavily armed, and machine-gun fire can be heard throughout the video.

Background satellite imagery from SkySat on August 29, 2024 captured by Planet Labs PBC.*

## New Fortifications around the Town

In late 2022, satellite imagery shows the construction of trenches around the western outskirts of Barsalogho. By 2023, the fortifications had expanded into more [extensive trenches circling around the northwest side of the town](https://x.com/trbrtc/status/1828657384975192551?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828657384975192551%7Ctwgr%5E9d04080d7333ced52f84f9cb84150d8dbaf43e8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bellingcat.com%2F%3Fp%3D45950), as highlighted by New York Times investigator and former Bellingcat researcher, Christiaan Triebert.
