# **Introduction**

As the year-end is approaching, I believe all of you must be anxious about your year-end report.

The year-end report is the summary and reflection of the year's work results, and it is also the key moment to report the work achievements upwards. For such an important occasion, using data to speak has become a necessary skill for professional workplace! So, how to use data to speak?

In this article, let's talk about how to use SAP Analytics Cloud to spice up your year-end report.

## **Why use data to tell a story?**

In his book *Energy Management*, renowned psychologist Jim Lowe suggests that **instead of managing time, it's better to manage energy.** Because people's energy and attention throughout the day is something more limited than time, this is especially important for bosses who have a lot to do.

Therefore, to make your report impressive, you must make clever use of the expressive power of graphics and data.

In addition, for the year-end report will generally contain three soul questions: Were the goals set last year achieved? Was there outstanding growth this year? What are the plans for the coming year? All can be answered one by one with data.

As shown in Figure 1, we use the sales data of a fictitious company as a case study, and we can see that using data to tell a story can make the audience take in the information better than using words.

## **Use different charts for different business scenarios**

We can find many different chart types in the statistical charts of SAP Analytics Cloud Builder, each of which has different advantages.

Here, we briefly recommend some charts for year-end reporting.

### **Line Chart**

A line chart is a desirable choice when we talk about the performance and growth of the year. This is because the line chart can be used to describe the trend and direction of events.In the twists and turns of the line chart, we can find the growth points, turning points, a certain period or event in the year that led to the trend and direction of the performance.

In Figure 3, we can see that the line graph indicates that the recent sales are in an increasing upward trend.

### **Pie Charts**

When we want to know what products sold the most during the year, we can use a pie chart, which can be used to break down the contribution in specific data, as in Figure 4, which depicts the percentage contribution of four products to sales.

### **Histogram**

Bar charts are used to describe the distribution and comparison of numbers, and can especially show the superiority of data at a certain node. Using a bar chart to describe one of your outstanding results often works well.

For example, in Figure 5, which depicts the sales performance of a virtual company in 2020, we can see that the company has outstanding sales performance in May.

### **Map**

Data involving regional distribution is most intuitive with maps. There are two main forms of data visualization charts for designing maps.

* Use shades of color to show the size of the value of the regional range, such as showing the sales volume of each province and city, the distribution range of the market and other data.

* Using anchor points to show the distribution of data in the region.

Figure 6 combines the above two forms, using gradient anchor points to indicate the size of the value range of each region.
