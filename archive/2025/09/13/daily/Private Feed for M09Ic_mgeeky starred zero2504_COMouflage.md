# COM-based DLL Surrogate Injection

## Abstract

This paper analyzes a sophisticated injection technique that leverages the Component Object Model (COM) and DLL Surrogate processes for stealthy code execution. Unlike traditional COM hijacking methods focused primarily on persistence, this technique exploits the surrogate hosting capabilities to achieve process injection with several operational advantages, including parent process masquerading and reduced detection footprint.

## 1. Introduction

Component Object Model (COM) hijacking has been extensively documented as a persistence mechanism in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This paper examines the technical mechanics of COM-based DLL Surrogate injection.

## 2. Technical Background

### 2.1 What is COM?

The Component Object Model (COM) is a Microsoft technology that enables software components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to create them. COM objects are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) called Class Iden...
