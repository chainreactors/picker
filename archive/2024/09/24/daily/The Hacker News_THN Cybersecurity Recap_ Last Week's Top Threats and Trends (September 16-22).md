Hold on tight, folks, because last week's cybersecurity landscape was a rollercoaster! We witnessed everything from North Korean hackers dangling "dream jobs" to expose a new malware, to a surprising twist in the Apple vs. NSO Group saga. Even the seemingly mundane world of domain names and cloud configurations had its share of drama. Let's dive into the details and see what lessons we can glean from the past week.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Raptor Train Botnet Dismantled:** The U.S. government announced the [takedown of the Raptor Train botnet](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/new-raptor-train-iot-botnet-compromises.html) controlled by a China-linked threat actor known as Flax Typhoon. The botnet consisted of over 260,000 devices in June 2024, with victims scattered across North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, and South America. It also attributed the Flax Typhoon threat actor to a publicly-traded, Beijing-based company known as Integrity Technology Group.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Lazarus Group's New Malware:** The North Korea-linked cyber espionage group known as UNC2970 (aka TEMP.Hermit) has been observed utilizing [job-themed phishing lures](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/north-korean-hackers-target-energy-and.html) to target prospective victims in energy and aerospace verticals and infect them with a previously undocumented backdoor dubbed MISTPEN. The activity is also tracked as Operation Dream Job.
* **iServer and Ghost Dismantled:** In yet another big win for law enforcement agencies, Europol announced the [takedown of an international criminal network](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/europol-shuts-down-major-phishing.html) that leveraged a phishing platform called iServer to unlock stolen or lost mobile phones. The agency, in partnership with the Australian Federal Police (AFP), also dismantled an encrypted communications network called Ghost that enabled serious and organized crime across the world.
* **Iranian APT Acts as Initial Access Provider:** An Iranian threat actor tracked as UNC1860 is [acting as an initial access facilitator](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/iranian-apt-unc1860-linked-to-mois.html) that provides remote access to target networks by deploying various passive backdoors. This access is then leveraged by other Iranian hacking groups affiliated with the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).
* **Apple Drops Lawsuit against NSO Group:** Apple filed a motion to "voluntarily" dismiss the lawsuit it's pursuing [against Israeli commercial spyware vendor](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/apple-drops-spyware-case-against-nso.html) NSO Group, citing a shifting risk landscape that could lead to exposure of critical "threat intelligence" information. The lawsuit was filed in November 2021.
* **Phishing Attacks Exploit HTTP Headers:** A new wave of phishing attacks is [abusing refresh entries in HTTP headers](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/cybercriminals-exploit-http-headers-for.html) to deliver spoofed email login pages that are designed to harvest users' credentials. Targets of the campaigns include entities in South Korea and the U.S.

## **üì∞ Around the Cyber World**

* **Sandvine Leaves 56 "Non-democratic" Countries:** Sandvine, the company behind middleboxes that have [facilitated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-08/sandvine-s-tools-used-for-web-censoring-in-more-than-a-dozen-nations) the delivery of commercial spyware as part of highly-targeted attacks, said it has exited 32 countries and is in process of ceasing operations in another 24 countries, citing elevated threats to digital rights. Earlier this February, the company was [added](https://thehackernews.com/2024/02/president-biden-blocks-mass-transfer-of.html) to the U.S. Entity List. "The misuse of deep packet inspection technology is an international problem that threatens free and fair elections, basic human rights, and other digital freedoms we believe are inalienable," it [said](https://www.sandvine.com/press-releases/our-next-chapter-as-a-market-leader-for-technology-solutions). It did not disclose the list of countries it's exiting as part of the overhaul.
* **.mobi Domain Acquired for $20:** Researchers from watchTowr Labs [spent](https://labs.watchtowr.com/we-spent-20-to-achieve-rce-and-accidentally-became-the-admins-of-mobi/) a mere $20 to acquire a legacy WHOIS server domain associated with the .mobi top-level domain (TLD) and set up a WHOIS server on that domain. This led to the discovery that over 135,000 unique systems still queried the old WHOIS server over a five day period ending on September 4, 2024, including cybersecurity tools and mail servers for government, military and university entities. The research also [showed](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/rogue-whois-server-gives-researcher-superpowers-no-one-should-ever-have/) that the TLS/SSL process for the entire .mobi TLD had been undermined as numerous Certificate Authorities (CAs) were found to be still using the "rogue" WHOIS server to "determine the owners of a domain and where verification details should be sent." Google has since [called](https://lists.cabforum.org/pipermail/servercert-wg/2024-September/004821.html) for stopping the use of WHOIS data for TLS domain verifications.
