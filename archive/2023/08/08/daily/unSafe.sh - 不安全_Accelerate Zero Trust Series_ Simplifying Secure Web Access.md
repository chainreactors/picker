As organizations embrace having employees working from anywhere and accessing data everywhere, it's becoming increasingly important for businesses to deliver safe access to business-critical resources wherever it's being used without sacrificing performance.

### A Seven-Stage Strategy for Migrating to Security Service Edge (SSE)

[Watch the Webcast](https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/webcasts/seven-stage-strategy-migrating-security-service-edge-sse "Watch the Webcast")

The shift to remote and hybrid work has enabled businesses to adapt swiftly and ensure continuous operations in an ever-evolving landscape. However, this transformation has also exposed organizations to emerging security risks while navigating the web and using cloud applications for day-to-day work.

The need for organizations to adopt a [Zero Trust](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/zero-trust-system) model is especially important now, as employees expect to be fully productive wherever they work. It's no longer sufficient to rely on traditional perimeter-based security measures as before. However, implementing a Zero Trust model may seem daunting, and organizations may not know where to begin, particularly if they lack the necessary resources or expertise.

## Convergence of Security

One of the most effective ways to adopt a Zero Trust model is with a unified security platform that can protect against threats across different access channels. By enforcing explicit permission for web, cloud, and private apps, organizations ensure greater visibility and control for their employees accessing sensitive business resources.

In 2021, Gartner introduced the term [Security Service Edge (SSE)](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/security-service-edge-sse), describing it as a convergence of security capabilities that secure access to the web, cloud services, and private applications on a unified cloud-based service. As this security cornerstone, SSE is the security component of [Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/secure-access-service-edge-sase), which together provides both strong network and data protection.

[Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-06-21-gartner-unveils-the-top-eight-cybersecurity-predictio):

> "By 2025, 80% of enterprises will adopt a strategy to unify web, cloud services and private application access from a single vendor’s SSE platform."

For businesses, an SSE platform provides a comprehensive solution that integrates all the necessary security tools into a single, unified console, simplifying security management and reducing the complexity of managing multiple point product security solutions.

Organizations can benefit from an increase in their security posture by adopting an SSE platform and accelerate their Zero Trust journey.

## Understanding Secure Web Gateway

A [Secure Web Gateway (SWG)](https://www.forcepoint.com/product/secure-web-gateway-swg) is the web security component of a SSE platform and is a security solution that can combine URL filtering, malware detection, dynamic real-time threat analysis of websites, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) to protect users and devices from online threats. SWGs provide granular control over user and device access to web applications and services.

Whether in the office or remote, workers require secure access to websites and downloaded documents without sacrificing performance. Ensuring secure yet fast, reliable web access is essential for employees to perform their jobs effectively. Latency while browsing the web may lead to risky workarounds by workers.

A modern SWG should deliver fast, safe access to the web, enforce acceptable use policy (AUP) controls on risky websites, block uploading of sensitive data to unsanctioned websites, and stop malware from getting onto user devices without compromising usability.

Choosing the right SWG is an important decision for businesses, considering factors such as investment protection, performance, scalability, and the ability to integrate with existing apps and expand to other security tools.
