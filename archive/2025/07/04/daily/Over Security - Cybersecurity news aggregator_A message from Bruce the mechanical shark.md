[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Hi, I’m Bruce, the 25-foot mechanical star of “Jaws.”

This summer marks 50 years since my 4 minutes of screentime kept people out of the water for decades. Maybe this Fourth of July weekend you’re planning to sea-shanty your way to a special screening? If you do, here’s a little behind-the-scenes story on how my endless malfunctions almost made Spielberg hang up his director hat before you could say “phone home.”

I was built for a studio tank — a predictable and safe environment. But Spielberg, in pursuit of realism, had other plans. He threw me into the Atlantic, where the salt water, rolling waves and unruly weather conditions caused more chaos than anybody had bargained for.

Each day, my hydraulics jammed, my pneumatics corroded and my paint peeled like a sunburned tourist on Amity Beach.

There were days when the crew could only capture one or two shots before either I broke, the weather broke, or one of the actors’ egos broke. Every night they’d patch me up and whisper an assortment of four-letter words into my rusty gills.

My saving grace became Verna Fields, aka “Mother Cutter.” Spielberg’s editor was the one to suggest they only use fleeting moments of footage starring yours truly. While I bobbed around like a skydancer on a windless day, Verna worked her magic: stitching reactions, cutting away at just the right moment and building tension with empty water. She turned me from a potential failure to a legend.

And thus, I became a lesson in what happens when you build for a predictable environment but deploy in the wild. Sound familiar?

I’ve been told that readers of Talos’ Threat Source Newsletter are security folks, and I’ve been asked to write something just for you. Here it goes…

* *“You’re gonna need a bigger boat.”* Overprepare. Expect things to go wrong.
* *“It’s only an island if you look at it from the water.”* Perspective matters. Make sure your alerts are honed to spot the things that really matter.
* *“Smile, you son of a…”* Sometimes, your last line of defense is your defining moment. Should everything else fail, make sure you have something left in the tank.

In cybersecurity, your green ticked audit checklists mean nothing if you haven’t pressure-tested your environment against real red teamers. Incident response plans need ocean trials, not just bullet points.

If I have a legacy beyond people sticking their noggin in my teeth for “the gram,” it’s this: Build your defenses for salt water, not studio tanks. And remember, the mayor always wants to keep the network open...

*Editor’s note: I’d like to thank Bruce for his time and perspective, and I hope he found our studio a relaxing place to write. I’m also sorry that I only had two barrels and not the requested three for him to play with.*

*Bruce’s story is why*[*Cisco Talos Incident Response*](https://talosintelligence.com/incident_response) *exists: to help you prepare for the effects of salt water before they wreak havoc on your system. With Talos IR, you can stress test your defenses using real world scenarios and incident responders who’ve experienced just about everything there is to see.*

*Enjoy the Fourth of July weekend, and remember to listen out for the* duh dun.

## The one big thing

Cisco Talos has enhanced its email threat detection engine to address [brand impersonation tactics using PDF payloads in phishing attacks](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/pdfs-portable-documents-or-perfect-deliveries-for-phish/). These attacks often exploit popular brands to steal sensitive information, employing methods like QR code phishing and telephone-oriented attack delivery (TOAD), where victims are tricked into calling adversary-controlled phone numbers. Adobe’s e-signature service and PDF annotations have also been abused to bypass detection systems.

### Why do I care?

Phishing attacks are getting sneakier, using PDFs and trusted brands to trick people into giving up personal info or downloading malicious software. If you're not careful, you could fall for one of these scams, especially since attackers are using clever tactics like fake phone numbers or QR codes to seem legitimate.

### So now what?

Be extra cautious with emails containing PDFs, even if they look legit. Avoid scanning QR codes or calling phone numbers from unsolicited emails. Cisco’s detection tools are updated often, but staying vigilant and double-checking anything suspicious is your best defense.
