If there’s one thing that knowledge workers have learned throughout the pandemic, it’s that they can be highly productive working remotely. Employees with strong digital skills were abruptly cast out of offices and forced to work from home. Before long, many began relocating away from cities to less populated areas, or from colder regions to vacation destinations – sometimes in other countries. Unbound from the office, knowledge workers became free-range employees – and most don’t want to go back.

According to a pulse survey conducted by the [Future Forum](https://futureforum.com/2021/10/05/the-great-executive-employee-disconnect/), 76% of employees want flexibility in where they work and 93% flexibility in when they work. The desire for flexible work is strongest among women, working parents, and employees of color who have shown gains in feelings of belonging working remotely. Specifically, 81% of Black respondents say they want flexibility in where they work, compared to 75% of White respondents.

This data is in direct contrast to what most executives report that they want in post-pandemic workforce policies. Of those currently working fully remotely, nearly half of all executives surveyed (44%) want to work from the office every day, compared to 17% of employees. And 75% of these executives say they want to work from the office three to five days a week versus only 34% of employees.

So, what are companies to do? How can they make informed decisions about what’s best for leaders, for the business, and for their employees?

## Applying a Sustainability Lens to Work Location Decision

One way of looking at the issues of return to office or hybrid work is from a business [sustainability](https://news.sap.com/topics/sustainability/) perspective. For example, if forcing people back to the office will make critical employees more likely to leave their jobs, you have a real flight risk issue impacting the sustainability of your business. Your business must have enough people with the right skills at the right time to propel it forward.

Another perspective to consider is how today’s business environment has been transformed by climate change, nature loss, and more. The planet needs change, and people demand change. What if, when making decisions about who comes into the office and when, executives considered the carbon footprint generated by employee travel and commutes, weighed against the energy usage working from home, along with the sustainability causes that their employees support?

This would require implementing next-generation holistic steering and reporting that maps operational and experiential data to show progress on goals such as reducing the carbon footprint of the business. Imagine executives having climate and natural capital accounting at their fingertips, including individual and collective employee carbon footprint tracking.

This is the kind of holistic steering and reporting that groups such as the World Economic Forum (WEF) want companies to integrate into their strategic decision-making. Integrating economic, environmental, and social performance data into decisions – referred to as Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics – can help executives serve their own goals, respect their employees’ preferences for when and where they work, and contribute to reaching sustainability goals that make the world a cleaner, greener place.

## How SAP Can Help

In 2020, SAP committed to enable companies to report on the WEF’s Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. As promised, we have delivered [SAP Sustainability Control Tower](https://www.sap.com/products/sustainability-control-tower.html) to help enable holistic enterprise-wide sustainability performance management. SAP also made it easier to become a sustainable business and reduce carbon footprints with [SAP Product Footprint Management](https://www.sap.com/products/product-footprint-management.html), which can enable businesses to move toward lower carbon emissions and more sustainable operations. SAP’s data-driven approach lets businesses embed sustainability comprehensively and gain actionable insights across the entire value chain to enable companies to transition to low-carbon business processes.

Faced with an ambitious sustainability agenda and carbon-lowering targets, one SAP customer wanted to go further and consider the employee wishes for home/office work, and the carbon emissions generated from their commute to work against the energy efficiency of their home offices. The company had committed to lowering its enterprise carbon emissions and wanted a mechanism to support managers’ operational workforce planning processes.
