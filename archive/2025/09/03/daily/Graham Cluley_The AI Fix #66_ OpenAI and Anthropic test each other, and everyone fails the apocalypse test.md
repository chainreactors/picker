In episode 66 of The AI Fix, ChatGPT gives Mark and Graham a terrible lesson in anatomy, boffins at Stanford ruin sushi, Google Gemini has a self-loathing meltdown, DeepSeek gets an ‚ÄúF‚Äù in stopping existential threats to humanity, a robot doesn‚Äôt give birth, and a team of AI agents stuns our hosts with an amazing medical breakthrough.

Plus, Graham explains why the impending AI apocalypse is making him feel unusually upbeat, and Mark looks at how a highly unusual collaboration could make us all safer.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
