## My Latest Book: *Rewiring Democracy*

I am pleased to announce the imminent publication of my latest book, [*Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform our Politics, Government, and Citizenship*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/): coauthored with [Nathan Sanders](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nathan-sanders), and published by MIT Press on October 21.

*Rewiring Democracy* looks beyond common tropes like deepfakes to examine how AI technologies will affect democracy in five broad areas: politics, legislating, administration, the judiciary, and citizenship. There is a lot to unpack here, both positive and negative. We do talk about AI‚Äôs possible role in both democratic backsliding or restoring democracies, but the fundamental focus of the book is on present and future uses of AIs within functioning democracies. (And there is a lot going on, in both national and local governments around the world.) And, yes, we talk about AI-driven propaganda and artificial conversation.

Some of what we write about is happening now, but much of what we write about is speculation. In general, we take an optimistic view of AI‚Äôs capabilities. Not necessarily because we buy all the hype, but because a little optimism is necessary to discuss possible societal changes due to the technologies‚Äîand what‚Äôs really interesting are the second-order effects of the technologies. Unless you can imagine an array of possible futures, you won‚Äôt be able to steer towards the futures you want. We end on the need for [public AI](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-public-ai-can-strengthen-democracy/): AI systems that are not created by for-profit corporations for their own short-term benefit.

Honestly, this was a challenging book to write through the US presidential campaign of 2024, and then the first few months of the second Trump administration. I think we did a good job of acknowledging the realities of what is happening in the US without unduly focusing on it.

[Here‚Äôs](https://www.schneier.com/books/rewiring-democracy/) my webpage for the book, where you can read the publisher‚Äôs summary, see the table of contents, read some blurbs from early readers, and order copies from your favorite online bookstore‚Äîor signed copies directly from me. Note that I am spending the current academic year at the [Munk School](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I will be able to mail signed books right after publication on October 22, and then on November 25.

Please help me spread the word. I would like the book to make something of a splash when it‚Äôs first published.

EDITED TO ADD (9/8): You can order a signed copy [here](https://www.schneier.com/product/rewiring-democracy-hardcover/).

Bruce,

The title is: Rewiring Democracy

Probably an auto-correct tweak.
