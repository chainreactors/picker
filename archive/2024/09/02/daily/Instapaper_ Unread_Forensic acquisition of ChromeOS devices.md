# Forensic acquisition of ChromeOS devices

Sep 1, 2024

In recent years, ChromeOS has gained significant traction as a lightweight, cloud-focused operating system, particularly in educational and enterprise environments. The simplicity and security of ChromeOS make it an appealing choice for many users, but these same features pose unique challenges for forensic investigators.

Forensic acquisition of ChromeOS devices, such as Chromebooks, requires specialized knowledge and tools due to the operating system’s reliance on cloud services and its built-in security measures like disk encryption and sandboxing. Traditional forensic methods often fall short, necessitating a different approach to effectively gather and analyze data.

## 1. Understanding ChromeOS and its forensic challenges

### Overview of ChromeOS architecture

ChromeOS is a Linux-based operating system designed by Google with a primary focus on speed, simplicity, and security. Unlike traditional operating systems, ChromeOS is heavily reliant on cloud services, with most user data stored on Google’s servers rather than locally on the device.

#### Key Components of ChromeOS:

* **Cloud-Centric Storage:** User data, settings, and applications are primarily stored in the cloud, with local storage serving as a temporary cache.
* **Built-In Security Features:** ChromeOS includes several security features, such as automatic updates, sandboxing of applications, and full-disk encryption using a unique encryption key for each user.
* **Verified Boot:** ChromeOS checks the integrity of the operating system during every boot, preventing unauthorized modifications.

### Forensic Challenges with ChromeOS

The architecture and security features of ChromeOS present several challenges for forensic investigators:

1. **Data Location:** Since most data resides in the cloud, traditional disk imaging techniques that focus on local storage may miss critical information.
2. **Encryption:** ChromeOS encrypts user data by default, making it difficult to access without proper credentials.
3. **Limited Boot Options:** ChromeOS devices typically do not allow users to change the BIOS/UEFI boot order, complicating efforts to boot from an external device for data acquisition.
4. **Volatile Memory:** Acquiring volatile memory (RAM) from a ChromeOS device is challenging due to the system’s architecture and the lack of traditional forensic tools that support ChromeOS.

### Importance of Cloud Data Acquisition

Given the cloud-centric nature of ChromeOS, acquiring data from Google’s cloud services is often as important, if not more so, than acquiring data from the physical device. This can be done voluntarily by the user through services like Google Takeout or via legal processes that compel Google to provide data.

**Key Points:**

* **Google Takeout**: A service that allows users to export their data from Google services.
* **Legal Compliance**: Investigators may need to issue legal requests to Google for accessing user data stored on their servers.

## 2. Preliminary steps in Chromebook forensic acquisition

### Legal Considerations and Data Preservation

Before beginning any forensic acquisition, it’s essential to follow legal protocols to ensure that all evidence is preserved correctly and is admissible in court. This involves securing proper legal authorization, such as a search warrant, to access both the physical device and any associated cloud data.

### Tools and equipment required

Successful forensic acquisition of a ChromeOS device requires specific tools and equipment:

* **Three 32GB USB Flash Drives:** Used for creating recovery and live USB environments.
* **Large Capacity USB Hard Drive:** For storing acquired data.
* **Chrome Browser and Chromebook Recovery Utility:** Essential for creating recovery media.
* **A Special Build of Chromium OS:** Used to boot the device into a forensic-friendly environment.

### Creating essential USB drives

#### Step 1: Creating a factory ChromeOS recovery USB drive

A recovery USB drive allows you to reset a Chromebook to its factory state. While this might seem counterintuitive for forensic purposes, it is essential for understanding the device’s default configuration and for creating a clean forensic environment.

* **Instructions:**
  1. Download and install the [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/jndclpdbaamdhonoechobihbbiimdgai) on a Chrome browser.
  2. Insert a 32GB USB flash drive into your computer.
  3. Follow the prompts in the Chromebook Recovery Utility to create a recovery drive.

#### Step 2: Creating a Chromium OS Live USB

To perform forensic acquisition, you’ll need to boot the Chromebook from a live USB running a special build of Chromium OS.

* **Instructions:**
  1. Download a special build of Chromium OS from [ArnoldTheBat’s ChromiumOS Builds](https://chromium.arnoldthebat.co.uk/index.php?dir=special&order=modified&sort=desc).
  2. Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable USB drive with the downloaded image.

### Preparing for Data Acquisition

Before proceeding with the data acquisition, ensure that you have the necessary legal authority and that all tools and equipment are prepared. It’s crucial to document the entire process to maintain the chain of custody and ensure that all actions taken are legal and transparent.

## 3. Detailed acquisition procedures

### Encrypted Partition Recovery

One of the primary challenges in ChromeOS forensic acquisition is dealing with encrypted data. ChromeOS encrypts user data by default using a unique encryption key, which is stored on the device’s hardware.

#### Steps to Acquire Decrypted Data:

1. **Create an Encrypted Partition Recovery USB:** This USB drive will allow you to boot the device and access the encrypted partitions with the correct credentials.
2. **Authenticate with User Credentials:** To decrypt the data, you will need the username and password associated with the device. Without these, the data will remain inaccessible.
3. **Copy Decrypted Data:** Once authenticated, use tools like `dd` or `dcfldd` to copy the decrypted data to your forensic storage device.

### Physical Disk Cloning

Physical disk cloning involves creating an exact copy of the Chromebook’s internal storage. This is only possible in specific scenarios, such as when the device allows access to the storage media or when the encryption keys are obtainable.

#### Steps to Clone the Disk:

1. **Create a Physical Cloning USB:** This USB drive should contain a Linux-based live environment with disk cloning tools like `ddrescue` or `dcfldd`.
2. **Boot from the USB Drive:** Use the Chromium OS live USB to boot the device and access the internal storage.
3. **Clone the Disk:** Use the appropriate tool to clone the internal storage to an external drive.

### Handling encrypted data

Even after cloning the disk, the data may still be encrypted. You will need the user’s credentials or a method to extract the encryption keys from the device to access this data.

**Note:** It is essential to handle the cloned data carefully to avoid any accidental decryption attempts that could compromise the integrity of the evidence.

## 4. Working with Google Takeout and legal processes

### Voluntary Data Export via Google Takeout

In cooperative scenarios, Google Takeout is an invaluable tool that allows users to export their data from various Google services, including Gmail, Google Drive, and Chrome Sync.

#### Steps to Use Google Takeout:

1. **Access Google Takeout:** Visit [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).
2. **Select Data to Export:** Choose the services from which you want to export data.
3. **Export Data:** Google will prepare a downloadable archive of the selected data.

**Limitations of Google Takeout:**

* **User Cooperati...
