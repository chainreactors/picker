[![Malware Injected in npm Packages](data:image/png;base64... "Malware Injected in npm Packages")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtcARGJVZr-2ZdlDCqa-diQTrTsjWOALlU0S3DNGrC-S_9T3e8bltlvdTpNeLSrFm8a-XrEEf1yJ9y3phekcDAOBKcq2J1wNCH24i_r0C3hXHU_i1doGytooBQAaRYC6tto4uQpvrMsGNyGXY12h1cd0uQq1-WKUkzutA0bVF4jCJFGQsOks_FA412y8NU/s790-rw-e365/npm-malware.jpg)

Cybersecurity researchers have alerted to a supply chain attack that has targeted popular npm packages via a phishing campaign designed to steal the project maintainers' npm tokens.

The captured tokens were then used to publish malicious versions of the packages directly to the registry without any source code commits or pull requests on their respective GitHub repositories.

The list of affected packages and their rogue versions, [according](https://socket.dev/blog/npm-phishing-campaign-leads-to-prettier-tooling-packages-compromise) to Socket, is listed below -

* eslint-config-prettier (versions 8.10.1, 9.1.1, 10.1.6, and 10.1.7)
* eslint-plugin-prettier (versions 4.2.2 and 4.2.3)
* synckit (version 0.11.9)
* @pkgr/core (version 0.2.8)
* napi-postinstall (version 0.3.1)
* got-fetch (versions 5.1.11 and 5.1.12)
* is (versions 3.3.1 and 5.0.0)

"The injected code attempted to execute a DLL on Windows machines, potentially allowing remote code execution," the software supply chain security firm said.

The development comes in the aftermath of a [phishing campaign](https://socket.dev/blog/npm-phishing-email-targets-developers-with-typosquatted-domain) that has been found to send email messages impersonating npm in order to trick project maintainers into clicking on a typosquatted link ("npnjs[.]com," as opposed to "npmjs[.]com") that harvested their credentials.

The [digital missives](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/issues/339#issuecomment-3090304490), with the subject line "Please verify your email address," spoofed a legitimate email address associated with npm ("support@npmjs[.]org"), urging recipients to validate their email address by clicking on the embedded link.

The bogus landing page to which the victims are redirected to, per Socket, is a clone of the legitimate npm login page that's designed to capture their login information.

Further analysis of the malware embedded within these packages has uncovered that the DLL, dubbed Scavenger Loader, is designed to bypass detection and deliver from an external server a stealer component codenamed Scavenger Stealer that's capable of gathering sensitive data from web browsers, per researchers [Cedric Brisson](https://c-b.io/2025-07-20%2B-%2BInstall%2BLinters%2C%2BGet%2BMalware%2B-%2BDevSecOps%2BSpeedrun%2BEdition) and [Josh Reynolds](https://invokere.com/posts/2025/07/scavenger-malware-distributed-via-eslint-config-prettier-npm-package-supply-chain-compromise/).

But what makes the [attack](https://deceptiq.com/blog/from-phish-to-package-npm-supply-chain-attacks) [targeting](https://bsky.app/profile/jordan.har.band/post/3ludlbnstr22w) "is" significant is that, unlike the Scavenger malware that only affects Windows systems, the payload fitted within it is wholly written in JavaScript, meaning it can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS machines. The malicious module captures system information and environment variables, and exfiltrate the details over a WebSocket connection.

"The campaign is deploying multiple payload families to maximize reach," Socket [said](https://socket.dev/blog/npm-is-package-hijacked-in-expanding-supply-chain-attack). "The 'is' variant drops no DLL; instead, it remains entirely in JavaScript, and maintains a live command-and-control (C2) channel."

"Every message received over the socket is treated as executable JavaScript, giving the threat actor an instant, interactive remote shell. The payload executes with the same privileges as the host process, allowing unrestricted file system and network access."

Developers who use the affected packages are advised to cross-check the versions installed and rollback to a safe version. Project maintainers are recommended to turn on two-factor authentication to secure their accounts, and use scoped tokens instead of passwords for publishing packages.

"This incident shows how quickly phishing attacks on maintainers can escalate into ecosystem-wide threats," Socket said.

The findings coincide with an unrelated campaign that has flooded npm with 28 packages containing protestware functionality that can disable mouse-based interaction on websites with a Russian or Belarusian domain. They are also engineered to play the Ukrainian national anthem on a loop.

However, the attack only works when the site visitor has their browser language settings set to Russian and, in some cases, the same website is visited a second time, thereby ensuring that only repeat visitors are targeted. The activity marks an expansion of a campaign that was [first flagged](https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/weekly-recap-airline-hacks-citrix-0-day.html#:~:text=Malicious%20Python%20Package%20Shuts%20Down%20Windows%20Systems) last month.

"This protestware underscores that actions taken by developers can propagate unnoticed in nested dependencies and may take days or weeks to manifest," security researcher Olivia Brown [said](https://socket.dev/blog/protestware-update-28-npm-packages-affected-by-payload-targeting-russian-language-users).
