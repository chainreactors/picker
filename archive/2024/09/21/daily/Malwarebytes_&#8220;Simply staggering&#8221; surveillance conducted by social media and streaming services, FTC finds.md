# “Simply staggering” surveillance conducted by social media and streaming services, FTC finds

Posted: September 20, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released a [report](https://www.ftc.gov/reports/look-behind-scenes-examining-data-practices-social-media-video-streaming-services) that examines the data collection and use practices of major social media and video streaming services, finding that—and this will not come as a surprise to our regular readers—the companies engaged in vast surveillance of consumers in order to monetize their [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) while failing to adequately protect users online, especially children and teens.

The report, called [A Look Behind the Scenes: Examining the Data Practices of Social Media and Video Streaming Services](https://www.ftc.gov/reports/look-behind-scenes-examining-data-practices-social-media-video-streaming-services), is based on responses from nine companies to questions about how the companies collect, track, and use personal and demographic information, how they determine which ads and other content are shown to consumers, whether and how they apply algorithms or data analytics to personal and demographic information, and how their practices impact children and teens.

The companies that were ordered to respond own some of the household social media and streaming service names. They are Amazon ([Twitch](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/11/what-is-twitch)), Meta ([Facebook](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/facebook-scrapes-photos-of-kids-from-australian-user-profiles-to-train-its-ai) and [Instagram](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/meta-is-using-your-public-facebook-and-instagram-posts-to-train-its-ai)), [YouTube](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/03/youtube-ordered-to-reveal-the-identities-of-video-viewers), [X](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/08/x-accused-of-unlawfully-using-the-personal-data-of-more-than-60-million-users-to-train-its-ai) (Twitter), Snap ([Snapchat](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/snapchat-wants-to-put-your-ai-generated-face-in-its-ads)), ByteDance ([TikTok](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/06/tiktok-facing-fresh-lawsuit-in-us-over-childrens-privacy)), [Discord](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/billions-of-scraped-discord-messages-up-for-sale), [Reddit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/reddit-systems-compromised-by-phish-attack-heres-what-you-need-to-do-next), and [WhatsApp](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/09/critical-whatsapp-vulnerabilities-patched-check-youve-updated).

Some of the specific information that the FTC was looking for included:

* How social media and video streaming services collect, use, track, estimate, or derive personal and demographic information.
* How they determine which ads and other content are shown to consumers.
* Whether they apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information.
* How they measure, promote, and research user engagement.
* How their practices affect children and teens.

The conclusions seemed to upset the FTC, but we weren’t even mildly surprised:
