# How to protect your child’s identity

Posted: August 3, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

We all know [identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft) in adults is a serious problem, but how much do you consider your child’s identity? Identity thieves love preying on minors, simply because it usually takes longer before the theft is noticed.

Stolen identities (even children’s) can be used to:

* Apply for credit cards
* Obtain loans
* Seek benefits
* Open bank accounts

However, when it comes to children specifically, they typically don’t receive the bank statements, credit card bills, and other communications that could alert adults to suspicious financial activity. And so, child identity theft can go on for years before it is discovered.

And when it is discovered it’s often in a very annoying way. For example when the child’s first student loan application is denied.

You should never share a child’s Social Security Number ([SSN](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web)) with anyone who doesn’t have a very good reason for having it. Even those that mean well can have their data stolen at some point. Sometimes we read advice stating that you can limit the consequences by only providing the last four digits of the SSN, but you should be aware that even the “last four” can be useful to identity thieves.

When your child gets their first phone, explain to them that caller-IDs can be spoofed. And if they receive a call from someone claiming to be from banks or other trusted institutions, have them answer that this person needs to call one of the parents and hang up.

Tell your children not to give their email address to just anyone, and have them ask permission before registering for an online contest or service. Many spammers and phishers watch these groups or email lists to get new addresses.

If a site or service is covered by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), it has to get your consent before collecting [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from your child if they are under the age of 13, and it has to honor your choices about how that information is used. This is a reason why you should tell your kids never to lie about their age when they’re signing up for new accounts. The age requirements are there to protect them from online harm.

Be aware that you are a role model. Don’t spy on your children, but openly follow their social media accounts. It’s a win-win that keeps you in the loop and it makes them a bit more conscious of what they post.

Still, even if you have been careful, an identity can be stolen. More often than not identities get stolen in [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/data-breach). With most [data breaches](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach), cybercriminals want to steal names, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers. But most cybercriminals will steal any data that can be sold, used to breach other accounts, steal your identity, or make fraudulent purchases with.

## Countermeasures

You have every right to become anxious when your child starts receiving credit offers in the mail, or if you see unexpected activity on their email, phone or bank accounts. It may mean that their personal information has been compromised.

If you become aware of a...
