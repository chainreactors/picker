# AI browsers could leave users penniless: A prompt injection warning

Posted: August 25, 2025

[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-ai) ([AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet)) browsers are gaining traction, which means we may need to start worrying about the potential dangers of something called “prompt injection.”

Large language models (LLMs)—like the ones that power AI chatbots including [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security), Claude, and Gemini—are designed to follow “prompts,” which are the instructions and questions that people provide when looking up info or getting help with a topic. In a chatbot, the questions you ask the AI are the “prompts.” But AI models aren’t great at telling apart the types of commands that are meant for their eyes only (for example, hidden background rules that come directly from developers, like “[don’t write ransomware](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/will-chatgpt-write-ransomware-yes)“) from the types of requests that come from users.

To showcase the risks here, the web browser developer Brave—which has its own AI assistant called Leo—recently tested whether it could trick an AI browser into reading dangerous prompts that harm users. And what the company found caused alarm, as they wrote in a [blog this week](https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/):

> “As users grow comfortable with AI browsers and begin trusting them with sensitive data in logged in sessions—such as banking, healthcare, and other critical websites—the risks multiply. What if the model hallucinates and performs actions you didn’t request? Or worse, what if a benign-looking website or a comment left on a social media site could steal your login credentials or other sensitive data by adding invisible instructions for the AI assistant?”

Prompt injection, then, is basically a trick where someone inserts carefully crafted input in the form of an ordinary conversation or data, to nudge or outright force an AI into doing something it wasn’t meant to do.

What sets prompt injection apart from old-school [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) is that the weapon here is language, not code. Attackers don’t need to break into servers or look for traditional software bugs, they just need to be clever with words.

For an AI browser, part of the input is the content of the sites it visits. So, it’s possible to hide indirect prompt injections inside web pages by embedding malicious instructions in content that appears harmless or invisible to human users but is processed by AI browsers as part of their command context.

Now we need to define the difference between an AI browser and an agentic browser. An AI browser is any browser that uses artificial intelligence to assist users. This might mean answering questions, summarizing articles, making recommendations, or helping with searches. These tools support the user but usually need some manual guidance and still rely on the user to approve or complete tasks.

But, more recently, we are seeing the rise of agentic browsers, which are a new type of web browser powered by artificial intelligence, designed to do much more than just display websites. These browsers ...
