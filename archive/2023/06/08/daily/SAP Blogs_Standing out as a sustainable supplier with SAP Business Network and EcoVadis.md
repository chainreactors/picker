How can you differentiate your business and win sales in today’s highly competitive market? In a challenging economy, it’s not always possible to reduce prices and simply offering discounts is often not enough to attract new customers. Buying organizations are looking for suppliers who meet their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in order to ensure their own supply chain’s sustainability. With new due diligence and reporting legislation being passed globally and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products, sustainability is becoming table-stakes to play in the B2B market.

Facilitating the analysis of business' sustainability through the generation and verification of sustainability ratings, EcoVadis is the world's most trusted provider of such ratings. Global supply chains, financial institutions, and public organizations rely on EcoVadis to monitor and improve the sustainability performance of their business and trading partners.

### **Generate more B2B sales leads**

Today, with the integration of EcoVadis to SAP Business Network, suppliers can upload their sustainability rating to their Trading Partner Profile on the network. Buyers can easily search for suppliers with sustainability ratings on their profile, which will streamline their decision process and put a spotlight on sustainable suppliers. This is a quick and straightforward way for suppliers to **differentiate their brand and credibly inform** the millions of buyers on the network of their commitment to doing sustainable business. Suppliers will be able to generate more sales leads when they are discovered by buyers through the simple and intuitive search on the SAP Business Network Trading Partner Portal, while buyers will be able to simultaneously address the sustainability requirements and goals of their business.

### **Increase buyer trust**

When getting rated by EcoVadis, which can be done by first purchasing this add-on [here in the SAP Store](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000059164_live_v1/ecovadis-business-sustainability-assessments-esg-ratings-and-carbon-scorecards) and completing a questionnaire, suppliers will be evaluated in four key areas: Environment, Labor & Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement. The rating system is aligned with international ESG standards, with tailored questionnaires for every business that are customized by industry, size and country. Most importantly, EcoVadis is an evidence-based assessment with data verified by the world’s leading sustainability analysts. Used by over 100,000 companies across more than 200 industries and 175 countries, getting rated by EcoVadis is a credible way to demonstrate and improve your company’s sustainability performance and comply with ESG due diligence regulations. Paired with SAP Business Network, suppliers can display their rating to the millions of buyers on the network to **gain incredible exposure and potential leads** for their brand while **infusing trust** into buyer relationships.

### **Boost your sustainability metrics**

With these key features, suppliers can showcase their sustainability to gain new business and begin the evaluation process for continual improvement across ESG factors. In fact, over 80% of suppliers improve their scorecard performance upon their second evaluation (1). With the access to the EcoVadis Academy you receive by purchasing your rating, you can **gain more knowledge on sustainability, collaborate with customers, and better your business’ performance** with relevant and actionable e-learning courses.

### **Get rated**

Getting a sustainability rating from EcoVadis is simple to do. All it takes is to upload relevant data (documentation, metrics, etc.) related to your business’ ESG management systems. EcoVadis will then evaluate your inputs and provide you with **sustainability and carbon scorecards**. You will be given scores (1–100) across four themes, as well as guidance on strength and improvement areas. Additionally, with its built-in benchmarking functionality, you can **compare your performance** against companies in the same country, industry, or globally.

### **Add your sustainability rating to your network profile**
