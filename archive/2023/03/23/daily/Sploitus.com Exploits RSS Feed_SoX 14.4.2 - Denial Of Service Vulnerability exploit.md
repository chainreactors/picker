# Exploit Title: SoX 14.4.2 - Denial Of Service
# Exploit Author: LiquidWorm

Vendor: Chris Bagwell
Product web page: http://sox.sourceforge.net
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX
Affected version: <=14.4.2

Summary: SoX (Sound eXchange) is the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
tools: it can convert sound files between many different file formats and
audio devices, and can apply many sound effects and transformations, as well
as doing basic analysis and providing input to more capable analysis and
plotting tools.

Desc: SoX suffers from a division by zero attack when handling WAV files,
resulting in denial of service vulnerability and possibly loss of data.

Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
           Microsoft Windows 10 Home
