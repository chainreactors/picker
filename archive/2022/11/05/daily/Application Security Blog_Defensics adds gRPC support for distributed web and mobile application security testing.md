As the leading tool on the market for negative testing, Synopsys Defensics® fuzz testing currently offers over 300 test suites to ensure system security and robustness. Defensics has now expanded testing of communication protocols with support for the popular gRPC framework used in microservices, mobile, web, and IoT applications. The gRPC framework uses HTTP/2 as a transport protocol and Protobuf (protocol buffers) for its service definition. The framework offers tools for creating client and server bindings for multiple programming languages including Go, Java, C++, Python, and many others. The code bindings are automatically generated based on a Protobuf definition.

Protobuf is an open source mechanism for serializing structured data, which are defined through the use of an interface definition language (IDL). The Protobuf IDL defines message structures and the remote procedure call (RPC) services of a system. Protobuf also includes a proto compiler, which generates serialization code from Protobuf definitions. The gRPC framework serializes and deserializes data when it is sent between network nodes.

## Fuzzing gRPC

Defensics is a model-based fuzzer. A basic Defensics test suite is written on the basis of protocol specifications. In the case of gRPC though, this does not work because each system has its own definition. We know the basic encoding for the various fields, but to create effective test cases, we need to know more about the system under test.

Another problem with gRPC fuzzing is that while we can learn the protocol model and service endpoints from a Protobuf definition, we don’t know how the system under test uses the RPCs and what data is sent over the messages. We could create a test sequence for each RPC separately, but most systems have an internal state in which RPC A needs to be sent before RPC B, so the server is in the correct state to rece...
