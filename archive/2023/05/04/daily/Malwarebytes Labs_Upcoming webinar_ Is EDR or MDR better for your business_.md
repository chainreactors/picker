## Upcoming webinar: Is EDR or MDR better for your business?

May 3, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

Don’t miss our upcoming webinar on EDR vs. MDR!

In the webinar, Marcin Kleczynski, CEO and co-founder of Malwarebytes, and guest speaker Joseph Blankenship, Vice President and research director at Forrester, discuss topic such as:

* **The difference between EDR and MDR**, how EDR solutions can be challenging for businesses without dedicated security teams, and why building an in-house SOC can be expensive and difficult.
* **The limitations of Endpoint Protection and EDR**, specifically when it comes to advanced threats like ransomware that use [Living off the Land (LOTL) attacks](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/living-off-the-land-lotl-attacks-detecting-ransomware-gangs-hiding-in-plain-sight/) and [fileless malware](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/fileless-attacks-how-attackers-evade-traditional-av-and-how-to-stop-them/).
* **How MDR providers work with clients** to understand their security technology stack, make recommendations, and agree on response actions to take.
* **If EDR or MDR is better for your business** based on the resources you have available and the level of security you require.

Want to learn more about EDR and MDR and which is right for your business? Be sure to **catch the full webinar on Wednesday, May 10, 2023 at 10 am PT / 1 pm ET** and get valuable insights from industry experts on how to improve your security operations and protect against ransomware and fileless malware.
