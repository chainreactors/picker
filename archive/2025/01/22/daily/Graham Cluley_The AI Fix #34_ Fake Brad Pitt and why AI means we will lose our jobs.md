In episode 34 of The AI Fix, our hosts watch in horror as a vacuum cleaner sprouts a robotic arm and tiny little robot legs, a mind-reading helps a man chat up some French students, a robot dog runs as fast as Usain Bolt, and AI podcast hosts get impatient with their listeners. Meanwhile Graham isn‚Äôt tempted by NVIDIA‚Äôs $3000 supercomputer, and Mark explains his emergency manoeuvre for avoiding karaoke.

Graham shares a heartbreaking tale of a French woman‚Äôs encounter with someone who owns a copy of Photoshop, and Mark looks into AI‚Äôs voracious appetite for jobs.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
