# The THIRTEENTH Annual Disaster Recovery Breakfast: Changing of the Guard

* [By

What a long, strange trip it’s been over the last 3 years. In fact, the last time I saw many of you was at the last Disaster Recovery Breakfast in 2020. Within two weeks of that event, the world shut down due to COVID. Well, a lot has changed since then. DisruptOps was acquired by [Firemon](https://www.firemon.com/) in September 2021. In early 2022, Rich decided he wanted to see our cloud security vision through and dedicate his full-time efforts to the [Cloud Defense](https://www.firemon.com/products/cloud-defense/) product. In July of 2022, I decided to partner with Alan Shimel and Mitch Ashley and join [Techstrong](https://techstronggroup.com/) as head of the research business. We still do cloud security training and house our cloud security content in Securosis, but we’ve both moved on.

Our long-time venue for the DRB, Jillian’s (then TableTop Tap House) in San Fransisco, didn’t survive the pandemic. They went out of business in early 2022 and took our deposit for the 2022 DRB with them. Ouch. But given the lack of venues and the rescheduling of the RSA Conference to June 2022, we couldn’t pull off the breakfast last year.

But this year, **we are back.** But it’s different. We have a different venue, which is The Pink Elephant (142 Minna St). We have a different organizer, which is now Techstrong and our [Security Boulevard](https://securityboulevard.com/) site. We have mostly the same sponsors, so we need to thank our pals at [IANS](https://www.iansresearch.com/), [LaunchTech](http://golaunchtech.com/), and [AimPoint Group](https://aimpointgroup.com/). Their support is critical.

So yes, we’ve had a changing of the guard. But what isn’t different is breakfast. It’s still a place where you can grab some breakfast and see some friends without the pomp and circumstance of a major conference.

We hope to see you there.

Totally Transparent Research is **the embodiment of how we work at Securosis**. It’s our core operating philosophy, our research policy, and **a specific process**. We initially developed it to help maintain objectivity while producing licensed research, but its benefits extend to all aspects of our business.

Going beyond Open Source Research, and a far cry from the traditional syndicated research model, we think it’s the best way to produce independent, objective, quality research.

Here’s how it works:

* Content is developed ‘live’ on the blog. Primary research is generally released in pieces, as a series of posts, so we can digest and integrate feedback, making the end results much stronger than traditional “ivory tower” research.
* Comments are enabled for posts. All comments are kept except for spam, personal insults of a clearly inflammatory nature, and completely off-topic content that distracts from the discussion. We welcome comments critical of the work, even if somewhat insulting to the authors. Really.
* Anyone can comment, and no registration is required. Vendors or consultants with a relevant product or offering must properly identify themselves. While their comments won’t be deleted, the writer/moderator will “call out”, identify, and possibly ridicule vendors who fail to do so.
* Vendors considering licensing the content are welcome to provide feedback, but it must be posted in the comments - just like everyone else. There is no back channel influence on the research findings or posts.
  Analysts must reply to comments and defend the research position, or agree to ...
