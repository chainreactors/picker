## Sirius XM Software Vulnerability

This is [new](https://gizmodo.com/sirius-xm-bug-honda-nissan-acura-hack-1849836987):

> Newly revealed [research](https://twitter.com/samwcyo/status/1597792097175674880) shows that a number of major car brands, including Honda, Nissan, Infiniti, and Acura, were affected by a previously undisclosed security bug that would have allowed a savvy hacker to hijack vehicles and steal user data. According to researchers, the bug was in the car’s Sirius XM telematics infrastructure and would have allowed a hacker to remotely locate a vehicle, unlock and start it, flash the lights, honk the horn, pop the trunk, and access sensitive customer info like the owner’s name, phone number, address, and vehicle details.

Cars are just computers with four wheels and an engine. It’s no surprise that the software is vulnerable, and that everything is connected.

There was a podcast episode called “[The Roman Mars Mazda Virus](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-roman-mars-mazda-virus/transcript/)” (that’s the transcript link; [here’s the MP3](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-roman-mars-mazda-virus/download/)) about how the “99% Invisible” podcast could crash the in-car entertainment system in a way that was difficult to fix. It was a format string bug, of course, because of the percent sign; there was a “Mazda feed” of the podcast for a while, consisting of the same episodes with the percent sign removed.

Mazda later had [a very similar bug caused by radio broadcasts](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/radio-station-snafu-in-seattle-bricks-some-mazda-infotainment-systems/). FM radio now has some way of embedding metadata, including station logos, and a station transmitted an image whose filename had no extension. Because of that, the car was permanently locked to that station, with no volume control (though a commenter said muting still worked), till the radio unit was patched or replaced (Mazda wanted $1500, but later relented and waived the fee as a “goodwill” gesture).

The persistency of these crashes were caused by the entertainment system storing data about what people were listening to, and reloading this data on the next boot. There’s usually no easy way to wipe this private data; those who consider it a privacy invasion had better just use the analog line input.

I don’t recall anyone checking for remote exploitability of these bugs. But given the level of incompetence they demonstrate, I’d be shocked if Mazda’s systems were secure.

> Cars are just computers with four wheels and an engine.

They’re actually a network of several computers, which adds to the fun.

Neither the Twitter nor Gizmodo links will work without Javascript enabled; the latter one has no text whatsover. [Here’s a working Twitter link.](https://web.archive.org/web/20221201163429/https%3A//nitter.net/samwcyo/status/1597792097175674880) An alternate Gizmodo link would be appreciated.

@ Bruce,

> “Cars are just computers with four wheels and an engine.”

No

Computers as most people understand them in general have “no physical agency” beyond push paper out of a printer and opening a drive door.

A car is upwards of 1500lb of metal with upwards of a 100kW power generation system capable of hurling it at 100mph for hours at a time.

Few people have yet realised that their car is a “leathal weapon” run by hundreds of thousands of lines of code a sizable fraction of which can alow the car to be “taken over” by somebody who could be half way around the planet.

The worst offenders at the “wrong view” in the technical commubity who should know better are general application “software developers” deluding themselves about their capabilities.

Every day more and more “Devices with physical agency” are having code loaded that is vulnerable to outside influence in hundreds if bot thousands of ways.

At some point people are going to be hurt, maimed and killed by these “Devices with physical agency” just because some one can do so. Because someone else who realy should have known beyyer, instead thought “dancing hansters” would be “cool”.

Presumably there’s absolutely no relation with the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, and the directors need not fear being the first “up against the wall” come the revolution.

Umm – why does a car’s “telematics infrastructure” need to be able to honk the horn, flash the lights, fiddle with the locks, and pop the trunk? That seems like automation for the sake of automation (being generous), or sinister control freakery (being cynical).

I regret the passing of the days when a reasonably-competent mechanic could diagnose most car problems, and replace most parts. My first car was a Morris Minor; you could reach in and touch everything in the engine compartment, without grazing your knuckles on neighbouring components. Most of these components were user-replaceable, and many of them were user-serviceable.

This is why consumers should be able to physically disable telematics on their vehicles. Right now it’s a ‘trust the manufacturer to disable when asked’ approach.

I’m still trying to find the radio on my new Toyota, but they’ve made it exceedingly difficult to access and find.

Tesla of course, is the anthesis of this approach (and why I’ll never drive one).

Um, does this affect cars that have Sirus, but it isn’t used by the driver? Asking for a friend. Me.
