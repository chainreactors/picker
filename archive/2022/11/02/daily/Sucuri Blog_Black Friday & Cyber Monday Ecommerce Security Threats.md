![Black Friday Cyber Monday Ecommerce Threats & Malware](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blog-Post-Ecommerce-Malware-820x385.png)

Consumers spent a whopping [$35.3 billion](https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2022/Adobe-Cyber-Monday-Drove-11.3-Billion-in-Online-Spending-Breaking-E-Commerce-Record--/default.aspx) during last year’s cyber week shopping season. With Cyber Monday accounting for $11.3 billion in revenue alone, this period remains one of the biggest online shopping events of the year.

Unfortunately, hackers are making bank alongside online retailers. As we enter the holiday season, ecommerce websites are at an increased risk for security threats like skimmers, [MageCart](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-magecart/), ransomware, and phishing. Software vulnerabilities remain one of the most common threats impacting ecommerce websites — with successful exploits known to result in heavy losses for unprepared web stores and organizations.

Don’t make it a sweet Black Friday for skimmers. Here are six [ecommerce security](https://sucuri.net/ecommerce-website-security/) threats to look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

**Contents:**

* [Skimmers & MageCart](#magecart)
* [Phishing](#phishing)
* [SocGholish (Fake Browser Updates)](#socgholish-fake-browser-updates)
* [Supply Chain Attacks](#supply-chain-attacks)
* [Fake DDoS Verification Pages](#fake-ddos)
* [Software Vulnerabilities](#vulnerabilities)

## Skimmers & Magecart

[Magecart attacks](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-magecart/) are known for skimming credit card details and other sensitive information from compromised websites. Also referred to as [card skimmers](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/05/analyzing-a-woocommerce-credit-card-skimmer.html) or [credit card stealers](https://blog.sucuri.net/2019/12/the-anatomy-of-website-malware-part-2-credit-card-stealers.html), Magecart harvests and exfiltrates stolen data as it’s entered on checkout pages and payment forms.

Attacks can even steal data in real time from the purchase process — before the information has been submitted on the page. This means that if you (or any potential customers) enter personal information and credit card details on a compromised website but don’t complete the form submission, there’s still a risk that it can be stolen and harvested.

And while some variants of skimmers exist only on the [server level](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/04/pinnaclecart-server-side-skimmers-and-backdoors.html), MageCart attacks are often found as malicious JavaScript injections. According to senior malware researcher [Denis Sinegubko](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/denis), the average ecommerce web page loads over 40 scripts — adding an extra layer of complexity when keeping an eye out for indicators of compromise.

In most cases, developers and website owners *aren’t* tracking who has added new scripts or if anything has been injected onto the website. But even just a single line of code from one malicious domain is enough for an attacker to swipe the details from the checkout page.

Credit card skimmer loads an iframe from a single line of HTML.

While Magecart derives its name from credit card stealers that targeted the popular ecommerce CMS Magento, attacks have since evolved to target platforms like WordPress, OpenCart, and Prestashop. Since 2021, our data reveals that [WordPress detections have exceeded Magento](https://sucuri.net/reports/2022-hacked-website-report/) for credit card skimmers — demonstrating how effective and prevalent the malware has become.

Impacts of a Magecart attack can include:

* **Data theft.** While credit card information is the primary target for Magecart, attacks can also steal personal information.
* **Lost site revenue.** A small to medium sized webstore may experience a loss in revenue and decreased sales due to infection and damaged reputation.
* **Cross-site contamination.** Infections are known to spread [between shared server or hosting environments](https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/07/cross-site-contamination-and-how-to-prevent-i...
