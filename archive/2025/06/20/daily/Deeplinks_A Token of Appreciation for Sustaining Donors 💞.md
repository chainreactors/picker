But here's a little more background for all of you detail-oriented digital rights fans.Â [EFF's 35th Anniversary](https://www.eff.org/35)Â celebration has begun and we're commemorating three and a half decades for fighting for your privacy, security, and free expression rights online. These values are hallmarks of freedom and necessities for true democracy, and you can help protect them. It's only possible with the kindness and steadfast support from EFF members, and over 30% of them are *Sustaining Donors*: people who spread out their support with a monthly or annual automatic recurring donation.

We're saying thanks to new and upgrading Sustaining Donors by offering brand new EFF35 Challenge Coins as a literal token of thanks.Â Challenge coins follow a long tradition of offering a symbol of kinship and respect for great achievementsâ€”and we owe our strength to tech creators and users like you. EFF challenge coins are individually numbered for each supporter and [only available while supplies last](https://eff.org/r.d98c).
