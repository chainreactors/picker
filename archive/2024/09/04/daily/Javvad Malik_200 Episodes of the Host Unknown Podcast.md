What started off as a vision I had many years ago has hit a significant milestone.

The Host Unknown Podcast has somehow managed to stumble its way to 200 episodes. It’s a feat that probably a testament to the sheer stubbornness of my co-hosts [Thom Langford](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) and [Andrew Agnês](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/) – and a bit of external motivation provided by [Graham Cluley](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/).

For those of you who have been living under a rock (or perhaps just have better things to do with your time), Host Unknown is the weekly podcast that nobody asked for but everyone somehow needs. It’s a magical place where serious security topics are discussed with all the gravitas of a whoopee cushion at a funeral.

Thom Langford, a man who has been in the cybersecurity game since the days of dial-up modems and AOL CD-ROMs. Thom brings a wealth of experience to the table, and is still going strong, even if he does occasionally refer to the cloud as “those fluffy things in the sky.”

Our third wheel is Andy Agnes. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Who?” Don’t worry, you’re not alone. Andy is like the Bigfoot of the cybersecurity world—often spoken of, but rarely seen. Some say he’s a myth, a legend, a ghost in the machine. Others claim he’s just really bad at remembering to unmute himself on Zoom calls. Either way, Andy’s contributions to the podcast are as mysterious as they are sporadic.

And while I try to remain the voice of reason, the beacon of wisdom, the… OK, OK, I’ll stop. But seriously, someone has to keep these two in check, and I’ve taken on that burden with all the enthusiasm of a kid eating broccoli.

But putting all jokes aside, it’s a bit more than a podcast. It’s the chance for me to catch up with my friends. I’m also grateful to our listeners who occasionally give us feedback to let us know they are there.

Here’s to another 200 episodes of laughter, banter, and the occasional moment of actual insight.
