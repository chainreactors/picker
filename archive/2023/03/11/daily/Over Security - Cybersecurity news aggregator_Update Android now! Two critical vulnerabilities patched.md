# Update Android now! Two critical vulnerabilities patched

Posted: March 9, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The March security updates for [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) include fixes for two critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities impacting Android systems running versions 11, 12, 12L, and 13. Users should update as soon as they can.

The [March 2023 Android Security Bulletin](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-03-01) contains the details of the security vulnerabilities affecting [Android devices](https://www.malwarebytes.com/android-antivirus). Security patch levels of 2023-03-05 or later address all of these issues.

That means, if your Android phone is at patch level 2023-03-05 or later then the issues discussed below have been fixed. The updates have been made available for Android 11, 12, and 13.

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before publication. However, [this doesn’t always mean that the patches are available for devices from all vendors](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/11/android-users-are-facing-a-double-patch-gap).

You can find your Android’s version number, security update level, and Google Play system level in your Settings app. You’ll get notifications when updates are available for you, but you can also check for updates.

For most phones it works like this: Under **About phone** or **About device** you can tap on **Software updates** to check if there are new updates available for your device, although there may be slight differences based on the brand, type, and Android version of your device.

## Vulnerabilities

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. The CVEs that deal with RCE vulnerabilities which were patched in these updates are:

[CVE-2023-20951](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20951) and [CVE-2023-20954](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20954): both are critical RCE vulnerabilities in the System component. The most severe vulnerability could lead to remote code execution with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.

[CVE-2022-33213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33213) and [CVE-2022-33256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-33256) are vulnerabilities in Qualcomm closed-source components that could allow for remote code execution. CVE-2022-33213 is a memory corruption vulnerability in [a modem](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-is-a-modem) due to buffer overflow while processing a PPP packet. And CVE-2022-33256 is a memory corruption vulnerability due to the improper validation of an array index in a Multi-mode call processor.

Google only sparingly gives out details about vulnerabilities, so everyone gets a chance to patch before cybercriminals can start abusing the vulnerabilities in attacks. But there are some pointers in the descriptions of the vulnerabilities.

Memory corruption vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that may occur in a computer system when its memory is altered without an explicit assignment. The contents of a memory location are modified due to programming errors which enable attackers to execute arbitrary co...
