![Understanding CSRF](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Understanding-CSRF-820x386.png)

Cross-Site Request Forgery, often called CSRF (or its other nicknames, Session Riding and XSRF), is a tricky type of attack. In short, it lets attackers make users do things on websites without their consent or knowledge. This attack works by misusing the trust a web application puts in a user’s browser once they’re logged in. By duping the browser into sending fake requests (usually through shady emails or misleading links), CSRF allows unauthorized commands to hit a website. And since these requests seem to come from a legitimate, logged-in user, the website has a hard time spotting the fakes, which can open the door to significant security problems.

Below we’ll cover how these attacks happen, their impact, and proven methods to keep your web apps secure.

## How Does Cross-Site Request Forgery Work Its Magic?

So, how does a CSRF attack actually pull it off? Well, three things usually need to be in place. First, the attacker needs to target an action that can be done with a simple web request – think things like changing account details or admin settings. Second, the website has to rely only on session cookies to know who’s making the request, without any extra checks. Third, the attacker needs to be able to guess what the mischievous request should look like. Then, if all these pieces fit, the attacker just has to get that bogus request (often hidden in a link or some web content) over to the victim’s browser so it can do the dirty work.

## Here’s a CSRF Attack in Action (An Example)

Let’s say you get an email that looks like it’s from customs, saying a package for you is stuck and you need to click a link to sort it out. You click, and it takes you to a website you commonly use, maybe even your own. Everything seems fine on the surface. But, what if a part of that website, like a plugin you installed, has a CSRF weakness?

For example, imagine a music plugin that doesn’t properly check who’s allowed to change its settings. An attacker could create a special link, something like **`www.yourwebsite[.]com/music/settings?default_user=admin&anyonecanregister`**. If an admin of your site clicks that link while they’re logged in, it could quietly change the settings to let anyone sign up as an admin! The attacker would hide this link in that fake customs email. The admin clicks, and bam – they’ve unknowingly given the attacker control. This really shows why good security, like using CSRF tokens and checking where requests come from, is a big deal. And remember, CSRF isn’t about cookies alone; it can pop up anywhere an app automatically trusts user credentials.

## CSRF vs. XSS: What’s the Difference?

It’s easy to mix up CSRF with another common threat, [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-cross-site-scripting/), since both try to run bad code during your web session. But they go about it differently. XSS is all about sneaking harmful scripts right onto a web page you’re looking at. That script then runs in your browser as if it’s part of the site, potentially letting attackers grab whatever’s on the page, even anti-CSRF tokens.

CSRF, on the other hand, plays on the trust between your browser and a website. It usually involves tricking users into making their browser send a fake request to a site they’re logged into. This request often comes from a dodgy page or link the attacker controls. A key difference? With CSRF, the attacker usually doesn’t get to see what the website sends back. But here’s a kicker: if a site has an XSS problem, even good CSRF protection might not be enough because XSS could swipe that anti-CSRF token.

## The Damage of a CSRF Attack

When a CSRF attack hits the mark, it can cause a lot of trouble for everyone involved, from businesses to everyday users. We’re talking about things like money being moved without permission, passwords getting changed (which can mean accounts get hijacked), and private data, even session cookies, being stolen. Attackers usually pull this off by luring people to a harmful page or getting them to click a specially made link that takes advantage of a weak spot on the target website. This click sends requests through the user’s browser, and becaus...
