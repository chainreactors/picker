# Streameast Reclaimed Domain Name Previously Seized By the U.S. Government

Pirate sports streaming site Streameast has quietly reclaimed one of the domain names the U.S. authorities seized last year. No legal battle was required, as the U.S. government apparently let the domain expire. The quiet re-registration of Streameast.xyz marks a major symbolic win for the site, which continues to challenge the authorities who tried to shut it down.

In some cases, domains are seized as part of a criminal prosecution. [Megaupload.com](https://torrentfreak.com/tag/megaupload/), for example, was taken down thirteen years ago and remains under the control of the United States which renews its registration annually.

Not all seizures are treated equally, however. In some cases, domains are simply let back into the system after they expire, allowing anyone with an interest in the brand to pick them up relatively cheaply. Domain squatters pick up some, while others simply end up in the hands of ‘pirates’ once again.

## U.S. Seized Streameast Domains

Earlier in September, there was much ado about the takedown of what was reportedly the largest pirate sports streaming network. The [Streameast operation](https://torrentfreak.com/ace-shuts-down-giant-streameast-piracy-ring-but-the-original-survives-250903/) did not involve the U.S. government, nor was it targeted at the original Streameast, but it was a massive victory nonetheless.

The original Streameast has not been spared legal trouble either. In fact, its domain names were [seized by U.S. authorities last year](https://torrentfreak.com/feds-seize-domain-names-of-sports-streaming-site-streameast-240819/). While the site swiftly moved to new domains, the old ones were pointing to a seizure banner.

“It is unlawful to reproduce or distribute copyrighted material including sporting events, television shows, movies, music, software, or games without authorization. Individuals who do so risk criminal prosecution under Title 18,” the banner explained.

The seizures were backed up by a warrant obtained in August 2024 at a Louisiana federal court, targeting Thestreameast.to, Streameast.io, Streameast.live, Streameast.xyz, Thestreameast.io, and Thestreameast.xyz.

## Streameast ‘Reclaims’ Streameast.xyz

Today, some of these seized domains continue to point to the original warning banner but it appears that the U.S. authorities no longer control all of them.

While researching both old and newly-seized Streameast domains recently, we noticed that Streameast.xyz expired earlier this year. Apparently, it was not renewed by those who controlled it, as the seizure banner was gone.

Instead, the domain appeared to have been reclaimed by the original Streameast team. While it is not listed as an official mirror site, Streameast.xyz points to content from the original site once again. And indeed, the original Streameast team confirms that the domain is theirs.

*Streameast.xyz*

It is not clear why the U.S. authorities lost control of the domain or whether it was intentional. Other domain names covered by the same seizure warrant were renewed recently, including Streameast.io.

The Streameast team might view this as a significant symbolic victory. After all, they effectively reclaimed a federally seized domain name without having to mount a legal challenge.

In the grander scheme, one domain name is not going to make a massive difference. However, the U.S. government went through the trouble to obtain a federal warrant, so it’s ironic to see it controlled by pirates once again.
