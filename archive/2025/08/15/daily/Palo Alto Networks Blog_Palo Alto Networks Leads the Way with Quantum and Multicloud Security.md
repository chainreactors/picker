As leaders in cybersecurity, we operate at the forefront of digital transformation. I speak with executives and security practitioners every day, and I hear a consistent theme: How do we stay ahead of adversaries who now move faster than ever, without adding more tools and complexity? Our customers are tasked with preparing for the quantum revolution, while also expanding their digital estate that spans multiple clouds, supports a hybrid workforce and rapidly adopts artificial intelligence. And they do all this while facing threat actors operating at unprecedented scale, speed and sophistication.

That’s why we’re excited to introduce **PAN-OS® 12.1 Orion**, which has been engineered to make network security smarter, more predictable and more resilient. It’s built to address the challenges facing modern organizations by providing a robust foundation that enables IT leaders to confidently embrace the future of multicloud, AI, quantum and beyond.

## Demystifying the Quantum Future Is Your First Step to Readiness

Nearly every leader I speak to is concerned about quantum risk, because, at some point in the next few years, quantum computers will be powerful enough to break the encryption that currently protects virtually all of today’s digital communications. The threat of quantum computing may seem distant, but organizations must recognize that the time to act is now. Becoming quantum-safe is a multi-year journey, and taking the first step today is critical to staying ahead of tomorrow’s threats.

PAN-OS 12.1 Orion is designed to provide an easy path to quantum-safe security. It enables you to wrap your arms around the problem by conducting a comprehensive Quantum Readiness assessment, giving you an inventory of cryptography usage across your entire enterprise. This assessment identifies where you are and where you are not compliant with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, giving you the visibility needed for effective planning.

For legacy applications that can't be immediately upgraded or don’t natively support PQC, this release introduces the industry’s first cipher translation, which instantly upgrades any application to be quantum safe. And when you’re ready to take the next step toward becoming quantum-safe, our new fifth-generation quantum-optimized NGFWs are built to decrypt and inspect PQC-encrypted traffic at scale.

## Unified Network Security to Accelerate Multicloud and AI Transformation

Enterprises are scaling cloud and AI initiatives to drive innovation and growth, but fragmented security tools and inconsistent controls increase operational overhead and expose critical assets to risk. Security teams are burdened with operational complexity, struggling to maintain visibility, enforcing consistent policies, as well as protecting dynamic workloads at the speed of business.

PAN-OS 12.1 Orion was built to tackle these challenges head-on. It simplifies multi-cloud security by continuously assessing every cloud and AI asset for risks from weak or missing security controls. It automatically deploys and redirects traffic to best-of-breed network and AI security, builds a complete multi-cloud security fabric, and it applies microperimeters to contain lateral threat movement. Finally, the entire security fabric scales automatically, providing constant protection and performance. This is the industry’s only network security platform that automatically discovers, deploys and scales security for today’s dynamic multi-cloud and AI environments.

Enterprises can confidently scale their multicloud and AI initiatives with a unified network security foundation that evolves with them, delivering consistent visibility with control and protection at every stage of their journey:

* **Discover Assets Instantly –** Automatically discover and map workloads, applications, AI assets and data flows across every cloud, eliminating blind spots and manual inventories for complete, real-time visibility.
* **Assess Risk in Real Time –** Continuously detect misconfigurations and exposures as they emerge, delivering actionable insights so teams can prioritize and fix issues without manual investigations.
* **Deploy Protection in One Click –** Instantly deploy a multicloud security fabric and firewalls across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, as well as hybrid environments, automating protection deployment with scalable coverage for dynamic workloads.
* **Operationalize from One Console –** From its unified, NOC-style command center, Strata Cloud Manager delivers the centralized visibility to manage policy enforcement, control east-west traffic with microperimeters, and scale security on demand, streamlining incident response and compliance.

##### Start your multicloud and AI transformation with the  [Cloud Network and AI Risk Assessment (CLARA)](/network-security/cloud-and-ai-risk-assessment).

Scott Moser, SVP, Chief Information Security Officer, Sabre, said:

> Our vision at Sabre is to power the global travel industry by providing innovative software and technology solutions, and we can't be distracted or slowed down by cyber threats. With the threat landscape being radically changed by AI-powered attackers, complex global architectures, and the huge shifts coming with quantum computing, we need a cybersecurity partner with a powerful vision and a proven ability to execute. The introduction of PAN-OS 12.1 Orion is just another milestone that proves why Palo Alto Networks is our partner of choice for cybersecurity.

## Proactive Security Starts with the Power of Precision AI

At the forefront of our AI strategy is innovation. We’re using [Precision AI](/resources/ebooks/strata-revolutionize-your-security-posture-with-cloud-delivered-security-services-powered-by-precision-AI)®, our proprietary system that leverages the capabilities of machine learning, deep learning, as well as generative AI, to augment your expertise and help you build a more proactive infrastructure. Precision AI continuously analyzes vast amounts of data in real time to anticipate threats and automate defenses, freeing your teams to focus on strategic initiatives. It enables proactive risk mitigation, addressing security gaps before attacks start. Precision AI provides real-time detection and prevention using AI to fight AI, automatically defeating attacks.

Because our commitment to innovation never stops, PAN-OS ...
