# ‘Historic Decision’ to Imprison Pirate IPTV User Smells of Propaganda

Greece is buzzing with news of a historic, landmark decision by a local court, to imprison a person for five months for subscribing to a pirate IPTV service. The news warrants an informed conversation about creators' rights and how the judicial system has sharpened its response to piracy. However, until evidence is produced to the contrary, the story should be stamped "propaganda" and noted for an offense of its own: a distraction from genuine progress in the fight against piracy.

After investing huge resources into tackling pirate IPTV platforms as significant as the one [reportedly taken down last week](https://torrentfreak.com/e3bn-pirate-iptv-network-serving-22m-users-dismantled-in-massive-operation-241127/), a little stagecraft should be as expected when authorities and rightsholders declare victory.

Information suggests that the blackout impacted supply across Europe and beyond, so a small amount of window-dressing on the number of users affected and profits generated don’t really have a misleading impact. There’s no denying the importance of the operation either; a lot of information was shared by the authorities and while difficult to confirm, in general most things felt coherent and unforced.

As previously highlighted, negatives related to these types of operations usually receive no mention, even when so serious that they [completely undermine statements](https://torrentfreak.com/dash-the-iranian-busted-pirate-iptv-kingpin-allegedly-owns-rapidiptv-220828/) made [just hours previously](https://torrentfreak.com/police-shut-down-pirate-iptv-operation-with-2-million-subscribers-200610/).

There’s nothing like that following last week’s operation, but it will be a serious concern that end-users whose providers relied on those streams were mostly without service for just 48/72 hours, several sources suggest.

Clearly, users of these services need to be dissuaded.

## The Importance of User Attitudes

There are well-publicized efforts to convince users of pirate services that they’re incurring various risks, up to and including being sent to prison.

In Greece right now there are hundreds of news articles (unrelated to the events of last week) reporting on a “landmark” and/or “historic” decision by a local court to send a pirate IPTV ***subscriber*** to prison for five months. We reviewed a total of 62 of these articles and selected two for illustration purposes within this article *(translated from Greek)*.

![greek-iptv-1](https://torrentfreak.com/images/greek-iptv-1.png)

Leaving aside that a casual reader might believe the sentence was connected to events last week ([zero action reported in Greece](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/european-law-enforcement-stops-illegal-iptv-service-providers#:~:text=270%20IPTV%20equipment%2Fdevices%20seized,EUR%2040%2C000%20in%20cash%20seized) by Europol), the article is consistent with the majority of dozens of others in claiming a “historical precedent” (first time a user has received a custodial sentence), a “significant shift” in judicial attitudes, and interestingly “a return to the rule of law.”

## Common Details in the Majority of Articles

There appears to be no question that the defendant was indeed a pirate IPTV subscriber, but pleading not guilty with the defense outlined below seems quite the long shot. There seems no reasonable basis to criticize the Court’s conclusion that the defense lacked credibility, at least how the case is being reported.

![greek-iptv-2](https://torrentfreak.com/images/greek-iptv-2.png)

“The judges concluded that the consequences of piracy cannot be considered ‘minor,’ given the enormous damage it causes on multiple levels,” a [report](https://www.skai.gr/news/greece/peirateia-stin-tv-katadiki-xristi-se-fylakisi-stin-ellada-gia-proti-fora) from Skair.gr reads.

The Skai article is cited on many occasions as the source of this news, likewise a [video news report](https://www.alphatv.gr/news/koinonia/article/181283/peirateia-sundromitikis-tileorasis-proti-poini-fulakisis-gia-hristi-stin-ellada/) from Alpha TV.

## Effectively The Same Source For All Articles

Skai, AlphaTV news, and the majority of publications citing these outlets as a source, state that the trial judges rejected the notion that the defendant’s viewing of pirate IPTV streams was anything other than a serious matter.

“According to the evidence presented at the trial, pay-TV piracy causes serious economic and social consequences, such as revenue losses for the Greek State from the non-collection of VAT and tax revenues and the parallel circulation of ‘black money’,” Skai reports.

“It causes damage to Greek society from the loss of jobs and the non-payment of remuneration to creators. And it increases crime as pirate organizations have a clear criminal organization structure with a multitude of parallel criminal crimes. And finally, piracy causes financial disaster for providers from revenue losses and degradation of the quality of services.”

These talking points are well-worn industry standards across the world. The articles state that these claims were provided in evidence, so these aren’t necessarily the words of any or all of the three judges. Yet this is where things start to get interesting.

## The Important Details Are Those That Didn’t Get Reported

Let’s start with the basics that any journalist would include in the most mundane of reports. Despite being central to the entire ‘historic decision’ the defendant almost seems irrelevant.

Privacy issues surrounding real names aside, there is no indication whether the defendant is a 29-year-old man from the Athens area, or a grandmother in her sixties from Thessaloniki. Since this was a criminal case, details such as when the investigation began or even when the person was arrested and what for – nada, nothing.

And there’s the Court where the historic decision was handed down, the Athens Court of Appeals for Misdemeanors. If we assume that having “Court of Appeals” in the title means what it says, logically this can’t be the first trial. So when was the first trial, what were the allegations, in which court did it take place, and what was the outcome?

For that matter, on what basis was there an appeal? Did the defendant get found not guilty? If so, when was the announcement and if not, why wasn’t there an announcement in the interests of balanced reporting?

Given the industry standard evidence in respect of the damage caused by IPTV, it should be safe to assume there is an injured party, such as a broadcaster or similar rightsholder.

Who is that party or parties?

Perhaps more to the point, why isn’t that party and all the other major rightsholders in Greece, a...
