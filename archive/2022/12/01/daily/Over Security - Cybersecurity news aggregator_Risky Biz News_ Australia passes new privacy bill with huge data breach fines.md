Following a string of high-profile security breaches at Australian companies such as [Optus](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-63056838), [Telstra](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7928324/telstra-staff-have-details-hacked/), [Medibank](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/21/medibank-hack-explained-what-do-we-know-about-the-data-breach-and-who-is-at-risk), [Woolworths](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-15/woolworths-mydeal-cyber-attack-hack-information-leaked/101539686), and [EnergyAustralia](https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/energyaustralia-portal-compromised%2C-details-of-323-customers-leaked.html), both houses of the Australian Parliament [passed](https://ministers.ag.gov.au/media-centre/parliament-approves-governments-privacy-penalty-bill-28-11-2022) a new privacy bill on Monday.

Called the [Privacy Legislation Amendment (Enforcement and Other Measures) Bill 2022](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/PrivacyEnforcement2022), the new regulation grants the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) the power to crack down on companies that ignore security best practices and expose their customers' data through cybersecurity breaches.

Under the new bill, companies that fail to safeguard user data face fines of up to AUS$50 million, or 30% of the company's adjusted turnover, whichever is higher—a significant increase from the current AUS$2.22 million fine they stood to receive for any security breaches.

The bill is an update to Australia's existing Privacy Act 1988 regulation and has been met with positive feedback from Australian cybersecurity experts, who view it as a good incentive to get local companies to pay more attention to the state of their IT systems. [Not all](https://www.innovationaus.com/unworkable-data-breach-laws-pass-parliament/), though.

The new bill is also part of a government-wide push to bolster Australia's national cybersecurity posture, which recent attacks have exposed to be insufficient, even if a recent academic study ranked Australia at the top in terms of "[cyber defense](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/15/1063189/the-cyber-defense-index-2022-23/)."

The Australian privacy watchdog welcomed the bill's passing in a [press release](https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/oaic-welcomes-passing-of-privacy-bill) and called it "an important opportunity" to secure the Australian economy.

The bill will become law and replace Australia's Privacy Act 1988 after it receives royal assent in the coming weeks. According to the bill's text, its provision and fines also apply to any foreign company carrying business in Australia, even if they are domiciled overseas. Australia previously tried to revamp and update its privacy laws in 2020, but that legislative effort got bogged down in political swamps.

### Breaches and hacks

**Vanuatu ransomware attack:** Almost a month after a [ransomware attack](https://www.wionews.com/world/vanuatu-island-hit-by-ransom-attack-cripples-government-535355) that crippled its IT network, the government of the small Pacific island of Vanuatu has yet to recover from the incident. [ABC News reports](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-29/cyber-hack-cripples-vanuatu-public-sector/101705322) that government workers are using their personal email services and hotspots to conduct government business and that local hospitals are still limited to using pen and paper. The Australian government is currently helping Vanuatu rebuild its IT network following the attack.

**Local IKEA incidents:** Swedish furniture retailer [IKEA confirmed](https://therecord.media/ikea-investigating-cyberattacks-on-outlets-in-kuwait-morocco/) that its local franchises in Kuwait and Morocco are dealing with a cyber-attack. The company confirmed the incident after data from both franchise chains was [published](https://twitter.com/AlvieriD/status/1597043395410526208) on the leak site of the Vice Society ransomware and data extortion group.

**New REvil leaks:** The REvil ransomware group has added two new companies on its dark web data leak portal, a US school district and a major services provider for the US healthcare sector. Two two updates are of note because they come after a period of two weeks of inactivity, following REvil's high-profile leak of Medibank patient data. The leak of Medibank patient information prompted the Australian government to issue [a threat of repercussions and offensive operations](https://riskybiznews.substack.com/p/risky-biz-news-australia-to-hack) against cybercrime groups. It remains to be seen if the new leaks will trigger a response from the ASD or if the Australian agency will be contempt to sit on its possible offensive operations until another ransomware gang hits an Australian entity.

### General tech and privacy

**Facebook fined €265 million:** Ireland's data protection agency [fined](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-in-facebook-data-scraping-inquiry) Meta €265 million in connection to the company's April 2021 data breach. The Irish Data Protection Commission said that Meta failed to safeguard its Facebook platform from data scraping, which allowed a threat actor to compile details on more than 530 million Facebook users. This data was later sold on an underground cybercrime forum. Responding to the fine, Facebook told [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/28/facebook-gdpr-penalty/) that they have since rolled out protections to detect scraping operations. With this fine, the Irish data protection agency has fined all of Meta's three main platforms after it also [fined Instagram €405 million](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-instagram-inquiry) in ...
