ANY.RYN x IBM QRadar SIEM: Real-Time Intelligence for Wider Threat Coverage

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_ibmqradar&utm_term=090925&utm_content=linktolanding)’s Threat Intelligence Feeds are designed to power SOAR, SIEM, EDR/XDR, TIP, and other security systems. Our goal is simple: to fit naturally into a customer’s security ecosystem so analysts can investigate incidents faster, improve detection quality, and spend less time on repetitive tasks.

Now, IBM QRadar SIEM users can directly consolidate ANY.RUN’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://any.run/threat-intelligence-feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_ibmqradar&utm_term=090925&utm_content=linktotifeeds) to strengthen detection and triage capabilities — all from a single console.

## IBM Qradar and TI Feeds Connector Effects: Visible on Metrics

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-02-at-11.00.33-2-1024x391.png)

[IBM QRadar SIEM](https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem) is a leading Security Information and Event Management solution that centralizes visibility across IT infrastructure, enables real-time threat detection through log and flow analysis, and incorporates advanced analytics like AI and user behavior monitoring.

The [integration with TI Feeds](https://apps.xforce.ibmcloud.com/extension/85034cf13916e0512bcd1b65061fd134) helps teams using QRadar SIEM boost their security with high-quality threat intelligence. They deliver malicious IPs, domains, URLs extracted from live sandbox analyses of the latest threats hitting 15,000+ organizations worldwide. Unlike post-incident reports that lag behind, our feeds update in real time sending active attack indicators straight to clients.

* **Expanded Threat Coverage**

Automatically correlate logs and events with the latest IOCs to spot the latest threats, reduce mean time to detect/respond (MTTD/MTTR), and lower analyst burnout.

* **Early Threat Detection**

Identify threats earlier in the kill chain to stop and mitigate attacks before they impact business operations

* **Enhanced Team Productivity**

Automated correlation reduces manual research time, allowing analysts to focus on investigation and response rather than IOC verification and threat hunting.

* **Measurable ROI**

Faster threat detection translates directly to reduced potential damage from security incidents, while improved analyst efficiency lowers operational costs.

API, SDK, and STIX/TAXII formats are supported to seamlessly bring the feeds into your existing architecture. No redesigning workflows, no extra costs.

## Benefits for Security Teams

For SOC level 1-2 analysts, the IBM-ANY.RUN connection fuels:

* **Automated Threat Detection**: When network logs or infrastructure data collected by QRadar match ANY.RUN’s IOCs, correlation rules automatically generate high-priority alerts. This eliminates manual IOC checking and accelerates initial triage.

* **Contextual Investigation**: ANY.RUN’s approach to extracting IOCs directly from malware configurations and network traffic provides organizations with indicators that might not be detected through other means, giving analysts deeper insight into threat behavior and campaign attribution.

* **Reduced Alert Fatigue**: With nearly 100% malicious indicators, analysts can trust that ANY.RUN-sourced alerts represent genuine threats requiring immediate attention, improving focus and reducing investigation overhead.
