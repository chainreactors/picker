# The Risks of Non-Compliant Email: How HIPAA Violations Hurt Healthcare Companies

February 3rd, 2025

In today’s increasingly digitized healthcare landscape, email is an essential tool for communication between providers, patients, and other key stakeholders. However, non-compliance with HIPAA standards for email can have devastating consequences.

From hefty fines to eroded patient trust, the risks of non-compliance with HIPAA regulations, for healthcare organizations of all sizes are considerable. Understanding what constitutes HIPAA-compliant email communication and how to best protect sensitive patient data are crucial to mitigating these risks.

With this in mind, this post details the risk of non-compliant email, the security measures required by HIPAA regulations, and essential strategies for securing protected health information (PHI) and ensuring compliance.

### **What Are The Risks of Non-Compliant Email?**

Let’s begin by detailing the consequences of non-compliance with HIPAA regulations

**Data Breaches**: while not a direct consequence of non-compliance, by failing to implement the security measures mandated by HIPAA, you increase the risk of falling victim to a data breach by malicious actors. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive patient data – leading to the additional consequences of non-compliance outlined below.

**Operational Issues:** a data breach will negatively impact an organization’s regular operations: exhausting manpower, resources, and attention until it’s contained – *and* the resulting fallout is managed. At worst, this can demand a lot of a company’s time and resources, for an extended period, affecting their ability to deliver their products and services.

Unfortunately, when it comes to patients’ healthcare, this can have devastating ripple effects, e.g., an individual not being able to acquire a required prescription or medical device in a timely fashion.

**Financial Penalties**: Non-compliance with HIPAA or other privacy laws can result in hefty fines, compensation from resulting lawsuits, and, in some cases, financial penalties from the state in which the healthcare organization is based.

**Reputation Damage**: Mishandling sensitive data can lead to a loss of credibility – erode patient trust and harm the organization’s hard-earned public image and industry standing. As we’ll see later in this post, the larger the healthcare organization, the bigger the story and the more significant the potential fallout.

### **What Does HIPAA-Compliant Email Require?**

So, now we’ve covered the consequences of not adhering to HIPAA standards, how can organizations avoid them and achieve compliance. Let’s explore the critical components of HIPAA-compliant email.

* **Encryption**The HIPAA Security Rule mandates encryption of email data both in transit, when being sent to recipients,  and at rest, where it is stored. This means that emails containing PHI must be scrambled into an unreadable format, ensuring they are only accessible to authorized recipients – even in the event they’re intercepted by cybercriminals. Advanced encryption protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), and measures, such as end-to-end and flexible encryption, ensure the secure exchange of sensitive patient data between servers.
* **Access Control**
  Just because a healthcare organization has access to a patient’s sensitive data, that certainly doesn’t mean that *any* employee should be able to access said data – quite the opposite, in fact. Consequently, healthcare organizations must implement access control measures to ensure that only those authorized to handle PHI within your organization have access to it.A prominent example of this is role-based access control (RBAC), by which employees are granted access privileges according to their job role and the extent to which they need to deal with patient data. For example, an employee in a healthcare provider’s billing department will need access to PHI, to include it in email communications with patients.
* **User Authentication**In addition to limiting access to the appropriate employees, it’s critical that personnel are who they claim, or present themselves, to be when logging into your company’s network – so you must also implement strong user authentication measures.

Common ways of authenticating users include unique usernames, strong passwords, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) – where users have to prove their identity in more than one way (e.g., a one-time password (OTP) or biometric scan).  This is a growing cybersecurity requirement that’s increasingly essential for preventing unauthorized access from cybercriminals who are looking to access PHI by impersonating the employees of healthcare companies.

* **Automatic Session Timeout**
  Another simple, yet effective mitigation measure against unauthorized access is the inclusion of a built-in session timeout feature. This will cause an application to automatically log a user out after a set period of inactivity, reducing the risk of session jacking and other methods of unauthorized access.
* **Audit Logs**
  Another key aspect of HIPAA compliance is for a healthcare organization to maintain detailed logs of email activity. This involves continually recording information that includes who accessed the data, at which time, and, how it has been modified in any way. As well as helping with compliance, audit logs make it easier to locate and contain breaches – in addition to highlighting how and where an organization must strengthen its cybersecurity posture.
* **Business Associate Agreements (BAA)**:
  If you use a third-party email provider to transmit PHI, you must have a BAA in place to avoid the risks of HIPAA non-compliance. A BAA details the respective responsibilities of both the healthcare company and the email provider in protecting patient data, which holds both parties accountable.

#### **Real-World Consequences of Non-Compliant Email**

Now that we’ve explored the consequences of email non-compliance, as well as what a healthcare organization must do to adhere to HIPAA regulations, let’s briefly look at a couple of recent real-life examples

**Example of a Large-Scale Breach**

In 2023, a leading U.S. hospital system exposed over 3 million patient records due to unencrypted emails containing PHI. Not only was the healthcare organization fined “.25 million, but it also faced class-action lawsuits and a severe blow to its reputation.

**Example of a Data Breach Suffered by a Smaller Healthcare Company**

Alarmingly, as cybercriminals grow in numbers and capability, smaller healthcare organizations are under threat from cyber attacks and the resulting exposure of PHI. Again, in 2023, a small healthcare provider in California suffered a data breach compromising sensitive patient data, including names, Social Security numbers, health insurance details, and medical records. The breach led to a class-action lawsuit and subsequent settlement, allowing affected patients to claim up to $8,050 in compensation.

Now, while the scale of this breach was limited, it highlights that even smaller healthcare companies are frequent targets of malicious action and can’t afford, quite literally, in some cases, to have a weak cybersecurity posture that doesn’t meet HIPAA standards.
