Ukrainian hackers claim to have taken out the IT infrastructure at Russia's Gaskar Integration plant, one of the largest suppliers of drones for its army, and also destroyed massive amounts of technical data related to drone production.

Or, as described by the hacking collective (per Google translate), they "deeply penetrated" the drone manufacturer "to the very tonsils of demilitarization and denazification."

BO Team (also known as Black Owl) [announced](https://t.me/BO_Team_UA/568) the breach on its Telegram channel, and claimed to have carried out the operation alongside fellow hackers the Ukrainian Cyber Alliance "and one very well-known organization, the mention of which makes Vanya's bottle receivers explode," according to a Google translation of the Russian text.
