# IPTV Piracy: Cloudflare Says Thousands of Legal Sites Blocked Multiple Times

In submissions to the European Commission, rightsholders insist that intermediaries must kill pirate IPTV streams within minutes and proactive internet blocking should be ramped up across Europe. In its submission to the EC, Cloudflare reveals that a voluntary site-blocking program in a member state saw an ISP block thousands of entirely legal sites, on several separate occasions.

[![iptv](https://torrentfreak.com/images/iptv.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/iptv.png)Last month the European Commission (EC) issued a call for evidence to support an incoming “toolbox” of measures to combat live sports piracy.

The announcement followed a [huge campaign](https://torrentfreak.com/end-live-piracy-now-massive-coalition-demands-immediate-eu-action-221006/) by rightsholders last October. Organizations and companies, including the MPA, UEFA, Premier League, beIN, LaLiga, Serie A, Sky, and BT Sport, called on the EC to introduce new law that would compel intermediaries to take pirate streams offline within minutes of a complaint.

After [denying the request](https://torrentfreak.com/ec-declines-to-end-live-piracy-now-but-offers-toolbox-to-fight-illegal-streams-221020/), the [EC offered an opportunity](https://torrentfreak.com/combating-iptv-piracy-ec-calls-for-evidence-to-support-mitigation-toolbox-230117/) for rightsholders and other stakeholders to file submissions detailing their problems along with possible solutions actionable under existing law.

Most major stakeholders filed submissions close to the deadline late Friday. The majority were filed by sports leagues and organizations, broadcasters, and/or affiliated anti-piracy groups. Cloudflare, CCIA Europe, and an Austrian ISP coalition represented the internet/comms/tech sector.

## The Voices of Football

Despite being framed as a process to protect all live sports, it’s clear that the primary focus is to prevent European and UK football matches from appearing on pirate IPTV and similar web-based services. It therefore makes sense to focus on the demands of entities such as the Premier League, affiliated broadcasters, and the anti-piracy groups tasked with protecting their rights.

The Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance (AAPA) represents football leagues and their broadcasters all over Europe. AAPA members played a key role in the campaign last October, and their current position remains completely unchanged.

“As signatories to the Call To Action to End Live Piracy Now, we would like to restate that an EU legislative instrument still remains the most efficient and effective way to tackle piracy of live content within and across Member States,” AAPA begins.

In the knowledge that’s not going to happen anytime soon, AAPA notes that since the purpose of the exercise is to “*prevent*” online piracy, the main focus should be on the immediate removal of infringing content via the notice and takedown mechanism.

## What is a ‘Timely’ Takedown?

“The issue we have always had to face is the delayed response, if any, from online intermediaries that have been notified. The recently adopted [Digital Services Act (DSA)](https://www.aapa.eu/the-aapa-welcomes-the-european-parliaments-adoption-of-the-digital-services-act-dsa-but-reiterates-its-concerns-on-several-provisions-of-the-text) makes no meaningful change to the concept of ‘expeditious’ removal currently enshrined in EU law,” the AAPA writes.

“The latter is open to interpretation from online intermediaries which, in many cases, means they will simply either not respond to notices or do so hours or days after the end of the live event. Many of them will exploit all ambiguities in the law to avoid acting at all – never mind expeditiously – which is why concrete measures need to be taken.”

To empower rightsholders in the face of slow or even total non-compliance, the AAPA says that clarification of takedown terms would allow it to build on the concept of “timely” removals introduced in the DSA. Since accurately identifying infringing content is reportedly straightforward, non-compliant intermediaries should be held responsible for any infringement.

[![fingerprint2](https://torrentfreak.com/images/fingerprint2.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/fingerprint2.png)

“As live content is almost always watermarked and/or fingerprinted there is no question about identifying the stolen content which means the removal should be immediate and, in any case, well before the event terminates. In case online intermediaries do not remove access to the content in a timely manner, they should be held responsible for the harm caused to rights holders.”

If fingerprints are so easily detected and subscriber/device-level fingerprinting is available from multiple security vendors, that raises the question of why cutting off sources of infringing content isn’t a better option than battling to have streams taken down by uncooperative third parties. Perhaps we’ll hear more on this in due course.

## EU-Wide Implementation of Proactive ISP Blocking

In several EU member states and the UK, rightsholders already obtain court injunctions that require ISPs to block pirate sites when they try to evade blocking. These ‘dynamic’ injunctions are useful but ‘live’ injunctions are favored by rightsholders tackling IPTV services since they offer even more flexibility.

In broad terms, some European courts authorize live injunctions with particular aims in mind, protecting football matches or PPV boxing events, for example. To thwart the efforts of pirate services seeking to evade specified domain or specified IP-address-based blocking, rightsholders are given the power to identify in advance any online locations that are likely to be used for piracy in the near future.

[![datastop2](https://torrentfreak.com/images/datastop2.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/datastop2.png)

These are relayed to Internet service providers and rendered inaccessible, sometimes before events even begin. As such, live blocking injunctions are popular with rightsholders, but they’re not available in every member state. AAPA says this imbalance should be addressed by harmonizing this type of enforcement across the EU.

“The Commission should seek to create a level playing field and therefore replicate across the EU a powerful but carefully used approach to live blocking orders, bearing in mind that such actions shall not exclude rights holders who cannot act on the legal ground of copyright,” the [anti-piracy group](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13654-Combating-online-piracy-of-live-content/F3379800_en) notes.

Cloudflare’s submission begins with an overview of the company’s approach to copyright infringement and examples of how it cooperates with rightsholders seeking to protect their content from piracy.
