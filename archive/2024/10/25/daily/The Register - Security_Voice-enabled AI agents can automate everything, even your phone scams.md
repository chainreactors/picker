## All for the low, low price of a mere dollar

Scammers, rejoice. OpenAI's real-time voice API can be used to build AI agents capable of conducting successful phone call scams for less than a dollar.

There have been concerns that letting AI models interact with convincing, simulated voices might lead to abuse. OpenAI in June [delayed](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1805716393524183136) its [advanced Voice Mode](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8400625-voice-mode-faq) in ChatGPT, which supports real-time conversation between human and model, over safety concerns. This was after OpenAI demonstrated a voice that [sounded like celebrity Scarlett Johansson](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/21/scarlett_johansson_openai_accusation/), only to withdraw it [after an outcry](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/31/g-s1-2263/voice-lab-analysis-striking-similarity-scarlett-johansson-chatgpt-sky-openai) that the mimicry was done without her consent.

The [Realtime API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/), released earlier this month, provides a more or less equivalent capability to third-party developers. It allows developers to pass text or audio to OpenAI's [GPT-4o⁠](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) model...
