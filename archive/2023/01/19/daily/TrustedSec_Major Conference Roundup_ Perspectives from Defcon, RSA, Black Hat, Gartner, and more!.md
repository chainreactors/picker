The 2022 conference schedule ramped up in the second half of the year, and as you might expect, TrustedSec both attended and spoke at many of them. Within our organization, we have many different perspectives and focused interests, so we sampled opinions from some of the people who attended. We were curious how our experiences and those within our sphere of connections compared.

## **Views from Organizational Defenders and Penetration Test Practitioners**

For the purposes of the blog, we grouped perspectives into two primary personas—organizational defenders and penetration test practitioners. We started with organizational defenders as a catch-all name for folks whose focus is mainly on protecting their business or on the consultants assessing and advising on building and maturing their security programs. Some would call these Blue Teamers, but that didn't quite capture the different types of people we were talking with. Penetration test practitioners are the folks who are interested in or perform penetration testing of some kind. They are more generally interested in new exploits, tools, or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for breaking into an organization. Some of the conferences attended were different, but we were often at the same conferences, just attending different tracks.

It's always fascinating when people speaking on the same subject—Information Security—can not only have different perspectives (which is almost always the case), but in some cases, be speaking almost entirely different languages from one another about the same broad topic. That makes for very distinct differences. However, there were a lot of similarities whereby people arrived at similar conclusions, even though the problems were approached from entirely unique starting points.

One of the purposes of this blog is to help balance out perspectives and build an understanding of a challenge from different angles. Both organizational defenders and penetration test practitioners have the same ultimate goal of making companies more secure—one does so by breaking in and telling the company tactically how they did it to plug the holes, and the other by building the people, processes, and tools into a coherent security strategy (and plugging those holes) in an efficient and effective manner. Of course, this is subjective and certainly not representative of everyone's take. These notes are from our experience and from talking with others at the conferences and within TrustedSec.

**The First Universal Observation: High Levels of Excitement**

One of the great themes that seemed universal was the excitement exuded by the attendees! A two-year hiatus and isolation really got people jazzed up about going to conferences and interacting with others. People seemed to be in great moods and very engaged. There was a ton of mingling going on, not only among the attendees, but also with the vendors and people in the booths. There were many fresh fa...
