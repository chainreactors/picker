## Is that a lot? Depends on the context. GHz, no. Voltage, yes

Intel has divulged more details on its Raptor Lake family of 13th and 14th Gen Core processor failures and the 0x129 microcode that's supposed to prevent further damage from occurring.

The chipmaker previously disclosed that the so-called [instability issue](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/23/intel_raptor_lake_instability_fix/) plaguing many Raptor Lake chips stems from an elevated operating voltage set by the processor itself. Essentially, while relatively high voltage is crucial to maintaining stability at high clock speeds, there's a limit to how much a processor can tolerate. If voltage is set to a dangerously high value, it can permanently damage the processor, causing crashes at what should be stable frequencies if not fry the thing dead, as Intel customers have discovered.

Previously, it was unclear what Intel considered "elevated," but with a new [advisory](https://community.intel.com/t5/Processors/Microcode-0x129-Update-for-Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop/m-p/1622129) from Chipzilla now we finally have an answer: Anything above 1.55 volt...
