"Zero Trust security")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhizouLB24kshFkDJI1spTHZjMS6Dv4xmzt7B7Yk-V6JSxOBCI-fQUoOkEt5GOEqsBNDBQcEl3MW8UqwEdcMYlnPYux7DEfWhFdNdUZbM_IohN_Yi0VEJFfGnPrDuPC06cPTYDfJrSG4URJFwpCd8g4-F3Z-FogkcTU2eEMwcGSLNKVsxwJnjTgrBH48iQ/s790-rw-e365/wazuh.png)

Zero Trust security changes how organizations handle security by doing away with implicit trust while continuously analyzing and validating access requests. Contrary to perimeter-based security, users within an environment are not automatically trusted upon gaining access. Zero Trust security encourages continuous monitoring of every device and user, which ensures sustained protection after successful user authentication.

## Why companies adopt Zero Trust security

Companies adopt Zero Trust security to protect against complex and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This addresses the limitations of traditional, perimeter-based security models, which include no east-west traffic security, the implicit trust of insiders, and lack of adequate visibility.

| Traditional vs. Zero Trust security |

Zero Trust security upgrades an organization's security posture by offering:

* **Improved security posture**: Organizations can improve their security posture by continuously gathering data on network traffic, access requests, and user/system activities within their environment.
* **Protection from insider threats**: Zero Trust security ensures that every user within the network perimeter is authenticated before being granted access by adopting the principle of "never trust, always verify."
* **Adaptation to remote work**: Zero Trust security improves the security of remote work organizations by prioritizing identity verification, security, and continuous monitoring of each device/user.
* **Compliance**: It helps organizations meet compliance requirements by enforcing strict control, continuous monitoring, and data protection that aligns with regulatory standards.
* **Mitigation of breaches**: By implementing automated response mechanisms, organizations can quickly limit access privileges for compromised accounts and devices, thereby containing potential damage and reducing the overall impact of a breach.

## How to apply Zero Trust security

Here are the factors to consider when implementing Zero Trust security for your organization:

1. **Continuous monitoring**: This ensures that all network and system activities are monitored and analyzed. You can adopt a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. A SIEM is a security solution that offers real-time visibility, allowing organizations to identify and resolve security threats and vulnerabilities.
2. **Incident response**: This enables organizations to respond swiftly to security incidents. Organizations use Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms to react quickly to security breaches, minimizing damage and reducing downtime.
3. **Initial access prevention**: By continuously monitoring for vulnerability exploitation, unusual user behavior, and brute-force login attempts, organizations can detect threats in real-time before attackers establish an entry point.
4. **Least privilege**: This encourages minimal privilege attribution within the system, as users should only be granted the necessary access. It can be achieved by using Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions. IAM solutions use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign specific permissions to users. You can utilize a SIEM and XDR platform to monitor IAM configurations for unauthorized changes.
5. **Device access control**: All devices accessing the network must go through a prior authentication and verification process. This process involves checking the device's identity, security posture, and compliance with organizational policies. Even after initial access is granted, the device may continue to be monitored for any signs of compromise, ensuring ongoing security.
6. **Microsegmentation**: This Zero Trust security principle encourages organizations to break their network infrastructure into smaller, isolated parts. Each part operates independently with its security controls, reducing the attack surface by minimizing the risks of lateral movements.
7. **Multi-factor authentication**: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to present multiple verification forms before gaining access to systems, applications, or data. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if one factor, like a password, is compromised.

The following section shows examples of leveraging Wazuh capabilities for Zero Trust security.
