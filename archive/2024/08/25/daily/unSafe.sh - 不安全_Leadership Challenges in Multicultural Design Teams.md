Working in a multicultural design team can be an exciting opportunity to gain different perspectives and ideas and experience different cultures, but it also poses unique challenges for leaders in these teams. This article will explore the challenges of leadership in a multicultural design team, as these can be one of the first things a foreign designer may encounter when moving to the UK.

The field of design involves close collaboration which is often the link between project management, marketing, design, and business development. However, being a leader in a design team brings unique challenges when it comes to dealing with human feelings and needs, and it requires leading creative processes involving both business and engineering in the uncertainty of them.

It requires not only cultural sensitivity and adaptability but also the ability to manage identity and emotions. Collaborating with team members from different cultural backgrounds is easier when people need to achieve common goals in their daily work and are creating a positive atmosphere.

## Challenges of Leading a Multicultural Team

Understanding cultural aspects is useful in addressing critical cross-cultural issues and improving collaboration between team members from different cultures. Some cultures value consensus decision-making, while others expect command-and-control style leadership.

Since the fields of design and research are largely decision-making processes, it is important that leaders consider cultural differences that affect team dynamics. In addition, it is necessary to define objective measures of success and make sure that everyone learns their value. This will make it easier to work together toward the same goals, and cultural differences will become less complex.

There are five cultural dimensions: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and collectivism, masculinity and femininity, and long-term/short-term orientation. Taking into account these aspects allows using various methods of interaction. However, it requires the ability to be open-minded to people's ideas and opinions.

Hence, it is cultural intelligence that is needed to interpret unfamiliar gestures and situations and develop appropriate behavioral responses.

British society believes that inequality between people should be kept to a minimum. While there exists an established and historical class system, it exposes one of British culture's internal tensions, the importance of birth title on the one hand and the deeply rooted belief that where you were born should not limit how far you can travel in life.

A sense of fair play leads to the conviction that all people should be treated equally.

In the British design teams, with a more stable political and financial market, there is more emphasis on leaders' analytical skills and the ability to adapt to the diverse cultural codes of people from different countries. Developing intercultural competencies may be a good skill to deal with all the varieties of diversity.

Such competencies allow for increasing the productivity of multicultural design teams and also fostering an atmosphere of respect by demonstrating understanding and appreciation of the different beliefs and values of subjective cultures. This can help provide access to the differing cultural experiences of other people and allow for mutual adaptation.

By combining positive leadership resources with resilience capabilities, a leader can be more empathetic and respond flexibly to challenging circumstances. Ultimately, people are the team's most important asset. The job of leaders is to get the best out of people; making them more passionate about shared values by taking care of them, and, as a result, followers will try to do their best for the team.

Misunderstanding of cross-cultural issues affects every aspect of working within a product team, from development and researching user needs without taking into account local cultural tastes and preferences, to formulating a strategy and implementing it. Developing interpersonal relationships with local employees is one way to understand the dynamics in a particular country.

One of the ways for a designer to develop as a leader is through reflection, and it can take many different forms, such as internal dialogue, sketching, and engaging the practice community in reflection-in-action. However, it is important to create a psychologically safe environment by encouraging team members to engage in reflection at work, as this process may require interacting with others to receive feedback.

## Motivation and Emotions

Experiencing positive emotions changes the boundaries of our minds and affects our physical and mental health, environment, and overall well-being. The openness of our minds and hearts yields the warmth of positive emotions and helps leaders see the common humanity with others.

By creating a positive atmosphere, a leader can change people’s perspectives, which broadens people’s scope of mind and raises their awareness. It is especially important in a creative field where people need to come up with a large number of ideas. When they are happy, they can see more, so positive emotions expand the horizons of consciousness and provide new opportunities.

Bringing together people with different experiences and cultural backgrounds provides an opportunity to look at things from a range of perspectives and find alternative solutions. Dealing with such dynamics within a team highlights the important role of leaders, especially when it comes to trust and psychological safety.

Psychological safety refers to the perception that people are at ease being themselves and that they can express and employ themselves without fear of negative consequences to their self-image, status, or career. Without forming and building trust, cooperation, and improving relationships between members from different cultures, a team will not be able to achieve its goals.

Some factors can cause stress in a multicultural team. One of them is being away from home and family. A good leader with high emotional and cultural intelligence can help team members adapt by providing information about local values and norms and helping to develop interpersonal relationships across cultures.

A positively emotional leader can enable others to ignore racial and cultural differences, identify unique individuals across racial boundaries, see past differences, and strive for unity. If the leader evokes positive emotions, people become more trusting and better come to win-win solutions in negotiations. In general, when people experience positive emotions, it allows them to see the bigger picture and broader forms of interconnection.

A leader who shares positive emotions is more likely to inspire and motivate their team, build strong relationships, and make good decisions. In such an atmosphere, it is easier to create a culture of cooperation and growth.

The combination of positive leadership resources and organizational resilience capabilities contributes to the prosperity of teams. Positive communication helps to provide corrective supportive feedback and alleviates dysfunctional conflict, helping avoid d...
