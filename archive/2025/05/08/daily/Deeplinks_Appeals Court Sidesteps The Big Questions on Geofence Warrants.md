Another federal appeals court has ruled on controversial geofence warrantsâ€”sort of. Last week, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sitting en banc issued [a single sentence opinion](https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/224489.P.pdf) affirming the [lower court opinion](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/federal-court-virginia-holds-geofence-warrant-violates-constitution) in *United States v. Chatrie*. The practical outcome of this sentence is clear: the evidence collected from a geofence warrant issued to Google can be used against the defendant in this case. But that is largely where the clarity ends, because the fifteen judges of the Fourth Circuit who heard the en banc appeal agreed on little else. The judges wrote a total of nine separate opinions, no single one of which received a majority of votes. Amid this fracture, the judges essentially deadlocked on important constitutional questions about whether geofence warrants are a Fourth Amendment search. As a result, the new opinion in *Chatrie* is a missed opportunity for the Fourth Circuit to join [both](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-geofence-warrants-are-categorically-unconstitutional) [other](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/first-us-appellate-court-decide-finds-geofence-warrant-unconstitutional) appellate courts to have considered the issue in finding [geofence warrants unconstitutional](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/federal-appeals-court-finds-geofence-warrants-are-cate...
