# Activision took down Call of Duty game after PC players hacked, says source

Games giant Activision took down Call of Duty: WWII due to hackers exploiting a flaw in a specific PC version of the game, which led to several players getting their computers hacked, TechCrunch has learned.

Last week, Activision [announced](https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1941286795565728085) that it brought offline the Microsoft Store version of Call of Duty: WWII, a 2017 first-person shooter, as the company was investigating “reports of an issue,” without specifying what the issue was. The company had just launched that version of the game, also available on Game Pass, a subscription service that provides access to several games for a monthly fee.

A person with knowledge of Activision’s response told TechCrunch that the company took the game offline because of the hacks and while it works to patch the issue. TechCrunch is not naming the person, as they are not authorized to speak to the press.

[Several](https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-ww2-hackers-fix-update-pc-xbox-game-pass/) video game [news](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-wwiis-game-pass-pc-version-was-pulled-reportedly-after-hacking-issues/1100-6532997/) [outlets](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-ww2-pulled-from-pc-following-reports-of-remote-code-exploit-trolling-players-with-notepad-pop-ups-pc-shutdowns-and-desktop-wallpaper-of-a-lawyer/) reported on the story and noted that [several](https://x.com/borraskkaaa/status/1941286931134021948) [players](https://x.com/wrioh75753/status/1940597447467979053) [complained](https://www.reddit.com/r/WWII/comments/1lqhkiu/pc_hacked_while_playing_this_on_gamepass_please/) on [social](http://x.com/RyDog2Nasty/status/1940509520180269214) [media](https://x.com/Soaarz/status/1940991938402107426) that they had been hacked while playing the game. Until now, there had not been a confirmed link between the two events.

“The game is not safe to play on PC right now, there’s an RCE exploit,” a player wrote on Reddit last week, referring to a type of bug known as [remote code execution](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#remote-code-execution), which allows hackers the ability to plant malware capable of essentially taking control of a victim’s device.

The game for the Microsoft Store and Game Pass remains down at the time of publication, per [Activision’s status page](https://support.activision.com/onlineservices.Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20WWII.html).

Activision did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The game publisher took down only the Microsoft Store and Game Pass version of Call of Duty: WWII because they were different versions of the game than listed on Steam and contained an old flaw that had been patched on other versions of the game, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation.

In the last couple of years, Activision has had to deal with several hacking incidents. In November 2024, a [hacker found a flaw in Call of Duty’s anti-cheat system](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/07/hacker-says-they-banned-thousands-of-call-of-duty-gamers-by-abusing-anti-cheat-flaw/) that allowed them to ban thousands of legitimate gamers. Earlier in the year, the company investigated a hacking campaign targeting players with [infostealer malware](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#infostealers), a type of malicious software designed to steal a victim’s passwords. In 2023, [hackers used a self-spreading malware](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/27/hackers-are-infecting-call-of-duty-players-with-a-self-spreading-malware/) — a computer worm — to hack Call of Duty: Modern Warfare players, [thanks to an unpatched years-old bug](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/31/call-of-duty-worm-malware-used-to-hack-players-exploits-years-old-bug/) in the game.

In recent times, some video game companies have beefed up their cybersecurity teams, as well as their [anti-cheat teams](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/03/how-riot-games-is-fighting-the-war-against-video-game-hackers/). Activision, however, has gone through [several](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs) [rounds](https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-activision-blizzard-xbox-warcraft-rumble) of [layoffs](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2024-09-27/activision-blizzard-to-begin-layoffs-next-month) in the last few years, some of which have directly affected its cybersec...
