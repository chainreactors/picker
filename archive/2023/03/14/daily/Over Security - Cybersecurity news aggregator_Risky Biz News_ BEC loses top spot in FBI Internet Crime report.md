The Federal Bureau of Investigation has released its yearly internet crime report [*[PDF](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf)*], and after seven years of dominance, business email compromise has lost the top spot to a "rising star"—namely, **investment fraud**.

Together with Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), the FBI's Internet Crime Report is one of the most seminal reports in the cybersecurity community.

It is compiled by the FBI each year by aggregating complaints filed through the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a website where Americans can report an internet crime to the FBI.

Since its first edition, the IC3 report, as it's most commonly known, has been reporting losses at an increasing rate each year, and 2022 continued that trend. The FBI says that last year, users reported losing more than $10.3 billion to various forms of cybercrime, a 50% increase from 2021's $6.9 billion figure.

But things get interesting when we break down the numbers per category. While BEC ($2.7 billion) lost the top spot to investment fraud ($3.3 billion), both crime types combined accounted for more than half of the losses reported last year.

Furthermore, both BEC and investment fraud were also the only crime types that had losses in the realm of "billions," while everything else was in the millions mark.

For industry analysts, the shake-up at the top of the FBI IC3 report was surprising but not a total shock.

The signs were there for anyone paying attention. For example, in November of last year, Interpol detained nearly 1,000 suspects engaged in BEC and investment fraud and seized nearly $130 million as part of [Operation HAECHI III](https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2022/Cyber-enabled-financial-crime-USD-130-million-intercepted-in-global-INTERPOL-police-operation). Europol also [cracked down](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/call-centres-selling-fake-crypto-taken-down-in-bulgaria-serbia-and-cyprus) on call centers in Europe that used social media to lure users to scammy crypto-investment platforms. [Spanish police](https://www.policia.es/_es/comunicacion_prensa_detalle.php?ID=14662), too, as part of an operation against a gang that stole nearly €12 million.

Security firm Group-IB and Resecurity published reports on two cybercrime groups known as [CryptosLab](https://www.group-ib.com/media-center/press-releases/cryptoslabs-invest-scam/) and [Digital Smoke](https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/resecurity-disrupts-investment-scam-network-digital-smoke) that ran massive investment scam networks. These groups abused the brands and impersonated the investment portals of many high-profile brands, attracted investors with too-good-to-be-true opportunities, and then disappeared with the money.

In June of last year, the FBI put out a public statement warning that investment scams were [rampant on LinkedIn](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/fbi-says-fraud-on-linkedin-a-significant-threat-to-platform-and-consumers.html).

It put out [another alert](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003) in October of last year, warning about a tactic known as [pig-butchering](https://www.michigan.gov/ag/consumer-protection/consumer-alerts/consumer-alerts/scams/cryptocurrency-scam-pig-butchering).

Here is also where the confusion about "*investment fraud*" lies. In pig-butchering, threat actors approach victims via dating sites, move conversations to other more private platforms, build a rapport, and once they have the victim's trust, they propose they go into a joint investment. In most cases, the investments are made in cryptocurrency, mainly because the scammer can hide their identity better and because there's no way to recover cryptocurrency once it's been transferred out.

But investment fraud takes place in many other ways. For example, WithSecure (formerly F-Secure) has a [report](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/usdt-crypto-scams) here where scammers used Youtube videos advertising various cryptocurrency investment platforms to trick users into depositing funds at a platform they operated.

Scammers also use social media spam on sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to achieve the same results. Instant messengers are also abused, with known cases where threat actors have used Discord, WhatsApp, and Telegram to lure users onto their platforms.

Although the FBI says that crypto investments saw "unprecedented increases in the number of victims and the dollar losses," investment scams aren't always limited to cryptocurrency fans alone.

For example, Group-IB documented [an operation](https://www.group-ib.com/blog/investment-scams-europe/) that targeted stock market players as well. This group takes the cake for sophistication, with them building fake investment portals, complete with a dashboard that shows fake profits and urging users to deposit more via phone calls.
