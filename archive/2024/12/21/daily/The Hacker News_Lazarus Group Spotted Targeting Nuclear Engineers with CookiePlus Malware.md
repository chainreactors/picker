[![CookiePlus Malware](data:image/png;base64... "CookiePlus Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhblmMwsassaFD6IZFbb6ZTpi33tAfrqUHu_gGQuE18oCuetQ3l8ZnFmvIvjyktR2ipdfnTk4t1iIE3VAhjF-Oa698WEDTesYcMUpBt_5t2pwXyT2g2AfjQjHIX4dlGdNpCV2glvNzKh9lZwoQWmh8ynP8tubJbY7GlvjQ7joCFUGkPYAmFf3jUZfyj8h5q/s790-rw-e365/chrome.png)

The Lazarus Group, an infamous threat actor linked to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has been observed leveraging a "complex infection chain" targeting at least two employees belonging to an unnamed nuclear-related organization within the span of one month in January 2024.

The attacks, which culminated in the deployment of a new modular backdoor referred to as **CookiePlus**, are part of a long-running cyber espionage campaign known as Operation Dream Job, which is also tracked as [NukeSped](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/lazarus-hacker-group-evolves-tactics.html) by cybersecurity company Kaspersky. It's known to be active since at least 2020, when it was [exposed](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/north-korean-hackers-exploited-chrome.html) by ClearSky.

These activities often involve targeting developers and employees in various companies, including defense, aerospace, cryptocurrency, and other global sectors, with lucrative job opportunities that ultimately lead to the deployment of malware on their machines.

"Lazarus is interested in carrying out supply chain attacks as part of the DeathNote campaign, but this is mostly limited to two methods: the first is by sending a malicious document or trojanized PDF viewer that displays the tailored job descriptions to the target," the Russian firm [said](https://securelist.com/lazarus-new-malware/115059/) in an exhaustive analysis.

"The second is by distributing trojanized remote access tools such as [VNC](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-hackers-weaponizing-open.html) or [PuTTY](https://thehackernews.com/2022/09/north-korean-hackers-spreading.html) to convince the targets to connect to a specific server for a skills assessment."

The latest set of attacks documented by Kaspersky involve the second method, with the adversary making use of a completely revamped infection chain delivering a trojanized VNC utility under the pretext of conducting a skills assessment for IT positions at prominent aerospace and defense companies.

It's worth noting that Lazarus Group's use of rogue versions of VNC apps to target nuclear engineers was [previously highlighted](https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/lazarus-group-targeting-defense-experts.html) by the company in October 2023 in its APT trends report for Q3 2023.

"Lazarus delivered the first archive file to at least two people within the same organization (we'll call them Host A and Host B)," researchers Vasily Berdnikov and Sojun Ryu said. "After a month, they attempted more intensive attacks against the first target."

The VNC apps, a trojanized version of TightVNC called "AmazonVNC.exe," are believed to have been distributed in the form of both ISO images and ZIP files. On February 19, 2024, a legitimate version of UltraVNC ("vncviewer.exe") was used to sideload a malicious DLL packed within another ZIP archive on Host A.

The DLL ("vnclang.dll") serves as a loader for a backdoor dubbed [MISTPEN](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/north-korean-hackers-target-energy-and.html), which was uncovered by Google-owned Mandiant in September 2024. It's tracking the activity cluster under the moniker UNC2970. MISTPEN, for its part, has been found to deliver two additional payloads codenamed [RollMid](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/north-koreas-lazarus-group-deploys-new.html) and a new variant of LPEClient.

On the other hand, executing "AmazonVNC.exe" prompts the user to connect to an IP address mentioned in a readme.txt file along with a password, after which a downloader lodged within the binary, named Ranid, is decrypted and loaded into memory in order to run further malicious operations.

Kaspersky said it also observed the CookieTime malware being deployed on Host A, although the exact method that was used to facilitate it remains unknown. First [discovered](https://securelist.com/apt-trends-report-q1-2021/101967/#southeast-asia-and-korean-peninsula) by the company in September and November 2020, CookieTime is so named for its use of encoded cookie values in HTTP requests to fetch instructions from a command-and-control (C2) server.

[![CookiePlus Malware](data:image/png;base64... "CookiePlus Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRfQHbYH9w9Q6o96pUkzm8lkgMj93mE83RZIgpfkRCBKSZ4XXSP51YYiu_xZ57t5j1nfrwTCWYUfw7k_wf8iY_zM6rxW7PXGpM1y2cSi7Fvf2R7i7ns4KSqkteDCZqt8d2b08xqXry2MTJ2n-JNLM0hO29lYKfQeQKXQ9IuYNMSd-H790ikzipb1NNTYUc/s790-rw-e365/chart.png)

Further investigation of the attack chain has revealed that the threat actor moved laterally from Host A to another machine (Host C), where CookieTime was again used to drop various payloads between February and June 2024, such as follows -

* LPEClient, a malware that comes fitted with capabilities to profile compromised hosts
* ServiceChanger, a malware that stops a targeted legitimate service so as to sideload a rogue DLL embedded within it using the executable via DLL side-loading
* Charamel Loader, a loader malware that decrypts and loads internal resources like CookieTime, CookiePlus, and [ForestTiger](https://thehackernews.com/2023/10/microsoft-warns-of-north-korean-attacks.html)
* CookiePlus, a new plugin-based malicious program that's loaded by both ServiceChanger and Charamel Loader

"The difference between each CookiePlus loaded by Charamel Loader and by ServiceChanger is the way...
