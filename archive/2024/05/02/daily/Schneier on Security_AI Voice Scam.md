@ Bruce, ALL,

In a world that is moving rapidly to a “man in the middle” paradigm where “Face to Face”(F2F) nolonger happens

Two important points,

1, How do we prove we are who we say we are?

As far as I’m aware there is no easy or even realistically workable solution to this.

In the past the likes of the head of MI5 Stella Rimington pointed out it was actually not possible. And many “National ID Card” systems have failed because those involved did not take it onboard.

But more than a quarter of a century ago I fell foul of a couple of simple things,

“Authenticating the channel is not authenticating the transaction”.

“Anything an individual can do another individual or system can impersonate.”

Reading Ross Anderson’s comments on the difference in “trust” should be mandatory reading.

Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose

A similar ruse was described in the Count of Monte Cristo, but then using a telegraph.

I am not the first to mention this on this blog. Six years ago this also came up:

@ Winter,

Re : Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose

You forgot the other link a couple before,

<https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/05/1834_the_first_.html/#comment-321503>

And the reply,

“Ancipiti plus ferit ense gula.”

Which can be read as,

“Greed kills more than the sword”.

> Re : Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose

Great minds think alike?

Or, maybe, everyone uses that phrase because it is true.

@Clive, All

re: *Modern phone etiquette*

In old movies which depict the new telephones being used, the butler answers the phone

* (dialog) The XYZ Residence.

Later businesses with human operators answered

* XYZ Company. How may I direct your call?

Now, there are no more humans in the call routing software and you can punch at any variety of numbers or shout a variety of “trigger” words to try to get to human. How much of this gets gets recorded as part of their “All calls are recorded…” statement would certainly yield new levels of “profanity laden curses”.

At home we used to answer

* You have reached XYZ PhoneNumber

Which later turned into a simpler

* Hello?

Many people no longer identify their phone number as Caller ID does it for them. Many people do not identify the name(s) of the answering destination since it’s available from reverse phone number look up. Many people have learned not to say “Hello?” because they do not know who is on the other end, even if Caller Id shows a name.

Now it’s best not to say anything at all. Even breathing near the phone might not be wise. Who ever is calling is Not Your Friend.

* Friends send you Direct Messages and know your DID number

This is a bit of defensive self-preservation shielding.

Like when an Insurance Company calls you to discuss your health insurance claim and starts the conversation with

* Hi, this is ABC from XYZ Heath Company calling. How you are you doing?

People auto-answer with

* Fine.

Which returns the following

* Oh, since you are “fine” we will close your application and case.

After that, you might not Have A Nice Day.

Social Engineering is used by Big Businesses, not just scammers. Well… it is a form of scam.

Bruce, can you, or anyone here, explain to me why an Artificial Idiot service should be legal to fake voices?

@mark, All

re: *legal to fake voices?*

Are these voices fake? I don’t think so.

There is a class of comedians who specialized in voice mimicry. (1) They have great ability to make a voice “sound” like that of another famous person. Sometimes they included mannerisms or hand gestures that the famous person used.

These are “fake voices”, they sound OK to our hearing but technically they are not the same.

AI and Recordings use actual snippets of real voices. They do not need much, Hello will do. They take the real voice and rearrange it so that it says something else. Like movie, music and voice editors can rearrange word order.

AI can do something more specific. It can take a sample of a word and reconstruct how the sound of the word is produced. The way the word is vocalized. (2) AI can then create any sentence or word order it wants.

* It’s not fake, because it is your voice.
* + It is fake, because you did not say it.

===

h ttps :/ /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionist\_(entertainment)

* An impressionist or a mimic is a performer whose act consists of imitating sounds, voices and mannerisms of celebrities and cartoon characters. The word usually refers to a professional comedian/entertainer who specializes in such performances and has developed a wide repertoire of impressions, including adding to them, often to keep pace with current events.
* Impressionists are a major part of animation; many film and television cartoons (especially adaptations of franchises) used impressions of famous celebrities of the era. Voice actors are known for their celebrity impressions.

2)

In telephony the voice is divided in 256 samples.
