From October 04th to 11th another successful Hack2Build event took place, and this time offered completely in Spanish to LAC SME partners. Themed on SAP BTP fast adoption for SME use cases, partners were invited to build on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) extensions and integrations for SAP Small and Midsize Enterprise (SME) solutions: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Business One and/or SAP Business ByDesign. Partners could realize how quickly SAP BTP can be leveraged to add value to their Cloud journey and serve as the platform for them to offer their applications to customers.

[Hack2Build](https://events.sap.com/hack2build2022/en/home) initiative from SAP is a rapid prototyping initiative to drive early-stage inspiration, use case exploration and technology adoption for SAP partners. In this opportunity, partners validate their ideas, get coaching and support during the build of the prototype, and get hands-on experience with SAP Technologies. After the hackathon, they also explore how to package the solution and get ready for go-to-market.

The participants brought inspiration, hard work, curiosity, and delivered compelling solutions in a week’s time.

## **The Participating Companies**

Hack2Build SME, SAP BTP fast adoption – LAC (Spanish) – October/2022 Participants

We were glad to welcome twelve SAP partner companies with around 70 participants from seven countries in the region. Participated in this edition of the Hack2Build: [CSTI Corp](https://csticorp.biz/en/), [Exxis Group](https://exxis-group.com/), [H&CO Global Advisors](https://www.hco.com/), [Heinsohn Business Technology](https://www.heinsohn.co/), [Inforum](https://grupoinforum.com/), [Pampa Business Ideas](https://pampabi.com/en/), [RedSinergia](https://redsinergia.com/), [Tesselar](https://www.tesselar.mx/), UpperSap, [Ventura Soluciones](https://venturasoluciones.pe/), [VisualK Group](https://visualk.cl/) and [VRTCL Consulting](https://www.vmedsuite.com/).

By harnessing the power of the SAP Business Technology Platform, the participants prototyped use cases for extensions and integrations with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP Business One and SAP Business ByDesign, thereby consuming standard APIs from the corresponding ERP. This way, they managed to target customer essential needs or to alleviate customer’s pain points with intelligent solutions.

Every Hack2Build event demonstrates the innate innovation potential of SAP’s ecosystem, driven by their close association with SAP products and technologies and servicing customer needs over many years. Enabled by the manifold capabilities offered by the SAP Business Technology Platform, each partner demonstrated a clear value proposition with their ideas arising from the challenges they observe with our joint customers planning needs and aspirations.

At first, the SAP teams worked to review the business use cases and prototype architecture along with each partner. Then, within just a week’s time, the partners worked hard to materialize their innovations onto working software running on SAP BTP and demo it for the critical eyes of the judges. Although all participating teams had the potential to win, the jury had to determine the winners based on key criteria.

It was interesting to see that SAP BTP was a new topic to most of these SME partners, and they have quickly acquired know-how to build their prototypes. Some partners were developing new solutions from scratch, and some partners were kickstarting the migration of their existing on-premises applications to the Cloud. SAP BTP could effectively support both scenarios, add value, and speed up partner’s development efforts.

## **Demo Day and the Panel of Judges**

All participants made it to the final Demo Jam and showcased their inspiring innovative solutions to the audience. With only 10 minutes to present the Business Case and the functioning Prototype running on SAP BTP, they had an intense morning aiming to impress the Jury and answer their questions.

The Panel of Judges offered partners a diverse perspective and consisted of four SAP Senior Executives:

The judges were amazed by the showcases, given the constraints of such short time and high quality of the partner prototypes. They also had the chance to provide insights and feedback to each partner.
