Longtime EFFer and Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel Kurt Opsahl will be moving on from the Electronic Frontier Foundation after nearly 20 years, on February 1. But we aren’t going to let him go too far: Kurt will continue on as a Special Counsel of EFF.  Kurt will be joining the Filecoin Foundation as Associate General Counsel for Cybersecurity and Civil Liberties Policy.

Over the years, he established the [reporters’ privilege for online journalists](https://www.eff.org/cases/apple-v-does), has been our lead attorney helping security researchers on the [Coders' Rights Project](https://www.eff.org/issues/coders), fought against [copyright trolls](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/righthaven-case-ends-victory-fair-use) and [warrantless mass surveillance](https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel), and represented a number of companies who challenged secret [National Security Letters](https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters). He’s been a big part of bringing EFF’s message to the world, talking to reporters about everything from [TikTok](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/30/explainer-us-congress-tiktok-ban) to [Tornado Cash](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/10/github_tornado_cookies/) to the [metaverse](https://www.toolbox.com/it-security/network-security/guest-article/identity-access-and-zero-trust-in-the-metaverse-era/), in outlets ranging from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/20/technology/tiktok-ban-government-issued-devices.html) to [Popular Science](https://www.popsci.com/technology/bills-tiktok-ban/) to [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-62142208) to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/31/bitcoin-donations-cryptocurrency-charities/).
