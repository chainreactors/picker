# Security awareness campaign highlights things your bank will never say

Posted: October 11, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

If you like anti-phishing efforts, hashtags, and confusing but colourful video games, you’ll be interested to know that a security initiative involving all three is now live. The American Bankers Association and other banks in the US are involved in an [awareness campaign tied in with National Cybersecurity Awareness Month](https://drgnews.com/2022/10/10/banks-using-banksneveraskthat-anti-phishing-campaign-to-try-to-make-customers-less-vulnerable-to-scams/).

The campaign focuses on [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) and ways to tackle it head on with the aid of some learning tools and an informative website. It’s called “Banks never ask that,” and this is a good place to focus a campaign given the number of times we do indeed say that “banks will never ask you this.” It’s a common bit of security messaging, given a potentially very visible boost. That can only be a good thing, right?

## Scoping out the scams

The incredibly colourful [Banks Never Ask That](https://www.banksneveraskthat.com/) is a collection of tips focused on four key areas of phishing danger: text messages, mobile payment app scams, email, and phone calls. Each section focuses on advising would-be victims to slow things down and not be rushed into hasty decisions by the scammer. This is a good idea; many phishing attacks plug into a fear of missing out, or time limited offers, and even refunds and panic-inducing situations. This is all in an effort to have someone not think clearly, and hand over logins or payment details in ways which can’t easily be corrected.

Also, a related PDF that claims to offer a “[deeper look](https://www.banksneveraskthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BNAT22_Web_RedFlagsInfoSheet.pdf)” into the problem repeats much of the same info from the website’s dropdown menus. All the same, it’s still handy to have all of the information in one place as opposed to dropdown categories which are only viewable one at a time.

The rest of the site focuses on specific areas of security related to locking down accounts, using multi-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication), insisting on calling back a bank directly instead of taking a random caller’s word for it and so on.

There’s also one of those pages where you can “spread the word”, in the form of pre-written tweets giving the same advice. I’m not entirely convinced this kind of thing is particularly effective, but the option is there nonetheless.

## Let’s all go to the movies

There is a tendency for people to not read things, and any cybersecurity month runs the risk of overloading folks with information. When everyone is saying to do this, and not do that, over the space of a few weeks, then fatigue will come into play.

With this in mind, there’s a [number of videos](https://www.banksneveraskthat.com/#videos) tied to the campaign which make a lot of the points easier to digest. One focuses on not falling for fake phone calls from your bank, another makes the point that bank staff will never ask for your PIN number. In fact, the videos seem to make the point about what banks don’t ask for more clearly than the various text-laden portions of the site. In conclusion, bonus points for the videos! They’re short, easy to understand, and work like a charm.
