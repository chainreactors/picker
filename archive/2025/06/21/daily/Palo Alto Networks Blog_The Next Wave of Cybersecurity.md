## Cloud and SOC Integration

Traditional approaches to cloud security can’t keep up with real-time attacks. To protect against modern threats, organizations need a unified approach that combines best-in-class cloud detection and response (CDR) with industry-leading CNAPP.

In today’s modern business landscape, cloud technology adoption has skyrocketed, driven largely by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). This shift has completely transformed how businesses operate, with [63%](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cloud/cloud-ai-business-survey.html) of organizations citing AI as the primary driver for cloud investment. However, this rapid growth in cloud technology has also attracted more threats, with nearly [29%](/blog/2025/02/incident-response-report-attacks-shift-disruption/) of cyber incidents originating in cloud environments.

Traditional approaches to cloud security can’t keep up with real-time attacks. While today’s CNAPPs are primarily focused on cloud posture management and have proven effective in flagging misconfigurations and ensuring security compliance, they can fall short in preventing a breach from a Zero Day attack.

To tackle these challenges, a unified approach is needed that combines best-in-class cloud detection and response (CDR) with industry-leading CNAPP to deliver the future of real-time cloud security. This comprehensive strategy is crucial as it integrates data from code to cloud to SOC, equipping organizations with complete context to drive rapid prioritization and real-time prevention. By fostering collaboration between cloud security and SOC teams, organizations can enhance threat detection and response capabilities across their cloud infrastructure.

The integration of AI-driven cloud and SOC technology is revolutionizing cybersecurity practices, allowing organizations to utilize advanced analytics and automation for improved threat detection and response. By leveraging AI-driven insights, security teams can proactively identify emerging threats, predict potential exposures, and implement proactive security measures to safeguard critical data effectively.

Unified security platforms are key in bridging the gap between cloud and enterprise SOC teams, leading to quicker response times and higher ROI. According to a [report](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-01-28-ibm-and-palo-alto-networks-find-platformization-is-key-to-reduce-cybersecurity-complexity) from IBM and Palo Alto Networks, organizations with unified platforms detect and contain security incidents faster, resulting in a significant increase in ROI compared to using standalone products. By consolidating data, streamlining workflows and leveraging AI insights, organizations can reduce risks, prevent cloud threats and respond to attacks promptly.

In today’s cybersecurity landscape, it’s crucial for defenders to bring AppSec, CloudSec and SecOps teams together to stay ahead of cyberthreats. Embracing cloud and SOC integration allows organizations to bolster their defense, enhance their security posture and effectively stop threats. The seamless integration of cloud and SOC is not just a best practice but a strategic necessity in protecting businesses from today’s ever-changing cyber landscape.
