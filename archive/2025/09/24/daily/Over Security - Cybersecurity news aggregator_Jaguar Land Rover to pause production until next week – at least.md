# Jaguar Land Rover to pause production until next week – at least

Luxury car-maker Jaguar Land Rover will not resume production at its factories for yet another week as it continues to grapple with fallout from a cyberattack.

In early September, [Jaguar Land Rover stopped production](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/jaguar-land-rover-says-data-stolen-in-disruptive-cyberattack/) at its factories in the U.K. after it was impacted by a cyberattack in which hackers stole company data. Jaguar Land Rover has not said what data was stolen.

Jaguar Land Rover [said in a statement on Tuesday](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident-4) the production suspension will continue until next week, specifically Wednesday October 1. But the company did not commit to resuming production then, only saying it “made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation.”

Francis Robertson-Marriott, a spokesperson for Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s Tata Motors, declined to comment when TechCrunch asked if the company has a timeline for the restoration of production.

Factories have now been shut down for three weeks. The continued shutdown will affect suppliers as well, which are [reportedly](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czewlj57e24o) concerned about being forced into bankruptcy.
