Officials in Moore County, North Carolina, declared a state of emergency on Sunday after gunfire damaged an electrical substation and left 45,000 homes and businesses without power in near freezing temperatures.

"It appears to be an intentional, willful, and malicious act," said Tom McInnis, North Carolina State Senator, during [a press conference](https://twitter.com/IntelPointAlert/status/1599515327578406912). "The perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."

The [state of emergency declaration](https://www.thepilot.com/news/substation-attack-progress-made-but-vast-majority-of-homes-and-businesses-will-not-regain-power/article_b3b19780-7370-11ed-865d-c78d0de5d921.html), obtained by North Carolina-based publication The Pilot, says, "Massive Power Outages due to criminal activity…has caused widespread and significant power outages within the County of Moore, North Carolina. It is anticipated to take up to one week for the power to be restored to residents, businesses, churches, schools, and government."
