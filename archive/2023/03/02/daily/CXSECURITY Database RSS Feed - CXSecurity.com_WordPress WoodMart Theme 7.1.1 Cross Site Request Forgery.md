==== [ Z://USB-00\_RESEARCH/WORDPRESS/ ] ============================================= [ 2023 ] ==
Report Title: WordPress WoodMart Theme <= 7.1.1 - Theme License Options Change via CSRF
Google Dork: inurl:/wp-content/themes/woodmart/
Research Date: 2023-02-10
Researcher: FearZzZz [ https://fearzzzz.ru ]
Component Vendor: XTemos [ https://themeforest.net/user/xtemos ]
Vulnerable Version: <= 7.1.1
Component Link: https://themeforest.net/item/woodmart-woocommerce-wordpress-theme/20264492
CVSS Base Score: 5.4 (Medium)
CVSS Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
OWASP Top 10: A01: 2021 â€“ Broken Access Control
CWE: CWE-352
CVE: TBA
=================================================================================================
#### [ Description: ]
The WoodMart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in versions up to, and including, v7.1.1, because of missing nonce validation on the 'process\_form' function. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to trick users into performing an action they didn't intend to perform under their current authentication.
#### [ Vulnerable Code: ]
File #0: ~/woodmart/inc/classes/License.php, lines: 134-143.
```
if ( isset( $\_POST['purchase-code-deactivate'] ) ) {
$this->deactivate();
$this->\_notices->add\_success( 'Theme license is successfully deactivated.' );
return;
}
if ( isset( $\_POST['woodmart-purchase-code'] ) && ( ! isset( $\_POST['agree\_stored'] ) || empty( $\_POST['agree\_stored'] ) ) ) {
$this->\_notices->add\_error( 'You must agree to store your purchase code and user data by xtemos.com' );
return;
}
```
#### [ Impact: ]
Impact of a CSRF vulnerability is related to the privileges of the target user. Depending on the nature of the action, an attacker might be able to change some data or gain full control over the user's account. If the compromised user has a privileged role (administrator, i.e.) within the application, then the attacker can gain full control over the application.
