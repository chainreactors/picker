Black Duck has released its “[2024 Software Vulnerability Snapshot](/resources/analyst-reports/software-vulnerability-trends.html)” report, offering valuable insights into the current state of web application security. The report analyzes data from over 200,000 [dynamic application security testing (DAST)](/glossary/what-is-dast.html) scans conducted by [Black Duck® Continuous Dynamic](/dast.html) scanning on approximately 1,300 applications across 19 industry sectors.

## Key findings from the Software Vulnerability Snapshot

##

The 2024 analysis identified a total of 96,917 vulnerabilities, with several critical issues standing out.

* [Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)](/blog/owasp-top-10-cryptographic-failures.html): This category accounted for 30,726 vulnerabilities, including 4,882 critical-risk instances. Affecting 86% of clients, it represents one of the most common and serious security issues across industries.
* [Injection Vulnerabilities](/blog/owasp-top-10-injection.html): 4,814 vulnerabilities were found in this category, with over half of those (2,491) critical instances. Injection vulnerabilities, which include [SQL Injection](/glossary/what-is-sql-injection.html) and [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](/glossary/what-is-cross-site-scripting.html), pose significant security threats due to their potential for data theft and system compromise.
* [Security Misconfigurations](/blog/owasp-top-10-security-misconfiguration.html): This vulnerability category affected 98% of the clients scanned, with over 36,000 vulnerabilities identified. While many of those vulnerabilities were classified as “informational” by Black Duck experts (that is, no immediate action was indicated), they still represent potential security risks.
