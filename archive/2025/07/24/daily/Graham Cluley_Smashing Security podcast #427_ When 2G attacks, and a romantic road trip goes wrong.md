In this episode, Graham warns why it is high time we said goodbye to 2G ‚Äì the outdated mobile network being exploited by cybercriminals with suitcase-sized SMS blasters. From New Zealand to London, scammers are driving around cities like dodgy Uber drivers, spewing phishing texts to thousands at once.

Meanwhile, Carole unpacks a painfully awkward tale of amour fou, as a 76-year-old Belgian man drives 476 miles to meet his dream woman‚Ä¶ only to be greeted by her very-much-still-husband at the gate.

Plus: Sky Arts painting competitions get a thumbs up, Mark Zuckerberg never loses at board games, and the scandalous Facebook memoir Meta tried to silence.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
