An Iranian ransomware-as-a-service operation with ties to a government-backed cyber crew has reemerged after a nearly five-year hiatus, and is offering would-be cybercriminals cash to infect organizations in the US and Israel.

The malware, an updated version of 2020's Pay2Key, previously linked to Tehran's [Pioneer Kitten](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/28/iran_pioneer_kitten/), now uses several of the Mimic ransomware's capabilities, according to the threat research team at Morphisec, a purveyor of defensive security products.

In a June 23 post screenshotted by the security firm and shared in a Tuesday report [[PDF](https://engage.morphisec.com/hubfs/Pay2Key_Iranian_Cyber_Warfare_Targets_the_West_Whitepaper.pdf)], the ransomware crew that now uses the name “Pay2Key.I2P” promised a "favorable percentage (80 percent instead of 70 percent) for anyone engaged in an attack against enemies of Iran. This is primarily Israel and the United States. Write in support."
