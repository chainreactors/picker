# Startup takes personal data stolen by malware and sells it on to other companies

Posted: July 22, 2025

A tech startup is using personal data stolen by infostealer [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that it has found on the [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web), and then selling access to that data. And it claims to be working within the law.

According to [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/a-startup-is-selling-data-hacked-from-peoples-computers-to-debt-collectors/), for as little as $50, Farnsworth Intelligence will give companies a look at records from infostealer logs.

Infostealers are a type of malware that focus on harvesting as much data from a victim’s computer as possible. Criminals infect computers in various ways, including via malicious links and infected versions of pirated software or cheat add-ons.

The malware can do everything from monitoring every key you type through to code that probes your internal storage and memory for secrets. Some infostealers even take snapshots of screens to see what they can find. All this data gets beamed back to the infostealer’s criminal operators.

There is no suggestion that Farnsworth Intelligence infects computers with infostealer software itself. It claims to operate within legal frameworks, with data provided through a third-party vendor that specializes in security monitoring services.

This data is available in huge quantities. The startup offers over 20 billion records of stolen data from over 50 million computers. A professional subscription-based version of the service offers access to include anything that an infostealer can pilfer, including [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) wallet data, browser histories detailing what sites you’ve visited, usernames and passwords for those sites, and browser [cookies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies) that criminals could use to impersonate you on a site. Customers can also get access to a list of applications on a person’s computer.

Farnsworth Intelligence says its target audience for the service is “professionals with a legitimate use case in industries such as investigations, intelligence, journalism, law enforcement, cyber security, compliance, IP/brand protection, executive protection, etc”.

There is also a version with ad hoc searches paid for in credits. This gives you access to a subset of the data, searched via phone number, email address, username, domain, password, or autofills (the information that browsers use to fill common fields in web forms). At one credit per search, the cheapest version is the $50 version, which buys users 45 credits.

The service doesn’t just provide access to a static set of data; it’s adding to it all the time. It claims to add over 185 million new records, stolen from over 40,000 computers each month.

“While historical breach data remains valuable, its utility diminishes over time as credentials change and contact information becomes outdated,” says the blurb on Farnsworth’s website (which we’re not linking to here). “Infostealer logs provide investigators with current, device-level data that offers significantly higher intelligence value than traditional breach compilations.”

Is this legal? The startup seems to think so. There’s no vetting of customers, thoug...
