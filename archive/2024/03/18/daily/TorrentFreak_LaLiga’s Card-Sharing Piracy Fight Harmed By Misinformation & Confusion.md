# LaLiga’s Card-Sharing Piracy Fight Harmed By Misinformation & Confusion

A piracy-related court order obtained by Spanish football league LaLiga should've been relatively easy to explain. Instead, it now sits at the heart of a controversy that began with misinformation and is now being fueled by mischaracterization and misinterpretation. Today we'll shine new light on the case and show why it has implications for every internet user in the country. That leads to the role of ISPs and whether internet users can rely on them to defend whatever privacy they have left.

[![pirate-view-card-football](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-view-card-football.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/pirate-view-card-football.png)Orders handed down by courts presiding over novel intellectual property cases routinely convey clear instructions, regardless of underlying complexity. With no room for misinterpretation, everyone knows where they stand and what the court expects of them.

Such clarity can also be a plus outside court too, at least when orders are made available to the public. When originating applications or complaints are also made available for scrutiny, that allows most interested parties to take in the facts and draw reasonable conclusions.

When it first emerged last week that a court in Barcelona had issued an order to help Spain’s LaLiga fight TV piracy, the order itself hadn’t been seen in public. The originating application still hasn’t. An unsourced statement in the article that broke the news appeared to send people in the wrong direction, and a general reluctance by those familiar with the facts to actually share some, sealed the deal.

## A Mostly Accurate Report, One Pivotal Claim

[![el pais iptv](https://torrentfreak.com/images/qqIugOo8Aq.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/qqIugOo8Aq.png)As far as we can determine, [El País broke the story](https://elpais.com/economia/2024-03-07/el-juez-abre-la-puerta-a-laliga-a-demandar-a-clientes-particulares-por-pirateria.html) after gaining access to the court order handed down by a Barcelona court in February.

In almost all respects, the article accurately reports the information contained in the order. The problems appear when information that doesn’t appear in the order is presented as fact leading in. Specifically, that the court had granted LaLiga permission to target “private users who consume protected audiovisual content through IPTV.”

The source of that statement wasn’t mentioned in the article but assumptions that the claim was true ignited widespread misinterpretations concerning the nature of the case.

El País used the claim in the headline of the article and from there, stories stating that LaLiga would be targeting regular IPTV viewers with fines, spread like wildfire.

*A single statement with the potential to affect thousands*[![elpais-liga](https://torrentfreak.com/images/elpais-liga.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/elpais-liga.png)

That prompted an [official statement](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunales-Superiores-de-Justicia/TSJ-Cataluna/Noticias-Judiciales-TSJ-Cataluna/Un-juzgado-mercantil-de-Barcelona-acuerda-que-se-identifique-a-los--cardsharers--que-re-difunden-a-terceros-la-senal-de-los-partidos-de-futbol-propiedad-de-La-Liga-y-obtienen-un-lucro-con-ello) from the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia (TSJ-Cataluna) which attempted to set the record straight.

The statement confirmed that the case isn’t about pirate IPTV services. It relates to a specific type of piracy known as card-sharing and the ISPs in this matter are only required to hand over the details of individuals who profit from illicit content, the [statement added](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunales-Superiores-de-Justicia/TSJ-Cataluna/Noticias-Judiciales-TSJ-Cataluna/Un-juzgado-mercantil-de-Barcelona-acuerda-que-se-identifique-a-los--cardsharers--que-re-difunden-a-terceros-la-senal-de-los-partidos-de-futbol-propiedad-de-La-Liga-y-obtienen-un-lucro-con-ello).

People who simply view content without paying for it are not affected, TSJ-Cataluna stressed.

## LaLiga Responds via an ‘Information Notice’ and Social Media

The ‘Information Notice’ published by LaLiga doesn’t directly challenge the TSJ-Cataluna statement but describes it as an “[interpretation](https://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Tribunales-Superiores-de-Justicia/TSJ-Cataluna/Noticias-Judiciales-TSJ-Cataluna/Un-juzgado-mercantil-de-Barcelona-acuerda-que-se-identifique-a-los--cardsharers--que-re-difunden-a-terceros-la-senal-de-los-partidos-de-futbol-propiedad-de-La-Liga-y-obtienen-un-lucro-con-ello)” of the order handed down by Commercial Court no.8 of Barcelona.

President of LaLiga, Javier Tebas Medrano, posted something similar on X, without any useful context that might help anyone understand why the facts, whatever they might be, seem to be in public dispute. Through the sharing of just a few lines of text, however, LaLiga mentioned details of the authorization it had obtained from the court, but left the backstory wide open to speculation.

According to LaLiga, it will provide Spain’s ISPs with the IP addresses of servers that “transmit illegal content.” Again, the lack of clarity doesn’t help people to understand what “illegal content” means, but those who reasonably concluded that meant “pirated LaLiga football streams,” were incorrect.

## Card-Sharing Piracy is Not IPTV, But it is Illegal

The servers mentioned by LaLiga grant access to a card-sharing piracy system. Our earlier report has a [more detailed explanation](https://torrentfreak.com/does-laligas-court-order-compel-isps-to-identify-piracy-that-laliga-hasnt-240312/) of what that entails but here, even the Superior Court of Justice statement struggles to offer a suitable definition that doesn’t imply the distribution of audiovisual content.

“Cardsharing is a practice by which legitimate users re-broadcast the signal to certain ‘pirate’ networks in which all participants, including those who only defraud the quota, use decoders,” it reads.

To be clear, these servers supply codes, not audiovisual content. No video, no audio, no streams; those are transmitted via satellite. The codes that are shared via these servers allow people to decrypt the channels transmitted by the satellite, and technicalities aside, that’s pretty much it *(detailed description at the end of this article)*.

While some have suggested these services operate in a gray area, distributing the codes and using the codes to obtain subscription TV without paying for it is illegal in the EU.

Yet when LaLiga’s president was asked during a [Movistar Plus+ interview](https://www.infobae.com/espana/deportes/2024/03/10/tebas-se-pronuncia-tras-la-polemica-por-la-lucha-de-laliga-contra-el-pirateo-no-sera-una-multa/) to clarify the nature of the IP addresses and servers the league is targeting, he responded: “Those IP addresses, which LaLiga is going to p...
