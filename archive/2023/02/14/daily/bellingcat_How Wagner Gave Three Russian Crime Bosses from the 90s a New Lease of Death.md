“In six months, you’ll go home, having received a pardon. (…) Those who come with us and on the first day say, ‘I ended up somewhere I shouldn’t have’, we’ll mark a deserter and execute. (…) You have five minutes to decide.”

[So said Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOtN3PllDrk), self-confessed founder of the Russian private military company Wagner, to a group of inmates at [Penal Colony 6 in Yoshkar Ola](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/europe/russia-wagner-ukraine-video.html), capital of the region of Mari El, 645 kilometres east of Moscow. After the video from the prison surfaced in September 2022, the same pitch went out to convicts across Russia.

But on February 9, Prigozhin confirmed in a [response published on social media](https://vk.com/concordgroup_official?w=wall-177427428_2005) to a Russian TV station that Wagner had ceased hiring convicts. “We are fulfilling all obligations towards those currently working for us”, he wrote.

As Bellingcat has previously reported, Wagner [originated in Ukraine](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/01/30/wagner-mercenaries-with-gru-issued-passports-validating-sbus-allegation/) back in [2014.](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/9458) This private military contractor has risen to newfound prominence following Russia’s full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022, most recently amid the fierce [battle for Bakhmut](https://time.com/6253515/bakhmut-battle-ukraine-russia/) in eastern Ukraine.

Extensive news reporting in recent years has illustrated Wagner’s operations not only in Ukraine but also in [Syria](https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/decoding-wagner-group-analyzing-role-private-military-security-contractors-russian-proxy-warfare/introduction/), the [Central African Republic](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61311272), [Libya](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-58009514), and [Madagascar](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/08/14/pmc-structure-exposed/), among other countries. In January, the US Treasury went as far as to label Wagner a “[transnational criminal group](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1220)”.

As analysts from the Carnegie Centre [put it](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/07/08/putin-s-not-so-secret-mercenaries-patronage-geopolitics-and-wagner-group-pub-79442) in 2019, Wagner’s usefulness lies in the fact that it can do, or claims it can do, what the Russian state and its formal institutions can’t. It is “a vehicle the Kremlin uses to recruit, train, and deploy mercenaries, either to fight wars or to provide security and training to friendly regimes.”

“It is quite clear from the preparatory work that went into building the Wagner Group’s profile ahead of the February 2022 invasion that [Russian President] Putin counted on being able to use the Wagner Group to fill gaps in Russian military units”, said Candace Rondeaux, a Professor of Practice at the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University, in an interview with Bellingcat. “All the evidence has long pointed to close coordination between the Wagner Group’s leadership and both the GRU and FSB [Russia’s security services]” added Rondeaux, who has researched the Wagner group in depth in a [series of reports](https://www.newamerica.org/international-security/reports/decoding-wagner-group-analyzing-role-private-military-security-contractors-russian-proxy-warfare/).

Due to Wagner’s secretive nature, it can be difficult to verify the number of fighters it commands, As of January 2023 estimates by the [US](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/20/politics/us-russia-wagner-group/index.html) and [British](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1616323761392812033) ministries of defence ran to at least 50,000, convicts or not. The head of [Russia Behind Bars](https://meduza.io/en/news/2023/01/23/russia-behind-bars-wagner-group-s-losses-80-percent-of-50k-inmate-recruits), an NGO which protects the rights of prisoners, says that figure is convicts alone. Rondeaux told Bellingcat that she did not find these estimates credible and believes that they are “likely based on the some 30,000 men who are counted as missing or released from prison since the start of the war”.

Whatever the figure, Wagner has grown significantly since its inception. The fact that the group operates openly at all suggests that its usefulness to the state is recognised – although private military contractors are technically illegal under Russian law under Article 359 of the criminal code, in 2018 Russian President Vladimir [said](https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2018/12/20/147797-putin-chvk-vagnera-ne-narushaet-rossiyskogo-zakonodatelstva) that Wagner does not break Russian law.

So Prigozhin’s promises to these prisoners also have a presidential pedigree – Russian presidential Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov [admitted on January 27](https://www.ft.com/content/82748bdd-5b34-4204-b3ad-d08da2c58982) that Putin is indeed issuing pardons to convicts who fight for Wagner, noting that one of them received a medal from the president for his “[heroism](https://www.ft.com/content/82748bdd-5b34-4204-b3ad-d08da2c58982)” in Ukraine.

Local media reported Wagner recruiters visiting prisons in every corner of Russia – [Tyumen](https://nashgorod.ru/news/2022-11-11/tyumenskih-zekov-verbovali-po-stahanovski-2586438), [Chelyabinsk](https://74.ru/text/gorod/2022/10/20/71751674/), [Kemerovo](https://ngs42.ru/text/politics/2022/11/23/71837525/), [the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug](https://muksun.fm/news/2022-11-30/zaklyuchennyh-iz-hmao-verbuyut-v-chvk-vagner-prigozhin-pobyval-v-dvuh-gorodah-2603317), and many others. RFE/RL’s [report](https://www.sibreal.org/a/kak-zeki-iz-koloniy-sibiri-popadayut-na-voynu-v-ukraine/32141615.html) from a prison in Primorsky Krai noted that over 100 prisoners are often enlisted in each recruitment trip. Prigozhin has also taken foreign citizens from Russia’s jails; one man from [Zambia](https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-prigozhin-says-zambian-student-who-died-ukraine-was-fighting-with-wagner-2022-11-29/) and one from [Tanzani...
