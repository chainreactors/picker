## Introduction

Some of the winning cryptographic schemes in the NIST standardization process belonging to the latex-based cryptography family are constructed from a problem called Learning With Errors (LWE).

Given a system of random linear equations describing a secret, the problem of Learning With Errors is based on the idea of hiding the value of the secret by adding noise (or error) to the system.

Introduced in 2005 by Israeli-American computer scientist and theoretical mathematician Oded Regev, LWE had a significant impact on postquantum cryptography from the very beginning
which earned Regev in 2018 the Gödel Prize, a prestigious award in the field of theoretical computer science.
