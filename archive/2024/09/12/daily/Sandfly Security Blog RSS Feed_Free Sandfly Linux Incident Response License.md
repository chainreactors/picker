Sandfly investigates Linux systems in seconds and the free license allows security teams to:

* Deploy our extensive compromise tactics detection.
* Use our agentless password auditor to find high risk accounts.
* Leverage our SSH Hunter to find, track, and audit SSH keys, who is using them, where they are being used, and much more.
* Utilize drift detection to find systems that are using unknown processes, users, scheduled tasks, files, and other unauthorized changes.
* Build custom detection modules to do tailored threat hunting.
* Investigate privately and discreetly as no data is ever sent to Sandfly or any third-party.

Dealing with an incident can be stressful, especially when many different versions and configurations of Linux are in play. Let Sandfly do the investigation and get answers in seconds. Reach out today with any questions. We are here to help.
