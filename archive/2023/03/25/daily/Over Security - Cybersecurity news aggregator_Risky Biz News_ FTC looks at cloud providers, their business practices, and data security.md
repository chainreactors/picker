The US Federal Trade Commission is [seeking comment](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-seeks-comment-business-practices-cloud-computing-providers-could-impact-competition-data) from the public on the business practices of cloud computing providers.

The FTC says it wants to understand the role and importance of cloud providers to the US economy and what kind of security risks emerge from the current model.

The FTC's action comes after [Politico reported](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/10/white-house-cloud-overhaul-00086595) two weeks ago that the White House was exploring the idea of regulating the cloud industry, fearing that some of their predatory business practices would lead to widespread national IT infrastructure outages and major cybersecurity incidents.

This appears to be that action, and the FTC is hitting all the major issues that security researchers, software engineers, and many other have raised about cloud providers over the years.

For example, the FTC is asking the public to share if they have the "ability" to negotiate their cloud computing contracts or if they're stuck in "take-it-or-leave-it standard contracts."

The FTC also wants to know if cloud providers "compete" to provide secure storage. While the FTC didn't say it, they most likely want to confirm that cloud providers offer generally insecure services and then scalp their customers for basic or adequate security features—something that the Risky Business podcast [highlighted years ago](https://risky.biz/soapbox56/).

FTC officials also want to know if cloud providers notify their customers about security breaches and misconfigurations. This, again, is a well-known gripe security experts have had with cloud providers. Cloud service providers have a well-known allergy and disdain to issuing CVE identifiers for security issues found in their services. They also rarely bother (*except in very rare cases*) to notify customers of vulnerabilities discovered in their services.

In addition, the FTC also wants to know if cloud providers use "incentives" to keep customers locked into their infrastructure, which would make customers and even entire industry sectors reliant on a cloud provider's capability to keep its infrastructure up, running, and safe.

The comment period will be open until May 22, 2023.

Since these public comment periods are wild, the FTC might get more varied feedback than it bargained for, especially since the tide of public opinion has been turning against cloud service providers and their predatory practices for a few years now. [*Insert joke about pressing the wrong button in an AWS dashboard and bankrupting your company within two hours.*]

### **Breaches and hacks**

**ChatGPT leak:** OpenAI says it fixed a bug in the ChatGPT AI chatbot that caused a small number of users to view the titles and past conversations of other users. The issue came to light earlier this week after ChatGPT users posted images of other people's conversations on social media. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [blamed](https://archive.ph/qDEAj) the issue on "a bug in an open source library."

**Lionsgate Play leaky server:** Movie studio Lionsgate has leaked some technical user data after it left an Elasticsearch server exposed on the internet without a password. Exposed data included the likes of user IP addresses, device details, user-agent strings, and URLs of streamed content, according to *[CyberNews](https://cybernews.com/security/lionsgate-data-leak/)*.

**Skylink attack:** Skylink, a major DTH and internet TV service provider in Czechia and Slovakia, [says](https://www.facebook.com/SkylinkCZ/posts/pfbid02EVijQARp5Fd1wdfUNztus7xZwVg3hLFPbKC7FNVcvAofPoGESSs9CmKAyzgNv5iUl) it was hit by a "hacker attack." The company did not disclose the nature of the incident but says it only impacted its "web and customer zones." Skylink says it expects some downtime this week as it works to repair the damage.

**LinusTechTips hack:** LinusTechTips, one of the most popular YouTube channels, was hacked and used to promote Elon Musk-themed crypto scams. YouTube's security team intervened and took down the entire channel roughly 35 minutes after the first reports. The channel is currently suspended but will most likely be restored to its legitimate owner once it's resecured and the channel's video inventory restored since almost six years worth of videos were deleted shortly after the hack.

**DPRK tries to phish Euler hacker:** North Korean hackers tried to phish the individual behind the recent Euler Finance hack in an attempt to hijack the stolen funds. The phishing attempt took place earlier this week and was [spotted](https://archive.ph/tAIZM) by Mudit Gupta, the CISO of blockchain company Polygon. Gupta says the phishing attempt consisted of [an on-chain message](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf0b3487dc443f1ef92b4fe27ff7f89e07588cdc0e2b37d50adb8158c697cea6) sent to the Euler hacker from a cryptocurrency address linked to the Ronin hack (*attributed by the FBI to the DPRK*). The message asked the Euler hacker to download a special tool and use their wallet's private key to decrypt and view a supposed message. Euler [urged](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1fd6d2e67a2ac4cf7c1718cc3058d5625171b95d66744801c97a4de54a41197b) the hacker not to download the tool and attempt to view the message. The company's warning comes as it began negotiating with the hacker about the return of the stolen funds, and execs feared the hacker (and themselves) would lose the bulk of the $197 million if they got phished by the North Koreans.

### **Government, politics, and policy**

**Chinese security products for Russia:** As part of the recent high-level meetings between Russian and Chinese officials in Moscow this week, the two governments signed several treaties of cooperation, including on cybersecurity topics. According to Russian news outlet [Octagon Media](https://octagon.media/novosti/poyavilis_podrobnosti_pro...
