# ACE Expands to Become a Lean and Mean Anti-Piracy Machine

With the addition of more than a dozen new members, the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE) will soon close the book on a record year and a string of coalition successes. Through agreements with domain registries, collaboration with governments, and partnerships with enforcement agencies, including Interpol, ACE hopes to continue down this path in the year ahead.

The Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment ([ACE](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/)) brought together well-known Hollywood companies including Disney, Warner Bros, NBCUniversal, media giants such as Sky and BBC, as well as streaming-based newcomers Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu.

In the years that followed several other media companies were added to the roster. This year alone, 18 new members were announced, bringing the [total count to 52](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/members/). Perhaps more importantly, the coalition’s scope and reach expanded too.

A major event in 2022 saw Qatari media company beIN join the coalition and with it, a new focus area for ACE – live sports streaming protection. Elsewhere, the global nature of the alliance was strengthened with new members from Asia, Latin America, and Europe.

## Explosive Growth

Looking back at the progress made over the past 12 months, ACE head Jan van Voorn highlights “explosive growth” as a key achievement. He believes that a broad coalition, with tentacles all over the globe, increases the overall effectiveness of its anti-piracy efforts.

“This growth dramatically increases ACE’s global network, including key partnerships with local law enforcement and other authorities, and its ability to shut down illegal piracy operations around the world,” Van Voorn tells us.

“Piracy is a global challenge that requires a global approach, so bringing members from all over the world into one coalition makes us more effective and impactful at hitting the right targets.”

Adding more members doesn’t magically increase the group’s effectiveness, of course. What it does, however, is open the door to collaboration with intermediaries, governments, and law enforcement agencies in other countries. This has been a key driver of many recent successes.

## Collaborating with Governments and Law Enforcement

Confidential agreements with domain registrars and registries, for example, help to efficiently take down domain names. In addition, advertising companies and payment processors help to cut off revenue to pirate sites and services, when appropriate.

“We continue to expand our impact through voluntary agreements with domain registries and registrars, fast-track procedures with social media companies, ad companies, payment processors, online marketplaces, etc., all over the globe. So, we work with all parties in the internet ecosystem,” Van Voorn says.

The same strategy applies to governments and law enforcement. ACE has partnered with Interpol and Europol, for example, and also has full-time team members embedded within the City of London Police and the U.S. Government’s National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center.

Forging these relationships takes time but they eventually start to pay off. These collaborations are the key to unlocking the true potential of its alliance, ACE believes. This is a two-way street, as ACE also assists governments in local enforcement efforts.

“Collaboration enables ACE members and the local content industry to speak to government officials with one voice about the need to better prioritize copyright enforcement. And governments are beginning to listen,” Van Voorn notes.

## Lean and Mean

A larger organization doesn’t automatically make an alliance more effective, especially if interests and priorities begin to conflict. From the outside, however, it appears that ACE, which is led by the Motion Picture Association, is running a tight ship.

Van Voorn believes that growing the alliance will make it more streamlined and effective. In the past, the anti-piracy efforts of media companies were siloed, even though the piracy threats they face are very similar.

ACE’s overall strategy is to collaborate, share knowledge and resources, and then target the piracy problem as a united front.

“There was a lot of duplication of effort, for many companies around the world, and we saw that we needed to do more together to avoid that duplication and build a global collation to deal with these issues in a much more cost-effective, but more importantly, in an impactful way.”

This global approach helps to expand the alliance’s reach. It can easily shift focus between continents and share information back and forth.

“ACE’s global network enables us to access pirate operators’ information quickly and escalate and streamline any new workstreams from a specific country or region to the rest of the world,” Van Voorn says.

ACE typically starts by identifying and locating targets, and then prioritizing the big fish – larger piracy players ideally. The next step is to determine when and where to carry out potential enforcement actions, often with help from authorities.

“The hierarchical nature of the piracy ecosystem means that when we take down the world’s largest piracy services, the ripple effect ensures that the lower-tier piracy services are also impacted.”

A good example of an enforcement effort with a broad impact was the [shutdown of HDFoxCDN](https://torrentfreak.com/ace-shuts-down-pirate-cdn-service-and-ymovies-221007/), a Brazil-based pirate video CDN that offered access to a broad library of pirated content. With minimal effort, pirate sites could use its API to embed tens of thousands of titles.

## Piercing the Anonymity Veil

Looking ahead to 2023, Van Voorn says that ACE will continue where it left off by adding more members in the new year.

“ACE will continue its expansion, both by adding global members and expanding our focus on live sports content. Our enforcement actions will be designed to obtain the most significant impact by grouping actions by tactic, time, region, or language.”

New enforcement actions against [“Piracy as a Service” (PaaS)](https://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-and-netflix-signal-piracy-as-a-service-paas-as-new-threat-vector/) targets are already in the works. Taking down illegal streaming services also remains a priority.

The key objective is to identify the ‘anonymous’ people behind these illicit operations. To do so, ACE will call on investigators and lawyers all over the globe to force breakthroughs.

“Piracy operators use various technologies in an attempt to create anonymity. These people do business online and try to hide their identities. And as they...
