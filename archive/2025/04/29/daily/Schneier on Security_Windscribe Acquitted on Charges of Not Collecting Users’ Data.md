## Windscribe Acquitted on Charges of Not Collecting Users’ Data

The company doesn’t keep logs, so couldn’t [turn over data](https://hackread.com/court-dismisses-criminal-charges-against-vpn-executive-no-log-policy/):

> Windscribe, a globally used privacy-first VPN service, announced today that its founder, Yegor Sak, has been fully acquitted by a court in Athens, Greece, following a two-year legal battle in which Sak was personally charged in connection with an alleged internet offence by an unknown user of the service.
>
> The case centred around a Windscribe-owned server in Finland that was allegedly used to breach a system in Greece. Greek authorities, in cooperation with INTERPOL, traced the IP address to Windscribe’s infrastructure and, unlike standard international procedures, proceeded to initiate criminal proceedings against Sak himself, rather than pursuing information through standard corporate channels.

Per ‘unlike standard international procedures, proceeded to initiate criminal proceedings against Sak himself, rather than pursuing information through standard corporate channels.’

Sorry to say but like ABBA claims in

‘being like a fool PLAYING BY THE RULE’

there are no rules aka international and domestic laws which provide you guarantee you are not a fool playing by them rather opposite: rule of jungle covered by thin layer of procedures – the winner takes it all by money of force.

That is what you need to know not what you want to hear – as PM Brawn of UK said to Parliament many years ago. Please don’t delete post. I guess many will agree on my point. Can we handle the truth? The ugly truth?

Abba? Talk about a flashback! 1980 the year I graduated from H.S. I had way more hair then!
As for the article; way to go Windscribe!

Either the Greek law make the owner and/or renter of the Public IP Address responsible for any usage of the TCP/IP network through it, or not.

I am a law abiding citizen, and understand the need to be able to investigate and have access to a lot of information under the control of the Justice system through judges.

But if we make everyone responsible for any usage of the Public IP Address they own or rent, this might turn private companies into censoring/banning monsters for their own security, without Justice oversight. It’s a slippery slope.
Privacy and freedom would obviously suffer.

I have no idea how to create a balance, and in fact I am pretty sure there’s no balance possible satisfying everyone, not even the majority of people.

Taking down a non-logging VPN is *NOT* a solution.

But on the other side, maybe we could have public-key encrypted logs (you know pseudo-random key, encrypted with the public key, to encrypt a log entry), with the corresponding private key detained by authorities and access to encrypted logs (and thus clear text logs) controlled by the Justice system through judges.

Naturally this is theoretical: at some point some private keys will be leaked, breaching privacy. So no-one will be assured their traffic is partially private.

@iAPX: The task of investigating, collecting evidence and surveiling suspects lies with the police under warrant oversight by the justice system. If we force everyone to collect evidence on everyone under penalty, we make everyone a policeperson and create not even a police state but a police society. That is, soviet Russia on steroids. It does not matter if the evidence is encrypted or not.

Two inmates of a soviet labor camp sit in a barrack:
– For what were you arrested?
– For laziness.
– ???
– One night I was drinking with another guy and we were telling jokes about Stalin. I was lazy and I thought I would go to NKVD in the morning and denunciate him. The bastard went to NKVD that night!!!

@ ALL,

This is a very old argument going back to before any form of electrical / electronic communication.

The two ends of the argument are,

Officially unknowing and full liability of the “carrier of the communications”.

It’s why those “officially unknowing” are classified as “common –law– carrier –services–“,

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier>

Note the comment in the first paragraph,

> *“A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body, which has usually been granted “ministerial authority” by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.”*

In the past with “letter and parcel services” each nation operated it’s own licenced and regulated “Postal Services”.

Cross border carrying was always “terminated at customs” such that duties and tariffs could be assessed and charged and other import or export legislation applied.

The advent of electromechanical communications caused no end of issues and is in part reason for the very strange ways phone charges are reconned.

The advent of data communications over “radio circuits” caused the next set of rules including notably for “encryption”. But the legislative issues got worse with data communications in a “packet based” rather than “circuit based” network caused even more issues such as data could come over two or more physical networks from two or more legal jurisdictions…

The result of which is most modern data commun...
