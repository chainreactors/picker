Ever wonder what happens in the digital world every time you blink? Here's something wild - hackers launch about 2,200 attacks every single day, which means someone's trying to break into a system somewhere every 39 seconds.

And get this - while we're all worried about regular hackers, there are now AI systems out there that can craft phishing emails so convincingly, that even cybersecurity experts have trouble spotting them. What's even crazier? Some of the latest malware is like a digital chameleon - it literally watches how you try to catch it and changes its behavior to slip right past your defenses.

Pretty mind-bending stuff, right? This week's roundup is packed with eye-opening developments that'll make you see your laptop in a whole new light.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**T-Mobile Spots Hackers Trying to Break In:** U.S. telecom service provider T-Mobile caught some suspicious activity on their network recently - basically, [someone was trying to sneak into their systems](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/us-telecom-giant-t-mobile-detects.html). The good news? They spotted it early and no customer data was stolen. While T-Mobile isn't pointing fingers directly, cybersecurity experts think they know who's behind it - a hacking group nicknamed 'Salt Typhoon,' which apparently has ties to China. What makes this really interesting is that these hackers have a brand new trick up their sleeve: they're using a previously unknown backdoor tool called [GHOSTSPIDER](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/chinese-hackers-use-ghostspider-malware.html). Think of it as a skeleton key that no one knew existed until now. They've been using this same tool to target telecom companies across Southeast Asia.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Prototype UEFI Bootkit Targeting Linux Detected:** Bootkits refer to a type of malware that is designed to infect a computer's boot loader or boot process. In doing so, the idea is to execute malicious code before even initializing the operating system and bypass security measures, effectively granting the attackers absolute control over the system. While bootkits discovered to date have only targeted Windows machines, the discovery of [Bootkitty](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/researchers-discover-bootkitty-first.html) indicates that it's no longer the case. That said, it's assessed to be a proof-of-concept (PoC) and there is no evidence that it has been put to use in real-world attacks.
* **Avast Anti-Rootkit Driver Used to Disarm Security Software:** A new malware campaign is [leveraging](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/researchers-uncover-malware-using-byovd.html) a technique called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) to obtain elevated privileges and terminate security-related processes by making use of the legitimate Avast Anti-Rootkit driver (aswArPot.sys). The exact initial access vector used to drop the malware is currently not clear. It's also not known what the end goal of these attacks are, who are the targets, or how widespread they are.
* **RomCom Exploits Mozilla Fire and Windows 0-Days:** The Russia-aligned threat actor known as RomCom [chained](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/romcom-exploits-zero-day-firefox-and.html) two zero-day security flaws in Mozilla Firefox (CVE-2024-9680, CVSS score: 9.8) and Microsoft Windows (CVE-2024-49039, CVSS score: 8.8) as part of attacks designed to deliver the eponymous backdoor on victim systems without requiring any user interaction. The vulnerabilities were fixed by Mozilla and Microsoft in October and November 2024, respectively.
* **LockBit and Hive Ransomware Operator Arrested in Russia:** Mikhail Pavlovich Matveev, a Russian national who is wanted in the U.S. in connection with LockBit and Hive ransomware operations, has been [arrested and charged](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/wanted-russian-cybercriminal-linked-to.html) in the country for developing malicious programs that can encrypt files and for seeking ransom payments in exchange for a decryption key. While he is unlikely to be extradited to the U.S., the development comes a little over a month after four members of the now-defunct REvil ransomware operation were sentenced to several years in prison in Russia.
* **New Botnet Linked to DDoS Campaign:** A script kiddie likely of Russian origin has been using publicly available malware tools from GitHub and exploits targeting weak credentials, configurations, and known security flaws to [assemble](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/matrix-botnet-exploits-iot-devices-in.html) a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet capable of disruption on a global scale. The threat actor has established a store of sorts on Telegram, where customers can buy different DDoS plans and services in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment.
