SAP Readiness Check for SuccessFactors solutions

Since it became generally available in September 2022, more than 100 customers of all sizes have run this SAP Readiness Check, and the pace of adoption has been accelerating.

We are very pleased that SAP partners are now recommending the use of this SAP Readiness Check on behalf of our mutual customers.  When we created the tool, we were not sure whether partners would adopt it.  After all, we automated tasks that were previously billable work.  However, partners have been very quick to embrace the Readiness Check around the world.  They acknowledge that having a consistent, scalable, automated tool for determining how SAP ERP HCM customers are configured and running today is far better than trying to collect the information manually.

So, why is the Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors so valuable to our customers, and the partners who support them?

The US-based airline is using it to identify legacy HCM customizations that could potentially be retired by leveraging SuccessFactors native capabilities.  Many of their 4,000+ custom HCM programs can be retired in favor of using standard Employee Central functionality to support automated grade step progression, based on collective bargaining agreements with their unionized employees.

The German chemical company identified more than 350,000 custom programs in their environment and are in process of identifying which can be retired with a move to Employee Central.

The Australian Public Sector org identified more than 1,000 interfaces and integrations in their legacy system.  They are now looking at how moving to SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central can help them to reduce this figure by 20% or more. Just imagine the subsequent cost savings that come with a reduction of supporting and maintaining 200 integrations on a yearly basis…

The UK-based University identified that they had over 50,000 wage types for 100,000 employees.  They are looking to simplify and standardize their pay practices to gain efficiencies, as well as potentially deploying the Payroll Control Center to automate process quality checks as part of a migration to SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll.

While these large organizations may see the greatest opportunities for savings, we’ve also had customers with as few as 1,500 employees run the SAP Readiness Check and identify similar benefits (although on a different scale, of course).

What can the SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors solutions do for you?  Please check out this [Readiness Check explainer video](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2022/12/5e3a59f3-557e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) for a quick overview, in under 2 minutes.
