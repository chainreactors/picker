# SSHniff - An SSH Metadata Harvester

## Overview

This tool was written as a part of my Bachelor thesis, which was a research project on the SSH protocol and specifically its susceptibility to a metadata-based attack, where keystroke latencies are used to obtain information about the underlying command, breaching confidentiality.

This attack was first introduced in 2002, in a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2907598_Timing_Analysis_of_Keystrokes_and_Timing_Attacks_on_SSH) by Song, Wagner, and Dawn, targeting the SSH-1 protocol. My research and this tool revive the attack, focusing on recent OpenSSH versions.

## Installation

The tool is found in the `sshniff` directory and...
