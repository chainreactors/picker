Turns out Microsoft's latest patch job might need a patch of its own, again. This time, the culprit is a mysterious inetpub folder quietly deployed by Redmond, now hijacked by a security researcher to break Windows updates.

The folder, typically `c:\inetpub`, reappeared on Windows systems [in April](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/14/windows_update_inetpub/) as part of Microsoft's mitigation for CVE-2025-21204, an exploitable elevation-of-privileges flaw within Windows Process Activation. Rather than patching code directly, Redmond simply pre-created the folder to block a symlink attack path. For many administrators, the reappearance of this old IIS haunt raised eyebrows, especially since the mitigation did little beyond ensuring the folder existed.

For at least one security researcher, in this case Kevin Beaumont, the fix also presented an opportunity to hunt for more vulnerabilities. After poking around, he [discovered](https://doublepulsar.com/microsofts-patch-for-cve-2025-21204-symlink-vulnerability-introduces-another-symlink-vulnerability-9ea085537741) that the workaround introduced a new flaw of its own, triggered using the [`mklink` command](https://lea...
