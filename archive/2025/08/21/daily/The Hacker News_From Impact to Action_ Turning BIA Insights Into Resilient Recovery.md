Modern businesses face a rapidly evolving and expanding threat landscape, but what does this mean for your business? It means a growing number of risks, along with an increase in their frequency, variety, complexity, severity, and potential business impact.

The real question is, "How do you tackle these rising threats?" The answer lies in having a robust BCDR strategy. However, to build a rock-solid BCDR plan, you must first conduct a business impact analysis (BIA). Read on to learn what BIA is and how it forms the foundation of an effective BCDR strategy.

## What Is a BIA?

A BIA is a structured approach to identifying and evaluating the operational impact of disruptions across departments. Disruptive incidents or emergencies can occur due to several factors, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters or supply chain issues.

Conducting a BIA helps identify critical functions for a business's operations and survival. Businesses can use insights from BIA to develop strategies to resume those functions first to maintain core services in the event of a crisis.

It informs key priorities, such as [RTO/RPO](https://www.datto.com/blog/the-importance-of-rpo-and-rto/) SLAs, and aligns technological capabilities proportionally with the level of threat and risk, which are critical for continuity and recovery planning.

### The IT Leader's Role in Enabling an Effective BIA

While business continuity, risk, or compliance teams often lead business impact analysis, IT leaders play a crucial role in making it work. They bring critical visibility into system dependencies and infrastructure across the organization. They provide valuable insights into what's technically feasible when disaster strikes. IT leaders also play a key part in validating recovery commitments, whether the set RTO and RPO goals can be achieved within the current infrastructure, or if upgrades are needed.

IT leaders operationalize the recovery strategy with appropriate tooling, from selecting and configuring DR tools to automating failover processes. This helps ensure the recovery plan is executable, integrated into everyday operations, tested and ready to scale with the business.

In SMBs or IT-led orgs, IT often leads the BIA by necessity. Because of their cross-functional view of operations, infrastructure and business continuity, IT leaders are uniquely positioned to drive the BIA.

***Pro Tip:*** *IT's involvement ensures the BIA isn't just a business document; it becomes an actionable recovery plan.*

## Identifying Threat Vectors

Before you can protect what matters, you must understand what threatens it. Assess the threat landscape facing your organization and tailor your response plan based on industry, geographic risk and operational profile.

Here are the key threat vectors to consider:

* **Cyberthreats:** From ransomware to insider threats and credential compromise, cyberattacks are growing in complexity, frequency and severity. One weak point in your defense systems can lead to massive data loss and operational downtime.
* **Natural Disasters:** Events like hurricanes, wildfires, floods and earthquakes strike fast and hard. The effects of these events can ripple across regions, disrupting supply chains, data centers and physical offices.
* **Operational Disruptions:** Unexpected outages due to power failure, software bugs or network downtime can bring daily operations to a grinding halt if you aren't prepared.
* **Human Error:** Anyone, including your best employees, can make mistakes. Accidental deletions or misconfigurations can lead to costly downtime.
* **Regulatory and Compliance Risks:** Data breaches and data loss can not only hurt your business financially but also lead to legal issues and compliance violations.

### Industry-specific risks

Every sector operates in its own unique way and relies on different systems to stay up and running. Certain threats can hinder those systems and core functions more than others. Here are a few examples to guide you in identifying and prioritizing threats based on industry.

#### **Healthcare**

If you operate in the healthcare sector, ransomware and system availability must be your top priorities since any disruption or downtime can directly impact patient care and safety. As regulations like HIPAA get more stringent, data protection and privacy become critical to meet compliance requirements.

#### **Education**

Phishing and account compromise attacks targeting staff and students are common in the education sector. Additionally, the rise of hybrid learning environments has expanded the threat surface, stretching across student endpoints, SaaS platforms and on-premises servers. To make matters more challenging, many institutions operate with limited IT staff and resources, making them more vulnerable to human error, slower threat detection and delayed response times.

#### **Manufacturing and Logistics**

In manufacturing and logistics, operational technology (OT) uptime is mission-critical as downtime caused by power failures, network outages or system disruptions can halt production lines and delay deliveries. Unlike tradit...
