A criminal investigation into Twitter has been [initiated by French prosecutors](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-opens-criminal-probe-into-x-for-algorithm-manipulation/ "LInk to Politico article"), over allegations that its algorithm is manipulated for the purposes of ‚Äúforeign interference.‚Äù

The [probe](https://www.tribunal-de-paris.justice.fr/sites/default/files/2025-07/2025-07-11%20-%20CP%20X.pdf "LInk to announcement") focuses on claims that Twitter‚Äôs algorithms were altered to distort user discourse and potentially mislead users. Hmm‚Ä¶ as if!!!

Earlier this year Elon Musk‚Äôs site was [accused](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-opens-probe-into-musks-x-over-algorithm/ "LInk to Politico article") of spreading ‚Äúan enormous amount of hateful, racist, anti-LGBT+ and homophobic political content, which aims to skew the democratic debate in France.‚Äù

The criminal investigation is also looking into if Twitter/X fraudulently extracted data from users.

I‚Äôd like to see more organisations (and indeed governments) ditch Twitter/X permanently, and go somewhere more positive instead.
