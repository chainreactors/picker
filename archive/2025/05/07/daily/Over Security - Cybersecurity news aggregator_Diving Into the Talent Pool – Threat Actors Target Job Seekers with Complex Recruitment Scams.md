## Key Data

Are you in the market for a new job? Talent scouts arenât the only ones aggressively recruiting. Netcraft has observed a recent spike in recruitment scams, uncovering significant impact from three unique adversaries, each leveraging different tactics to target job seekers:

* Threat actor #1 â Impersonates employers in the tech vertical using advance fee fraud (AFF) tactics
* Threat actor #2 â Impersonates a logistics recruitment agency using similar AFF tactics:

  + Localized scams focused on 18 geographies
  + 63,000 people targeted in the U.S. alone
* Threat actor #3 â Impersonates the Government of Singapore to steal victimsâ personal identity number and Telegram account details

According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in 2023, [more than $500m was lost to job-related fraud](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/TheBigViewAllSentinelReports/TopReports) in the U.S., more than double the 2022 figure ($200m). It is anticipated that 2024 will beat that record. We have felt this increase across Netcraftâs business, with employees in the U.S., U.K., and Australia receiving lure messages for recruitment scams throughout the year. And weâre not alone.

Several economic and technosocial factors â greater competition, lower wages, the cost-of-living crisis, the rise of zero-hours gig work, etc. â have created an ideal climate for criminals to exploit job seekers. This is especially true for those in lower economic communities.

This article reviews the exploitsâ common components, adversary insights, the proliferation of these scams, and how to protect yourself and your employees.

## Dissecting the Scam

Among the most common scams observed are task scams. Letâs break these down into their parts, exposing how and why they can be so effective at tricking eager targets out of time, work product, and money.

### What Are Task Scams?

Task scams are a specific form of recruitment scam (or âjob scamâ), which impersonate legitimate employers or recruiters to financially exploit victims. In some cases, they may also attempt to obtain personally identifiable information (PII) for fraudulent use. These scams typically assign victims âtasksâ or âprojectsâ under the guise of legitimate work or as part of the recruitment process, often with promises of payment or a job offer upon completion.

Task scams typically engage their targets via messaging platforms, often directing the individual to a fake website. These typically unfold quickly, completing the fraud within a few days or weeks.

Threat actors posing as recruiters contact potential victims with offers of a job or other source of freelance income. Flexible terms and/or simple tasks (e.g., watching videos for money) are used to make these opportunities more appealing. To complete the task, users must pay an upfront fee â this is the catch.

Once a victim has sent their payment, they can proceed to complete the assigned tasks. Victims may continue this process several times, enabling the threat actor to repeatedly extract money and free labor (which can be monetized) from the victim and increase their returns. Once the victim notices the lack of reimbursement and challenges the process, the threat actor will typically end their correspondence.

### Lure Messages

Every scam starts with the lure. Netcraft has observed the following messaging channels used to lure victims (in order of prevalence): WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, RCS, and SMS.

In many cases, threat actors will engage potential victims with two fake personas:

* The first persona sets the trap, making an initial outreach, hooking the target into the scam
* The second executes and extracts, providing additional details on the tasks or role they must perform

This approach likely enables the threat actor to achieve persistence and scale while effectively managing high volumes of concurrent scams.

### Why Persistence Matters

Phone numbers and accounts performing high-volume, outbound communications are more likely to be identified and disrupted by platform operators. By separating these âburnerâ personas, adversaries can prevent successful engagements from disruption mid-scam, increasing their efficacy and return on investment.

### Threat Actor Roles

Cybercriminals mostly use manual communications for these scams, which require real phones and real humans. Splitting the workload can optimize their activities and manage resources efficiently. This aThis allows threat actors to focus on high-return activities, likely outsourcing the first outreach to other groups who provide the initial contact as a service.

Task Scams coerce their targets by promising flexible hours and lucrative rates. Because gig work and flexible working schedules are desirable to many job seekers, it becomes a clear opportunity for scammers looking to exploit individuals open to these job prospects.

### Inside a Job Scam â Threat Actor #1: Celadon and Softserv

The following walkthrough illustrates the step-by-step process a threat actor used, posing as a technology company to extract funds from their victims.

The attack begins with the recipient, this example from the U.K., receiving an unsolicited WhatsApp message from a Canadian phone number and the display name âQuinn.â The adversary positions themself as a recruitment consultant from LinkedIn who has purportedly received a job application from the recipient.
