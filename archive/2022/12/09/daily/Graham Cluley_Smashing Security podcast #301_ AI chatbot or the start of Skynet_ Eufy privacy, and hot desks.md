An AI chatbot is causing a stir ‚Äì both impressing and terrifying users in equal measure. A security researcher discovers that a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù cam that doesn‚Äôt use the internet is err.. using the internet. And university students revolt over under-the-belt surveillance.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of the award-winning ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Host Unknown‚Äôs Thom Langford.
