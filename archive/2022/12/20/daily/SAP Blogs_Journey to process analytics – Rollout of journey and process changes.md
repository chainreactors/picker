The enormous investments in digital transformation and the need for agility to sense and respond to changes quickly highlight the key role that process management plays in successful process transformation. In the previous blog posts of this series, we have addressed a multitude of [necessary steps for successful journey-to-process analytics](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/05/12/10-steps-for-successful-journey-to-process-analytics-bringing-together-the-worlds-of-process-analysis-and-design-and-experience/) such as [better modeling customer journeys](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/29/whats-in-a-successful-journey-leverage-journey-modeling-to-achieve-process-and-experience-excellence-at-scale/) and [process models](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/10/5-reasons-why-process-modeling-is-the-operational-backbone-of-your-journey-to-process-analytics-initiatives/), the identification of [metrics to be monitored](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/16/key-lessons-to-identify-and-monitor-your-operational-and-experience-metrics/), and the mapping of journeys to processes[.](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/23/leverage%E2%80%AFjourney%E2%80%AFmodeling-to-operationalize-the-experiences%E2%80%AF/) All this work comes to nothing if we don’t enact the identified changes. As a result of the data analysis, start making real improvements to your processes, customer journeys, or even organizational structure.

While stability and control are crucial in process management, so are flexibility, leanness, and continuity. For Journey-to-Process analytics and ultimately, for process transformations and journey model improvements to be successful, **organizations need agility to deal with continuous and significant changes**.

The process of process change comprises necessary steps to be conducted before, while, and after the actual change takes place. A successful rollout of changes requires:

1. well-defined processes and journeys across organizational units that are captured quickly and accurately by modeling capabilities as well as utilization of process data obtained from the live source systems,

2. analytical and collaborative capabilities in identifying and evaluating change  opportunities, and

3. embracing an appropriate [organizational setup](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/06/19/how-to-get-your-company-in-shape-for-journey-to-process-analytics/) and a corporate culture that has “change” in its DNA. In the following, more details of these three aspects are explained.

**Well-defined processes – quick and accurate**

SAP Signavio is enabling organizations to model their journeys and processes collaboratively and manage their process repositories in a cloud-based environment. These capabilities specifically support having clear process definitions and enabling collaboration while supporting the shared understanding of processes across the units (read more about process modeling [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/10/5-reasons-why-process-modeling-is-the-operational-backbone-of-your-journey-to-process-analytics-initiatives/)). Reducing time to capture knowledge throughout the organization and modeling the as-is process is an important element in enabling timely understanding and analysis that is required to identify and evaluate changes.

Process and journey modeling should not be limited to those who understand or are comfortable with specific modeling notations. It is also important to have in mind that processes are not only in the minds of process modeling experts. Many business users are running the processes and are carrying them out in multiple ways thus capturing their knowledge is crucial. In addition, the adoption of changes is more sustainable and significantly higher when all relevant stakeholders are involved in shaping the changes. Quick modeling capability enables process modeling for everyone and process owners can leverage this capability to capture the knowledge of every process collaborator within the organization.
