# 4 ways to protect your privacy while scrolling

Posted: January 23, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Privacy is a right that is yours to value and defend. [Article 8 of the Human Rights Act](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights-act/article-8-respect-your-private-and-family-life) protects your right to respect for your private and family life. One of the pillars of the article is that [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) about you (including official records, photographs, letters, diaries, and medical records) should be kept securely and not be shared without your permission, except under certain circumstances.

But we know that information is not always protected as much as it should be, and it seems like we hear about a new [data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach) every day. It’s up to us to defend our privacy as much as we can online, so here are a few suggestions on how you can best protect your privacy when scrolling online:

## 1. Consider what you share about yourself

Many of us are leaking information about ourselves and our online behavior almost constantly.

When posting online, consider what information you find valuable and what you are happy for everyone to know? As soon as you know where you draw your personal line, you can start working on protecting your privacy.

As a guide, if you wouldn’t say it in person, don’t put it online.

## 2. Check your browser settings

Your browser is your gateway to the internet. Unfortunately, few of them have ideal privacy and security settings set by default, even if they’re present.

So it’s a good idea to go ahead and tinker with your browser’s settings, carefully making sure that options are set in a way that are acceptable to you, privacy-wise.

You can read about some popular browsers’ privacy settings here:

* [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114836) privacy settings
* [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/privacy-and-security) privacy and security settings
* [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy-bb8174ba-9d73-dcf2-9b4a-c582b4e640dd), browsing data, and privacy
* [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-bn/guide/safari/sfri35610/mac) privacy preferences

While you’re reviewing your settings, you may want to clear out your browser history. Then review your extensions, and remove those you hardly, or have never, use. Vulnerable or malicious add-ons can easily become a privacy and security risk.

Do a browser settings review on your mobile devices as well. You can learn more about them here:

* [Chrome for Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114836?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en-GB&oco=0) privacy settings
* [Safari for iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210675) privacy

Now, if you find that what’s in there by default lacks the privacy and security settings you hope for, it’s time to ditch that browser for a new one.

Thankfully, most (if not all) desktop browsers that made taking care of your privacy their business, too, have mobile versions. Start by looking up Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and even the Tor Browser on the Google Play and Apple App stores.
