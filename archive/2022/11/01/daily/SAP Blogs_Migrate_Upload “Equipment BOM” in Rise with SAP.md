**Introduction:**

Hi Guys,

I am working as a SAP S/4HANA **Plant Maintenance Consultant**. In this blog, we will see about the data migration of **Equipment BOM** in SAP S/4HANA system.

First let’s have a short i**ntroduction** and **overview** of the functionality of the S/4HANA migration cockpit.

The SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit is a tool designed for customers who have just SAP S/4HANA and want to transfer the business data from SAP to non-SAP Systems. It is part of **Both SAP S/4HANA and SAP S/4HANA Cloud** and can be launched using the “Migrate Your Data “app in the Fiori launchpad. With migration cockpit you can migrate your master data and transactional data to SAP S/4HANA.

In this blog, let’s discuss about data migration for Uploading **Equipment BOM** which identifies all the replacement spare parts for an equipment, so that maintenance engineers can quickly identify the right part required.

**Data Migration Steps**

The process of data migration follows a sequence of six Steps

We will see in detail each of these Steps:

* Select migration objects

* Populate and Upload tables

* Mapping Tasks

* Simulate

* Migrate Data

**Select migration object:** In this Step you must select which object you want to migrate in your project.

**Populate and Upload Tables:** The XML template files must be downloaded and filled. After that, it must be uploaded in the “**Migrate your data**” app.

**Prepare:** After uploading the file, the system will validate the table structure to ensure that the data is filled according to the template which was generated by the system.

**Mapping Tasks:** This Step  requires a manual confirmation between the data inserted into the files and the data configured in the S/4HANA system

**Simulate:** This is the final Step  before uploading the XML file data into S/4HANA tables the system will validate the information is correct and check if any error occurs.

**Migrate Data:** The cockpit will execute the data load. After completing this Step , you will be able to see the data you uploaded.
