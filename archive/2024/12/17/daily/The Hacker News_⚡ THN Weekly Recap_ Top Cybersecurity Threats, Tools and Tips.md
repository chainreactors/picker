If you've been too busy to keep track, now is the perfect time to catch up on what you may have missed.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Cleo Vulnerability Comes Under Active Exploitation ‚Äî** A critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-50623) in Cleo's file transfer software‚ÄîHarmony, VLTrader, and LexiCom‚Äîhas been [actively exploited by cybercriminals](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/cleo-file-transfer-vulnerability-under.html), creating major security risks for organizations worldwide. The flaw enables attackers to execute code remotely without authorization by exploiting an unrestricted file upload feature. Cybersecurity firms like Huntress and Rapid7 observed mass exploitation beginning December 3, 2024, where attackers used PowerShell commands and Java-based tools to compromise systems, affecting over 1,300 exposed instances across industries. The ransomware group Termite is suspected in these attacks, using advanced malware similar to tactics previously seen from the Cl0p ransomware group.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Iranian Hackers Deploy New IOCONTROL Malware ‚Äî** Iran-affiliated threat actors have been linked to a new custom malware called [IOCONTROL](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/iran-linked-iocontrol-malware-targets.html) that's designed to target IoT and operational technology (OT) environments in Israel and the United States. It's capable of executing arbitrary operating system commands, scanning an IP range in a specific port, and deleting itself. IOCONTROL has been used to attack IoT and SCADA devices of various types including IP cameras, routers, PLCs, HMIs, firewalls, and more from different vendors such as Baicells, D-Link, Hikvision, Red Lion, Orpak, Phoenix Contact, Teltonika, and Unitronics.
* **Law Enforcement Operations Take Down Several Criminal Services** ‚Äî A series of law enforcement operations across the world have led to the shutdown of the [Rydox](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/fbi-busts-rydox-marketplace-with-7600.html) marketplace and [27 sites](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/europol-dismantles-27-ddos-attack.html) that peddled distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack services to other criminal actors. In a related development, authorities from Germany announced that they disrupted a [malware operation called BADBOX](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/germany-disrupts-badbox-malware-on.html) that came preloaded on at least 30,000 internet-connected devices sold across the country.
* **U.S. Charges Chinese Hacker for Sophos Firewall Attacks** ‚Äî The U.S. government on Tuesday unsealed charges against Chinese national [Guan Tianfeng](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/us-charges-chinese-hacker-for.html) (aka gbigmao and gxiaomao) for allegedly breaking into thousands of Sophos firewall devices globally in April 2020. Guan has been accused of developing and testing a zero-day security vulnerability (CVE-2020-12271) used to conduct the attacks against Sophos firewalls. The exploit is estimated to have been used to infiltrate about 81,000 firewalls.
* **New Attack Technique Exploits Windows UI Automation (UIA) to Bypass Detection** ‚Äî New research has found that it's possible for malware installed on a device to exploit a Windows accessibility framework called [UI Automation](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/new-malware-technique-could-exploit.html) (UIA) to perform a wide range of malicious activities without tipping off endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. In order for this attack to work, all an adversary needs to do is convince a user to run a program that uses UI Automation. This can then pave the way for command execution, leading to data theft and phishing attacks.
* **New Spyware Linked to Chinese Police Bureaus** ‚Äî A novel surveillance software program dubbed [EagleMsgSpy](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/chinese-eaglemsgspy-spyware-found.html) is likely being used by Chinese police departments as a lawful intercept tool to gather a wide range of information from mobile devices since at least 2017. While only Android versions of the tool have been discovered to date, it's believed that there exists an iOS variant as well. The installation appears to require physical access to a target device in order to activate the information-gathering operation.
* **New PUMAKIT Rootkit Detected in the Wild** ‚Äî Unknown threat actors are using a sophisticated Linux rootkit called [PUMAKIT](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/new-linux-rootkit-pumakit-uses-advanced.html) that makes use of advanced stealth mechanisms to hide its presence and maintain communication with command-and-control servers. It's equipped...
