# Ruckus Unleashed: Multiple vulnerabilities exploited

This blog post describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the firmware of Ruckus Unleashed and ZoneDirector. The vulnerabilities were found and reported to CommScope by René Ammerlaan, a guest writer for this blog post. I will take you through all the vulnerabilities and demonstrate how they can be exploited by an attacker.

Related CVE:

* CVE-2025-46116
* CVE-2025-46117
* CVE-2025-46118
* CVE-2025-46119
* CVE-2025-46120
* CVE-2025-46121
* CVE-2025-46122
* CVE-2025-46123
* CVE-2025-XXXXX (CVE request pending)

## Background

Ruckus Unleashed is a standalone network management solution from CommScope for access points and switches, commonly deployed in residential and small business networks. The control logic is embedded in every Ruckus access point, removing the need for a separate ZoneDirector or SmartZone appliance. In the Unleashed network one of the access points will be designated as the Master AP, which allows the Master AP to act as the network controller and manage Ruckus ICX switches and access points inside the network. The Master AP exposes a management interface by SSH and HTTPS, allowing an administrator to monitor and manage all network components from a central location. The HTTPS management interface is based on EmbedThis Appweb software, and utilizes Embedded JavaScript Template (EJS) files to generate the HTML page server-side. These template files expose privileged controller functions to the web and mobile clients by invoking the Delegate function, which serializes its parameters and sends them over a UNIX domain socket from the webs process to the emfd process. Based on the first argument, the emfd process will resolve the internal function address and execute the function. The management interface is also reachable via SSH, allowing the administrator to make configuration changes within a restricted CLI environment. Standard Linux commands are restricted to prevent unauthorized users from inadvertently or maliciously modifying the system configuration. Because Ruckus Unleashed is based on the ZoneDirector, most vulnerabilities are also applicable for the ZoneDirector controller.

## Vulnerabilities

In total, nine distinct vulnerabilities were found, including an authentication bypass, a hard-coded password for FTP, multiple command injection and format string vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be chained together by unauthenticated users to obtain remote code execution. While some vulnerabilities remain confined within the restricted CLI or admin interface, others may allow an attacker to jailbreak the device and obtain a root shell. While most vulnerabilities require access to the Ruckus Unleashed management interface, one interesting attack vector allows exploiting a format string vulnerability using a single DHCP request sent from the (guest) WiFi network.

All vulnerabilities have been reported to CommScope and addressed in Unleashed `200.15.6.212.27` and `200.18.7.1.323` or later, and in ZoneDirector `10.5.1.0.282` or later. For `CVE-2025-46120`, this firmware mitigates all publicly demonstrated exploit paths, but a potential residual vector remains under investigation. During validation of the firmware, the vector was identified and reported, but it has not yet been proven exploitable. CommScope plans to release an additional patch in a forthcoming update, which is expected to fully address the issue.

### Leaking secrets

Several vulnerabilities were found where the firmware did not properly handle secrets. Consequently, this exposes the web interface to MITM attacks, unauthorized disclosure of credentials, and eventually leads to full compromise of the management interface. Some of these vulnerabilities can be exploited via network access to the management controller without requiring authentication. If the administrator enables a captive portal on the network, the controller becomes reachable to attackers regardless of VLAN segregation or restricted subnet access. All ports are accessible when the guest user has not yet authenticated to the guest network. After authentication, only the HTTPS management interface remains available.

#### Hard-coded FTP credentials (CVE-2025-46118)

I noticed that the FTP service on the controller was enabled by default, but the admin credentials did not grant access. After some digging in the firmware, static credentials were found in function `setRootAccount` from the shell script `sys_wrapper.sh`. Here is the relevant part of the script:

```
    if [ "$IS_REAL_BOX" = "yes" ] ; then
        if [ "$PLATFORM" = "ar7100" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "ar7161" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "nar5520" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "unleashed-standard" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "unleashed-micro" ] || [ "$PLATFORM" = "unleashed-ulc" ]; then
            echo "rkscli:*:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh" >> /etc/passwd
            echo "nobody:x:99:99:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin" >> /etc/passwd
            echo "ftp:x:1021:1021:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin" >> /etc/passwd
            echo "ftpuser:*:1022:1022:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin" >> /etc/passwd
            passwd -p Rks@zdap1234 ftpuser
        fi
    fi
```

This script is executed during boot and configures a fixed password for the `ftpuser` user account, which cannot be changed by the end user. With these credentials, we gain access to the following directory (`/etc/airespider-images/firmwares`):

```
drwxr-xr-x   10 0        0             800 Aug 18 09:16 .
drwxr-xr-x   10 0        0             800 Aug 18 09:16 ..

drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0             160 Aug 18 08:26 usb_software
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        0             304 Aug 18 09:16 webaccert
```

A few interesting directories can be found here, three world-writable directories that may be used to upload malicious code. I wanted to see if any of these files were accessible from the web interface, but this is something we’ll explore later.

#### Leaking the private key (CVE-2025-XXXXX CVE request pending)

When custom SSL certificates are installed on the management interface, then the private key is stored at `/etc/airespider/certs/webackey.pem`. However, for some reason the binary `apmgr_zd` copies the private key and stores it at `/etc/airespider-images/firmwares/webaccert/webackey.pem`. As you have learned, we have access to the `webaccert` directory by FTP, allowing an attacker to fetch the private key. Using an RSA modulus check, I confirmed that the key retrieved via FTP is identical to the one in use by the running web service:

```
% openssl rsa -modulus -noout -in webackey.pem |md5
b9fbbbba5d97871a2407129345f253d3
% echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect 192.168.0.1:443 2>/dev/null| openssl x509 -modulus -noout 2>/dev/null|md5
b9fbbbba5d97871a2407129345f25...
