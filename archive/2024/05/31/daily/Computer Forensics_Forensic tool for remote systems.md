# Forensic tool for remote systems

Hi,

As a newbie, I have question based on remote working conditions. Is it possible to initiate a disk image on remote computer? I'd like to use a network drive as image destination. Old school physical nics provides 10/100 mbps yet new WiFi 6 can go upto 6-9gbps. So, the disk write performance may be enough. However, I'd like to get your thought before starting such path. Is it reasonable to do? If yes, anybody can share their experience ?

I'd also like to get name of tools that can handle such case
