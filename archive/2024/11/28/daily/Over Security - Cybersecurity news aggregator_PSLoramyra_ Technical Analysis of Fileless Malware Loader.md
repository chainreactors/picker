PSLoramyra: Technical Analysis of Fileless Malware Loader

In this article, [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=psloramyra_analysis&utm_term=271124&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s analyst team will explore a malicious loader known as **PSLoramyra**. This advanced malware leverages PowerShell, VBS, and BAT scripts to inject malicious payloads into a system, execute them directly in memory, and establish persistent access.

Classified as a **[fileless loader](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/fileless-malware/)**, PSLoramyra bypasses traditional detection methods by loading its primary payload entirely into memory, leaving minimal traces on the system.

## PSLoramyra Loader: Technical Analysis

To see PSLoramyra loader in action, let’s have a look at its sample inside ANY.RUN’s sandbox:

[View analysis](https://app.any.run/tasks/24dbdd79-5ff1-4050-8ac3-9edb348ff923/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=psloramyra_analysis&utm_term=271124&utm_content=linktoservice)

## Initial PowerShell script

Let’s take a closer look at this loader. The infection chain begins with an initial [PowerShell](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/powershell-script-tracer/) script that contains both the main malicious payload and the scripts required to execute it. The script performs the following steps:

1. **File creation**:

The script generates three files critical to the infection chain:

1. roox.ps1

2. roox.bat

3. roox.vbs

2. **Execution chain**:

1. The roox.vbs script is executed first to initiate the process.

2. roox.vbs launches the roox.bat script.

3. roox.bat then runs the roox.ps1 PowerShell script.

3. **Payload execution**:

The roox.ps1 script loads the main malicious payload directly into memory using Reflection.Assembly.Load.

It then leverages RegSvcs.exe to execute the payload. In this case, the payload is the [Quasar RAT](https://any.run/malware-trends/quasar).

### Establishing Persistence with Task Scheduler

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1-1024x444.jpg)

The PowerShell script [establishes persistence](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/6-persistence-mechanisms-in-malware/) by creating a Windows Task Scheduler task that runs **roox.vbs** every two minutes. Here’s how it operates step by step:

1. **Creating the scheduler object**:

The script initializes a Task Scheduler object using the following command:

```
New-Object -ComObject Schedule.Service
```

It then connects to the Task Scheduler service: $scheduler.Connect()

2. **Defining a new task:**

A new task is created with: $taskDefinition = $scheduler.NewTask(0)

The task is described, and its execution is enabled: $taskDefinition.Settings.Enabled = $true

3. **Setting the Trigger**:

A trigger is configured to execute the task every two minutes: $trigger.Repetition.Interval = “PT2M”

4. **Configuring the Task Action**:

The action specifies the execution of the roox.vbs script: $action.Path = “C:\Users\Public\roox.vbs

5. **Registering the Task**:

Finally, the task is registered in the Task Scheduler, ensuring it runs continuously: $taskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition()

### Script Creation

The initial PowerShell script generates multiple scripts and writes them to the disk. This is achieved using the following command: [IO.File]::WriteAllText(“PATH”, CONTENT)

The content of these scripts is initially stored in variables such as $Content.
