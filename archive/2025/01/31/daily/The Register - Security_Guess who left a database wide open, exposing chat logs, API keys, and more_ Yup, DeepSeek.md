Wiz, a New York-based infosec house, says that shortly after the [DeepSeek R1 model](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/27/deepseek_r1_identity/) gained widespread attention, it began investigating the machine-learning outfit's security posture. What Wiz found is that DeepSeek – which not only [develops](https://github.com/orgs/deepseek-ai/repositories) and [distributes](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai) trained openly available models but also provides online access to those neural networks in the cloud – did not secure the database infrastructure of those services.
