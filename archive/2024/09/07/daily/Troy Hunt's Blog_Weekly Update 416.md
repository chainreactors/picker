# Weekly Update 416

07 September 2024

It's been a while since I've just gone all "AMA" on a weekly update, but this was just one of those weeks that flew by with my head mostly in the code and not doing much else. There's a bit of discussion about that this week, but it's mostly around the ongoing pain of resellers and all the various issues supporting them then creates as a result. I think we just need to get on with writing the code to automate everything they do so I just don't need to think about them any more ðŸ˜­
