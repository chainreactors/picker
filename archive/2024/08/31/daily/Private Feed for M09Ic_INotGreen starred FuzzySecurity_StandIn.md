# StandIn

StandIn is a small AD post-compromise toolkit. StandIn came about because recently at [xforcered](https://github.com/xforcered) we needed a .NET native solution to perform resource based constrained delegation. However, StandIn quickly ballooned to include a number of comfort features.

I want to continue developing StandIn to teach myself more about Directory Services programming and to hopefully expand a tool which fits in to the AD post-exploitation toolchain.
