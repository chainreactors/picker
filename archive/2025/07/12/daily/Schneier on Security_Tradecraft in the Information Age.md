And all this whizbang tech in the hands of, let’s say, an orange headed shitler will be turned against any and all domestic resistance. How f’n lovely. Big brother is here.

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “… the difficulty (impossibility?) of human spying in the age of ubiquitous digital surveillance.”

Whilst it feels like spying is ubiquitous, it’s not. Even in London one of the most surveilled places in the Western World it is if you take certain precautions possible to either avoid or avoid the effects of surveillance.

One technique that still works is apparently “random behaviour” where you just appear to wander around.

Look at it this way, even in the arcade game of Pinball it is possible to just keep the ball on the table till you rack up the high score.

Thus just wandering around but walking past a place in a given time looking for “tell tale signs” allows for communication at a very low bit rate.

There are many other “old school spy craft” techniques that work in the modern world even when you are under active surveillance.

The important thing is not to allow those surveilling seeing either an unexplainable pattern, or break in an established pattern that can be correlated or correlated with other events.

The problem is it’s darn difficult to do these days.

Back when surveillance was by people on foot etc following you around. They did not get to see in front of you when somebody else “sets the tell tales”. These days those surveilling you can set up the equivalent of “game cameras” at road junctions and see who went before you by half a day or more.

Which is why a taste for long random walks can be you and your handlers friend.

Just don’t do the daft stuff the CIA has this century developed a bad reputation over.

Similar with the UK SS and the “Moscow Rock” using technology in a covert manner can be a very very bad idea, and people can easily die or worse.

This parts:

> But NOCs became easier to spot, too, in the age of social media and forever-data. They couldn’t just drop into a cover job. They needed an authentic digital history including things like a “LinkedIn” profile that had no gaps and would never change.=

Only crazy person could go NOC to USA, Russia and China having deep knowledge of their legal and prison systems. Not even talking about N Korea, Iran, you name it.

2)=It turns out that China hasn’t encrypted much of its data — because the authorities want to spy on their own citizens. China is now restricting more data, but Levesque says Strider hasn’t lost its access.=

That is old balance between security and privacy.

@ not important, ALL,

With regards,

> “The CIA’s default answer to tradecraft problems, for decades, was greater reliance on “nonofficial cover” officers, known as NOCs.”

Also known as “contractors” in other countries is a significant issue.

The UK Security Service because it was idiotic over Matrix Churchill blew the gaff on NOC/Contractor work.

The expression “NOC” stands for ‘no official cover’ which means yhe person does not have any kind of diplomatic immunity. So if caught in any country will be treated as a criminal or worse with “no assistance”.

The dumb ass thing the UK Security Services did was turn their back on the directors of Matrix Churchill.

The story is a little complicated but it was to do with Iraqi armament production. The company was near bankrupt and got taken over through another company by Iraqi interests.

Rather than keep clear the UK Security Services told MC Directors how to bypass export regulations to Iraqi.

In return the directors were unpayed spys reporting back to the UK Security Services.

They were not caught in Iraqi, howrver another part of the UK Government decided to start prosecuting the MC Directors…

Several UK Ministers decided not to sign Public Immunity Certs that would have killed the prosecution, instead they threw the four MC Directors to the Wolves.

It would have ended very badly for the directors if the court case had proceeded. However one Minister decided that this was iniquitous and basically alowed the Directors to defend themselves.

To put it politely the Judge was not impressed with either the prosecuting agency or the ministers that had decided to rob the four directors of their right to defend themselves.

It made quite a bit of memorable news at the time.

As some know in the US it’s kind of the other way around there is legislation in place to protect at least serving officers even though they may not be abroad or in hostile territory. For those that don’t remember a little weasel side kick of Dick Cheney by the name of “Scooter Libby” you might want to look up his treasonous activity over the releasing of Valerie Plame’s identity… Oh and who fully pardoned him in 2018 and why,

I not convinced “gait recognition” cannot be subverted. As a student we used to imitate the way other students walked for fun, often four of us in a single line (I know it sounds silly). I have since worked with dance and choreographers who have a huge range of movement.
There was a television series in the U.K. this year – What It Feels Like For A Girl – that shows how gait can be changed. The actor playing the main character had three ways of walking: when he was a boy, he walked like a boy; when he dressed as a girl he walked like a girl; when he left the youth detention cent...
