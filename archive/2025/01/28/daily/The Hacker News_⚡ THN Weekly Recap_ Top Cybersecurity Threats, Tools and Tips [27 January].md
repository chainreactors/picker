Welcome to your weekly cybersecurity scoop! Ever thought about how the same AI meant to protect our hospitals could also compromise them? This week, we're breaking down the sophisticated world of AI-driven threats, key updates in regulations, and some urgent vulnerabilities in healthcare tech that need our attention.

As we unpack these complex topics, we'll equip you with sharp insights to navigate these turbulent waters. Curious about the solutions? They're smarter and more unexpected than you might think. Let's dive in.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Juniper Networks Routers Targeted by J-magic** ‚Äî A new campaign targeted enterprise-grade Juniper Networks routers between mid-2023 and mid-2024 to infect them with a backdoor dubbed [J-magic](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/custom-backdoor-exploiting-magic-packet.html) when certain precise conditions. The malware is a variant of a nearly 25-year-old, publicly available backdoor referred to as cd00r, and is designed to establish a reverse shell to an attacker-controlled IP address and port. Semiconductor, energy, manufacturing, and information technology (IT) sectors were the most targeted.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Palo Alto Firewalls Found Vulnerable to Firmware Exploits** ‚Äî An analysis of three firewall models from Palo Alto Networks ‚Äì PA-3260, PA-1410, and PA-415 ‚Äì [uncovered](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/palo-alto-firewalls-found-vulnerable-to.html) that they are vulnerable to known security flaws that could be exploited to achieve Secure Boot bypass and modify device firmware. In response to the findings, Palo Alto Networks said exploiting the flaws requires an attacker to first compromise PAN-OS software through other means and obtain elevated privileges to access or modify the BIOS firmware. It also said it will be working with third-party vendors to develop firmware updates for some of them.
* **PlushDaemon Linked to Supply Chain Compromise of South Korean VPN Provider** ‚Äî A never-before-seen China-aligned hacking group named [PlushDaemon](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/plushdaemon-apt-targets-south-korean.html) carried out a supply chain attack targeting a South Korean virtual private network (VPN) provider in 2023 to deliver malware known as SlowStepper, a fully-featured backdoor with an extensive set of information gathering features. The threat actor is also said to have exploited an unknown vulnerability in Apache HTTP servers and conducted adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks to breach other targets of interest. Active since at least 2019, the group has singled out individuals and entities in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, the United States, and New Zealand.
* **Mirai Botnet Launches Record 5.6 Tbps DDoS Attack** ‚Äî Cloudflare revealed that a Mirai botnet comprising over 13,000 IoT devices was [responsible](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/mirai-botnet-launches-record-56-tbps.html) for a record-breaking 5.6 Terabit per second (Tbps) distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack aimed at an unnamed internet service provider (ISP) from Eastern Asia. The attack lasted about 80 seconds. The web infrastructure company said the average unique source IP address observed per second was 5,500, and the average contribution of each IP address per second was around 1 Gbps.
* **Over 100 Flaws in LTE and 5G Implementations** ‚Äî A group of academics has [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/ransacked-over-100-security-flaws-found.html) 119 security vulnerabilities impacting LTE and 5G implementations, Open5GS, Magma, OpenAirInterface, Athonet, SD-Core, NextEPC, srsRAN, that could be exploited by an attacker to disrupt access to service and even gain a foothold into the cellular core network. Some of the identified vulnerabilities could be weaponized to breach the cellular core network, and leverage that access to monitor cellphone location and connection information for all subscribers at a city-wide level, carry out targeted attacks on specific subscribers, and perform further malicious actions on the network itself.
* **Ex-CIA Analyst Pleads Guilty to Sharing Top Secret Docs** ‚Äî Asif William Rahman, a former analyst working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), [pleaded guilty](https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/ex-cia-analyst-pleads-guilty-to-sharing.html) to transmitting top secret National Defense Information (NDI) to unauthorized personnel and attempted to cover up the activity. The incident, which took place in October 2024, involved Rahman sharing documents prepared by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency. They were related to Israel's plans to attack Iran, and were subsequently shared on Telegram by an account called Middle East Spectator. He has pleaded guilty to two counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information related to the national defense. He is expected to be sentenced on May 15, 2025, potentially facing a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
