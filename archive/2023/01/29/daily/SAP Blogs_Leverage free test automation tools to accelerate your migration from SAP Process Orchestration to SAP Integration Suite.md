To support your transition to SAP Integration Suite, SAP provides you with the following tools and capabilities- [Migration Assessment](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/30/automatically-assess-your-migration-from-sap-process-orchestration-systems-to-sap-integration-suite-with-the-new-migration-assessment-capability/) and [Migration tooling](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/27/migration-tool-in-cloud-integration-capability-of-sap-integration-suite/).

The migration journey can only be said to be complete when integrations on the SAP Integration Suite are tested and the business is seamlessly running and restored on the new SAP Integration Suite system. In order to achieve the last mile of the migration and to check that the migration was done successfully, SAP provides customers with Regression and Test Tools from partner companies like Int4 or Figaf.

SAP has worked with these partners to provide our SAP Process Orchestration customers with free use of their test automation tools during the duration of the migration project, to SAP Integration Suite, up to a maximum of 12 months.   Any continued use of the test tools for ongoing testing, or other capabilities, beyond the migration project would require a license from the partner.
