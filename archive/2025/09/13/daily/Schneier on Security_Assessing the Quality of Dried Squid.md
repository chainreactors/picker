## Assessing the Quality of Dried Squid

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157525010439):

> Nondestructive detection of multiple dried squid qualities by hyperspectral imaging combined with 1D-KAN-CNN
>
> **Abstract:** Given that dried squid is a highly regarded marine product in Oriental countries, the global food industry requires a swift and noninvasive quality assessment of this product. The current study therefore uses visible­near-infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral imaging and deep learning (DL) methodologies. We acquired and preprocessed VIS-NIR (400­1000 nm) hyperspectral reflectance images of 93 dried squid samples. Important wavelengths were selected using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, principal component analysis, and the successive projections algorithm. Based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), we introduce a one-dimensional, KAN convolutional neural network (1D-KAN-CNN) for nondestructive measurements of fat, protein, and total volatile basic nitrogen….

Nondestructive? Interesting … The only way to import dried squid to NZ is in sealed plastic bags. Until now there has been no way to test the quality of the product before it went into the bag, except by opening the bag. So when will this new method be available for the average shopper?

Enforced Cultural Amnesia

*“The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.”*

According to a BBC article, Reality TV is a wonderful thing which changed the way we think.

Reality TV ideology, for Reality TV people, living in a Reality TV world.
How can we understand our present and future if we cannot remember our own shared past?

The fragmentation of culture is exacerbated by technology.

‘https://bohotude.com/cultural-amnesia-why-forgetting-our-past-could-cost-us-our-future/

Our reference point is framed by the location in which we are confined and the information we receive. How we view the place in which we live is shaped by what we accept as “normal”.
<https://encyclopedia.uia.org/problem/cultural-amnesia>

Machine learning will hand immense power to those who can control what is remembered and what is forgotten. States may enforce cultural assimilation and repression. The collective memories of generations of students and adults could be repressed, erased and replaced.

With the fragmentation of culture and society comes the loss of knowledge and skills.

*There is a growing shortage of botanists.*

Professions and industries rely on botanical knowledge, yet fewer people are studying to become botanists. Botany has been cut from many universities in many countries as funding and government support for the subject has dwindled at a time when the practice is vital.

Many regions now **cannot find botanists** to do crucial work as the number of professionals in the field shrinks while practicing botanists continue to retire.

Wild plants are valuable genetic resources for producing stress tolerant and disease resistant crops. Biodiversity loss threatens this critically important resource.

The very populations of insect and animal species that plants require in order to fruit and propagate are under threat. Half of all plants rely on animals to disperse their seeds. In North America almost a quarter of pollinators are at risk. **Cuts** to educational **funding** and **research** are endangering human health and security as biodiversity threats grow. Invasive species now also threaten food security globally.

Good points, Researcher, thanks. And I want whatever Global Blackout is smoking! :)))

Wow, another method is just to buy and sample different kinds of dried squid you’re interested in
