# Adult popunder campaign used in mainstream ad fraud scheme

Posted: December 20, 2022

*This blog post was authored by Jérôme Segura*

Online advertising is a multi billion dollar industry with [projected](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/) spending to reach over 600 billion U.S. dollars for 2022. It’s not surprising that criminals are trying their hardest to abuse this ecosystem in any way that they can.

One of the biggest threats and always top of mind for advertisers is [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot) traffic as it is the equivalent of throwing money down the drain with ads that will never be seen by real eye balls. However, ad fraud is more than bots and in fact, even when traffic is seemingly real, there can still be abuse.

Case in point, we came across a clever ad fraud scheme where a fraudster is running a cost-effective popunder campaign on high-traffic adult websites and then making money via Google Ads. What originally caught our attention was seeing a Google advert on what appeared to be an adult page, as it is strictly against the search giant’s acceptable content policy. It turned out to be a clever way to hide a bogus blog loaded with many more ads, most of them hidden behind a fullscreen pornographic iframe.

As unaware visitors trigger the popunder landing page and continue browsing in their other tab, the decoy website is constantly refreshing with new content and of course new ads, generating millions of ad impressions per month.

We reported this invalid traffic and would like to thank Google for quickly shutting down this ad campaign.

## Popunder campaign on top adult sites

It is no secret that adult websites generate a lot of traffic. Did you know that 3 of the top 20’s most visited websites are from the adult industry, the more popular one getting an estimated 2.8 billion monthly visits?

A fraudster has set up an ad campaign with one of the major adult ad networks using an ad format known as a popunder, which is one of the most cost efficient. Depending on the visitor’s geolocation and other parameters, the CPM (cost per thousand impressions) can be as low as $0.05.

A popunder is like a ‘pop-up’ in that it is triggered when a user clicks anywhere on a web page, except that the resulting ad will appear behind the open window. It’s also not like a typical banner ad, it’s actually an entire page, often referred to as a landing page whose goal is to provide clear and interesting information in order to have a high conversion ratio. Examples of common popunders for the adult industry include online dating services, adult webcams, or simply an adult portal.

At first, it appears that this popunder is simply promoting another adult website called Txxx. But a couple of things don’t add up: the page’s title and address bar show something completely unrelated and we can see what appears to be a Google ad at the bottom of the page.

The problem is that Google’s [advertising policies](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6015406?hl=en) state that sexually explicit content such as text, image, audio, or video of graphic sexual acts intended to arouse is not allowed. Technically speaking, the adult content is merely an iframe plac...
