[SAP Partner Finder](https://pf-prod-sapit-partner-prod.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/) is a valuable tool for keeping your sales pipeline full – and its new features can help you make even greater strides toward growing your business.

SAP Partner Finder allows prospects looking for your specific skills and expertise to learn more about your business. Prospective clients can use the tool to search for partner types that specialize in particular SAP solutions, are located in their country, and have a good track record with enterprises in their industry.

The tool generates a list of SAP partner profiles that match the criteria the customer is looking for and provides links to partner profile pages for their review. For customers to find your business, you must publish a profile on SAP Partner Finder – and [creating a robust profile](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/07/maximize-your-customer-visibility-with-a-robust-profile-and-new-features-for-sap-partner-finder/) is essential. The profile page is **your opportunity** to sell your services to customers searching on the platform. Make the most of the space by articulating your value proposition, details on the range of service you offer, listing supported languages, linking to white papers, articles, and case studies, and even including a video or image.

If you haven’t reviewed your profile on SAP Partner Finder in a while, it’s a good idea to take a look at it with fresh eyes, and make sure all information and assets are up to date and will resonate with customers looking for solutions to today’s challenges. By showcasing your business, you’ll ensure you’re attracting prospects with the greatest chance at customer success with your business and you’re well-matched to meet their unique needs.

Another advantage of SAP Partner Finder is that it’s easy to use, and SAP is consistently releasing new features – based on *your* feedback – to make it even more intuitive and simple to leverage for both partners and customers alike.

**Partner-Led Updates for SAP Partner Finder**

You asked. We listened. SAP has incorporated new updates popularly requested by partners asked for in surveys and interviews. Here’s what’s new:

1. **Optimization feature on the profile editor**

The most significant upgrade to SAP Partner Finder ensures you are fully utilizing the tool’s functionality and have optimized your profile page. The optimization feature shows how complete your profile is and guides you through steps to put the finishing touches on it. Once your profile is 100% complete, you’ll unlock analytics that show the number of contact forms you’ve received over the past 12 months. Insights from this feature can help you optimize your profile and attract more customers.

2. **Optimized location filters**

SAP received many requests for a more user-friendly location filter. Now it’s easier for a customer to find a partner in their country, or city. SAP Partner Finder includes a drop-down with a list of countries in alphabetical order. (Partners’ listings are based on the countries where they have partnership agreements.) Additionally, prospects can search by cities and states and select multiple locations at the same time for efficiency.

3. **Broadened partner type filters**

SAP has expanded the partner type filters from three to seven, better aligning with the new taxonomy on sap.com and making it easier for customers to precisely find the type of partner they’re looking for. This new feature also gives customers a better picture of the different types of SAP partners and helps you showcase your specific business model.

**Learn More About the New and Improved SAP Partner Finder**

SAP Partner Finder gives you the opportunity to stand out from among your peers as a business that’s uniquely positioned to address the needs of best-match businesses. To make the most of that opportunity and optimize your partner profile today, visit the [SAP Partner Finder home page](https://pf-prod-sapit-partner-prod.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/) and the SAP Partner Finder page on [SAP Partner Portal](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/partnership/marketing/campaigns/part-find.html).
