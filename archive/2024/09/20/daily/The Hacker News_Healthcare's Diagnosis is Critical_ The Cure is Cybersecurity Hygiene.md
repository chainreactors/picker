Cybersecurity in healthcare has never been more urgent. As the most vulnerable industry and largest target for cybercriminals, healthcare is facing an increasing wave of cyberattacks. When a hospital's systems are held hostage by ransomware, it's not just data at risk — it's the care of patients who depend on life-saving treatments. Imagine an attack that forces emergency care to halt, surgeries to be postponed, or a cancer patient's private health information used for extortion. This is the reality healthcare faces as cybercriminals exploit people who need care. Healthcare accounted for 17.8% of all breach events and 18.2% of destructive ransomware events since 20121, surpassing other sectors like finance, government, and education.

This alarming rise in attacks makes one thing clear: poor cybersecurity hygiene is the root cause, and the consequences for failing to address these vulnerabilities are devastating. Organizations that neglect basic cybersecurity practices, like software patching and ensuring network safety, are leaving their systems exposed to malicious actors. More importantly, the risks aren't just theoretical; they manifest in frequent breaches that cause real-world harm.

## **Healthcare's vulnerabilities**

While many industries suffer financial and reputational damage from cyberattacks, healthcare faces a much graver risk. Hackers know they're not just targeting data or systems — they're holding something far more precious in their hands: life itself. The healthcare sector is a uniquely vulnerable target for cybercriminals for several reasons. First, the industry's reliance on interconnected systems that support everything from patient records to life-saving devices creates a broad attack surface. Additionally, healthcare systems often contain sensitive personal information, making them attractive targets for extortion and data theft.

In one example, the CommonSpirit Health ransomware attack in October 20241 resulted in hospitals having to delay medical procedures and redirect emergency care, significantly affecting patient safety​. Another concerning case was the breach of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in November 2024 where criminals extorted patients by threatening to release their private health information.

The vulnerabilities in healthcare systems are exacerbated by poor cybersecurity hygiene.

## **Understanding the correlation between hygiene and breach events**

A thorough analysis of 1,454 destructive [ransomware events](https://hubs.li/Q02Q8sWC0) between 2016 and 20232 provides crucial insights into the link between poor cybersecurity hygiene and the frequency of attacks. The findings show that organizations rated D or F have a 35 times higher frequency of destructive ransomware events compared to those with A ratings. This stark contrast underlines the importance of maintaining strong cybersecurity practices.

Criminals target systems with vulnerabilities in basic areas, such as unpatched software, unsafe network services, and unencrypted web communications​. These weaknesses provide easy entry points for attackers, allowing them to compromise critical systems and, ultimately, hold organizations hostage with ransomware.

Organizations with good cybersecurity hygiene — those that regularly patch vulnerabilities, secure their networks, and encrypt sensitive communications — are far less likely to experience breaches. However, many healthcare institutions fail to uphold these standards, making them prime targets for attackers.

## **Consequences of poor cybersecurity hygiene**

In an environment where patient safety depends on the availability of health systems, the consequences of poor cybersecurity can be life-threatening. Destructive ransomware events, which encrypt systems and disable operations, pose significant risks. For hospitals, downtime can mean the difference between life and death for patients relying on critical care services.

The data highlights the consequences of neglecting basic cybersecurity practices. According to Mastercard, healthcare organizations with D or F ratings have 16.6x more breach events than organizations rated A1. These organizations not only expose themselves to more frequent attacks but also face more severe outcomes, such as the inability to deliver care during critical times.
