# iPhone vs. Android: iPhone users more reckless, less protected online

Posted: July 24, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

The smartphone wars have a winner, and it’s [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus).

No, this isn’t about which device has the best camera, the snappiest processor, or the flashiest [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) features—this is about which device *owners* are safer online, and in many ways, it is Android users who take the crown. According to a new analysis from Malwarebytes, when compared to iPhone users, Android users share less of their [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) for promotional deals, more frequently use security tools, and more regularly create and manage unique passwords for their many online accounts.

They also, it turns out, fall victim to fewer scams.

This is the latest investigation into [research conducted earlier this year by Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/scams/2025/06/44-of-people-encounter-a-mobile-scam-every-single-day-malwarebytes-finds) that surveyed 1,300 people over the age of 18 in the US, the UK, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. In the [original report released in June](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile-scams), Malwarebytes revealed how mobile scams have become a part of everyday life for most everyone across the globe—and how far too many individuals have essentially given up on trying to fight back.

Now, Malwarebytes can reveal how iPhone and Android users differ when scrolling, shopping, and sending messages online. This secondary analysis has controlled for age, meaning that, while iPhone users did tend skew younger in the original data set, the differences identified here are more directly attributed to device type.

Here are some of the key takeaways:

* Apple users are more likely to engage in risky behavior.
  + 47% of iPhone users purchased an item from an unknown source because it offered the best price, compared to 40% of Android users.
  + 41% of iPhone users sent a Direct Message (DM) on social media to a company or seller account to get a discount or discount code, compared to 33% of Android users.
* Apple users take fewer precautions online.
  + 21% of iPhone users said they use security software on their mobile phones, compared to 29% of Android users.
  + 35% of iPhone users choose unique passwords for their online accounts, compared to 41% of Android users.
* Apple users are more likely to be the victims of scams.
  + 53% of iPhone users have fallen victim to a scam compared to 48% of Android users.

Importantly, the behavioral splits here are largely device agnostic.

Android users are not scanning fewer QR codes and iPhone users are not failing to make unique passwords because their respective devices are somehow incapable. Instead, iPhone users are making worse decisions about buying things online and about staying safe from all types of cyberthreats—whether that includes [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) attempts, [social engineering](https://www.malwarebytes.com/social-engineering) scams, or [malware infections](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware).

The reasons for this are complex and hard to identify, but Malwarebytes’ orig...
