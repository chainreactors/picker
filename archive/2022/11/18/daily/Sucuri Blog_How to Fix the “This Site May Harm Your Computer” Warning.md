![How to fix the This SIte May Harm Your Computer website warning](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_How-to-Fix-This-Site-May-Harm-Your-Computer-Warning-820x386.png)

Most modern web browsers and search authorities like Google have a vested interest in protecting their users from malware. Warning messages like “**This site may harm your computer**” are a clear way for services to educate and protect end users from accessing malicious websites.

A hacked website can result in a plethora of headaches: [unwanted redirects](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/11/massive-ois-is-black-hat-redirect-malware-campaign.html), [SEO spam](https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/02/spamdexing-seo-spam.html), backdoors, and even [ransomware](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/08/socgholish-5-years-of-massive-website-infections.html). But the fun doesn’t end there. If your site’s been hacked, you’ll likely be on the receiving end of these browser and search warnings — which in turn can affect your website’s traffic, reputation, and revenue.

Today, we’re going to look at how a hacked website can result in browser and warnings in Google search results. We’ll also outline the steps you can take to fix “This site may harm your computer” warnings and prevent it from happening again.

## What is the “This site may harm your computer” notification?

Google uses strict policies to protect search traffic from malware. If Google detects that a website is infected, they’ll serve a “**This site may harm your computer**” warning message in search results to warn potential visitors and deter them from accessing the domain.

By raising awareness about malicious websites, they reduce the likelihood that users will get infected by shady websites. Search authorities like Bing and Google may even eventually [blocklist the website](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-remove-google-blocklist-warning/) to prevent search traffic navigating to the hacked site.

Search result warning users about malicious software on an infected domain.

And while it may be a minor inconvenience for a web searcher to come across this message, it’s an entirely different story for whomever owns the infected website.

So, let’s take a look at why your site might be getting this warning in the first place.

## What causes these warnings for my website?

Website malware can lead to warnings in browsers and search results.

Bad actors actively target vulnerable websites to distribute their payloads. In many instances, their malware employ clever methods designed to trick victims into clicking and executing [malicious softwar](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/how-to-fix-google-ads-disapproved-due-to-malicious-software.html)e downloads onto their computer.

These infections are exceptionally dangerous for website visitors. They can allow an attacker to gain control of the infected system, harvest sensitive user information and credit card details, and perform other malicious activities.

To protect users, most search authorities and modern web browsers use automated processes to detect website malware. Data from a wide range of sources is aggregated to find websites that are involved in suspicious or harmful activities.

So if services like Google or Bing detect malware on your website, they’ll issue a warning to their end users to protect them until the problem is fixed.
