If you're a Power User and someone who loves staying up to date with the latest news, updates, and content from the SAP and the SAP community, then you'll definitely want to check out this tool:

With the SAP RSS Feeds Generator, you can easily keep track of all the latest happenings from your favorite sources, including your own GitHub profile, SAP community following, SAP blog tags, SAP groups, SAP group events, SAP YouTube channels, and SAP podcasts.

One of the best things about this tool is that it's super easy to use. All you have to do is enter your usernames, generate the OPML file, and upload it to a RSS Reader. You can even customize which categories you want to include, whether it's your GitHub Following, SAP Community Following or your favorite SAP blog tags.

The generated OPML file can then be uploaded to your favourite RSS reader.

If your RSS feeder reads the OPML correctly, individual categories are also automatically saved in folders.
The result could look something like this:

Another great feature of this tool is its privacy. There's no backend server to save your token or any other data, so you can use it without worrying about your information being compromised.
Only publicly available information is processed.
So if your following is not publicly viewable, then the tool cannot retrieve it.

If you'd like to learn more about the SAP RSS Feeds Generator or contribute to its development, you can check out the source code on GitHub at <https://github.com/marianfoo/gh-following-to-rss>.
You can also create issues to report bugs or request new features, or submit pull requests to contribute to the project.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to leave them in the comments as well!
