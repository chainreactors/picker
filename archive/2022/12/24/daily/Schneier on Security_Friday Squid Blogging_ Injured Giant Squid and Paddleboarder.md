## Friday Squid Blogging: Injured Giant Squid and Paddleboarder

Here‚Äôs a [video](https://unofficialnetworks.com/2022/12/19/giant-squid-paddleboarder/)‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs from‚Äîof an injured juvenile male giant squid grabbing on to a paddleboard.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven‚Äôt covered.

Hack using parallel email accounts:

Say there‚Äôs Hercules99@example.com. Someone cracks in and copies addresses, but sends nothing from inside that account. The cracker, as impersonator, creates Hercules99@example.net and emails everyone, asking if they shop at Macy‚Äôs. Those who answer, at least in the affirmative, get another email, this time from Hercules99@example.org , asking them to buy a gift card because Herc‚Äôs parents‚Äô anniversary is coming up and Herc‚Äôs credit card was declined. If you recognized the scam and wanted to warn Herc but didn‚Äôt remember his original (right) address, you might email the warning by replying to one of these parallel addresses because you recognized the username/userinfo, but he‚Äôd be guaranteed to never see it.

In this case, I emailed a warning to an address that I hadn‚Äôt yet realized was probably fake (parallel), and it wasn‚Äôt answered, and I tried voicemail, but that was full. But I also sent postal mail that was similar to the email I had sent, figuring being a few days late was better than no notice at all. Herc got the letter and, fortunately, one of Herc‚Äôs close people had already been fast with a heads-up. Damage was limited and the cracker may‚Äôve been taken down in a few hours.

The entry point may‚Äôve been a security software subscription renewal notice. Herc, who once had a career with computers, didn‚Äôt suggest that the notice was fake, so perhaps the security company‚Äôs servers got infected with malware that infects outbound emails or that gets triggered by clicks on outbound emails‚Äô links. I hope Herc told all relevant companies.

I‚Äôve masked some details in this post and omitted others, all for the sake of privacy, but kept the essence.

Just what I‚Äôve always wanted and sounds too good to be true

‚Äú MIT researchers have developed what they say is a scalable fabrication technique to produce ultrathin, lightweight solar cells that can be adhered to any surface.‚Äù

@ modem phonemes, ALL,

Re : Not what you think.

> *‚ÄúMIT researchers have made solar panels thinner than human hair that provide 18 times as much power per kilogram as today‚Äôs glass and silicon-based solar panels. These solar cells are in fact one-hundredth the weight of conventional photovoltaics.‚Äù*

Read it carefully and pull out the numbers‚Ä¶

They say that the new cells are 1/100th of the weight of conventional cells. Also that they produce 18 times the energy mass for mass.

So the actual performance is 18/100 or 18% of conventional cells that in turn are at best only about 25% and usually less than 20% efficient under full illumination. So 0.18√ó0.2 gives 3.6% energy conversion at best or maybe 40w per square metre‚Ä¶

I could go on, but it will only go further down hill.

Basically the article is a ‚Äúpuff piece‚Äù for MIT‚Äôs Grid-Edge project to make start-ups in ‚Äúlite-weight‚Äù solar cells to attract ESG money. Call it the ‚ÄúSolar Roads 2.0‚Äù initiative for want of a more accurate description‚Ä¶

You might remember ‚Äúsolar roads‚Äù were the next big ‚ÄúGreen Investment‚Äù only they have all catastrophicaly failed in a totaly predictable ways, that were predicted by engineers who did make them public‚Ä¶

Not least of which are obvious such as roads are flat and flat solar panels are very inefficient due to not just poor illumination but ‚Äúshading effect‚Äù. Oh and dust, tire waste, grit, etc did not ‚Äúrun-off‚Äù with the rain, thus made even the most efficient cell near usless, and that was before vehicles ground up the optical surface‚Ä¶ The result millions upon millions of dollars poured into Start-ups that built very very expensive prototypes using very energy intensive processes, and barely a flashlight battery of energy produced over a year. Thus payback times were never ever going to happen. But nice upper middle class salaries were paid to the managers etc‚Ä¶

These ‚Äúnew‚Äù grossely inefficient cells from MIT are touted for business/industrial roofs, most of which are effectively flat or shade easily‚Ä¶

Thus the energy payback period will probably be longer than the life time of these new cells‚Ä¶

Whilst I won‚Äôt call it a scam, it‚Äôs research that currently has no practical use, nor is it likely to. Likewise any patents gained don‚Äôt have value because they will have ex...
