Threat Intelligence Reports: Get Fresh Research on the Latest Cyber Attacks and APTs

[ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_reports&utm_term=130225&utm_content=linktolanding) proudly presents Threat Intelligence Reports: investigative reports on cyber threats and attacks focused on delivering actionable insights to security professionals and decision makers.

Manually composed by our experienced analysts, the Reports provide data for threat monitoring and detection, incident mitigation and response, R&D, education, strategic planning and compliance.

These detailed attack overviews are based on comprehensive research of cyber threats, including malware, ransomware, phishing campaigns, and other malicious activities. APTs and cybercriminal groups are under special scrutiny as one of the most critical and persistent hazards to organizations and individuals.

## How to Get TI Reports

## Data Behind TI Reports

TI Reports are founded on fresh real-world data about new and ongoing threats, handpicked and processed by ANY.RUN analysts. Our Interactive Sandbox, among other sources, provides us with a constantly filling community-powered collection of malware sample analyses.

Each report lets researchers dive deeper into any indicator or artifact with pre-created TI Lookup search queries to discover more relevant data.

## Info You Can Find in TI Reports

Each report begins with the actor or vehicle **overview** and continues with its basic **description**: aims, origins, first-seens, targeted industries and countries. The description helps to grasp the scale and context of a threat, letting you understand its relevance to specific industries.

A list of [**TTPs**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/mitre-ttps-in-ti-lookup/)used by the attackers contains their tactics, techniques and procedures which are methods and tools that adversaries engage and combine in their campaigns. TTPs are followed by a collection of [indicators](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/threat-intelligence-pivoting/) — of compromise (**IOCs**), of behavior (IOBs) and of attack (IOAs) — associated with the threat or the group.

TTPs and indicators are essential for setting up proactive cyber defense and are listed along with links to sandbox sessions showing them in action.
