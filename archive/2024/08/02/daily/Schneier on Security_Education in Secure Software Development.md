## Education in Secure Software Development

The Linux Foundation and OpenSSF released a [report](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-and-openssf-release-report-on-the-state-of-education-in-secure-software-development) on the state of education in secure software development.

> ‚Ä¶many developers lack the essential knowledge and skills to effectively implement secure software development. Survey findings outlined in the report show nearly one-third of all professionals directly involved in development and deployment ¬≠ system operations, software developers, committers, and maintainers ¬≠ self-report feeling unfamiliar with secure software development practices. This is of particular concern as they are the ones at the forefront of creating and maintaining the code that runs a company‚Äôs applications and systems.

In my opinion this is a result of how security specialists are integrated into most organizations. We usually pretend that since we have a security team, they‚Äôll handle security.

It is rare to find an organization where the security team is allowed to act as a both a consultant to a development team, and to create metric and target that the development team are required to meet.

Usually, I see the security team require that development teams use static analysis tools and scan the test environment before deployment. This fixes some of the more common and easy to spot development mistakes, but does nothing for bad architecture and more subtle issues.

@ Bruce, ALL,

This is not a exactly news, nor are the reasons behind it.

To be brief,

**‚ÄúManagment see no short term profit in security, only delays to product delivery cycles‚Äù.**

The rest as they say follows on as a consequence.

I‚Äôll let others ‚Äúfill in‚Äù the veritable tsunami of reasons, but note there are now many many books addressing the issue, and they have all failed due to the way management behave.

My suggestion lock a few senior managers up for 20years+ and bankrupt them and their families, and you might see a change in the right direction.

This is no surprise to me. In my ~40 years coding I have met a few programmers who cared at all about security and most of those didn‚Äôt really know enough to create secure code/processes.

It keeps me busy and employed, so I‚Äôm not sure if I want to see any change üòâ

And they expect this to survive the first manager with time constraints? I don‚Äôt.

Oh ya, Computer Science is not Software Engineering. Or security related DevOps or IT. Nobody really teaches Software Engineering, last I knew. It would be great.

The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude from management, that others have alluded to, is not just about profits. There‚Äôs also a huge unwillingness to take in knowledge that is not directly related to the job.

This manifests even in other ways ‚Äî for example, normal people unwilling to pick a better password for their bank account or whatever.

Once AI has replaced all of the business owners, system architects, designers, coders, testers and end users, then I‚Äôm sure secure coding practices will be automatically embedded in the development of every piece of software. After all there were no bugs in SkyNet.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Why Walled Gardens fail.

As most readers here are aware Apple and Google have ‚ÄúWalled Garden‚Äù repositories of Applications. It‚Äôs a game Microsoft desperately want to get into but got stymied by both the EU and Google.

Well Apple have been having a ‚ÄúRed Queens Race‚Äù with their walled garden for a number of reasons, but one that keeps popping up is ‚ÄúBad Apps passing scrutiny‚Äù that in the blurb of both Apple and Google way back ‚Äúcould not / will not‚Äù happen.

Some of us here a little wiser than most gave at best hollow laughs to such blatant nonsense[1] designed to befuddled those with political influence.

The problem for Apple is ‚Äúuser expectations‚Äù from Apple talking security up as just one reason to justify their business models.

The problem is those that fall for the ‚ÄúApple Security‚Äù nonsense generally are up in what were once known as ABC1 consumers. Thus Apple was the ‚Äúhoney pot most sweet‚Äù for those looking to gain unlawfully or dubious advantage that there was little or nothing Apple could do to stop it.

It‚Äôs getting to the point that even ‚ÄúFan-boi Zines and Sites‚Äù are ‚Äúdishing the dirt‚Äù on the nonsense.

For instance this little article from yesterday,

<https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/02/developers-trick-app-store-review/>

[1] I‚Äôve mentioned it before, but back in the early 1930‚Äôs there were a series of mathematics papers that proved that there were limits on what ‚Äúa computer could do‚Äù and what could be done with them before electromechanical or electronic computers had actually been invented and built (commercially that did not happen untill the J.Lyon‚Äôs Tea Shop company research gave rise to the ‚ÄúLEO‚Äù that was ‚Äúcranking it out‚Äù less than twenty years later,
