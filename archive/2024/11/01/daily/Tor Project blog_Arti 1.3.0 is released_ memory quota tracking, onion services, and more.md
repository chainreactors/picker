# Arti 1.3.0 is released: memory quota tracking, onion services, and more

Arti is our ongoing project to create a next-generation Tor client in
Rust. Now we're announcing the latest release, Arti 1.3.0.

This release is a significant milestone:
we have achieved parity on most major client features with C Tor.
Much other major work is taking place, too!
Work on Arti Relay is accelerating, and the RPC system is proceeding too.

For full details on what we've done, and for information about
many smaller and less visible changes as well,
please see the [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#arti-130---31-october-2024).

For more information on using Arti, see our top-level [README](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/README.md), and the
documentation for the [`arti` binary](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/tree/main/crates/arti).

Thanks to everybody who's contributed to this release, including
Morgan, and Neel Chauhan.
Also, our welcome to Clara Engler as they join the team!

And as always, our deep thanks to
[Zcash Community Grants](https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/),
the [Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/),
and our [other sponsors](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors/)
for funding the development of Arti!
