# CVE-2022-26134_check

The script is used to check remotely if a Confluence server is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-26134 vulnerability. This vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server if left unpatched. This vulnerability was being exploited by several botnets in June to deploy cryptomining malware on unpatched installations.

Instructions for use:

- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- Download the script and save it on your local machine.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
- Run the script using the command: python CVE-2022-26134_check.py -t [target_url]. Replace [target_url] with the URL of the Confluence server you want to check.
- The script will check if the server is vulnerable to the CVE-2022-26134 vulnerability and return the result.
- If the script returns that the server is vulnerable, it is important to apply the necessary patches or updates to secure the server.
