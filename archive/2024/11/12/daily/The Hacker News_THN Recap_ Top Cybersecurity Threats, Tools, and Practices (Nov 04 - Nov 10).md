‚ö†Ô∏è Imagine this: the very tools you trust to protect you online‚Äîyour two-factor authentication, your car's tech system, even your security software‚Äîturned into silent allies for hackers. Sounds like a scene from a thriller, right? Yet, in 2024, this isn't fiction; it's the new cyber reality. Today's attackers have become so sophisticated that they're using our trusted tools as secret pathways, slipping past defenses without a üîç trace.

For banks üè¶, this is especially alarming. Today's malware doesn't just steal codes; it targets the very trust that digital banking relies on. These threats are more advanced and smarter than ever, often staying a step ahead of defenses.

And it doesn't stop there. Critical systems that power our cities are at risk too. Hackers are hiding within the very tools that run these essential services, making them harder to detect and harder to stop. It's a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek, where each move raises the risk.

As these threats grow, let's dive into the most urgent security issues, vulnerabilities, and cyber trends this week.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**FBI Probes China-Linked Global Hacks:** The FBI is urgently calling for public assistance in a [global investigation into sophisticated cyber attacks](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/fbi-seeks-public-help-to-identify.html) targeting companies and government agencies. Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups‚Äîidentified as APT31, APT41, and Volt Typhoon‚Äîhave breached edge devices and computer networks worldwide.

Exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in edge infrastructure appliances from vendors like Sophos, these threat actors have deployed custom malware to maintain persistent remote access and repurpose compromised devices as stealthy proxies. This tactic allows them to conduct surveillance, espionage, and potentially sabotage operations while remaining undetected.

**Tips for Organizations:**

* **Update and Patch Systems:** Immediately apply the latest security updates to all edge devices and firewalls, particularly those from Sophos, to mitigate known vulnerabilities like CVE-2020-12271, CVE-2020-15069, CVE-2020-29574, CVE-2022-1040, and CVE-2022-3236.
* **Monitor for Known Malware:** Implement advanced security solutions capable of detecting malware such as Asnar√∂k, Gh0st RAT, and Pygmy Goat. Regularly scan your network for signs of these threats.
* **Enhance Network Security:** Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor for unusual network activity, including unexpected ICMP traffic that could indicate backdoor communications.

## **üîî Top News**

* **Android Banking Trojan ToxicPanda Targets Europe:** A new Android banking trojan dubbed [ToxicPanda](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/new-android-banking-malware-toxicpanda.html) has been observed targeting over a dozen banks in Europe and Latin America. It's so named for its Chinese roots and its similarities with another Android-focused malware named TgToxic. ToxicPanda comes with remote access trojan (RAT) capabilities, enabling the attackers to conduct account takeover attacks and conduct on-device fraud (ODF). Besides obtaining access to sensitive permissions, it can intercept one-time passwords received by the device via SMS or those generated by authenticator apps, which enables the cybercriminals to bypass multi-factor authentication. The threat actors behind ToxicPanda are likely Chinese speakers.
* **VEILDrive Attack Exploits Microsoft Services:** An ongoing threat campaign dubbed [VEILDrive](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/veildrive-attack-exploits-microsoft.html) has been observed taking advantage of legitimate services from Microsoft, including Teams, SharePoint, Quick Assist, and OneDrive, as part of its modus operandi. In doing so, it allows the threat actors to evade detection. The attack has been so far spotted targeting an unnamed critical infrastructure entity in the U.S. It's currently not known who is behind the campaign.
* **Crypto Firms Targeted with New macOS backdoor:** The North Korean threat actor known as [BlueNoroff](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-hackers-target-crypto.html) has targeted cryptocurrency-related businesses with a multi-stage malware capable of infecting Apple macOS devices. Unlike other recent campaigns linked to North Korea, the latest effort uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets with a backdoor that can execute attacker-issued commands. The development comes as the APT37 North Korean state-backed group has been [linked](https://www.genians.co.kr/blog/threat_intelligence/apt37_recon) to a new spear-phishing campaign distributing the [RokRAT malware](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/north-korean-scarcruft-exploits-windows.html).
* **Windows Hosts Targeted by QEMU Linux Instance:** A new malware campaign codenamed [CRON#TRAP](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/ne...
