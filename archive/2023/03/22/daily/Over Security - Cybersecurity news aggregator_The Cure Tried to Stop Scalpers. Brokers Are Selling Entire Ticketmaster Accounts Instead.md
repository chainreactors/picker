The steps The Cure has taken to prevent ticket scalping to its highly anticipated tour is seemingly inspiring elaborate workarounds for ticket brokers and hackers. “Aged” Ticketmaster accounts, which are accounts that are years old rather than freshly created and which are more likely to win presale codes from Ticketmaster, are being sold on hacking forums. And a popular and secretive paid forum for ticket brokers is requiring brokers to sell entire Ticketmaster accounts (with The Cure tickets in them) to each other to circumvent the band’s ban on reselling tickets above face value.

The news shows how even when artists try to actively address ticket scalping, scalpers find new and inventive methods to keep profiting on the secondary market, making concerts more expensive for regular fans.

Earlier this month, The Cure announced its first North American tour since 2016 and, along with it, announced specific steps it was taking to prevent ticket scalping following mass scalping activity and chaos with [Blink-182](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gx34/blink-182-tickets-are-so-expensive-because-ticketmaster-is-a-disastrous-monopoly-and-now-everyone-pays-ticket-broker-prices) and [Taylor Swift](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7g45a/why-ticket-brokers-can-get-taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly) earlier this year.

First, the band sold tickets through Ticketmaster’s “[Verified Fan](https://blog.ticketmaster.com/verifiedfan-faq/)” program, which provides unique passwords (or presale codes) to fans who preregister with the company, and supposedly biases toward accounts that have a history of buying tickets and, notably, don’t have a buying pattern consistent with that of a ticket broker (buying lots of tickets for the same acts across many cities). Second, the band said it would simply make tickets nontransferable to prevent scalping.

“Our ticketing partners have agreed to help us stop scalpers from getting in the way; to help minimize resale and keep prices at face value, tickets of this tour will not be transferable,” The Cure [wrote on Instagram last week](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpnE6B_oSmZ/?hl=en). “If something comes up that prevents a fan from being able to use a ticket they have purchased, they will be able to sell it on a face value ticket exchange.”

The steps The Cure has taken have not stopped dedicated scalpers, however. Scalpers are simply buying and selling entire Ticketmaster accounts to sidestep the restrictions. Ticketmaster, meanwhile, has been getting hammered by fans and the [band for the fees it has been charging for the tour](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/17/1164171985/ticketmaster-the-cure-robert-smith).

Hacked, stolen, or dummy (but phone-verified) accounts without Cure tickets are being sold to ticket brokers through a variety of services and forums. Those accounts, in the hands of brokers, can then be used to bypass protections designed to prevent brokers from buying tickets in the first place. Once brokers have bought the tickets (or obtained presale codes to buy tickets), the accounts themselves can then be resold with the tickets in the account to bypass restrictions on selling or transferring tickets (at typical scalping prices).

Scalpers have been using stolen and hacked accounts to buy and resell tickets before The Cure asked for these recent anti-scalping protections, while selling entire Ticketmaster accounts which contain tickets scalpers wouldn’t be able to resell otherwise appears to be a new method introduced specifically for The Cure’s tour. Neither practice, however, is widely known to the general public.

“As many of you are already aware, tickets for [The Cure] tour will not be transferable,” a post from a staff member of the paid ticket broker forum Shows on Sale said in a post reviewed by Motherboard. “For this reason, we are re...
