The notorious data thief known as IntelBroker allegedly broke into computer systems belonging to more than 40 victims worldwide and stole their data, costing them at least $25 million in damages, according to newly unsealed court documents that also name IntelBroker as 25-year-old British national Kai West.

A criminal indictment [[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/06/26/us_kai_west_indictment.pdf)] unsealed on Wednesday charges West, aka Kyle Northern, with four counts related to breaking into companies' computer systems, following a years-long scheme that allegedly started in December 2022 and continued until West was arrested in France in February 2025.

These crimes, according to the court documents, include stealing and then deleting data from a victim on January 6, 2023, which caused at least $5,000 in damage.
