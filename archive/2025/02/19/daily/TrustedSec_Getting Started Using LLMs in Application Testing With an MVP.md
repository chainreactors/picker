Certainly, the hot topic in application security right now is large language models (LLMs). As with most buzzy topics in software, the rollout of practical deployments greatly leads the way vs getting tooling in the hands of security practitioners. A lot of work has gone into defining what offensive security around applications offering GenAI chat interfaces or using LLMs to generate other content should look like. Some leading examples of this are OWASP’s [GenAI-Red-Teaming Guide](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/genai-red-teaming-guide/) and NIST’s [Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf). If you’re going to get started performing offensive security against an application with an LLM, these documents are a great place to obtain a solid idea of what you’re looking for and help you put together a methodology around testing.

Security concerns for the use of these language models in applications will vary by audience. Coming from the perspective of those performing mostly traditional web application testing, we are most interested in GenAI twists on lot of the same application concerns we’ve always had. Those would include injection attacks, request forgery both client and server-side, missing or incorrect authorization control, and concerns specific to the application domain. It comes down putting remote model and the completions it generates into the attack chain. We should be able to affect a lot of testing these interfaces for those issues with existing tools. Importantly we should have as a goal being able to get started with serious, effective LLM attacks on Day 1 of an application assessment, not on Day 2 after six 6 hours of scripting and debugging.

There is, of course, an array of entirely new concerns as well in areas like confabulation and integrity, and additionally for a host of social, brand, and intellectual property issues. These later areas are not the focus of what I am covering here. If you need to do work in these areas, you will require complex classifiers, scoring, and other GenAI domain-specific tools that are likely always going to be more complex than anything that could be stuffed into *Burp Suite*. This is a scope problem, and if your clients are asking for that kind of work, the only way forward is to put in the hours to build what you need.

Microsoft has contributed a framework called [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT) for more opened-ended adversarial assessments. There is another project aimed at making PyRIT more immediately usable, [PyRIT-Ship](https://github.com/microsoft/PyRIT-Ship), which is also worth a look.

If you are still reading, it is likely because you took the click-bait 'MVP' and, well now, you can let your bated breath out slowly. In this instance, I mean *minimum viable product*. What I have to share with ...
