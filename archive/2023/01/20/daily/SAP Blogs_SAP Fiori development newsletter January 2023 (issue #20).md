With so much economic uncertainty ahead, it’s more important than ever to figure out ways to drive efficiencies in software development. While low-code tools can help business analysts and similar roles build apps quickly, professional developers often need more powerful ways to provide the functionality, performance, and UX that their users expect.

If you want to meet with fellow developers and the SAP engineers who build our professional development tools, I encourage you to join our monthly SAP Fiori elements and SAP Fiori tools roundtable group.
[https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/31/peer-to-peer-learning-at-the-sap-fiori-elements-and-sap-fiori-tools...](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/31/peer-to-peer-learning-at-the-sap-fiori-elements-and-sap-fiori-tools-roundtable/)
You can also email me if you would like an invitation.

We publish the SAP Fiori development newsletter every other month to share new information with developers in the SAP ecosystem about SAPUI5, SAP Fiori elements, SAP Fiori tools, and SAP Business Application Studio.

To receive this content in your inbox, please [subscribe to receive the SAP Fiori development newsletter](https://www.sap.com/cmp/nl/sap-fiori-development-newsletter/index.html).

I’m looking forward to a 2023 with ongoing innovation and collaboration.

Your editorial team,
oliver.graeff, raz.korn, and peter.spielvogel.
