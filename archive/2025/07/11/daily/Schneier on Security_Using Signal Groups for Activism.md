## Using Signal Groups for Activism

Good [tutorial](https://micahflee.com/using-signal-groups-for-activism/) by Micah Lee. It includes some nonobvious use cases.

A reminder:

It is free to users, but it costs them money to run it.

There was an activism group a decade ago where we live because our local council wanted to pull down our homes to build high-end luxury flats and offices for foreign investors. Because of the diverse group involved a traditional samizdat was printed by a local print shop. However some people did scan it and forward it by email.
When there is a diverse group of people, some older people who have little interest in the web, smart phones or social media this is a better method I believe.

I think Micah Lee would have more credibility if he didn‚Äôt repeatedly use fallacious language like ‚ÄúIsraeli genocide.‚Äù

I do believe one Michael Singer is not following the moderation policy, just as this comment is not following the moderation policy. Michael Singer‚Äôs entire comment is nothing more than a weak attack on the author of the article with no data to back his claim. His comment does nothing to advance the discussion around Signal and its use and/or security implications. I would expect both this comment and Michael Singer‚Äôs comment be removed in light of the moderation policy.

@Shoal Creek,
The claim of @Michael Singer is that if one uses loaded language (as per your example), one turns away the other half of people who don‚Äôt subscribe to it. While they claim that specific term is fallacious, which is a value-judgment I have no need to get into, it IS objectively true that it will turn away the people who don‚Äôt agree and that probably isn‚Äôt contributing to Micah Lee‚Äôs agenda, unless that agenda is security only for the same-minded, which I‚Äôd prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt on, as I‚Äôm sure you are not just Micah Lee masquerading, trying to use your questionable on it‚Äôs merits and definitively subjective interpretation of the moderation policy to censor an opinion ypu dislike üôÇ

Micah Lee claims the examples are from his own use, making them valid examples. The argument that the issue description is a problem is an argument inherently passing judgement on the issue at hand. The same invalid argument could be made for the other examples given ‚Äî there are many who don‚Äôt approve of people protesting ICE activities, for example.

It is likely that any example of using such groups for activism is going to be ‚Äúapproved‚Äù by some people and ‚Äúdisapproved‚Äù by others. That does not make the examples themselves invalid.

@ ALL in the UK,

As others and the referenced article have brought up a certain conflict and people that might believe in free speech about it‚Ä¶

You should all be aware of, and take caution that,

The very much ‚Äúon the take‚Äù actions of UK ministers including Yvette Cooper who have claimed a protest group is a terrorist organisation.

Whilst I might not agree with the actions of the protest group, I can not see any legitimate reason to call them terrorists unlike those working for the politicians.

Any way mentioning the now ‚Äúproscribed group‚Äù by name is technically a serious crime‚Ä¶ So how I caution against it without mentioning them is one of those things that arise with major abuses of power by politicians‚Ä¶

So I will just link to Minister Yvette Cooper‚Äôs own words made in the UK ‚ÄúCommons parliament‚Äù as justification for the ‚Äúon the take‚Äù actions that she and other ministers profit by,

My problem with this is that while all of the security measures were true, I‚Äôve read about the cases where secure means of comm unication were created and ran by monitoring agencies then marketed well. I feel like you couldn‚Äôt reasonably trust any major platform you didn‚Äôt create yourself for that reason.
( at least, if you have reason to distrust your current government)

@the i

> I feel like you couldn‚Äôt reasonably trust any major platform you didn‚Äôt create yourself for that reason.

Your advice is self defeating.

If you created the communication platform yourself, you advice the people you want to communicate with to not use it.

If they created it, you won‚Äôt use it.

How then to communicate?

Your advice only benefits the persecutors. So maybe we should not trust your advice.

But without trust, why should we communicate?

Micah has no credibility to teach about OPSEC.

@lost

I cannot find a connection between your accusation and the link you supplied.

Could you be bothered to give some supporting evidence?
