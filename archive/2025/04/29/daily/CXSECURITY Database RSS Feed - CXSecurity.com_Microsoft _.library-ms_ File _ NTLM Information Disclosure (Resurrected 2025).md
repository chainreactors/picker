[-] Microsoft ".library-ms" File / NTLM Information Disclosure Spoofing (Resurrected 2025) / CVE-2025-24054

[+] ISR: ApparitionSec
Back in 2018, I reported a ".library-ms" File NTLM information disclosure vulnerability to MSRC and was told "it was not severe enough", that being said I post it anyways.
Seven years passed, until other researchers re-reported it.
Subsequently this security flaw was finally deemed important by Microsoft and it received CVE-2025-24054, for which I was finally retroactively credited as the original reporter.
Circa 2025 updated:
