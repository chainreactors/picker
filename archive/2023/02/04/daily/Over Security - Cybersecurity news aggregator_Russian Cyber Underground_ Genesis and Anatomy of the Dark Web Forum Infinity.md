# **Executive Summary**

The Yarix Cyber Threat Intelligence (YCTI) team analysed the genesis and anatomy of a brand-new forum operating in the Russian cyber underground: the **Infinity Forum**.

Infinity is a recently appeared cyber creature founded by **KillMillk** (former head of the pro-Russia hacktivist group **Killnet**) and  engineered by Russian hacktivists. It is officially operative since January 2023, but its embryonic traces can be traced back at least to November 2022. Infinity is not like other known forums in the Dark Web. It has unique features, which were never seen before in the Russian cyber underground. Moreover, it is one of the most recent Dark Web forums founded by **hacktivists**.

As of January 2023, the **hacker groups officially members of the forum** are the following: Killnet, Anonymous Russia, Infinity Hacker By (Belarus), Bear IT Army, Deanon Club, Special Attack and Reconnaissance Division – SARD, National Hackers of Russia. However, **Infinity’s ambition is to gather all main pro-Russia hacktivist groups**. Therefore, we expect to see in the near future more hacker groups to become officially members of the forum.

Russian cyber-hacktivist groups like Killnet, Anonymous Russia or NoName057(16) [*For further information read Ylabs article* [Analysis of the Russian-Speaking Threat Actor NoName 057(16)](https://labs.yarix.com/2022/10/analysis-of-the-russian-speaking-threat-actor-noname-05716/)] are part of a wider strategy named **Cyberwarfare** in the Western doctrine and **Information Warfare** in the Russian one. Cyberwarfare is limited to computer network operations, while Information Warfare entails also psychological operations, as well as information and disinformation actions. From the analysis conducted by the YCTI team, it can be asserted that the cyber-collectives behind the Infinity Forum operate as agents of the Information Warfare, as will be further discussed in this article. However, there is no evidence of a potential connection with state entities of the Russian Federation.

The Infinity Forum is structured in a way similar to other well-known **Russian-speaking forums and marketplaces** active in the Dark Web such as XSS, Exploit and Club Hydra. However, this forum has also unique and distinctive features which make it different from the others. Specifically, there are sections dedicated to **discussions about geopolitics, ideologies, social movements** **and operations carried out or triggered by its members in the physical world**.

By analysing the contents of the forum, it can be assumed that the ideological background on which the Infinity Forum is grafted and through which flourished in the Dark Web is that one of the Russian ultra-nationalistic perspective with regards to the West. Namely, **anti-Western/NATO sentiments and rhetoric**.

One of the most striking and threatening features of the **Infinity Forum is that it has broken the boundaries of the cyberspace and made a breakthrough into the real world**. They not only conduct cyber-attacks, Infinity Forum members have raised the bar and conducted operations to harm the physical world. As an example, we can mention the **terrorist attacks** conducted by the cyber-collective National Hackers of Russia against Lithuanian airports, schools and state institutions. A further example is provided by the **disinformation campaigns and support to protests and anti-government movements held in Poland** and triggered by SARD, another cyber-collective officially member of the Infinity Forum. These and other examples will be further discussed in the present article, including an overview of the infrastructure built around the Infinity forum’s domain and correlated websites.

The Infinity Forum represents a **disruptive and threatening new element in the cyber domain** that is going to acquire wider recognition as one of the major threats coming from the **Russian cyber underground**.

# **The Landscape of Russian Cyber Underground**

## Russian cyber-underground: the fifth domain of warfare

London, 2005, during the e-Crime Congress in London, in front of a packed audience composed by experts coming from top-notch companies in the cybersecurity domain and governmental agencies, Lt. Gen. Boris Miroshnikov warned about the threat placed by **Russian hackers**. The Lt. Gen. called also for the strengthening of police international cooperation and for unified international laws in the field of Internet crime. Eighteen years have passed since that international conference and the world has changed a lot since then.

The current state of cooperation between Western powers and the Russian Federation is at the lowest level since the Cold War. That relationship of trust built with Russia has inevitably been affected by the on-going conflict in Ukraine. It will take years to restore good relations, if that ever happens. Nowadays, the West is confronting Russia in the battlefield indirectly by providing, mostly, defensive military support to Ukraine. However, as we all know, in the 21st century, after land, sea, air and space, warfare has entered a fifth domain: **cyberspace**. Therefore, the West is called to face as well the threats stemming from the **Russian cyber-arsenal**. Since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine, in February 2022, several **pro-Russia hacktivist groups** have emerged in the cyber-underground. Cyber-collectives whose aim is to attack, weaken and undermine Western countries and, in general, those who provide support to Ukraine in the conflict with Russia. Some of these groups, like Killnet, became well-known and were widely covered by media outreach for their cyber-attacks conducted against Western critical infrastructures and strategic economic domains (i.e., governmental agencies, airports, hospitals). Other pro-Russia cyber-collectives kept a more low-key profile, working silently but unceasingly in the wings.

As stated before, Russian cyber-hacktivists hit the news with their blatant attacks and declarations against Western countries critical targets. Everyone in the cybersecurity filed has heard about **Killnet** and probably almost everyone must have heard at least once about its founder: **KillMilk**.

KillMilk is not only the former leader of the well-known pro-Russia cyber-collective Killnet, he is also the founder of a **brand-new Forum** in the cyber-underground named **Infinity**, a recently appeared cyber creature engineered by Russian hacktivists. The Infinity Forum is officially operative since January 2023, but its embryonic traces can be traced back to the end of November 2022. Infinity is not like other known forums in the Dark Web. ...
