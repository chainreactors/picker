Your organization’s [application portfolio is growing](https://www.securityjourney.com/post/the-appsec-dilemma-could-be-to-blame) and so are the risks. With every new web app, API, or microservice, attackers find new vulnerabilities to exploit. Meanwhile, your AppSec teams are under constant pressure to do more, faster, with fewer resources.

Scaling your AppSec teams in 2025 isn’t just about keeping up; it’s about staying ahead. From managing sprawling portfolios to meeting rising compliance demands, the challenges can feel overwhelming. To help, we’ve broken down the challenges into four critical areas that you need to address:

* [**AppSec outpaced by portfolio growth**](#PortfolioGrowth)**.**

+ [Regain control of expanding portfolios and attack surfaces](#RegainControl).

* [**Solving the resource crisis in AppSec**](#ResourceCrisis)**.**

+ [How big is the resource challenge?](#ResourceChallenge).
+ [DAST: the solution to resource constraints?](#DAST).

* [**Breaking barriers: the modern security practice challenge**](#SecurityPractices).

+ [How Burp Suite Enterprise Edition empowers DevSecOps](#EmpowersDevSecOps).

* [**The high stakes of compliance reporting at scale**](#ComplianceAtScale)**.**

+ [DAST: Solving compliance challenges for AppSec teams](#DAST-Compliance).

PortSwigger will help you understand the complexities and challenges of scaling AppSec teams, and how [Dynamic Application Security Testing](/burp/application-security-testing/dast) ([DAST](/burp/application-security-testing/dast)) can help you build a more efficient, agile, and mature security program.

Let’s discuss the obstacles holding back your AppSec teams, and how you can confidently overcome your organization’s application security challenges.

## AppSec outpaced by portfolio growth

As an AppSec leader, you're tasked with securing an ever-growing portfolio of applications, APIs, and microservices, all while staying ahead of attackers who only need one opening to exploit your organization.

Growing portfolios of applications and APIs create an interconnected web of vulnerabilities that are increasingly difficult to manage through manual [pentesting](/solutions/penetration-testing) alone.

Imagine managing 10,000 websites across internal and external assets. In a discovery call, One Security Engineer from a leading asset trading platform describes the challenge:

With such a large application portfolio and limited visibility, critical vulnerabilities can go undetected, leaving your organization exposed to potential damage.

**The scale is daunting, but not unique.**

So, how do you improve your organization’s security posture amidst expanding portfolios and attack surfaces?

### Regain control of expanding portfolios and attack surfaces

To address the challenge of scaling amidst growing portfolios and new vulnerabilities, you need to feel confident that your teams are using a scalable solution that covers entire attack surfaces.

With [Burp Suite Enterprise Edition](/burp/enterprise), PortSwigger’s DAST solution, you can make scaling your security efforts achievable.

Whether you’re managing 10 or 10,000 web applications, Burp Suite Enterprise Edition allows teams to automate scanning, delivering actionable insights, quickly.

However, embedding a DAST solution across large portfolios should not become another challenge. PortSwigger’s onboarding teams have helped AppSec teams quickly address large portfolios and attack surfaces.

With Burp Suite Enterprise Edition, your AppSec teams have access to a centralized, automated vulnerability management system that can be adapted to your needs.

## Solving the resource crisis in AppSec

As portfolios grow, your AppSec teams face another challenge: the widening gap between resources and responsibilities. With developer-to-security unbalanced, the strain on lean teams is unsustainable.

You know that challenges like hiring talent, training, and cost make scaling AppSec teams difficult. Whilst there is no substitute for the accuracy provided by comprehensive, manual assessment by an experienced pentester, relying exclusively on manual testing is impractical at scale.

### How big is the resource challenge?

There is an imbalance in most organizations between developers and security professionals. An overwhelming number of our customers suggest...
