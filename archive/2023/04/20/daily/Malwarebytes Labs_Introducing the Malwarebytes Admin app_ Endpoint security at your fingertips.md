## Introducing the Malwarebytes Admin app: Endpoint security at your fingertips

April 19, 2023

[Bill Cozens](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/wcozensmalwarebytes-com/)

If you’re on the beach sipping piña coladas, the last thing you probably want to do is rush to your desktop and address a critical security issue.

And yet, this is the reality for many IT security professionals today. Regardless of the time or current location, security pros are expected to drop everything at a moment’s notice and swoop in to save the day.

But being tethered to a desktop workstation can blur the boundaries between work and personal life. This inflexibility not only leads to additional stress and pressure on IT professionals, but also can delay response times as they scramble back to their workstation to put out fires. Even just taking a break is hard without the fear of leaving the system unattended.

Enter the Malwarebytes Admin app.

Designed as a companion [to the Nebula console](https://www.threatdown.com/products/), the mobile app now allows administrators to manage alerts and perform essential tasks right from their iOS devices. No more being tied to a computer–you can now handle incidents and execute administrative functions wherever you are.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy an interrupted piña colada as we will delve into the key features of the Malwarebytes Admin App.

## Getting started: Setting up the Malwarebytes Admin app

![](http://www.threatdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/easset_upload_file5244_264349_e.png)

1. Download the Malwarebytes Admin app from the App Store. It is available for free for all Nebula users.
2. Log in with your Nebula console credentials. The app is accessible to users with admin or read-only privileges on the Nebula console.

**‎NOTE:** Malwarebytes Admin is an enterprise solution intended for IT admins. Malwarebytes Admin will not operate on your device without the required license for Nebula.

## Navigating the app: Dashboard and features

Once logged in, the first screen you will see is the Dashboard.

Here, you can quickly assess the protection status of all endpoints, view detections by type, and view your license usage.

## Managing endpoints: Endpoint list and actions

The Endpoint List displays all the endpoints you are managing.

The badges let you know which endpoints need immediate attention. The list can be filtered by status, OS, OS version, group, or policy, and you can search for specific endpoint names.

Tapping on a specific endpoint allows you to view its general information, such as host, location, operating system, and network interfaces.

## Adding users

With the Malwarebytes Admin app, you can add new users to the console by sending email invitations. You can assign roles (Super Admin, Admin, Read-only), add users to existing groups, delete users, resend invites, and edit user roles or group membership.

## Future developments

While the Malwarebytes Admin app currently offers a wide range of features, there are some functionalities reserved for future updates. For example, while the app is **only available for iOS right now,...
