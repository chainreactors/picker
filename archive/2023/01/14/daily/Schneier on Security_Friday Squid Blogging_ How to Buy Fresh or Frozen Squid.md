## Friday Squid Blogging: How to Buy Fresh or Frozen Squid

Good [advice](https://www.thespruceeats.com/squid-and-calamari-selection-and-storage-1807810) on buying squid. I like to buy whole fresh squid and [clean it](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-clean-squid-1808818) myself.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Israeli-owned firms reportedly selling spyware to Bangladesh with no oversight

<https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-owned-firms-reportedly-selling-spyware-to-bangladesh-with-no-oversight/>

“Spyware developed by several firms linked to Israel or led by Israelis has been sold to the government of Bangladesh, according to a joint investigation between the Haaretz daily and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.

Israel and Bangladesh do not have any diplomatic relations, and the South Asian country has a markedly poor human rights record.

According to the Haaretz report, several Israeli cybertech firms that are either based in other countries or appear to operate shell companies in other countries have sold the Bangladeshi government equipment that can be used to monitor the communications and activities of citizens.

Israel’s Defense Ministry must approve sales of sensitive technology to other countries, but has little recourse against Israeli-run companies that are based abroad.

One such firm named by Haaretz is known as Passitora, controlled by former senior Israeli military intelligence officer Tal Dilian as part of his Intellexa Alliance group of spyware companies. According to the report, Passitora, which is registered in Cyprus, sold a SpearHead system — a surveillance van that can hack into phones within a radius of about half a kilometer — to an arm of the Bangladeshi Interior Ministry.

Another such company named by Haaretz is Toru Group Limited, which utilizes a Swiss address but is registered in the British Virgin Islands and run by an Israeli citizen, Assaf Elias. Haaretz cited three sources claiming that Toru Group merely acts as a middleman to sell technology made by Dilian’s Intellexa companies.

A third company named in the report, Prelysis, is based in Cyprus and Israel and founded and directed by Israeli citizen Kobi Naveh. The firm reportedly sold a system that enables the interception of Wi-Fi communications to Bangladesh in 2019.

A company named Coralco Tech, based in Singapore and owned by Israeli Eyal Almog, sold equipment that can monitor cellphones to Bangladesh in 2019, while U-TX, based in Cyprus and directed by Israeli David Heled, also sold similar technology to Dhaka.”

Israeli quantum communication nanosatellite launched into orbit by SpaceX rocket

<https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-quantum-communication-nanosatellite-launched-into-orbit-by-spacex-rocket/>

“A new nanosatellite developed by Tel Aviv University researchers was launched into orbit by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Tuesday.

The 20-centimeter (7.9-inch) nanosatellite, named TAU-SAT3, is the first Israeli satellite built to advance research into optical and quantum communication from space and an “important step towards demonstrating reliable quantum communication,” according to the researchers.

!!!Quantum communication is a field of technology that seeks to enable the fast and secure transfer of communication for files and data and aims to make information security totally impervious to unauthorized access in a world haunted by constant hacking threats.

Prof. Yaron Oz, head of TAU’s Center for Quantum Science and Technology pointed out that as the emergence of quantum computers =>is expected to “crack today’s encryption algorithms,” exposing data such as personal medical and financial records, email and WhatsApp messages, governments around the world are investing millions in the research of “eavesdropping-proof quantum communication.”

“The principles of quantum mechanics enable an unconditionally secure encryption method,” said Prof. Oz. “Whenever a hostile entity tries to intercept a transmitted message, the message immediately dissipates.”

!!!“Moreover, the interception attempt is detected – unlike current encryption methods, in which interceptions remain undetectable,” Prof. Oz added.

At an altitude of 550 kilometers (342 miles), the TAU-SAT3 will orbit the earth for about five years to conduct several scientific missions while sending optical and radio communication signals back to an optical ground station set up on the roof of a building at the TAU campus.”

I haven’t cleaned whole squid in at least a decade. I always loved pulling the pen out – I took a pic of the 1st pen I extracted. Beautiful.

I have played a little with chatGPT. It gives remarkable sensible answers to questions. An obvious unhealthy action was rightly advised against, a simple question about an obscure scripting language problem was “correctly” answered (I did not really check).

I asked a very technical question in a field I am well informed about and it returned a very reasonable answer. If a student gave that answer, she would get an A+.

But chatGPT mentioned a study I did not know so I asked for a reference and it returned a title, author, year and journal. Looking that up showed that the article did not exist, not in Google Scholar, not in the archives of the journal, nor when browsing issues of that year.

Then I gave chatGPT the title and author of the study that actually contained the data it so well described, and then it reported a fictitious article with that title and author in a journal it most definitely did not appear in. The original study was published online, but never in a journal paper at all.

In...
