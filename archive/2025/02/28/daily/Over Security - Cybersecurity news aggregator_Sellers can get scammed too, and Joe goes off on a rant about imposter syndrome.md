[Threat Source newsletter](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/category/threat-source-newsletter/)

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Threat Source newsletter.

Hello again my friends! Geez, it’s been a year am I right? Lemons its February you say?! Oof.

Imposter syndrome. You’ve heard the term I’m sure, [but what is it](https://www.mcleanhospital.org/essential/impostor-syndrome)? Basically: imposter syndrome is the persistent feeling of self-doubt and fear of being exposed as a fraud despite clear evidence of competence and success. In cybersecurity, and in *especially* in Talos, you will find imposter syndrome in abundance.

In Talos you’re in rooms of incredibly bright and smart people. They are paragons of what it is to be hackers, and you cannot help but often admire the amazing quality of their work. It is truly an amazing team that does important work to help save the world from the bad guys.

The downside? *You’re in a room of bright and smart people.* Some can reverse malware binaries while juggling chainsaws. Some are polyglots who can at length tell you the linguistic nuances of Mesopotamian verbs and loanwords and have eidetic memory of every ransomware cartel ever. I personally know one is an amazing, accredited musician and actually hacked a prison to open its jail cells on a pentest.

How do you not compare yourself to the talents, skills, and achievements of wonderfully smart and talented people? It’s tough not to. Comparison is truly the thief of joy.

The truth is – in cybersecurity and in places like Talos and elsewhere, you will be constantly assailing yourself with self-doubt of achievement and belonging. The anxiety, stress, and burnout from imposter syndrome are a real thig.

So what do we do? First, look at your achievements. You are where you are because others saw value in your work. Second, challenge those negative self-thoughts. Easier said than done, I know, but hear me out. Use mentors and peer group support to help challenge those negative self-thoughts.

And lastly, *be kind to yourself.* Cybersecurity is a hard gig. It’s a gigantic amount of technical and non-technical information and we all feel the pressure to absorb, understand, and master it and all its nuances. That’s not possible of course, but we cyber folks are wired differently. If you can walk away with 1% more information than you had yesterday, that’s a win. Take it. Just be kind to yourself, ok?

I want to take a moment to address a specific audience of readers. All the U.S.  federal workers who have been affected by reduction in force (RIFs), my heart goes out to you. This is an unearned hardship. I wish I had a magic wand to wave to alleviate the stress and trauma of a sudden event like this. I know it’s truly awful. If I can offer any guidance or mentorship for private sector cybersecurity, [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeics/). I may not have all the answers, but I will do what I can. Stay strong.

## The one big thing

[Boy howdy is this a big one](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/online-marketplace-scams/) – scams! Look, the average person isn’t going to get smoked by Salt/Volt Typhoon, or wrestle with a financial threat actor like a ransomware cartel. But you absolutely have bought and sold things online.  We break down seller abuse – that is, ways to trick sellers into be defrauded out of money. We always picture scams as the seller doing the defrauding, but the reverse is just as true.

## Why do I care?

You want to keep money in your pocket, and not be the victim of a scam. They adversaries here know the systems they are manipulating quite well here and have fine tuned the art of fraud. It’s important to understand the seller experience as much as the buyer experience in order understand these kinds of frauds and thefts.

## So now what?

Understand the threat landscape for seller/buyer fraud, and hopefully this work can help keep money in your pocket and not a victim of theft. Pay attention to URL’s you’re asked to click, and clever re-directs to scamming websites. Now you know. And as G.I. Joe said – knowing is half the battle.

## Top security headlines of the week

Sensitive financial and health data belonging to millions of veterans and stored on a benefits website is at risk of being stolen or otherwise compromised, according to a federal employee tasked with cybersecurity who was recently fired as part of massive government-wide cuts.
