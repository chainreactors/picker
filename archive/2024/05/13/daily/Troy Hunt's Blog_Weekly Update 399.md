# Weekly Update 399

12 May 2024

The Post Millennial breach in this week's video is an interesting one, most notably because of the presence of the mailing lists. Now, as I've said in every piece of communication I've put out on this incident, the lists are what whoever defaced the site *said* TPM had and they certainly posted that data in the defacement message, but we're yet to hear a statement from the company itself. Taking it at face value, where does their responsibility lie as it relates to individuals in this data set? I mean, let's say you signed a petition aligned to your political ideals many years ago and agreed to the terms and conditions (which you didn't read, because you're a normal human) then your data pops up somewhere like TPM. Is it *their* responsibility to let you know? Or the service that sold your data to them? Or... something else? It's messy, real messy, and the only thing I'm confident in saying is that the most likely thing to happen is the same as every other time we see this pattern: nothing.
