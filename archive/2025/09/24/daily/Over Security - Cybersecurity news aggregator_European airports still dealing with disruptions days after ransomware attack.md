# European airports still dealing with disruptions days after ransomware attack

[A ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/eu-cyber-agency-confirms-ransomware-attack-causing-airport-disruptions/), a company that provides check-in systems to several airports in Europe, is still causing disruptions across the continent for the fourth day in a row.

As of this writing, [according to FlightRadar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airport-disruption?continent=worldwide&period=live&type=departures), a website that monitors air traffic live, London’s Heathrow airport has 90% of flights delayed, with an average delay of 29 minutes; Brussels airport has 88% of flights delayed, with an average delay of 43 minutes; Berlin Brandenburg airport has 94% of flights delayed, with an average delay of one hour; and Dublin airport has 91% of flights delayed, with an average delay of 26 minutes.

Dublin airport’s spokesperson Graeme McQueen told TechCrunch in a statement that “there is no timeline at the current time for a fix to be implemented,” as airlines “continue to deploy manual workarounds while work continues to fix the IT issues that have been affecting check-in and boarding systems.”

Brussel’s airport [wrote on X](http://x.com/BrusselsAirport) that it is expecting “limited disruptions” on Tuesday and Wednesday. On its official website, [the airport said](https://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passengers/infopage/difficult-airport-operations) “the service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. At the moment it is still unclear when the issue will be resolved.”

Ihsane Chioua Lekhli, spokesperson for Brussel’s airport, told TechCrunch that “over 90% of the scheduled flights can depart today, but there are indeed some delays.”

A warning on Berlin’s airport’s [official website](https://ber.berlin-airport.de/en.html) said “there are longer waiting times.”

Dennis Dobrowolski, Berlin airport’s spokesperson, told TechCrunch that “operations at the airport have continued to stabilize,” but “delays may still occur for departures as well as for baggage handling and delivery.”

A spokesperson for Heathrow did not respond to a request for comment.

On Monday, European cybersecurity agency ENISA [confirmed](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/eu-cyber-agency-confirms-ransomware-attack-causing-airport-disruptions/) that the airport disruptions were due to a ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace.

RTX, the company that owns Collins Aerospace, did not respond to a request for comment on the status of the recovery after the cyberattack.
