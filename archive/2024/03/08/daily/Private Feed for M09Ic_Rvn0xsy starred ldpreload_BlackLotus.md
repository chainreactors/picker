# BlackLotus

BlackLotus is an innovative UEFI Bootkit designed specifically for Windows. It incorporates a built-in Secure Boot bypass and Ring0/Kernel protection to safeguard against any attempts at removal. This software serves the purpose of functioning as an HTTP Loader. Thanks to its robust persistence, there is no necessity for frequent updates of the Agent with new encryption methods. Once deployed, traditional antivirus software will be incapable of scanning and eliminating it. The software comprises two primary components: the Agent, which is installed on the targeted device, and the Web Interface, utilized by administrators to manage the bots. In this context, a bot refers to a device equipped with the installed Agent.

**FYI**: This version of BlackLotus (v2) has removed baton drop, and replaced the original version SHIM loaders with bootlicker. UEFI loading, infection and post-exploitation persistence are all the same.
