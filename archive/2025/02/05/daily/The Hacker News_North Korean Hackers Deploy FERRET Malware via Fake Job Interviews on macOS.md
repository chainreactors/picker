[![Fake Job Interviews on macOS](data:image/png;base64... "Fake Job Interviews on macOS")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhj5mEwNHiHEc1VFQNd4XQqmcdYbMJmCADEzJQukNSzCVqN6MQoKZ27YgsyYrJtpCl9XNmFkBFeeWWvM-2oidZAYTme-m4FJE4zyKrWtPtS8QgvxY_fXOBq3fy46Fsa_pLxNBHRHmZjShZDJEHq_VRRjZvzCoPpL-iQFcIaxU9T1ViNjIPY297UWaLuUShO/s790-rw-e365/malware-code-job.png)

The North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign have been observed delivering a collection of Apple macOS malware strains dubbed FERRET as part of a supposed job interview process.

"Targets are typically asked to communicate with an interviewer through a link that throws an error message and a request to install or update some required piece of software such as VCam or CameraAccess for virtual meetings," SentinelOne researchers Phil Stokes and Tom Hegel [said](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/macos-flexibleferret-further-variants-of-dprk-malware-family-unearthed/) in a new report.

Contagious Interview, first uncovered in late 2023, is a [persistent effort](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/north-korea-linked-malware-targets.html) undertaken by the hacking crew to deliver malware to prospective targets through bogus npm packages and native apps masquerading as videoconferencing software. It's also tracked as DeceptiveDevelopment and DEV#POPPER.

These attack chains are designed to drop a JavaScript-based malware known as BeaverTail, which, besides harvesting sensitive data from web browsers and crypto wallets, is capable of delivering a Python backdoor named InvisibleFerret.

In December 2024, Japanese cybersecurity company NTT Security Holdings revealed that JavaScript malware is also configured to fetch and execute another malware known as [OtterCookie](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-deploy-ottercookie.html).

The discovery of the FERRET family of malware, first uncovered towards the end of 2024, suggests that the threat actors are actively honing their tactics to evade detection.

This includes the adoption of [a ClickFix-style approach](https://thehackernews.com/2024/10/beware-fake-google-meet-pages-deliver.html) to trick users into copying and executing a malicious command on their Apple macOS systems via the Terminal app in order to address a problem with accessing the camera and microphone through the web browser.

According to security researcher Taylor Monahan, who goes by the username @tayvano\_, the attacks [originate](https://x.com/tayvano_/status/1872980013542457802) with the attackers approaching the targets on LinkedIn by posing as recruiters and urging them to complete a video assessment. The end goal is to drop a [Golang-based backdoor and stealer](https://dmpdump.github.io/posts/NorthKorea_Backdoor_Stealer/) that's designed to drain the victim's MetaMask Wallet and run commands on the host.

[![macOS Malware](data:image/png;base64... "macOS Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9iQM_wf_H6MJP-t8t0EuEpM97zBhmFC2GtFJcaj4nOa8cvP1AdSpxu1MPn7kpvrv2Unw8wxKqjL3nzoNVzfpyWbO-3uWP0Q7a3epNl9WO5AP5jC9jmdnaI6URroKy7BPea14SJwK9ayKHvQy7vo7SGYOmziJnXjfzYbVP_mUUY-FKyL2vrRVdle2ntVew/s790-rw-e365/malware.png)

Some of the components associated with the malware have been codenamed FRIENDLYFERRET\_SECD, FROSTYFERRET\_UI, and MULTI\_FROSTYFERRET\_CMDCODES. According to Stokes, FROSTYFERRET\_UI refers to the first-stage binary delivered in malicious apps such as ChromeUpdate and CameraAccess.

FRIENDLYFERRET\_SECD is the name assigned to the second-stage Go backdoor "com.apple.secd" and the "growth" x86-64 Mach-O binary previously observed in the [Hidden Risk campaign](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-hackers-target-crypto.html) targeting cryptocurrency-related businesses. MULTI\_FROSTYFERRET\_CMDCODES, on the other hand, is a reference to the Go configuration file for the stage two backdoor.

SentinelOne said it also identified another set of artifacts named FlexibleFerret that takes care of establishing persistence on the infected macOS system by means of a LaunchAgent. The malware is propagated by means of a package named InstallerAlert that's functionally similar to FROSTYFERRET\_UI.

Stokes said while the FlexibleFerret samples were delivered in the form of an Apple Installer package, it's currently not known what lure technique was employed to entice targets into running the malware. That said, there is evidence to suggest that the malware is being propagated by opening fake issues on legitimate GitHub repositories, once again pointing to a diversification of their attack methods.

"This suggests that the threat actors are happy to expand the vectors by which they deliver the malware beyond the specific targeting of job seekers to developers more generally," the researchers said.

The disclosure comes days after supply chain security firm Socket detailed a malicious npm package named postcss-optimizer containing the BeaverTail malware. The library [remains available](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-optimizer) for download from the npm registry as of writing.

"By impersonating the legitimate postcss library, which has over 16 billion downloads, the threat actor aims to infect developers' systems with credential-stealing and data-exfiltration capabilities across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems," security researchers Kirill Boychenko and Peter van der Zee [said](https://socket.dev/blog/north-korean-apt-lazarus-targets-developers-with-malicious-npm-package).

The development also follows the [discovery](https://www.genians.co.kr/blog/threat_intelligence/k-messenge...
