# Pirate Service ‘MagisTV’ Fails to Secure U.S. Trademark, Faces Malware Backlash

MagisTV, a leading pirate streaming brand in Latin America, finds itself caught between a legal storm and a mounting malware backlash. This week, the service saw its U.S. trademark application abandoned amidst growing scrutiny from authorities and rightsholders worldwide. At the same time, a barrage of local news reports warn consumers that using MagisTV's software could lead to identity theft and expose them to viruses.

Pirate streaming apps and unauthorized IPTV services have become increasingly popular globally in recent years.

Latin America is no exception to this trend but unlike other regions, one pirate streaming brand clearly stands out: MagisTV.

The [MagisTV name](https://torrentfreak.com/?s=magistv) is used by dozens of websites, many of which are reseller platforms. While some of these might be related, the name is also used by unrelated entities, simply because the brand has become synonymous with pirate IPTV.

## A Notorious Market

Rightsholders worldwide are not pleased with the brand’s dominance and have worked hard to counter it. This resulted in several referrals that reportedly resulted in criminal investigations in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.

Following a referral from the MPA’s anti-piracy arm ACE, two Magis TV operators were criminally prosecuted in Colombia, with both receiving [30-month suspended prison sentences](https://www.alliance4creativity.com/news/ace-statement-on-sentencing-in-large-scale-digital-piracy-case-in-colombia/) from a local court in May.

The MagisTV problem was also reported to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), which added the brand to its [latest list of notorious piracy markets](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-trade-representative-lists-the-most-notorious-piracy-threats-250108/).

“MagisTV is one of the world’s most popular IPTV services and operates primarily in Latin America. The service provides unauthorized access to live sports streams, television channels, and on-demand movies and television shows to its customers for a monthly subscription,” USTR wrote.

However, despite these enforcement actions and repeated warnings, the “Magis TV” problem hasn’t gone away.

## Magis TV Trademark Application Abandoned

Following the USTR’s listing, several Magis TV domain names were abandoned, while others [rebranded their service](https://torrentfreak.com/notorious-pirate-iptv-service-magistv-applies-for-us-trademark-and-rebrands-250114/) to Flujo TV, presumably to escape the heat. The Magis TV brand nonetheless remains popular today even in the United States, where a Chinese company tried to obtain the U.S. trademark.

The company ‘Shenzhen Huiyi Electronics’ [applied](https://torrentfreak.com/notorious-pirate-iptv-service-magistv-applies-for-us-trademark-and-rebrands-250114/) for the ‘Magis TV’ mark for the recognizable logo at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Last December, it passed the first hurdle when the office issued a “notice of allowance,” to the frustration of many rightsholders.

To proceed with the registration process, the Chinese set-top box manufacturer was required to file a Statement of Use (SOU), proving they are actually using the trademark in commerce. That document never arrived, prompting the trademark office to abandon the application.

This effectively means the trademark application is no longer active and will not proceed to registration.

If the Chinese company would still like to secure the trademark, it can file a “Petition to Revive” within two months, which comes at an extra cost. For now, however, there’s no indication that it missed the deadline unintentionally. Instead, the legal pressure against the Magis TV brand likely makes the trademark less appealing.

## A Malware and Security Threat

In addition to the legal concerns, recent publications in Latin American news outlets repeatedly warn of potential security risks related to Magis TV. While these concerns are certainly warranted, the barrage of articles clearly stands out, as the collection of translated headlines below shows.
