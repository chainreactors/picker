It‚Äôs a case of algorithm and blues as we look into an AI music scam, Ukraine believes it has caught a spy high in the sky, and a cocaine-fuelled bear goes on the rampage.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
