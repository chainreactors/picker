#
# Osprey Pump Controller 1.0.1 Authentication Bypass Credentials Modification
#
#
# Vendor: ProPump and Controls, Inc.
# Product web page: https://www.propumpservice.com | https://www.pumpstationparts.com
# Affected version: Software Build ID 20211018, Production 10/18/2021
# Mirage App: MirageAppManager, Release [1.0.1]
# Mirage Model 1, RetroBoard II
#
#
# Summary: Providing pumping systems and automated controls for
# golf courses and turf irrigation, municipal water and sewer,
# biogas, agricultural, and industrial markets. Osprey: door-mounted,
# irrigation and landscape pump controller.
#
# Technology hasn't changed dramatically on pump and electric motors
# in the last 30 years. Pump station controls are a different story.
# More than ever before, customers expect the smooth and efficient
# operation of VFD control. Communications—monitoring, remote control,
# and interfacing with irrigation computer programs—have become common
# requirements. Fast and reliable accessibility through cell phones
# has been a game changer.
#
# ProPump & Controls can handle any of your retrofit needs, from upgrading
# an older relay logic system to a powerful modern PLC controller, to
# converting your fixed speed or first generation VFD control system to
# the latest control platform with communications capabilities.
#
# We use a variety of solutions, from MCI-Flowtronex and Watertronics
# package panels to sophisticated SCADA systems capable of controlling
# and monitoring networks of hundreds of pump stations, valves, tanks,
# deep wells, or remote flow meters.
#
# User friendly system navigation allows quick and easy access to all
# critical pump station information with no password protection unless
# requested by the customer. Easy to understand control terminology allows
# any qualified pump technician the ability to make basic changes without
# support. Similar control and navigation platform compared to one of the
# most recognized golf pump station control systems for the last twenty
# years make it familiar to established golf service groups nationwide.
# Reliable push button navigation and LCD information screen allows the
# use of all existing control panel door switches to eliminate the common
# problems associated with touchscreens.
#
# Global system configuration possibilities allow it to be adapted to
# virtually any PLC or relay logic controlled pump stations being used in
# the industrial, municipal, agricultural and golf markets that operate
# variable or fixed speed. On board Wi-Fi and available cellular modem
# option allows complete remote access.
#
# Desc: A vulnerability has been discovered in the web panel of Osprey pump
# controller that allows an unauthenticated attacker to create an account
# and bypass authentication, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the
# system. The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication
# checks during the account creation process, which allows an attacker
# to create a user account without providing valid credentials. An attacker
# who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain access to the pump
# controller's web panel, and cause disruption in operation, modify data,
# change other usernames and passwords, or even shut down the controller
# entirely.
#
# The attacker can leverage their unauthorized access to the
# system to carry out a variety of malicious activities, including:
# Modifying pump settings, such as flow rates or pressure levels, causing
# damage or loss of control, stealing sensitive data, such as system logs
# or customer information, changing passwords and other user credentials,
# potentially locking out legitimate users or allowing the attacker to
# maintain persistent access to the system, disabling or shutting down
# the controller entirely, potentially causing significant disruption to
# operations and service delivery.
