## Key data

**This article explores Netcraft芒聙聶s research into the HookBot malware family and associated attacks on Android devices, including examples of:**

* Typical HookBot behaviors, such as the use of overlay attacks

* The types of brands and apps being impersonated

* How HookBot utilizes Command and Control (C2) servers to continuously evolve

* A builder tool that enables threat actors to develop and deploy their own HookBot apps

* Distribution via Telegram, which highlight the lucrative pricing models available for buyers, as well as competition between developers/distributors

Netcraft芒聙聶s Android Malware Analysis engine was developed to build a deeper, applied understanding of the malware strains being used by threat actors to abuse brands and exploit their customers. The sandbox uses handwritten rules to detect malware families and extract specific configurations (e.g., which servers they utilize), helping us understand criminal architecture and its potential impact on organizations.

Using the analysis engine, our team has investigated instances of the notorious [HookBot malware family](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-hook-android-malware-lets-hackers-remotely-control-your-phone/) targeting Android devices specifically. First identified in 2023, we芒聙聶ll dig deeper to understand what makes this threat so effective, including the functionality underpinning HookBot-infected apps and the tactics being used by those developing and distributing them.

## Hookbot Background

HookBot is a family of banking Trojans whose primary function is to steal sensitive data from victims, such as banking credentials, passwords, and other personally identifiable information (PII). Now linked to a number of cybercrime campaigns, it芒聙聶s part of a malware ecosystem responsible for financial fraud globally. HookBot targets mobile devices, particularly Android. Not only does this provide the malware with optimal reach, from a security perspective, its mobile format adds complexity to the process of detecting and disrupting attacks.

### How HookBot Targets Android Devices

The HookBot lifecycle begins with a victim installing a malicious app disguised as legitimate, brand-owned software. These apps often come from unofficial sources. However, some are known to bypass Google Play store security checks, enabling them to reach victims through a legitimate, high traffic marketplace.

Once installed, the malicious app establishes communication with a  C2 server, enabling it to receive updates, new payloads, and device information including other legitimate apps and data. The malware then proceeds to extract user data using various attack techniques, such as apps overlays and surveillance techniques.

#### **Overlay Attacks**

Overlay attacks stack content from a malicious app on top of legitimate app screens. A victim opens an app and sees what looks like a legitimate form (e.g., a login or payment screen). In reality, they have triggered the malware-infected app to launch. This serves a visual overlay that (often convincingly) mimics the legitimate app interface. The victim enters their personal data, which is relayed to the threat actor.

#### **Keylogging, Screen Capture, and SMS Interception**

HookBot can also log keystrokes and capture screenshots to steal sensitive data while the user interacts with their device. It can also intercept SMS messages, including those used for two-factor authentication (2FA), enabling threat actors to gain full access to the victim芒聙聶s accounts.

## HookBot in Action

Netcraft has observed HookBot-infected apps targeting victims by mimicking known brands. In the sequence in fig 1 (below), we can see the malicious app芒聙聰disguised as Facebook芒聙聰requesting additional permissions to achieve greater control of the victim芒聙聶s device. Once fully set up, it renames and disguises itself as Google Chrome.

*Fig. 1. Screenshots showing how a HookBot-infected app establishes control of the victim芒聙聶s device.*

A sample from our research shows 460 different Android apps being impersonated. In some cases, the overlay screens are convincing, using brand logos and assets and mimicking the legitimate app interface (see fig 2 芒聙聯 fig 5). In other cases (see fig 6 芒聙聯 8), threat actors appear to have used generic overlay designs requiring less development/expenditure.
