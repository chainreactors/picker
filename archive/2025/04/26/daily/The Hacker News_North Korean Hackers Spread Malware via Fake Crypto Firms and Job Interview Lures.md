[![North Korean Hackers Spread Malware](data:image/png;base64... "North Korean Hackers Spread Malware")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYy5JGTQM_flurA9Uwe-Fx5l-EIBI2kng_NVCHUbz5TWIU4Kvj23ayVQ6_TJH0M670gJ1HTb-RE2vEVWovMA6BLV9bzI7WS1zCfkvenBzuF1v78gKLQ47o_1-C7wQ0URGSKkNrRkiZxRUWtxdK4AMdEdBYTpHiFpmsSPWcCH966G78xmFfOWswt5_e9zff/s790-rw-e365/crypto.jpg)

North Korea-linked threat actors behind the [Contagious Interview](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/dprk-hackers-steal-137m-from-tron-users.html) have set up front companies as a way to distribute malware during the fake hiring process.

"In this new campaign, the threat actor group is using three front companies in the cryptocurrency consulting industry – BlockNovas LLC (blocknovas[.] com), Angeloper Agency (angeloper[.]com), and SoftGlide LLC (softglide[.]co) – to spread malware via 'job interview lures," Silent Push [said](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/contagious-interview-front-companies/) in a deep-dive analysis.

The activity, the cybersecurity company said, is being used to distribute three different known malware families, [BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/north-korean-hackers-deploy-beavertail.html), and [OtterCookie](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-deploy-ottercookie.html).

Contagious Interview is one of the several job-themed social engineering campaigns orchestrated by North Korea to entice targets into downloading cross-platform malware under the pretext of coding assignment or fixing an issue with their browser when turning on camera during a video assessment.

The activity is tracked by the broader cybersecurity community under the monikers CL-STA-0240, DeceptiveDevelopment, DEV#POPPER, Famous Chollima, UNC5342, and Void Dokkaebi.

The use of front companies for malware propagation, complemented by setting up fraudulent accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, X, Medium, GitHub, and GitLab, marks a new escalation for the threat actors, who have been observed using various job boards to lure victims.

"The BlockNovas front company has 14 people allegedly working for them, however many of the employee personas [...] appear to be fake," Silent Push said. "When viewing the 'About Us' page of blocknovas[.]com via the Wayback Machine, the group claimed to have been operating for '12+ years' – which is 11 years longer than the business has been registered."

The attacks lead to the deployment of a JavaScript stealer and loader called BeaverTail, which is then used to drop a Python backdoor referred to as InvisibleFerret that can establish persistence on Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts. Select infection chains have also been found to serve another malware codenamed OtterCookie via the same JavaScript payload used to launch BeaverTail.

BlockNovas has been observed leveraging video assessments to distribute [FROSTYFERRET and GolangGhost](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/lazarus-group-targets-job-seekers-with.html) using ClickFix-related lures, a tactic that was detailed earlier this month by Sekoia, which is tracking the activity under the name ClickFake Interview.

BeaverTail is configured to contact an external server ("lianxinxiao[.]com") for command-and-control (C2) to serve InvisibleFerret as the follow-up payload. It comes with various features to harvest system information, launch a reverse shell, download additional modules to steal browser data, files, and initiate the installation of the AnyDesk remote access software.

Further analysis of the malicious infrastructure has revealed the presence of a "Status Dashboard" hosted on one of BlockNovas' subdomains to maintain visibility into four of their domains: lianxinxiao[.]com, angeloperonline[.]online, and softglide[.]co.

A separate subdomain, mail.blocknovas[.]com domain, has also been found to be hosting an open-source, distributed password cracking management system called [Hashtopolis](https://github.com/hashtopolis/server). The [fake recruitment drives](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/junaid-khan126072_ramon-mckenzie-nyx12upgrade-test-public-activity-7244057798815215617-2s5D/) have led to at least one developer getting their MetaMask wallet [allegedly compromised](https://dev.to/topninja/i-hacked-web3-wallet-15e4) in September 2024.

That's not all. The threat actors also appear to be hosting a tool named Kryptoneer on the domain attisscmo[.]com that offers the ability to connect to cryptocurrency wallets such as Suiet Wallet, Ethos Wallet, and Sui Wallet.

"It's possible that North Korean threat actors have made additional efforts to target the Sui blockchain, or this domain may be used within job application processes as an example of the 'crypto project' being worked on," Silent Push said.

BlockNovas, according to an independent report published by Trend Micro, also advertised in December 2024 an open position for a senior software engineer on LinkedIn, specifically targeting Ukrainian IT professionals.

As of April 23, 2025, the BlockNovas domain has been seized by the U.S. Federal Bureau ...
