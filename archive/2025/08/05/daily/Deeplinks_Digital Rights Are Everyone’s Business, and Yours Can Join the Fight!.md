Companies large and small are [doubling down on digital rights](https://www.eff.org/thanks), and we’re excited to see more and more of them join EFF. We’re first and always an organization who fights for users, so you might be asking: Why does EFF work with corporate donors, and why do they want to work with us?

SHOW YOUR COMPANY SUPPORTS A BETTER DIGITAL FUTURE

[JOIN EFF TODAY](https://eff.org/thanks "DONATE TODAY ")

Businesses want to work with EFF for two reasons:

1. They, their employees, and their customers believe in EFF’s values.
2. They know that when EFF wins, we all win.

Both customers and employees alike care about working with organizations they know share their values. And issues like data privacy, sketchy uses of surveillance, and free expression are pretty top of mind for people these days. Research shows that today’s working adults take philanthropy seriously, whether they’re giving organizations their money or their time. For younger generations (like the Millennial EFFer writing this blog post!) especially, feeling like a meaningful part of the fight for good adds to a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Given the choice to spend hard-earned cash with techno-authoritarians versus someone willing to take a stand for digital freedom: We’ll take option two, thanks.

When EFF wins, users win. Standing up for the ability to access, use, and build on technology means that a handful of powerful interests won’t have unfair advantag...
