[## Thanks for a Fantastic DEF CON](https://dctv.defcon.org)

Posted 2025-08-10

![def con video wall](../../images/defcon-33/post-images/goodbye.webp)

DEF CON 33 is winding down now, and we want to take a moment to thank the whole DEF CON community for another amazing year. Thank you for bringing your boundless energy and curiosity to this little party we throw. Thank you for spending another long enchanted weekend teaching each other, learning from each other, and partying with each other.

It’s good to spend some time with your people.

As always, if you want to keep that DEF CON feeling going all year long, consider joining a DEF CON Group. If you can’t find one close to home, consider starting one. Join our Discord. Start a project you might want to share next year.

Thanks for sticking with us through the last few crazy years. Know that we’re already scheming how to make next year even better.
