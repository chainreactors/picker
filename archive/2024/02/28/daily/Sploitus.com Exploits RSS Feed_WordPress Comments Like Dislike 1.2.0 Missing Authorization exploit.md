#The Comments Like Dislike plugin for WordPress has been found to have a vulnerability that allows unauthorized modification of data. This vulnerability arises due to a missing capability check on the restore_settings function, which is called through an AJAX action. The vulnerability affects versions up to and including 1.2.0 of the plugin.
#This security flaw enables authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as subscribers, to reset the plugin's settings. It's important to note that this issue was only partially patched in version 1.2.0, as the nonce (a security measure) is still accessible to subscriber-level users.
#For more detailed information about this bug, you can refer to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) website at [CVE-2023-3244](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3244).
