We are pleased to introduce the revamped [SAP Activate for New Cloud Implementation](https://go.support.sap.com/roadmapviewer/#/group//roadmapOverviewPage/02c0b5bb07be485c98a3b3287f3b4cf1) roadmap. It's with great excitement that we announce its relaunch, showcasing a range of enhancements. This implementation roadmap is specifically designed for SAP cloud solutions that do not have dedicated roadmaps. Its purpose is to provide comprehensive guidance to the implementation team throughout the cloud deployment process. The roadmap consists of six phases with associated deliverables, and tasks that align with the SAP Activate methodology. It also includes accelerators that are directly linked to the relevant deliverables and tasks, ensuring easy navigation and usability.

With the relaunch of this general Cloud roadmap, we offer a comprehensive guide that will facilitate a fast and successful implementation for SAP cloud solutions beyond SAP S/4HANA. This roadmap provides a step-by-step approach to ensure that customers can make the most of the guidance required for a successful implementation.

By following the SAP Activate phases of Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy, and Run, customers will gain a clear understanding of the scope, extent, and features of the SAP cloud solution, and discover how it can enhance their business.

The guidance provided by this general cloud roadmap during the implementation process includes:

* Establishing initial planning and preparation for the project, initiating the project, finalizing plans, and identifying and assigning the project team.

* Verifying the solution functionality within the project scope and ensuring that the business requirements can be met.

* Building and testing an integrated business and system environment through a series of iterations based on established business scenarios and process requirements.

* Establishing the production system, ensuring the readiness of the customer organization, and transitioning business operations to the new system.

* Enhancing the efficiency and automation of the solution’s operability.

In addition to English, this roadmap descriptions are available in Chinese and Japanese (note that accelerators are not translated).
