In a world where environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly crucial, supporting green initiatives can make a real difference. Open-source and free software can be at the service of our planet, too. Developers can contribute their own grain of sand to solve big problems like global warming, pollution, and deforestation —mostly here because of the human race.

Since the projects we’re talking about are also free and available for everyone, they rely on the generosity of donors to thrive and expand their impact. **By donating to open-source green projects, you can contribute to the development of tools and technologies that address pressing environmental challenges. And you can do this in a few minutes with Kivach.**

[Kivach](https://kivach.org/?ref=hackernoon.com) is an Obyte-based platform that enables users to make crypto donations that can be automatically redistributed to multiple open-source projects on GitHub. It uses a decentralized approach where donations flow through a network of projects, with each recipient able to forward a portion or the total of the donation to other projects, amplifying the impact of each contribution.

In this episode, we’ll explore some environmentally-friendly software projects that you can use for free and, optionally, support with some coins via Kivach. Let’s go!

## CodeCarbon

Released in 2020 by a team of developers from Mila, BCG Gamma, Haverford College, and Comet, **this tool is designed to help developers track and reduce the carbon emissions of their computing**. Recognizing the significant environmental impact of computational processes, [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/?ref=hackernoon.com) aims to provide a simple yet effective way for individuals and organizations to monitor their energy consumption and take steps toward sustainability.

This tool provides a way to calculate how much CO2 is produced based on the electricity consumption of the hardware, including the GPU, CPU, and RAM while taking into account the carbon intensity of the region where the computing takes place. The latter is applied to the location of data centers, so it offers a clear picture of the emissions associated with a specific software. Besides, it’s easy to integrate into Python projects by embedding just a few lines of code.

Funding and professional time for CodeCarbon comes from grants and donations from organizations and individuals committed to sustainability in tech. The project also benefits from the support and contributions of the open-source community. If you want to contribute with some coins, you can find CodeCarbon on Kivach at [mlco2/codecarbon](https://kivach.org/repo/mlco2/codecarbon?ref=hackernoon.com).

## Mycodo

This is an environmental regulation system designed to monitor and control various environmental factors using Raspberry Pi. Initially created in 2013 by Kyle Gabriel to assist with mushroom cultivation, Mycodo has since expanded to support a wide range of applications, from hydroponic systems to beekeeping, offering users a powerful tool to manage and optimize their environments effectively.

**[Mycodo](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo?ref=hackernoon.com) can connect various sensors and devices to measure and control factors such as temperature, humidity, and light.** Users can create custom functions and automate organic processes using a web interface, making it easy to manage even complex systems remotely. This way, it helps to reduce waste and energy consumption, making it a valuable tool for sustainable practices in agriculture, food production, and environmental management. Additionally, it can be used to track energy usage, which aids in reducing carbon footprints.

Mycodo is funded through donations and community support. The software is free to use, and contributions from users help maintain its development and ensure that it continues to evolve and improve over the years. For crypto donations, you can find it [on Kivach](https://kivach.org/repo/kizniche/mycodo?ref=hackernoon.com) and donate with your Obyte wallet.

## Tracarbon

Released in 2022 by Florian Valeye, Tracarbon is designed to help developers and organizations track the carbon emissions generated by their devices and cloud infrastructure –similar to CodeCarbon. As awareness of the environmental impact of digital services grows, Tracarbon provides a way to measure and understand the carbon footprint of coding, making it easier to take steps toward reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.

[This software](https://github.com/fvaleye/tracarbon?ref=hackernoon.com)

can estimate the carbon emissions of various OS and cloud services by analyzing usage data and applying regional carbon intensity factors.\*\* Users can obtain an API key from CO2Signal for non-commercial use or ElectricityMaps for commercial purposes. This API key allows Tracarbon to retrieve the latest carbon intensity data based on your location, measured in grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2eq/kWh).

Tracarbon is supported by the open-source community, with funding primarily coming from user contributions. These donations and the collaborative efforts of volunteers help keep the project alive and growing. For crypto donations, it’s available on Kivach as [fvaleye/tracarbon](https://kivach.org/repo/fvaleye/tracarbon?ref=hackernoon.com).

## Open Green Map

This platform was launched in 2009 by the non-profit organization Green Map System. **It provides a collaborative space for creating and sharing maps that highlight eco-friendly and sustainable locations within communities.** Its main goal is to support greener living by helping people find and engage with environmental resources, green spaces, and sustainability initiatives.

[The software](https://www.opengreenmap.org/?ref=hackernoon.com) allows users to create interactive maps that feature various eco-friendly locations, such as community gardens, recycling centers, and renewable energy sites. It supports contributions from individuals and organizations, enabling users to add new sites, provide updates, and share their local sustainability efforts. By visualizing these green resources, Open Green Map helps raise awareness and encourages more people to adopt sustainable practices.

Green Map System encourages community participation by exploring and rating the maps, spreading the word, directly promoting the app, or becoming a volunteer. It also accepts donations (tax-deductible in the US) to keep running this project, and maintaining it available for everyone. To donate to them, you can [use Kivach](https://kivach.org/repo/greenmap/ogm?ref=hackernoon.com).
