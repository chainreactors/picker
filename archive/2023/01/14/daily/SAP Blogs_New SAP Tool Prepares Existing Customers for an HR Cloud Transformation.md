Most organizations using on-premise HR software could benefit from a cloud-based streamlining of their operations. However, some industry professionals report uncertainty over the need to customize and update their existing landscape. This presents iterative challenges in maintaining legacy systems that require significant dollars and time that could be otherwise allocated toward tools and initiatives that can make a greater impact on their organization.

To help our existing on-premise SAP ERP HCM customers better understand their current landscape from a single place and gain critical insights – we have created a tool called the [SAP Readiness Check](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/hxm-move.html?video=5e3a59f3-557e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b) for SAP SuccessFactors. This tool analyzes your existing on-premise SAP system and provides insightful information about your software and organization with easy-to-read reports and dashboards. It can help assess your readiness to migrate to our cloud-based SAP SuccessFactors solutions and teach you about your data and organization.

SAP Readiness Check provides detailed overviews of your entire employee population, such as geographical footprint by country and region. It also reveals your organizational structure by providing big-picture data for positions, cost centers, and more — all so you can better understand the scope of your migration. You’ll gain awareness of key data points such as payroll calendars and wage types and can export results for analysis and project planning if desired.

The best part? [SAP Readiness Check](https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/hxm-move.html?video=5e3a59f3-557e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b) is free for existing SAP customers under maintenance.

To learn more and see the tool in action, check out our new video “SAP Readiness Check for SAP SuccessFactors.” It provides a brief yet comprehensive summary of what this tool does and how to use it. Whether you want to analyze your current software, prepare for a smooth migration to the cloud, or receive practical guidance to better understand your data, the SAP Readiness Check can help you achieve your cloud migration goals.

Software is changing rapidly, and with cloud-based technology companies are finding fresh insights faster than ever. Stay ahead of the digital curve and get your HR software systems ready for the cloud.
