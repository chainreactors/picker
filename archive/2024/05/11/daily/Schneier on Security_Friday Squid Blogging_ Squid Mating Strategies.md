## Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Mating Strategies

[Some squids](https://phys.org/news/2024-04-squids-birthday-male-spear-shown.html) are “consorts,” others are “sneakers.” The species is healthiest when individuals have different strategies randomly.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

@Robin, Echo of past arising

Well, one thing is for sure. It looks like the book does relate to mating strategies.

> The second chapter moves to the most important event in „Turia’s” life ‒ her getting married. The engagement of the couple does not seem to have a very happy beginning though for Gn…. The future husband, who belonged to the Pompeian party, was in need of his fiancée’s support in providing money and in protecting all of his financial and family matters even though the woman was still not officially his wife. In the end, the wife-to-be emerges victorious from all the turbulent events: she protects her own life, her future husband’s family and his estates/fortune from the marauders of Milo.

Telit Cinterion modems are integrated into IoT devices from numerous vendors.

CVE-2023-47610 which allows remote code execution through SMS, is the worst of 7 vulnerabilities. Some of the other flaws require local access in order to exploit.

“telecom vendors are uniquely positioned to implement network-level controls that can prevent the delivery of malicious SMS messages to vulnerable devices.”

Reported to Telit last November, some of the flaws have not been patched. SMS disabling is the only reliable way to mitigate the risks associated with CVE-2023-47610.

A presentation on vulnerabilities in Telit Cinterion devices is due in May.

The ‘Sift’ strategy: A four-step method for spotting misinformation
<https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240509-the-sift-strategy-a-four-step-method-for-spotting-misinformation>

“There are many reasons why misinformation travels so quickly – according to some research, even faster than accurate information.

> One reason is that people are far more likely to share a claim when it confirms their pre-existing beliefs, regardless of its accuracy. This cognitive bias may help explain why even more misinformation seems to be shared by individuals than by bots. One study, for example, found that just 15% of news sharers spread up to 40% of fake news.

When it comes to not falling for misinformation, being aware of our human
fallibilities, such as our quickness to believe what we want to believe, is a
good first step. Research shows that even being more reflective in general can
“inoculate” us against believing fake news.

1. S is for… Stop

Perhaps one of the most pernicious aspects of the modern era is its urgency.
Thanks to everything from our continual phone use to nonstop work demands, far too many of us seem to be navigating the world at a dizzying speed.

Being online, where both news cycles and content are especially fast-paced and
often emotive, can put us in a particularly “urgent” mindset. But when it comes to identifying misinformation, immediacy is not our friend. Research has found that relying on our immediate “gut” reactions is more likely to lead us astray
than if we take a moment to stop and reflect.

> The first step of the Sift method interrupts this tendency. Stop. Don’t share the post. Don’t comment on it. And move on to the next step.

1. I is for… Investigate the source

> Posts show up in our social media feeds all the time without us having a clear
> sense of who created them. Maybe they were shared by a friend. Maybe they were
> pushed to us by the algorithm. Maybe we followed the creator intentionally, but
> never looked into their background.

Now’s the time to find this out.

> Who created this post? Get off-platform and do a web search. And because
> search results can be misleading, make sure you’re looking at a reputable website. One that fact-checkers often use as a first port of call might surprise you: Wikipedia. While it’s not perfect, it has the benefit of being crowd-sourced, which means that its articles about specific well-known people or organizations often cover aspects like controversies and political biases.

While you’re investigating, ask:

`If the creator is a media outlet, are they reputable and respected, with a`

recognized commitment to verified, independent journalism?

`If it's an individual, what expertise do they have in the subject at hand`

(if any)? !!! What financial ties, political leanings or personal biases may be at play?
If it’s an organization or a business, what is their purpose? What do they advocate for, or sell? !!!Where does their funding come from? What political leanings have they shown?

Would you still trust this creator’s expertise in this subject if they were
saying something you disagreed with?

1. F is for… Find better coverage

If, from the previous step, you find that you still have questions about the source’s credibility, now’s the time to dig a little further. What you’re looking for is whether a more trustworthy source, like a reputable news outlet or fact-checking s...
