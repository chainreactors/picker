Now, of course, we’ve all dropped a cell phone, picked it up, and realized that we’ve absolutely destroyed its screen. Right? *Or is it just me...?* Either way, you’ve probably seen how expensive it can be to repair a device, whether it be a cell phone, laptop, or even a washing machine.

Device repair doesn’t need to be expensive, but companies have made repair a way to siphon more money from your pocket to theirs. It doesn’t need to be this way, and with our new site—[Digital Rights Bytes](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org)—we lay out how we got here and what we can do to fix this issue.

Check out our short one-minute video explaining [why device repair has become so expensive](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org/topics/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-repair-my-devices) and what you can do to defend your right to repair. If you’re hungry to learn more, we’ve broken up some key takeaways into small *byte-sized* pieces you can even share with your family and friends.

Digital Rights Bytes also has answers to other common questions including if your phone is actually listening to you, ownership of your digital media, and more. Got any additional questions you’d like us to answer in the future? Let us know on your [favorite social platform](https://www.eff.org/pages/where-find-eff) using the hashtag #DigitalRightsBytes so we can find it!
