# Software supply chain attacks are on the rise ‚Äî are you at risk?

*Graham Cluley Security News is sponsored this week by the folks at **Sysdig**. Thanks to the great team there for their support!*

Attacks targeting the software supply chain are on the rise and splashed across the news. SolarWinds raised awareness about the risk. More recent events, like the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency breach, amplified the concern.

Software supply chain risk isn‚Äôt going anywhere. As development teams increasingly rely on open source software and third-party code, the risk of exposure to both known and unknown security vulnerabilities significantly increases.

The [Sysdig 2023 Cloud-Native Security and Usage report](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report/) found that 87% of container images have high or critical vulnerabilities, which highlights the importance of runtime security. There is a lot of talk about shift left, but threats arise in production. Then what?

Different attack vectors exist, and issues like ransomware, cryptomining, or other compromises aren‚Äôt prevented by scanning code or images. Not to mention that container vulnerabilities are discovered daily. Your container, which seems safe one second, can become a potential victim of a newly disclosed exploit. Shift-left alone is not enough.

The goal of every cybersecurity program should be full lifecycle security.

Looking at real-world data, the sixth annual [Sysdig Cloud-Native Security and Usage report](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report/) reveals how global companies of all sizes and industries are using and securing cloud and container environments. This year, the report highlighted key CISO priorities, including software supply chain risk, zero trust, and cost management. Read the [key takeaways](https://grahamcluley.com/go/sysdig-report-overview/) from Sysdig‚Äôs report.
