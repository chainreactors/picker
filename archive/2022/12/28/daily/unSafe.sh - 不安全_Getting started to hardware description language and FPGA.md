I decided to learn a little bit of Verilog and FPGA.

A nice place to start reading about Verilog is this site:

<https://www.asic-world.com/verilog/index.html>

Of course you can use Verilator to start with a simulator, but soon or later you will want to buy a board. I decided to start with the Sipeed Tang Primer 20K board because it is low cost.
