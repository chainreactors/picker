# Warning: Online shopping threats to avoid this Black Friday and Cyber Monday

Posted: November 13, 2024
 by [Anna Brading](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/anna-brading)

It’s that time of year again. Thanksgiving will pass just as quickly as it arrived, and the festive season will soon hit full swing as countless people go online for some gift shopping. But where there’s a gift to be bought, there’s also a scammer out to make money.

And make money they do. In the last five years, the [Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2023_IC3Report.pdf) said it has received 3.79 million complaints for a wide range of internet scams, resulting in $37.4 billion in losses.

Today, we’re warning of several online threats that could target you over the next few weeks and months: brand impersonation and fakes, credit card skimming, and [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising).

## 1. **Brand impersonation scams**

This Black Friday and beyond, you’re likely to see scammers ripping off big name brands. Here are a few fakes you should look out for.

### **Temu ads offer discounted PS5s**

Scrolling through Facebook, we were presented with a couple of posts advertising discounted PS5s.

![Ads on Temu showing PS5](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Temu-ads.png?w=1024)
> “Quit overspending on PS5! This one I got off TEMU is AWESOME and is much cheaper. I’d highly recommend picking this up!”

Of course, it’s tempting to get a discount on high-value items like a PlayStation 5, but Temu doesn’t actually sell PS5s.

If you click the play button on the “video,” you are instead redirected to a Temu page selling various PlayStation accessories that are not official or in any way approved by Sony.

### **Fake Amazon offers you great deals this Black Friday**

Amazon is relatively low cost, it’s convenient, and you can look at someone’s wish list on there. Except in this scam we caught online, the website isn’t really Amazon—check out the URL.

![Screenshot of a fake Amazon site showing goods to buy](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Amazon-watermark.png?w=932)

Fake online stores like this use Amazon’s branding to sell counterfeit products. Even if you take the risk and buy a knock off product (which we think is a bad idea), you have no guarantee of receiving the merchandise, and definitely no buyer protection.

### **Walmart makes it easy for you to buy gift cards**

Nothing says “I saw this and thought of you” like a Walmart gift card on Christmas day. But make sure you are buying from the right website.

Again, in this example, check out the URL—this website might look Walmart, but it’s a fake that will happily take your money in exchange for nothing.

### **“USPS” now delivers you fraud**

If you’re taking advantage of Black Friday sales and buying many things at once, it can be tricky to keep track of what you’ve ordered. Even if you do know what’s coming, you often don’t know which package service will deliver it to your door. Scammers take advantage of this and will send fake delivery notice emails that encourage you to click on them.

With this fake USPS site, you are asked to pay a small fee to have your delivery processed. However, once you hand over your card details the ...
