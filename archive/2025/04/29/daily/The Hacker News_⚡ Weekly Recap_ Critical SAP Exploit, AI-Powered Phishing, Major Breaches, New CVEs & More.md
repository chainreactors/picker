What happens when cybercriminals no longer need deep skills to breach your defenses? Today's attackers are armed with powerful tools that do the heavy lifting ‚Äî from AI-powered phishing kits to large botnets ready to strike. And they're not just after big corporations. Anyone can be a target when fake identities, hijacked infrastructure, and insider tricks are used to slip past security unnoticed.

This week's threats are a reminder: waiting to react is no longer an option. Every delay gives attackers more ground.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Critical SAP NetWeaver Flaw Exploited as 0-Day** ‚Äî A critical security flaw in SAP NetWeaver (CVE-2025-31324, CVSS score: 10.0) has been [exploited](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/sap-confirms-critical-netweaver-flaw.html) by unknown threat actors to upload JSP web shells with the goal of facilitating unauthorized file uploads and code execution. The attacks have also been observed using the Brute Ratel C4 post-exploitation framework, as well as a well-known technique called Heaven's Gate to bypass endpoint protections.

## Firewalls are Obsolete in the AI Era. It's Time for a Modern Security Approach

Companies need to rethink how they protect their private and public use of AI and how they defend against AI-powered attacks. Traditional firewalls, VPNs, and public-facing IPs expose your attack surface and are no match in the AI era. It's time for a modern approach with Zscaler Zero Trust + AI.](https://thehackernews.uk/legacy-systems-security-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **Darcula Phishing Kit Gets GenAI Upgrade** ‚Äî The threat actors behind the Darcula phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform have released new updates to their cybercrime suite with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capabilities to facilitate phishing form generation in various languages, form field customization, and translation of phishing forms into local languages. The updates further lower the technical barrier for creating phishing pages, making it quick and easy for even a novice criminal to set up complex smishing scams. The Darcula PhaaS suite is user-friendly. All that an aspiring scammer needs to do is sign up for the Darcula service, enter a legitimate brand site, and the platform will generate a bespoke, spoofed phishing version. "Darcula is not just a phishing platform; it's a service model designed for scale," Netcraft [said](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/darcula-adds-genai-to-phishing-toolkit.html). "Users pay for access to a suite of tools that enable impersonation of organizations in nearly every country. Built using modern technologies like JavaScript frameworks, Docker, and Harbor, the infrastructure mirrors that of legitimate SaaS companies."
* **Contagious Interview Sets Up Fake Firms** ‚Äî North Korea-linked threat actors behind the Contagious Interview have [set up front companies](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/north-korean-hackers-spread-malware-via.html) named BlockNovas LLC, Angeloper Agency, and SoftGlide LLC as a way to distribute malware during the fake hiring process. The activity exemplifies the sophisticated social engineering tactics employed by North Korean threat actors to lure developers. The disclosure comes as Pyongyang hackers are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence as part of the fraudulent IT worker scheme. At the heart of these operations lies a comprehensive suite of AI-enhanced tools that work in concert and are used to create synthetic personas in order to sustain the deception. The facilitators utilize unified messaging services that provide a way to manage multiple personas across various communication channels simultaneously. These services also incorporate AI-powered translation, transcription, and summarization capabilities to help the IT workers communicate with their prospective employers.
* **Suspected Russian Hackers Use New Tactic to Access Microsoft 365 Accounts** ‚Äî Multiple suspected Russia-linked threat actors like UTA0352 and UTA0355 are "aggressively" targeting individuals and organizations with ties to Ukraine and human rights with an aim to gain unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 accounts since early March 2025. "These recently observed attacks rely heavily on one-on-one interaction with a target, as the threat actor must both convince them to click a link and send back a Microsoft-generated code," Volexity [said](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/russian-hackers-exploit-microsoft-oauth.html). "These recent campaigns benefit from all user interactions taking place on Microsoft's official infrastructure; there is no attacker-hosted infrastructure used in these attacks."
* **Threat Actors Exploit Google Infrastructure for Phishing Attack** ‚Äî Unknown threat actors have [leveraged](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/phishers-exploit-google-sites-and-dkim.html) a novel approach that allowed bogus emails to be sent via Google's infrastructure and redirect message recipients to fraudulent sites that harvest their credentials. The sophisticated phishing attack bypassed email authentication checks, and sought to trick email recipients into clicking on bogus links that are designed to harvest their Google Account credentials. Google has since plugged the attack pathway.
