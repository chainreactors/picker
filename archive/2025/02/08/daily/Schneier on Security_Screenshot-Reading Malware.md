## Screenshot-Reading Malware

Kaspersky is [reporting](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/kaspersky-researchers-find-screenshot-reading-malware-on-the-app-store-and-google-play-211011103.html) on a new type of smartphone malware.

> The malware in question uses optical character recognition (OCR) to review a device’s photo library, seeking screenshots of recovery phrases for crypto wallets. Based on their assessment, infected Google Play apps have been downloaded more than 242,000 times. Kaspersky says: “This is the first known case of an app infected with OCR spyware being found in Apple’s official app marketplace.”

That’s a tactic I have not heard of before.

@ Bruce,

With regards,

> “That’s a tactic I have not heard of before.”

But I suspect neither a shock or even that unexpected.

Like the photographing of peoples keys to have the “pining pattern” for making a 3D print, it’s a logical progression of technological developments.

Actually thinking about it for a moment what, actually “surprises me” is why it’s taken so long to happen…

If you think back the first Home PC usable OCR goes back to the earliest days of “home scanners” back more than thirty years. Modern “Smart Devices” have thousands of times the capabilities in terms of CPU power and memory that even high end home PCs had thirty years ago.

So the obvious question would be,

“Why has it taken so long to happen?”

In some ways I would assume it’s not, but the need for it was so eclectic that there was no “mainstream need” amongst criminals of all varieties.

And for those that might such as “Security Services” would not go for “on device scanning” for two reasons,

1, Their victims were individually targeted and thus “Black-bagged”.

And for your more run of the mill criminal where the use of a “rubber hose” would look soft getting access to “in human memory” secrets would be given to some psycho or worse to do.

What has changed is the value of Crypto-Coins and the like, where knowing a “passphrase” anonymously enables a more sophisticated criminal time to not just take but launder / wash out the coins about as anonymously as they can.

Untill a year or so ago crypto-coins were of some value but not “go life in jail or the chair” value.

Now that is no longer the case, where even badly thought out petty almost “mugging” street level crime can get you hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars faster than you could spend it.

Those with a little more thought can find “high value wallets” by looking on the blockchain. Many of those wallets would not have been set up in a way that would make the owner anonymous.

Which means that they and their mobile phones and similar Smart Devices are fairly easily traceable to slightly smarter criminals.

Getting access to those devices would almost be “trivial” as we know there are many companies in Israel / Italy and similar that specialise in “access for hire” to politicians and bureaucrats and two bit rent-a-cops all over the world.

So not only were all the pieces in place, a need to use them had surfaced, with in hindsight a not unexpected result.

Which leaves the obvious question for those with “valuable wallets” of,

“How do you protect not just the wallet and yourself, but all your devices as well?”

Whilst I can think of several ways, I’m just glad I don’t have,

1, A need to use them
2, Clean up an existing trail to me

But it does beg the further question of,

“Now it exists, what will it be repurposed for next?”

As some will know now E2EE is something Law Enforcement are going to have to give up on because the “Chinese have robbed us of NOBUS” they are going to want something else.

There are two options currently,

1, Device side scanning
2, Back up third party storage.

We know Apple looked at device side scanning for CSAM finding, and got struck down by “user push back” when it became clear that it could scan for anything.

But we now find out Apple are getting attacked by the UK government over third party storage,

Put simply they demand access “anywhere in the world at any time” not only “no questions asked” but with significant penalties for not “jumping to it”.

My answer to these kinds of issues is to have a separate device that does the money and only the money, which is a tablet. There is no money on my phone or 2nd tablet. I think that reflects the state of the technology at this time.

Re AL (as I hope a comment of mine doesn’t sit in an eternal moderation queue) the real answer is not to use portable devices of any type for this. And, not to use a PC if you have a Mac.

@ SocraticGadfly, AL, ALL,

With regards “using devices” and,

“The real answer…”

The honest answer is “don’t”

Or more correctly,

“Do not use any device that has known or unknown to you external communications”

Thus anything based on Apple or Google mobile device OS’s is a very definate “No No”. Likewise any OS from Microsoft that’s less than two decades old (though I normally say three decades).

Unlike most readers here I have the advantage of knowing how to design and build “Microcontroller devices” which do not have external communications except through “strongly mandated interfaces”. As well as having designed minimal OS’s for them (think BIOS++) that I can “re-grind” for most microcontrollers from 8bit upwards.

This gives me a level of “communications security” and other EmSec that few others here can get, unless they are prepared to put the work in.

The simple fact is you can get the source code and programming books for a number of OS’s for microcontrollers. You can if you hunt around get the likes of the original FIG-Forth source for the Z80, 6502, and 68000. You can also get a Forth based system that will run on PC’s as an intermediate “boot-loader” or OS in it’s own right. That back in the early days of PCI interface card...
