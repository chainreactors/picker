Now that we are well into 2025, cloud attacks are evolving faster than ever and artificial intelligence (AI) is both a weapon and a shield. As AI rapidly changes how enterprises innovate, security teams are now tasked with a triple burden:

1. **Secure AI** embedded in every part of the business.
2. **Use AI** to defend faster and smarter.
3. **Fight AI-powered threats** that execute in minutes—or seconds.

Security is no longer about balancing speed and safety. In today's cloud-native world, real-time, context-aware defense is a baseline expectation, not a competitive edge. The recent [Sysdig Cloud Defense Report 2025](https://content.foleon.com/sysdig/sysdig-cloud-defense-report-2025/%20?utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=aware_global_the-right-way_na_ung_na&utm_content=na_na) breaks down this tectonic shift. Below, we unpack its key insights for security practitioners aiming to stay ahead of an accelerating threat landscape.

## **AI: The Double-Edged Sword of Cloud Security**

AI is transforming the security paradigm. It's both empowering defenders while creating entirely new attack surfaces.

### **AI for Security: Fighting Fire with Fire**

Attackers are automating faster. In campaigns like **CRYSTALRAY**, adversaries chain together open-source tools to perform reconnaissance, lateral movement, and credential harvesting. These attacks show a level of coordination and speed that would be impossible without automation. Security teams are responding in kind.

Tools like **[Sysdig Sage](https://www.sysdig.com/generative-ai?utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=aware_global_the-right-way_na_ung_na&utm_content=na_na)™**, a fully integrated AI cloud security analyst, are driving mean time to respond down by 76%. More than half of Sysdig customers now use Sysdig Sage, with the software and business services sectors leading adoption.

Key ways security teams are leveraging AI include:

* **Contextual enrichment**: AI quickly correlates related events and aggregates data that makes alerts understandable.
* **Summarization and deduplication**: AI links alerts to previous incidents and helps focus on what's relevant.
* **Workflow automation**: AI handles repetitive tasks like ticket creation, vulnerability analysis, and escalation logic.
* **Decision acceleration**: By acting as a tier-one analyst, AI allows human defenders to move faster and make informed decisions.

The lesson is simple: in a cloud world where attacks happen at machine speed, defense must be equally agile.

### **Security for AI: Protecting the New Digital Crown Jewels**

But here's the flip side: AI itself is now a prime target that needs to be protected. The Sysdig Threat Research Team has been identifying and reporting more attacks against LLMs and other AI tools since mid-2024. Sysdig observed a 500% surge in cloud workloads containing AI/ML packages in 2024, indicating massive adoption. However, a recent 25% decline suggests teams are buckling down on security and improving governance.

Recommendations to secure AI systems include securing APIs by authenticating and restricting access to public endpoints, hardening configurations by disabling open defaults like unauthenticated admin panels, enforcing least privilege to control root access and limit elevated permissions, monitoring for shadow AI through workload audits for unauthorized models and packages, and implementing data guardrails to filter prompts and outputs for sensitive information. The bottom line: AI requires the same level of rigor and protection as any other business-critical system, especially as it becomes deeply embedded across both customer-facing and back-end operations.

## **Runtime Security: No Longer Optional, But Foundational**

Prevention may reign supreme, but in today's cloud-native, ephemeral world, runtime visibility is your best shot at catching in motion that slips through the cracks.

### **The Case for Real-Time Threat Detection**

Runtime detection isn't just a defensive layer—it's a strategic necessity in today's cloud-native environments. With 60% of containers living for one minute or less and CI/CD pipelines emerging as high-value targets due to misconfigurations and insecure defaults, the window to detect and respond is incredibly narrow. Cloud attacks now unfold in 10 minutes or less, prompting the creation of the [555 Cloud Detection and Response Benchmark](https://www.sysdig.com/555-benchmark?utm_source=the-hacker-news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=aware_global_the-right-way_na_ung_na&utm_content=na_na): a framework that guides security teams to detect threats in 5 seconds, investigate in 5 minutes, and respond within the next 5 minutes.

### **Why Runtime Context Matters**

Traditional vulnerability scans bury teams under noise. But less than 6% of high and critical vulnerabilities are active in production. That means the rest are distractions.

Runtime insights help security teams:

* **Prioritize real risks**: Focus remediation on vulnerabilities loaded into memory.
* **Reduce noise**: Cut vulnerability lists by up to 99%.
* **Collaborate better**: Provide developers with clear, contextual remediation steps.

## **The CI/CD Pipeline: A Growing Target**

CI/CD workflows sit at the heart of modern DevOps, enabling rapid, automated delivery. But in 2025, they've also emerged as an attractive and increasingly exploited attack surface. From repository compromises to misconfigured automation, attackers are finding creative ways to infiltrate build systems—often before code even reaches pro...
