# libfate

A simple collection of tiny libraries to patch system functions deterministically using the LD\_PRELOAD trick.

## What is libfate?

libfate provides deterministic replacements for common non-deterministic system functions that can break reproducible builds. Instead of relying on complex build systems or apps or extensive patching, libfate uses the LD\_PRELOAD trick to intercept system calls and return fixed, predictable values.

The library currently provides deterministic variants of:

* **Random number generation**: `getrandom()` and `/dev/urandom` reading
* **Time functions**: `clock_gettime()`
* **System information**: `sysinfo()`

The project is tiny...
