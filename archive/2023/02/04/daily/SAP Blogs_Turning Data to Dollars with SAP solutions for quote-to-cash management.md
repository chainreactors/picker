![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/dollar1.png)Digital customer relationship management has drastically altered the way businesses price and monetize their products and services in the last decade. Subscription models, usage-based pricing, and the monetization of digital services, enabled by data from smart products, are disrupting the market. Companies must quickly find ways to generate cash from their assets or services, and

there is increasing demand for sustainable, circular business that require new monetization schemes. Or, to put it simply: Turning Data to Dollars.

In the digital world, enterprises strive to stand out by offering advanced, recurring monetization models that meter usage, manage high transaction volumes, and support complex pricing rules. These models must be sold efficiently via e-commerce or sales representatives, while also ensuring efficient and compliant revenue recognition. To achieve this, many companies have established the Chief Revenue Officer Role overseeing the entire quote-to-cash process.

As part of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Portfolio, SAP offers fully interoperable solutions along the quote-to-cash process that are well received by customers. The analysts Gartner and International Data Corporation (IDC) have both recognized SAP solutions for quote-to-cash for displaying market leadership (See [IDC](https://communicationhub-system-redirect.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/redirect?comm_hub_redirect_url_=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sap.com%2F2022%2F12%2Fidc-marketscape-enterprise-subscription-and-usage-management%2F&comm_hub_field_id_=124BFA3890C0675AA6AA0555255F99A6) on Billing and Revenue Management and [Gartner](https://communicationhub-system-redirect.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/redirect?comm_hub_redirect_url_=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sap.com%2F2022%2F11%2Fgartner-magic-quadrant-for-cpq-application-suites-sap-a-leader%2F&comm_hub_field_id_=124BFA3890C0675AA6AA0555255F99A6) on Configure, Price & Quote).
