“I don’t have enough fingers to count what was there,” says Nelia Stryzhakova as she recalls the Ukrainian town of Vovchansk, where she has lived for the past 40 years.

“There was a technical school, a medical school, seven schools, many kindergartens. How many factories did we have? An oil extraction factory, a butter factory, a furniture factory, a carriage factory, of which there were only two in Ukraine.”

The director of the local library, Stryzhakova, was among those to flee Vovchansk when Russian forces began to advance on the city in May this year.

Vovchansk is an administrative centre in the north-east of Ukraine, divided by the Vovcha river, and just five kilometres from the Russian border. In 2022, Vovchansk had [17,000 inhabitants](http://db.ukrcensus.gov.ua/PXWEB2007/ukr/publ_new1/2022/zb_%D0%A1huselnist.pdf), many with relatives in Russia.

“The city is beautiful, the people are beautiful, we had everything. We didn’t even think that in (just) five days we would be blown off the ground like that,” Stryzhakova said.

Her words are backed up by video and social media evidence that show explosion after explosion across the city.

Bellingcat and journalists from Agence France-Presse (AFP) bureaus in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Paris have partnered to investigate the damage in the city and talk to former residents who have first-hand experience of the destruction.

An analysis of satellite imagery suggests that 60 percent of buildings in Vovchansk have been completely destroyed.

Partial damage was observed on a further 18 percent of buildings, leaving just 22 percent of the city where damage has yet to be detected as of late September 2024.

Kindergartens, schools, religious sites, factories and libraries have all been wiped out. Videos and drone footage show a desolate landscape where only the burnt-out skeletons of buildings remain. Residents now living as refugees in nearby Kharkiv, like Stryzhakova, describe desperately fleeing the town under heavy bombardment.

“I took my documents from work and a couple of personal items,” Stryzhakova said. “That’s all I have. Objects are not the most important,”

The north of Vovchansk, where the majority of fighting has taken place, has been almost entirely destroyed or seriously damaged. The city centre also appears to be so severely affected that few structures remain. According to the city’s mayor, 90 percent of the centre has been “flattened”.

Although areas south of the Vovcha river that flows through Vovchansk have been badly impacted, especially in industrial districts and houses along major roads, large pockets of intact housing are still visible.

Bellingcat used SkySat imagery from Planet Labs PBC to carry out a damage assessment on a building-by-building basis. The process manually mapped out damage observed in the satellite imagery into three categories in the map below – green, orange, and red. Green corresponds with no observed damage, orange indications of damage, and red means the destruction of a building (readers can zoom in and switch between satellite imagery dates as well as show or hide the damage assessment layer).

More on our Map Methodology

The process of manually mapping out damage in Vovchansk sorted the buildings observed in the satellite imagery into three categories – green, orange, and red.

Green corresponds with no observed damage. This means that at the resolution and angle of satellite imagery used, no damage was observed to the structure, this leaves the possibility of damage which was not visible in the imagery.

Orange categorises indications of damage, which are assessed by a broad range of features. This could be indications of superficial damage to the roof of buildings, even extending to the apparent removal of the roof, but in which the ceiling appears to be intact, preventing the satellite from seeing inside the walls of the structure. Other indications of damage could be visible debris surrounding the building, particularly when combined with visible artillery impact craters.

Red means the destruction of a building. This could be when a building has been completely reduced to rubble, or when the roof has been shelled so intensely that the inside of the building’s walls is visible. A caveat to this rule is multi-storey apartment buildings, where signs of extreme fire damage or partial collapses of the building’s facade will also fall under the red category.

Decisions on these classifications are based on visual evidence on the map and we cannot completely rule out the possibility of damage having occurred that is not visible on the map.

Other towns and cities on the front line in Ukraine have faced a similar fate.

Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast was once home to 70,000 people before it was almost completely destroyed during intense [fighting](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/21/why-is-bakhmut-important-in-the-russia-ukraine-war) in 2023.

Lieutenant Denys Yaroslavsky of Ukraine’s 57th Brigade Reconnaissance Unit fought in both Bakhmut and Vovchansk. “The pace of destruction was so fast. What happened in Bakhmut in two or three months happened in Vovchansk in two or three weeks. Perhaps it was due to the proximity of the border, or the increase in the number of guided aerial bombs and the intensification of heavy fire,” he said.

In Vovchansk, control of the town has switched between Ukrainian and Russian forces and back again. After Russian troops rolled in at the start of the country’s full invasion in February 2022, Ukraine forced a retreat with an autumn counter-offensive. In May this year, however, Russia again pushed forward towards Vovchansk. The intensity of the attack forced residents to flee.

Ukraine hit back over the summer months, with the fierce fighting leading to further destruction.
