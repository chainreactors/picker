## You applied the patch that could stop possible RCE attacks last week, right?

A critical security hole in Apache Struts 2 – patched last week – is currently being exploited using publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) code.

Struts is a Java-based web application framework widely used by large enterprises and government agencies. Bugs in this open source project do not tend to end well – remember the ["entirely preventable" Equifax breach](https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/equifax_fca_fine/) in 2017?

The flaw is tracked as [CVE-2024-53677](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53677), it received a 9.5 out of 10 CVSS risk rating, and it affects Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.37 (end-of-life), 2.5.0 to 2.5.33, and 6.0.0 to 6.3.0.2.
