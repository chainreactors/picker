The federal government is trying to use Medicaid data to identify and deport immigrants. So EFF and our friends at [EPIC](https://epic.org/) and the [Protect Democracy Project](https://protectdemocracy.org/) have filed an [amicus brief](https://www.eff.org/document/2025-07-18-ca-v-hhs-amicus-eff-epic-pdp) asking a judge to block this dangerous violation of federal data privacy laws.

Last month, the AP [reported](https://apnews.com/article/medicaid-deportation-immigrants-trump-4e0f979e4290a4d10a067da0acca8e22) that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had disclosed to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) a vast trove of sensitive data obtained from states about people who obtain government-assisted health care. [Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid) is a federal program that funds health insurance for low-income people; it is partially funded and primarily managed by states. Some states, using their own funds, allow [enrollment by non-citizens](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/keep-your-Medi-Cal/Pages/Medi-Cal-Immigrant-Eligibility-FAQs.aspx). HHS reportedly disclosed to DHS the Medicaid enrollee data from several of these states, including enrollee names, addresses, immigration status, and claims for health coverage.

In response, California and 19 other states [sued](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-sues-trump-administration-illegally-sharing-californians%E2%80%99) HHS and DHS. The states allege, among other things, that these federal agencies violated (1) the data disclosure limits in the [Social Security Act](https://www.law....
