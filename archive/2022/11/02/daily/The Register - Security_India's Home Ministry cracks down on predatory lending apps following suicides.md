India's Home Ministry has asked state governments to crack down on illegal lending apps it says have led to "multiple suicides by citizens owing to harassment, blackmail, and harsh recovery methods."

A [letter](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/NationaladvisoryDigitalLendingApp_28102022.pdf) sent last week states: "Large numbers of complaints have been reported across India pertaining to illegal digital lending apps that provide short-term loans or micro credits at exorbitant interest rates with processing or hidden charges, especially to vulnerable and low-income people and use the borrower's confidential personal data like contacts, location, photos/videos for blackmail/harassment."

The letter does not mention China, but numerous [reports](https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/industry/chinese-loan-app-case-mha-says-serious-impact-on-national-security-asks-states-uts-to-take-strict-action-article-95190320) in [Indian outlets](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/chinese-lending-apps-mha-asks-states-uts-to-take-urgent-action-predatory-ap...
