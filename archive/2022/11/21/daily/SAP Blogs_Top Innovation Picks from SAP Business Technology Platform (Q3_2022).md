I can´t believe how time flies. If I look back for the past couple of months, I find it very impressive what got delivered across SAP BTP during summer season. Therefore, let´s have a look at the highlights of our recent deliveries out of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) product roadmap for Q3 2022. Those highlights reflect my personal view and is just a subset of all the innovations our development teams brought to the platform.

## SAP BTP Innovation Highlights in Q3 2022:

Enjoy spending some minutes on my personal view of innovation highlights in Q3 2022:

* **Integration**

  + In Q3 2022 we released SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh. This service is based on the Solace partnership and provides a fully managed enterprise-grade, event streaming and management platform that enables enterprise-wide and enterprise grade event-driven architecture (EDA). SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh is a perfect complement to the existing Integration Suite capability – SAP Event Mesh. It enables dynamic routing, allows brokers to be deployed in existing public or private cloud environments, delivers enterprise-grade performance, reliability, security, and governance and many more. Feel free to have a look at the [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/03/sap-integration-suite-advanced-event-mesh-vis-a-vis-sap-event-mesh-and-sap-integration-suite./?sap-outbound-id=B4918FAE508FE6EA1F958B2F6AB478545263F7CE&smc_campaign_id=0000030050&source=email-smc) of christopher.aron, the blog post [SAP’s Event-Driven Ecosystem Revisited](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/01/saps-event-driven-ecosystem-revisited/) and Introducing [SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/28/turn-your-erp-into-a-team-player-introducing-sap-integration-suite-advanced-event-mesh/) of karsten.strothmann and the SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh [SAP Help page](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ADVANCED_EVENT_MESH?locale=en-US) to get more useful information.

* **Application Development**

  + Happy to share that SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition SAP Build Work Zone, advanced edition (formerly called SAP Work Zone and SAP Launchpad, check out the exciting news around [SAP Build](https://news.sap.com/2022/11/business-expertise-sap-build-sap-teched/)) got a modern and fresh update in the UI area. A new Horizon Theme is now available which provides a user-friendly light (Morning Horizon) and dark (Evening Horizon) theme. With the additional light and dark high-contrast theme we are also supporting visually impaired users. In the [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/08/04/horizon-themes-now-available-with-the-sap-launchpad-service-and-sap-work-zone/) of sibylle.brehm  she will explain how SAP BTP will run with the Horizon Themes. Also check out the SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, product page on SAP Community and the YouTube Channel to stay up to date.

  + SAP Build Apps also got new improvements…great to see that one of the most awaited features got released in Q3. Real-time view of edits made by team members and the ability of access rights helps to make collaboration easier and simpler for project sharing between different teams. You also can manage access rights of developers and fine grain the access control. This feature makes knowledge sharing and engagement of the teams much easier and enhances the user satisfaction. mohini.verma explains more details in her [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/23/whats-new-in-sap-appgyver/).

  + In the Enterprise Event Enablement area, we offer an innovation also for ABAP developers. Enterprise Event Enablement helps to develop event-driven applications. With the new release, SAP supports the direct consumption and exposure of business events in SAP BTP, ABAP environment. With the help of the ABAP RESTful ABAP Application Programming Model (RAP), an event can be defined and raised inside a business object or in its behavior extension and then published via Event Bindings. To consume an event, ready to use event consumption models can be generated using the event consumer wizard embedded in ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse. Both, the event provider, and the event consumer, are connected via SAP Event Mesh on SAP Business Technology Platform. Check out the [SAP Developers Page](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-event-enablement-consumption.html#top) as well as our famous [Innobytes Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMlrwYXk550&list=PLWV533hWWvDkLRKiY-2aVnlXu5CpERDf9) to get more insights.
