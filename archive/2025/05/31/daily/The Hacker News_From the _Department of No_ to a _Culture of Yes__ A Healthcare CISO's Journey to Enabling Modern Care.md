## **Breaking Out of the Security Mosh Pit**

When Jason Elrod, CISO of MultiCare Health System, describes legacy healthcare IT environments, he doesn't mince words: "Healthcare loves to walk backwards into the future. And this is how we got here, because there are a lot of things that we could have prepared for that we didn't, because we were so concentrated on where we were."

This chaotic approach has characterized healthcare IT for decades. In a sector where lives depend on technology working flawlessly 24/7/365, security teams have traditionally functioned as gatekeepers—the "Department of No"—focused on protection at the expense of innovation and care delivery.

But as healthcare continues its digital transformation journey, this approach is no longer sustainable. With 14 hospitals, hundreds of urgent care clinics, and nearly 30,000 employees serving millions of patients, MultiCare needed a different path forward – one that didn't sacrifice innovation for safety. That shift began with a mindset change at the top that was driven by years of experience navigating these exact tensions.

## **Jason Elrod's View: The Healthcare Security Conundrum**

After 15+ years as a healthcare CISO, Elrod has a unique perspective on the security challenges facing healthcare organizations. According to him, healthcare's specific operational realities create security dilemmas unlike any other industry:

* **Always-on operations**: "When can you take it down? When can you stop everything and upgrade it?" asks Elrod. Unlike other industries, healthcare operates 24/7/365 with little room for downtime.
* **Life-or-death access requirements**: "We have to make sure all the information they need is available when they need it, with the minimum amount of friction possible. Because it's me, it's you, it's our communities, it's our loved ones, it's life or death."
* **Expanding attack surface**: With the shift to telemedicine, remote work, and connected medical devices, the threat landscape has expanded dramatically. "It's like a bowl of spaghetti where each strand needs to be able to talk to one end or the other, but just to the strands it needs to."
* **Misaligned incentives**: "IT historically has been concentrated on availability and speed and access, ubiquitous access… And security says, 'That's a fantastic Lego car you built. Before you can go outside and play with it, I'm going to stick a bunch more Legos on top of it called security, privacy, and compliance.'"

It's a recipe for burnout, blame, and breakdowns. But what if security could enable care instead of obstructing it?

Watch how MultiCare turned that possibility into practice in the Elisity Microsegmentation Platform case study with Jason Elrod, CISO, MultiCare Health System.

## **Identity: The Key to Modern Healthcare Security**

The breakthrough for MultiCare came with the implementation of identity-based [microsegmentation](https://elisity.co/3Z4qyVe) through Elisity.

"The biggest attack surface is the identity of every individual," notes Elrod. "Why are the attacks always on identity? Because in healthcare, we must make sure all the information is available when they need it, with the minimum amount of friction possible."

Traditional network segmentation approaches relied on complex VLANs, firewalls, and endpoint agents. The result? "A Byzantine spaghetti mess" that became increasingly difficult to manage and update.

Elisity's approach changed this paradigm by focusing on identity rather than network location:

* Dynamic security policies that follow users, workloads, and devices wherever they appear on the network
* Granular access controls that create security perimeters around individual assets
* Policy enforcement points that leverage existing infrastructure to implement microsegmentation without requiring new hardware, agents, or complex network reconfigurations

## **From Skepticism to Transformation**

When Elrod first introduced Elisity to his team, they responded with healthy skepticism. "They're like, 'Did you hit your head? Are you sure you read what you were saying? I thought you stopped drinking,'" Elrod recalls.

The technical teams were doubtful that such a microsegmentation solution could work with their existing infrastructure. "They said, 'That doesn't sound like something that can be done,'" shares Elrod.

But seeing was believing. "When you see people who are deeply technical, people who just know their craft really well, and they see something and go 'Wow'… it shakes the pillars of their opinions about what can be done," explains Elrod.

The Elisity solution delivered on its promises:

* Rapid implementation without disruptive network changes
* Real-time automated or manual policy adjustments that previously took weeks to implement
* Comprehensive visibility across previously siloed environments
* Enhanced security posture without compromising availability

...all without forcing a tradeoff between protection and performance.

But what surprised Elrod most wasn't just what the technology did, but how it changed the people using it.[JE2]

## **Breaking Down Walls Between Teams**

Perhaps the most unexpected benefit was how the solution transformed relationships between teams.

"There's been a friction point. Put this control and constraint around the network. Who's the first person to call? They're going to call IT. 'I can't do this thing.' And I'm saying, 'Well, you can't open everything, because everybody can't have ...
