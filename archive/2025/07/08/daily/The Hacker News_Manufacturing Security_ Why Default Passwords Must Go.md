If you didn't hear about [Iranian hackers](https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-urges-vendors-to-get-rid-of-default-passwords/) breaching US water facilities, it's because they only managed to control a single pressure station serving 7,000 people. What made this attack noteworthy wasn't its scale, but how easily the hackers gained access — by simply using the manufacturer's default password "1111." This narrow escape prompted [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-design-alert-how-manufacturers-can-protect-customers-eliminating-default-passwords) to urge manufacturers to eliminate default credentials entirely, citing "years of evidence" that these preset passwords remain one of the most exploited weaknesses.

While we wait for manufacturers to implement better security practices, the responsibility falls on IT teams. Whether you manage critical infrastructure or a standard business network, allowing unchanged manufacturer passwords in your environment is like rolling out the red carpet for attackers. Here’s what you need to know about default passwords — why they persist, their business and technical consequences, and how manufacturers can implement secure-by-design best practices.

## The pervasive threat of default passwords

Default passwords — the standardized credentials like "admin/admin" or "1234" shipped with countless devices and software systems — represent a glaring security gap that attackers love to exploit. Even though their risks are well-documented, they persist in production environments for numerous reasons:

* They simplify initial setup and configuration
* They streamline bulk device provisioning
* They support legacy systems with limited security options
* Manufacturers lack a secure-by-design mindset

The consequences of using default passwords include:

* **Botnet recruitment:** Attackers scan for vulnerable devices to build massive networks aimed at compromising other devices
* **[Ransomware entry points](https://specopssoft.com/blog/ransomware-prevention-best-practices/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thehackernews_referral&utm_content=article):** Hackers use default password access to establish footholds for deploying ransomware
* **Supply-chain compromises:** One vulnerable device can provide access to entire networks or partner systems
* **Complete security bypass:** Even robust security measures become ineffective when default credentials remain active

## Real-world consequences of default password attacks

Default passwords have facilitated some of the most destructive cyberattacks in recent history. For example, attackers created the [Mirai botnet](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/blog/the-mirai-botnet-threats-and-mitigations) by trying factory default passwords on thousands of IoT devices. Using a list of 61 common username/password combinations, the hackers compromised more than 600,000 connected devices. The resulting botnet launched devastating DDoS attacks that reached an unprecedented 1 Tbps, temporarily disabling internet services including Twitter and Netflix, and causing millions in damages.

Supply chains are also vulnerable to [default password attacks](https://specopssoft.com/blog/hybrid-password-attacks/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=thehackernews_referral&utm_content=article), with hackers targeting OEM devices with unchanged default credentials as beachheads in multi-stage attacks. Once inside, they install backdoors that keep their access open, then gradually move through connected systems until they reach your valuable data and critical infrastructure. These default passwords effectively undermine all other security controls, providing attackers with legitimate access that bypasses even advanced threat detection systems. The UK has recently moved to [ban IoT devices shipping with default passwords](https://www.bitdefender.com/en-gb/blog/hotforsecurity/uk-becomes-first-country-to-ban-iot-devices-with-default-passwords).

## The high cost of default password negligence

Failing to change default passwords can create consequences that go far beyond the initial security breach, including:

* **Brand damage:** Publicized breaches erode customer trust and trigger costly recalls, crisis management campaigns, and litigation that can continue for years, with expenses easily reaching millions of dollars.
* **Regulatory penalties:** New legislation like the EU's [Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act) and US state IoT security laws (like [California’s](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB327)) specifically target default password vulnerabilities, imposing significant fines for non-compliance.
* **Operational burden:** Implementing proper password policies up front is much more resourceful and cost-effective than emergency incident response, forensic analysis, and recovery efforts.
* **Ecosystem vulnerability:** A single compromised device can undermine interconnected environments — halting production in smart factories, jeopardizing patient care in healthcare settings, or creating cascading failures across partner networks.

## Five secure-by-design best practices for manufacturers

Manufacturers must shift from passing security burdens to customers and instead [build security into their products from inception](https://specopssoft.com/product/specops-password-policy/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaig...
