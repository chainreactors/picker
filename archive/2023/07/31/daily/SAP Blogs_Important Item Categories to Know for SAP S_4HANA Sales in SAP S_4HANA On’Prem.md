Together with sales document types, item categories set the framework for the different business transactions in an SAP S/4HANA system.

The item category allows you to process the same material differently depending on the document type. For instance, if a material is used in a quotation, the item category determined by the system is not relevant for delivery or billing. However, if the same material is entered in a sales order, or a sales order is created with reference to the quotation, a new item category is determined, which makes the item deliverable, and the item can be billed.

The table below shows some of the item categories defined in the standard system for sales documents. If the standard item categories don’t meet the requirements of your project, you can always define your own item categories in customizing to control the sales item differently.

You can define and assign item categories in the IMG menu under **Sales and Distribution >** **Sales >** **Sales Documents >** **Sales Document Item**. As a reference, the figure below shows a portion of the screen where the standard item category TAN can be configured.

### Define Item Categories

In this menu option, you define **item categories** for sales documents. The item categories that are contained in the system together with the sales document types represent the usual business transactions.

You have the following options for defining your own item categories:

* Copy an existing item category and change it according to your requirements.

* Create a new item category.

**Recommendation**

If you define your own item categories, the keys should begin with the letter Z since SAP keeps this range free in the standard system and protects it from being overwritten during release upgrades.

If you define your own item categories, you should copy similar item categories that are defined by SAP and make the required changes there. In this case, all the specifications of the existing item category are copied - even the assignment to the sales document types. In particular, the data for example concerning partner determination, pricing or document flow which you do not edit on the detail screen of the item category is also copied.  Consequently, you can test the new item category for the settings made without having to edit the other menu options.

When copying sales document types, item categories and schedule line categories, the system automatically creates a log with the copied data. Using the log, you can check whether all of the copied data applies to your item category or whether you must make changes.

**Note**

If you create or copy a new item category that is to be used for a delivery, you must also define a delivery item category with the same name. The system automatically transfers the item category that was found for the sales document item into the delivery item.

**Activities**

If you only need to make minor changes to the existing item categories (for example, a changed description), then you change this as appropriate. Minor changes refer to parameters that have no controlling character.

If you need to make other changes which might control the behavior of sales documents and their subsequent documents, define a new item category by copying a similar item category (which could be part of the standard content or customer-specific), and then change this new item category according to your requirements. In this way, you can for example define an item category for which a certain type of pricing is carried out, or for which the data must not differ at header and item level but which otherwise matches an existing item category.

This is especially important if you want to change item categories that are already in use in your production system.

If you want to create an item category, proceed as follows:

1. Enter an alphanumeric key with a maximum of four characters.

2. Maintain the respective specifications of the detail screen.

3. Also consider the additional functions on item category level and the item-specific settings in the general sales and distribution functions.

We won’t review every single function controlled by the item category, but you should be aware...
