### Austin Half

On January 19th, I ran the newly-renamed ‚ÄúAustin International Half Marathon‚Äù (formerly 3M). The night before I had spaghetti and meat sauce with the kids, and the morning of, I woke at 5:15 and had a cup of coffee and my usual banana. My trip to the bathroom was not very productive which worried me a bit, but my belly felt okay so I didn‚Äôt worry too much.

I left the house around 6:35 and parked in my usual spot around 6:50, early enough to get to a Porta-Potty without a line. It was bitterly cold that morning, with a stiff wind blowing southward, making for a rough start to the first northbound leg of the race. But since most of the race was southbound, we had a tailwind for most of it (not that I noticed).

I wore my trusty tights from last year, a $2 pair of disposable gloves I bought at the expo, and (luckily for me), my hoodie from the 2014 CodeMash conference. I assumed I would discard the hoodie and gloves along the way, but it was cold enough that I kept both for the entire race.

Just before starting, instead of my now-customary stroopwaffel, I had a ‚ÄúSalted Watermelon‚Äù gel pack (the first time I‚Äôve tried them). One of my two earbuds failed with a low battery (it‚Äôs *always* something) but the other stayed alive for the whole race.

I kept a solid pace for the first three miles, right around 9 minute miles. Alas, as I expected, I couldn‚Äôt keep it up and slowed down; last year, I‚Äôd managed to keep that pace for the first 10K.

Still, by mile 7 rather than feeling depressed and dying, I was actually *enjoying* myself a bit. My body felt good overall, my plantar fasciitis was quiet, my legs felt okay, and my greatest annoyance was a slight chafing I felt on my inner thigh (as I forgot to apply Body Glide as I usually do). A cold orange wedge offered by a kind spectator around mile 11 seemed like the most refreshing thing I‚Äôve ever eaten. I particularly enjoyed jogging through the UT Campus on the tree-lined brick path around mile 12.

A big upside to my third run is that the course felt more familiar, and I was no longer surprised/dismayed by the two short uphills in the city blocks at the end (although I didn‚Äôt even try to run them). I didn‚Äôt go all out at the end like I usually try to do, figuring that shaving tens of seconds wasn‚Äôt worth the risk that I‚Äôd hurl at the end (my near-miss in [2023‚Äôs Turkey Trot](https://textslashplain.com/2023/12/19/fall-races/#:~:text=Turkey%20Trot%205%2DMiler%2011/23) top of mind).

All in all, I finished in 2:18:35, nine minutes slower than [last year‚Äôs race](https://textslashplain.com/2024/01/23/cold-and-slow-half/), which was itself nine minutes slower than [my first effort](https://textslashplain.com/2023/01/23/couch-to-half-marathon-closing-my-first-year-of-running/).

Third Austin Half (2025) Results

While I‚Äôm not loving the direction my times are going, this race was (allegedly) 27 minutes faster than my glacial Dallas Half last month. *I‚Äôm not* entirely *convinced that the Dallas numbers are legit (I was* pretty sure *I was around a still-slow 2:35.*)

December 2024 Dallas Results

Spectator signs included a few copies of my favorite (*‚ÄúSeems like a lot of work for a banana‚Äù*) and I was a bit annoyed to discover that they didn‚Äôt even *have* bananas at the end this year. What a scam!

The most topical spectator sign was *‚ÄúWith TikTok banned, I‚Äôm so bored I‚Äôm watching this Half Marathon!‚Äù* Two people had signs: *‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt that hard‚Äì even boys do it‚Äù* which I‚Äôll confess annoyed me more than amusing me. But that‚Äôs another post.

Alas, my failure to apply Body Glide was a worse mistake than I realized, and I spent the next few days (on a work visit to Redmond HQ) walking and sitting gingerly as the chafing turned out to be a lot worse than I realized on the run. Other than that, and a gross-but-routine blister on one toe, I was no worse for the wear. Still, the coming full Marathon in Galveston in just three weeks loomed large in my mind‚Ä¶ will I be able to finish?

### Galveston Full

Way back at the end of 2023, I ran the [London Marathon on my treadmill](https://textslashplain.com/2023/12/19/fall-races/#:~:text=Virtual%20London%20Marathon%2012/17), but I‚Äôve not approached that distance since. Over a decade ago when Jane was training and running full marathons, I‚Äôd decided it was just a stupid distance ‚Äî training was too time-consuming, and there was too high a risk of injury. When I finally started running myself, I decided that 10Ks would be my main target, with [one half marathon](https://textslashplain.com/2023/01/23/couch-to-half-marathon-closing-my-first-year-of-running/) ‚Äújust to see if I could.‚Äù

Still, in the afternoon after [2024‚Äôs Galveston Half Marathon](https://textslashplain.com/2024/02/28/second-seaside-half/) run (my fourth real-world half), I ended up walking for about 7 miles on the beach, so when it came time to sign up for the 2025 race I decided that I‚Äôd sign up for the Full. I expected I‚Äôd run as much as I could (maybe 20 miles or so) and just walk the rest.

Alas, between my treadmill being broken for the fall of 2024, weight gain, my ongoing problems with plantar fasciitis, and a lengthy cold after my mid-January trip to Redmond, I was not feeling very ready for the Galveston Full. I had a nice spaghetti dinner the night before and went to bed early, around 10pm. I woke at 4:30 and dozed in bed until 5:30. Alas, my bathroom trip was unproductive, although my belly felt fine and I figured I‚Äôd probably visit a porta-potty after the first half.

Race morning was cool and extremely humid (~97%) and clouds kept the morning sun at bay (although not quite as foggy as [2023‚Äôs race](https://textslashplain.com/2023/03/01/slow-seaside-half/)). A light wind felt nice along the beach for the 7:30am start:

The sun broke through the clouds after a few hours and I had to apply more sunblock around mile 15, an effort that was not entirely effective ü§£l

I‚Äôd expected to finish the first half in around the same time I‚Äôd achieved last year (~2:15) leaving me as much as 3:45 for the second half (the course officially closes in 6 hours). Alas, knowing that every step in my first lap was going to be repeated on tired legs did not help my motivation, and I finished the first loop in a glacial 2:39, almost as slow as my run in Dallas.

My optimistic plan of breaking down the full race into *a Half, walking to mile 14, then running a 10K, then walking to mile 21, then running a 5K, then walking, then running a final 1K* immediately fell apart when it made contac...
