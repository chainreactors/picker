# Malware on the Google Play store leads to harmful phishing sites

Posted: November 1, 2022
 by [Nathan Collier](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/nathanmwb)

A family of malicious apps from developer [Mobile apps Group](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5631376253411320738) are listed on Google Play and infected with Android/Trojan.HiddenAds.BTGTHB. In total, four apps are listed, and together they have amassed at least one million downloads.

Older versions of these apps have been detected in the past as different variants of Android/Trojan.HiddenAds. Yet, the developer is still on Google Play dispensing its latest HiddenAds [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware).

This follows on the heels of [adware that was found on Google Play just a couple months ago from a rogue PDF reader](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/adware-found-on-google-play-pdf-reader-servicing-up-full-screen-ads).

## Delayed ungratification

Our analysis of this malware starts with us finding an app named Bluetooth Auto Connect (full app information at the bottom of this article). When users first install this malicious app, it takes a couple of days before it begins to display malicious behavior.  Delaying malicious behavior is a common tactic to evade detection by malware developers.  It turns out that this app uses delays quite a bit, as you’ll discover in our analysis.

After the initial delay, the malicious app opens phishing sites in Chrome. The content of the [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) sites varies—some are harmless sites used simply to produce pay-per-click, and others are more dangerous phishing sites that attempt to trick unsuspecting users.  For example, one site includes adult content that leads to phishing pages that tell the user they’ve been infected, or need to perform an update.

The Chrome tabs are opened in the background even while the mobile device is locked.  When the user unlocks their device, Chrome opens with the latest site.  A new tab opens with a new site frequently, and as a result, unlocking your phone after several hours means closing multiple tabs.  The users browser history will also be a long list of nasty phishing sites.

## Deeper analysis using LogCat

As per my last [blog post](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/08/adware-found-on-google-play-pdf-reader-servicing-up-full-screen-ads), I once again used an [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) OS test phone and plugged it into my laptop running *LogCat* via good old *Android Device Monitor.*To clarify, *LogCat* is usedto observe all logs created by installed apps and the Android OS, including the logs of this malware.  The first log entry from this malware came several hours after the initial installation.

```

```

The first important datapoint of the log entry is what *LogCat* calls the *Tag*.  This usually is a descriptor of the log text like *ActivityM...
