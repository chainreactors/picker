# Retracing the Congolese March Where Dido Kakisingi was Killed

December 10, 2024

* [Democratic Republic of the Congo](/tag/democratic-republic-of-the-congo)
* [Elections](/tag/elections)

In October two people [were sentenced to five years in jail](https://acp.cd/province/maniema-les-auteurs-de-lassassinat-de-maitre-kankisingi-condamnes-a-5-ans-de-prison/) in connection with the killing of opposition member Dido Kakisingi at a march in Kindu, Democratic Republic of Congo.

Kakisingi, a lawyer and [youth coordinator of political party Ensemble Pour la République](https://x.com/Ensemble_MK/status/1729767343708897474?s=20) (Ensemble) in the province of Maniema was [killed during clashes](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congo-opposition-party-says-activist-killed-violence-election-rally-2023-11-28/) at a political march in the province’s capital on November 28, 2023.

Kakisingi, along with supporters of the political party Ensemble, was attending [in support of opposition candidate, Moise Katumbi](https://www.rtl.be/actu/monde/international/un-membre-du-parti-de-moise-katumbi-serait-decede-en-marge-dun-meeting-kindu/2023-11-28/article/612738) ahead of presidential elections.

But the rally did not go as planned – most tragically for Kakisingi.

Less than a month after Kakisingi died, incumbent Félix Tshisekedi won the election amid [reports of repression and arrests](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/08/22/dr-congo-crackdown-opposition-ahead-elections) of rival politicians and violence against demonstrators and journalists.

The conviction of two suspects comes as supporters and family of Kakisingi continue to seek justice for his killing. [Those family members say at least 14 other people](https://www.radiookapi.net/2024/05/21/actualite/justice/meurtre-de-dido-kankisingi-ismael-munanga-cinquieme-prevenu-transfere) involved in the violence should be arrested and questioned by police.

A number of misleading reports have spread about the circumstances of Kakisingi’s killing.

With efforts at achieving justice ongoing, Bellingcat looked back at the available open source evidence to see what it shows about how exactly the march unfolded.

## Main Venue for Political Rallies Closed Ahead of the Opposition’s Arrival

It had long been common for political rallies to be held in central Kindu at the [Tribune Centrale de Kindu](https://www.google.se/maps/place/In%2BKindu%2BCentral%2BTribune/%40-2.9505035%2C25.9182718%2C112m/data%3D%213m1%211e3%214m12%211m5%213m4%212zMsKwNTcnMDIuNCJTIDI1wrA1NScwNi4xIkU%218m2%213d-2.9506564%214d25.9183646%213m5%211s0x19ee3a419365d35f%3A0x227507b88f0ef6a4%218m2%213d-2.9505629%214d25.9183074%2116s/g/11dxqk9tqg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOC4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExMjMzSAFQAw%3D%3D), a large covered area located on one of the city’s main roads.

For instance President Tshisekedi [held an election rally](https://actualite.cd/2023/11/23/campagne-electorale-la-ville-de-kindu-sapprete-accueillir-felix-tshisekedi) there on November 23, 2023, a few days prior to the fatal march.

However, local media [reported](https://digitalcongo.org/detail9052) that Kindu’s mayor [temporarily closed the Tribune Centrale de Kindu](https://archive.is/k5PIe) for repairs days before two opposition candidates were scheduled to hold rallies there. Opposition figures complained that the decision was politically motivated.

[Footage posted](https://x.com/Ensemble_MK/status/1729767343708897474) by Ensemble showed presidential candidate and party leader Katumbi landing at [Kindu Airport](https://www.google.se/maps/place/A%C3%A9roport%2Bde%2BKindu/%40-2.9262241%2C25.915016%2C894m/data%3D%213m2%211e3%214b1%214m6%213m5%211s0x19ee309109bd18e9%3A0xc80efdf1d95e25d2%218m2%213d-2.9262241%214d25.915016%2116s/m/02803k0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOC4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExMjMzSAFQAw%3D%3D) by private jet, a Dassault Falcon 900.

FlightRadar showed the jet landing in Kindu at 10:29 UTC (12:29 CAT, as Kindu is in the Central Africa Time zone, two hours ahead of UTC).

Opposition leader Katumbi, wearing a distinctive blue fedora, is seen descending from the jet.

Supporters met him at the airport and began the march, traveling south out of the airport down Joseph Kabila Boulevard, a wide street with a distinctive line of trees in the center. At some point, Kakisingi joined the procession, though it is not possible to determine from the available open source evidence if this was at the airport or along Joseph Kabila Boulevard.

## The March Begins and Kakisingi is Killed

Less than three kilometres from the airport, between 1:00 and 2:00 pm local time, and approximately 60 metres from the Joseph Kabila monument ([-2.939020, 25.924275](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monument%2BJoseph%2BKabila/%40-2.9357231%2C25.9177468%2C894m/data%3D%213m1%211e3%214m15%211m8%213m7%211s0x19ee3a6a2ab46331%3A0x74de10ef7e028b88%212sKindu%2C%2BDemocratic%2BRepublic%2Bof%2Bthe%2BCongo%213b1%218m2%213d-2.9492205%214d25.9231471%2116zL20vMDhuX3dt%213m5%211s0x19ee3b23cca96ce7%3A0x42d15742bc2d0360%218m2%213d-2.9390293%214d25.9242768%2116s/g/11s9hkvdc_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTExOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)), violence broke out during the march.

Footage from this area shows Kakisingi lying in blood on the street, his shirt has been torn and is dirtied.

People surround him, some are filming....
