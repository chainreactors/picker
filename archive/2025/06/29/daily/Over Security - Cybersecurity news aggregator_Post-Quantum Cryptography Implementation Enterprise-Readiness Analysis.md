Post‑quantum cryptography (PQC) is transitioning from research to early adoption. Cloudflare’s deployment is a significant step, but enterprises need to understand the broader ecosystem—including open-source libraries, cloud providers, hardware tools, and regulatory drivers—to prepare effectively.

## 1. PQC Momentum at Infosec Europe

At Infosec Europe 2025, Cloudflare demonstrated hybrid TLS protecting edge-to-origin traffic. Other vendors highlighted pilot solutions for internal communications and identity. Experts emphasized that practical challenges remain in performance tuning and interoperability ahead of wider adoption.

## 2. Industry-wide PQC Deployments

Meta began migrating internal data-centre traffic to hybrid TLS in 2023, using X25519 + Kyber to counter harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks. This impacted billions of internal connections without disrupting legacy clients.

Microsoft has integrated PQC support in Windows Insider and Linux preview builds as of 2025. That enables developers and system builders to test quantum-resistant encryption on common platforms.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 includes PQC algorithms under Technology Preview for TLS, SSH, and Kerberos. While not production-ready, it enables early testing and discovery of integration issues.

## 3. OpenSSL 3.5 Enables PQC Everywhere

OpenSSL 3.5—now available as an LTS release—integrates NIST-approved Kyber, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+ for hybrid TLS by default. This allows any application using OpenSSL to enable PQC with minimal code changes, and supports performance testing across environments.

## 4. Tools, Frameworks, and Case Studies

Booz Allen highlights that enterprise transition to PQC is necessary to defeat “harvest-now-decrypt-later” attacks, recommending immediate planning and early vendor pilots.

Apriorit published implementation examples using Go, liboqs, and Cloudflare integration. This demonstrates how to incorporate PQC in HTTPS communications for developers working in Go-based microservices.

## 5. Enterprise Readiness: Challenges and Recommendations

Surveys by Idemia reveal that over 50% of organizations are researching or planning PQC implementation, but most lack technical expertise. Regulatory guidance and controls are needed to guide adoption.

## 6. Compliance and Regulatory Drivers

NIST finalized its first PQC standards in August 2024. US federal guidelines require quantum-safe encryption in government systems by 2030. IBM, Microsoft, and Google are actively supporting integration of these standards.

India’s BFSI sector currently rates PQC readiness at 2.4/5, though 57.5% of CISOs project quantum risk is substantial within three years. A structured migration framework is being proposed to accelerate adoption.

## 7. Global Ecosystem and Commercial Offerings

PQShield—a UK startup with £37m funding—supplies post-quantum crypto components to governments and enterprises, powering standards and identity workflows. It is actively involved in advising agencies like GCHQ.

Quantinuum’s Quantum Origin service delivers quantum-generated random keys as a complement to PQC deployments. Partners include PureVPN and utilities in 2024, offering stronger entropy sources.

## 8. Summary Metrics

| Metric | Value / Estimate |
| --- | --- |
| Cloudflare PQC-enabled TLS | ~35% non-bot HTTPS traffic |
| Hybrid TLS handshake overhead | ~1 ms |
| Chrome PQC support | ≈10% traffic |
| NIST PQC deadline | Government compliance by 2030 |
| BFSI PQC readiness (India) | 2.4/5 score |

## Recommendations for Enterprises

* **Deploy hybrid TLS:** Enable via OpenSSL 3.5, RHEL 10, or reverse proxies; pilot in low-risk zones.
* **Integrate PQC into infrastructure:** Update Windows and Linux builds with PQC support using Microsoft previews and liboqs.
* **Perform crypto inventory:** Identify legacy and hybrid endpoints via scanning tools.
* **Enforce crypto agility:** In procurement and vendor contracts, mandate support for NIST PQC algorithms.
* **Prepare for compliance:** Align with NIST, NSA, and international standards; document rollout plans.
* **Educate teams:** Train crypto, network and security staff on algorithm changes and deployment risks.

## Conclusion

Post‑quantum cryptography is gaining real-world traction beyond Cloudflare. OpenSSL 3.5, Linux distributions, Windows builds, and vendors are enabling PQC testing today. Enterprises must operationalise hybrid TLS, audit cryptography across systems, align with regulatory timelines and inv...
