Cyber threats don't show up one at a time anymore. They're layered, planned, and often stay hidden until it's too late.

For cybersecurity teams, the key isn't just reacting to alerts‚Äîit's spotting early signs of trouble before they become real threats. This update is designed to deliver clear, accurate insights based on real patterns and changes we can verify. With today's complex systems, we need focused analysis‚Äînot noise.

What you'll see here isn't just a list of incidents, but a clear look at where control is being gained, lost, or quietly tested.

## **‚ö° Threat of the Week**

**Lumma Stealer, DanaBot Operations Disrupted** ‚Äî A coalition of private sector companies and law enforcement agencies have taken down the infrastructure associated with [Lumma Stealer](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fbi-and-europol-disrupt-lumma-stealer.html) and [DanaBot](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/us-dismantles-danabot-malware-network.html). Charges have also been unsealed against 16 individuals for their alleged involvement in the development and deployment of DanaBot. The malware is equipped to siphon data from victim computers, hijack banking sessions, and steal device information. More uniquely, though, DanaBot has also been used for hacking campaigns that appear to be linked to Russian state-sponsored interests. All of that makes DanaBot a particularly clear example of how commodity malware has been repurposed by Russian state hackers for their own goals. In tandem, about 2,300 domains that acted as the command-and-control (C2) backbone for the Lumma information stealer have been seized, alongside [taking down 300 servers and neutralizing 650 domains](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/300-servers-and-35m-seized-as-europol.html) that were used to launch ransomware attacks. The actions against international cybercrime in the past few days constituted the latest phase of Operation Endgame.

## It's not you. It's Python

More security teams are moving away from custom scripts like Python, PowerShell, and Bash in favor of low-code platforms. Why? This new Tines guide breaks it down. Inside, you'll find a side-by-side comparison of Tines vs Python across HTTP requests, webhooks, data manipulation, and more.](https://thehackernews.uk/tines-vs-python-thn-ar)

## **üîî Top News**

* **Threat Actors Use TikTok Videos to Distribute Stealers** ‚Äî While ClickFix has become a popular social engineering tactic to deliver malware, threat actors have been [observed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/hackers-use-tiktok-videos-to-distribute.html) using artificial intelligence (AI)-generated videos uploaded to TikTok to deceive users into running malicious commands on their systems and deploy malware like Vidar and StealC under the guise of activating pirated version of Windows, Microsoft Office, CapCut, and Spotify. "This campaign highlights how attackers are ready to weaponize whichever social media platforms are currently popular to distribute malware," Trend Micro said.
* **APT28 Hackers Target Western Logistics and Tech Firms** ‚Äî Several cybersecurity and intelligence agencies from Australia, Europe, and the United States issued a joint alert warning of a state-sponsored campaign orchestrated by the Russian state-sponsored threat actor APT28 targeting Western logistics entities and technology companies since 2022. "This cyber espionage-oriented campaign targeting logistics entities and technology companies uses a mix of previously disclosed TTPs and is likely connected to these actors' wide scale targeting of IP cameras in Ukraine and bordering NATO nations," the agencies [said](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/russian-hackers-exploit-email-and-vpn.html). The attacks are designed to steal sensitive information and maintain long-term persistence on compromised hosts.
* **Chinese Threat Actors Exploit Ivanti EPMM Flaws** ‚Äî The China-nexus cyber espionage group tracked as UNC5221 has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/chinese-hackers-exploit-ivanti-epmm.html) to the exploitation of a pair of security flaws affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) software (CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428) to target a wide range of sectors across Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region. The intrusions leverage the vulnerabilities to obtain a reverse shell and drop malicious payloads like KrustyLoader, which is known to deliver the Sliver command-and-control (C2) framework. "UNC5221 demonstrates a deep understanding of EPMM's internal architecture, repurposing legitimate system components for covert data exfiltration," EclecticIQ said. "Given EPMM's role in managing and pushing configurations to enterprise mobile devices, a successful exploitation could allow threat actors to remotely access, manipulate, or compromise thousands of managed devices across an organization."
* **Over 100 Google Chrome Extensions Mimic Popular Tools** ‚Äî An unknown threat actor has been [attributed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/100-fake-chrome-extensions-found.html) to creating several malicious Chrome Browser extensions since February 2024 that masquerade as seemingly benign utilities such as DeepSeek, Manus, DeBank, FortiVPN, and Site Stats but incorporate covert functionality to exfiltrate data, receive commands, and execute arbitrary code. Links to these browser add-ons are hosted on specially crafted sit...
