From the team that brought you COFF Loader, CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF, CS-Remote-OPs-BOF, and numerous blogs on BOFs, we are excited to release our first on-demand class: Building BOFs. TrustedSec has had private classes on BOF development, offensive tool development, and Penetration Testing for many years now; however, they have always been done live. Now, you can learn from these classes on-demand. You’ll learn how to confidently build BOFs yourself, and you'll create and you'll be introduced to two previously unreleased BOFs. One executes commands using service failure actions, and the other uses the VSS com interface to take a snapshot and dump hives without making additional copies on the disk.

TrustedSec now aims to provide [on-demand training](https://learn.trustedsec.com/catalog) on more niche topics with less coverage in the InfoSec space. The team recognizes that offense is becoming more specialized, and it's necessary to dive deep into various offensive topics. At the same time, there are numerous quality broad Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and other courses out there, but we’re not looking to reinvent the quality coursework. The team plans to release additional courses over 2025 on various topics. Stay tuned for updates!
