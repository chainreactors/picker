# Exploit Title: DSL-124 Wireless N300 ADSL2+ - Backup File Disclosure
# Date:  2022-11-10
# Exploit Author: Aryan Chehreghani
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.dlink.com
# Software Link: https://dlinkmea.com/index.php/product/details?det=dU1iNFc4cWRsdUpjWEpETFlSeFlZdz09
# Firmware Version: ME_1.00
# Tested on: Windows 11

# [ Details - DSL-124 ]:
#The DSL-124 Wireless N300 ADSL2+ Modem Router is a versatile, high-performance router for a home or small office,
#With integrated ADSL2/2+, supporting download speeds up to 24 Mbps, firewall protection,
#Quality of Service (QoS),802.11n wireless LAN, and four Ethernet switch ports,
#the Wireless N300 ADSL2+ Modem Router provides all the functions that a user needs to establish a secure and high-speed link to the Internet.

# [ Description ]:
#After the administrator enters and a new session is created, the attacker sends a request using the post method in her system,
#and in response to sending this request, she receives a complete backup of the router settings,
#In fact this happens because of the lack of management of users and sessions in the network.

# [ POC ]:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.co...
