# PMC Ryodan: The Strange Story of Anime Teens, their Sworn Enemies and the Kremlin

March 3, 2023

* [Russia](/tag/russia)

The Russian parliament is [set to meet](https://ria.ru/20230228/redan-1854803120.html) in order to assess the situation with PMC (Private Military Company) Ryodan following mass detentions across the country. Dmitry Peskov, the Press Secretary of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has said that his office has been “[paying attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj25XTxizJY)” to the group. Rotonda media reports that in St Petersburg, [police told children](https://t.me/rotondamedia/4359) that PMC Ryodan is the creation of “Western intelligence services”, and are part of Russia’s ongoing “confrontation with the West.” The reach of PMC Ryodan is not limited to Russia – [mass arrests have also taken place in Ukraine](https://kyiv.npu.gov.ua/news/politseiski-kyieva-vykryly-dvokh-administratoriv-telehram-kanaliv-nebezpechnoho-molodizhnoho-rukhu-v-ukraini?fbclid=IwAR1yPviC-7LENb7PZ4jqrUBddkjKbhGwPUq4yopHlDZ0zeVGGQFSX7lU-RE), with the Kyiv Police [calling](https://www.facebook.com/UA.KyivPolice/posts/pfbid0Naf51VkYNa3GxwDhnQYFtkivBRjWYqCdn7fgTUc3fdp8vP4GZLHM1VMaomNQZLipl?__cft__[0]=AZUZJEWGfxTXbj5EDgLBnw74udxAuMB7XzsiHV2xj8hfh8_mzz9ui6cCyuN9QMlRntDgCZ_n22X-DD5DJ0Gr7it7X_fYHSfLcgRkSwypFyNCM772ntbmdjw7bJLupFG2RWYKHcIVyQERDM_j8oxhYGYs6BPdCA6nHFLpwVmyDzundYWxnWFdfogbcsYGNzLKm2M&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) the group an instrument of “Russian propagandists” leading an “informational-psychological operation” to “destabilise the internal situation in Ukraine.”

PMC Ryodan is not a transnational terrorist operation, but rather a cheekily-named and loosely-organised [group of teenage](https://dailystorm.ru/detali/chvk-redan-stala-izvestna-blagodarya-smi-a-serial-hunter-x-hunter-vyhodit-na-novyy-pik-populyarnosti) [anime fans](https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Phantom_Troupe). Over the last week of February, panic spread through Russia and Ukraine about a mysterious subculture of teenagers wearing black hoodies adorned with a white spider, supposedly starting massive brawls in shopping malls. News spread of incidents of “the Ryodans”, identifiable by their ubiquitous fashion choices, gathering in [flash mobs in malls](https://t.me/bazabazon/16015?single) and [attacking people](https://tlgrm.ru/channels/%40readovkanews/53610).

Articles in Russian media outlets have been [published](https://fedpress.ru/article/3208839) with instructions for parents to help them find out if their child is a member of PMC Ryodan (one clue – they may have long black hair). News website Readovka has called PMC Ryodan a “[cult of violence](https://readovka.news/news/133912)”and a “[fight club](https://t.me/readovkanews/53554)”.

Facing off against this group of anime-obsessed teenagers are their adversaries.

Ryodans have called them a range of names including *offniki* (basically, football hooligans) and [*gopniki*](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/04/10/thugs-rednecks-nationalists-understanding-russias-gopnik-culture-a33852), a Russian term for a violent, working class subculture. A [post](https://t.me/ryodanpokolenie_4/103) in one Ryodan group called them simply “[bald motherfuckers](https://www.severreal.org/a/kto-takie-chvk-redan-/32290663.html) wearing Adidas”. These young men are usually depicted as brutish, Adidas tracksuit-wearing thugs. These “anti-Ryodan” groups have very quickly mobilised online into violent squads, sharing videos of attacks on anyone they suspect of being a “Ryodan” in shopping malls across Russia and Ukraine.

Although anti-Ryodan groups use homophobic language in deriding Ryodan fans, this isn’t necessarily reflective of a new culture war. For their part, Ryodan fans are hardly opposition protesters. These incidents are closer to fights in school canteens than a clash between politicised subcultures. In fact, upon closer inspection, the groups hunting Ryodan fans are more organised, more violent and more numerous than their prey.

## **Who are Ryodans?**

Ryodans are passionate anime fans, primarily of the *Hunter x Hunter* series. ‘Ryodan’, which means ‘the troupe’ in Japanese, is a group of thieves that feature in *Hunter x Hunter*, while their symbol is a white spider with a changing number.

Russian fan groups of the series are not new, with countless communities spread across [Vkontakte](https://vk.com/search?c%5Bper_page%5D=40&c%5Bq%5D=%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD&c%5Bsection%5D=communities&c%5Bsort%5D=6) (VK), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/search/user?lang=en&q=%23%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD&t=1677689169554), [Discord](https://discordserver.info/search/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD), [Steam](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=site%3Asteamcommunity.com+%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD#ip=1), [Telegram](https://t.me/ryodanpokolenie_4) and other social networking sites. Some groups started calling themselves “PMC Ryodan” as a joke, riffing off Wagner, Russia’s most notorious private military contractor (PMC). This is somewhat analogous to fans of the Korean group BTS calling themselves [Army](https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/ARMY) – but with a twist of the current wartime situation of Russia.  It may have expressed the extent of their fandom, which was expressed by buying large amounts of merchandise showing a white spider and digit (usually ‘4’) on a black background.

As one Ryodan member [has noted](https://t.me/reicxz/618) in a Telegram post, this name was often used as a “[clan tag](https://stratz.com/search/%D1%87%D0%B2%D0%BA%20%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD)” for people playing computer games online, such as [DotA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2), a multiplayer battle arena game. Popular VK groups show that this “PMC” formation was far from a serious designation – members of all ages joked about their “ranks” and spent more time posting screenshots of their [DotA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2) games than about actual fighting or war. In these groups, there was some limited discussion of in-person meetups, including one at the foodcourt of the Aviapark shopping mall in Moscow, which took place in late December 2022.

The first reported violent incident involving Ryodan happened on February 19, when a [small skirmish broke out at the food court](https://t.me/bazabazon/16015) of the Aviapark mall in Moscow. A group of Ryodans were attacked by a group of men in tracksuits. On the same day, a popular Ryodan Telegram channel [uploaded a photograph](https://t.me/ryodanpokolenie_4/102) showing four people, three of whom are wearing the Ryodan spider hoodie, which Bellingcat [geolocated to the ...
