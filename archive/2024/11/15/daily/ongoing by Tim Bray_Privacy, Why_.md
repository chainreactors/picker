They’re listening to us too much, and watching too. We’re not happy about it. The feeling is appropriate but we’ve been
unclear about why we feel it.

*[Note: This is adapted from a piece called
[Privacy Primer](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/privacy-primer-c7b9caadfc67) that I published on Medium in
2013. I did this mostly because Medium was new and shiny then and I wanted to try it out. But I’ve repeatedly wanted to refer to
it and then when I looked, wanted to fix it up a little, so I’ve migrated it back to its natural home on the blog.]*

This causes two problems: First, people worry that they’re being unreasonable or paranoid or something (they’re not). Second,
we lack the right rhetoric (in the formal sense; language aimed at convincing others) for the occasions when we find ourselves
talking to the unworried, or to law-enforcement officials, or to the public servants minding the legal framework that empowers
the watchers.

The reason I’m writing this is to shoot holes in the “If you haven’t done anything wrong, don’t worry” story. Because it’s
deeply broken and we need to refute it efficiently if we’re going to make any progress.

Privacy is a gift of civilization ·
Living in a civilized country means you don’t have to poop in a ditch, you don’t have to fetch water from the well or
firewood from the forest, and you don’t have to share details of your personal life. It is a huge gift of civilization that
behind your front door you need not care what people think about how you dress, how you sleep, or how you cook. And that when
communicating with friends and colleagues and loved ones, you need not care what anyone thinks unless you’ve invited them to the
conversation.

Privacy doesn’t need any more justification. It’s a quality-of-life thing and needs no further defense. We and generations of
ancestors have worked hard to build a civilized society and one of the rewards is that often, we can relax and just be our
private selves. So we should resist anyone who wants to take that away.

Bad people ·
The public servants and private surveillance-capitalists who are doing the watching are, at the end of the day,
people. Mostly honorable and honest; but some
proportion will always be crooked or insane or just bad people; no higher than in the general population, but never zero. I
don’t think Canada, where I live, is worse than anywhere else, but we see a pretty steady flow of police brutality and
corruption stories. And advertising is not a profession built around integrity. These are facts of life.

Given this, it’s unreasonable to give people the ability to spy on us without factoring in checks and balances to keep the
rogues among them from wreaking havoc.

“But this stuff isn’t controversial” ·
You might think that your communications are definitely not suspicious or sketchy, and in fact boring, and so why should you
want privacy or take any effort to have it?

Because you’re forgetting about the people who *do* need privacy. If only the “suspicious” stuff is made private,
then our adversaries will assume that anything that’s private must be suspicious. That endangers our basic civilizational
privacy privilege and isn’t a place we want to be.

Talking points for everyday use ·
First, it’s OK to say “I don’t want to be watched”; no justification is necessary. Second, as a matter of civic hygiene, we
need to be regulating our watchers, watching out for individual rogues and corrupt cultures.

So it’s OK to demand privacy by default; to fight back against those who would commandeer the Internet; and (especially) to
use politics to empower the watchers’ watchers; make their political regulators at least as frightened of the voters as of the
enemy.

That’s the reasonable point of view. It’s the surveillance-culture people who want to abridge your privacy who are being
unreasonable.

Along these lines, legal theory on privacy generally revolves around 1) control over one’s data, and 2) human dignity.

See eg Warren and Brandeis, “The right to privacy.”

I agree. I personally have "nothing to hide" but I believe that comes with the obligation to help protect others.

The more people who do the privacy tips from "how to protect your privacy when you're [sensitive activity redacted]" the better off the people actually doing the sensitive activity are. <https://blog.zgp.org/effective-privacy-tips/>

Remember ... uhm... last month, when being trans was celebrated across the corporsphere? I know, I know. It's hard to believe \*this week\*. Back then, the privacy of trans people was guaranteed by the Holy Terms Of Service. The Knights of Community Safety were always at the ready to serve and protect.

This week? Not so much.

(Amazon under Bezos has just deleted references to supporting LGBTQ rights. Zuckerberg, in his mania for a return to masculinity in tech, has signed off on calling trans people 'mentally ill'. Elon Musk has been railing against the 'woke mind virus' while giving Nazi salutes. Google CEO Pichai was at the inauguration, too, to ceremonially lay the world's surveillance engine at Trump's feet.)

Turns out the corporate guarantees were more or less empty. They did what they had to do to remain profitable. Now they're doing something else. In 4 years, they'll be doing a new thing.

And as the corporations and governments change like ever shifting weather patterns, with many dark and stormy clouds on the horizon, who is protected and who is exposed -- indeed, who is \*hunted\* -- shifts.

Today they are hunting \*them\* -- the ones you don't like. Tomorrow you. Oops.

That is why you want privacy.

The privacy argument fell on so many deaf ears for so long because the exploitative nature of big tech was wrapped behind a comfy UI/UX. Now that the Dumpster has torn off that bandaid, we can see the mega corps for what they are: not only stealing our information, exploiting us at every turn, but \*dangerous\* in and of themselves. They are arming the brown shirts of all brands of political crazy. Mis-kiss a girl 20 years ago? Cancelled by mobs of feminists. Wear the clothes of the other gender? Cancelled by mobs of neo-fascists. All thanks to the unblinking totalitarian eye that drains our personal lives into sensational tidbits, one twart at a time. We did it to ourselves.

Privacy is something each of us has to win, at great expense, and not something to be found in the promises of corporations or governments. You will not find privacy in a checkbox in your favorite app. If you have to check a 'privacy settings' button, you've already signed up for exploitation and fear. They've already tricked and entranced and trapped you. Your only hope now? That you're actually as boring and uninteresting as you think you are. Unfortunately, under exploitation capitalism, even corpses can be rendered into fat and sold back to the rich as artisanal soap. Good luck with being boring.

Privacy means, at bottom, refusing technology into our lives, and being very cautious about what we give up.

The Amish are instructive here. Even if you think they go too far, they provide a baseline for responsibility around technology. Start there and open a f...
