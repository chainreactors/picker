Access and Use ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds via MISP

As cybersecurity threats grow more sophisticated, collaboration becomes a cornerstone of effective defense strategies. This is where MISP, an open-source threat intelligence sharing platform, comes into play.

Recognizing its value, we are excited to announce the launch of our own MISP instance, enabling users to access and use [indicators of compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/indicators-of-compromise/) (IOCs) from [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_with_misp&utm_term=121224&utm_content=linktolanding)’s [Threat Intelligence Feeds](https://intelligence.any.run/feeds/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=ti_feeds_with_misp&utm_term=121224&utm_content=tifeeds).

## What is MISP?

**[MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/),** which stands for **Malware Information Sharing Platform,** is a free, open-source platform designed to facilitate the **exchange, storage**, and **correlation** of threat intelligence data. MISP lets organizations and researchers:

* Exchange critical data points to identify cyber threats.
* Share signals or attributes indicating the compromise of information systems.
* Automate the process of data sharing and find correlations between threat data.

## Benefits of ANY.RUN’s MISP Instance

With ANY.RUN’s MISP instance, you can:

### **1. Access ANY.RUN’s TI Feeds**

Receive a direct stream of the latest malicious IPs, URLs, domains, ports, file names, and hashes. These are extracted from malware and phishing samples, including ones not found elsewhere, submitted and analyzed in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox by security professionals worldwide. IOCs are pulled from different sources, including network activities and malware configurations.
