## UK Is Ordering Apple to Break Its Own Encryption

The *Washington Post* is [reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/) that the UK government has served Apple with a “technical capability notice” as defined by the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, requiring it to break the Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud for the benefit of law enforcement.

This is a big deal, and something we in the security community have worried was coming for a while now.

> The law, known by critics as the Snoopers’ Charter, makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.
>
> Apple can appeal the U.K. capability notice to a secret technical panel, which would consider arguments about the expense of the requirement, and to a judge who would weigh whether the request was in proportion to the government’s needs. But the law does not permit Apple to delay complying during an appeal.
>
> In March, when the company was on notice that such a requirement might be coming, it told Parliament: “There is no reason why the U.K. [government] should have the authority to decide for citizens of the world whether they can avail themselves of the proven security benefits that flow from end-to-end encryption.”

Apple is likely to turn the feature off for UK users rather than break it for everyone worldwide. Of course, UK users will be able to spoof their location. But this might not be enough. According to the law, Apple would not be able to offer the feature to anyone who is in the UK at any point: for example, a visitor from the US.

And what happens next? Australia has [a law](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/assistance-and-access-industry-assistance-framework) enabling it to ask for the same thing. Will it? Will even more countries follow?

This is madness.

“Apple can appeal the U.K. capability notice to a secret technical panel…”

…where it will be automatically dismissed.

Nice to see this NSL-style request has been published. I ask myself why it is a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand. The only answer I can think about is that it is a completely illegal request.

It is time to stop governments to act this way. The only way to achieve this goal is by means of technology and mathematics, as ever.

People should wake up.

To be more clear, I understand [somewhat] why a NSL requesting information about someone or an organization must be keep secret, as it may interfere with an investigation. However, this one is a general request that will not difficult a research. It is just a generic request to provide a backdoor, not a request targeted to someone under active investigation.

In other words, it is keep secret because it is an illegal request.

As I said in other cases, governments and citizens play on the same league, but are not on the same team.

Wake up.

Well, all Apple needs to do here is break the law in a limited and specific way.

The government won’t have any right to complain about that.

How would the UK punish a company for violating a secret law? A person they could grab and hold a secret trial.

Looking beyond all of the security, privacy, and human rights reasons that backdoored encryption is a bad idea, how is this not an international incident? The UK is demanding Apple backdoor their encryption worldwide, not just in the UK. The UK is demanding backdoor access to the data belonging to Americans. They’re basically trying to strongarm an American company into performing covert espionage against the United States. This wouldn’t just impact ordinary Americans, but presumably also the personal iCloud accounts of American diplomats and high level officials.

And the U.K. is supposedly America’s ally? The United States needs to retaliate.

if the data is encrypted in the cloud, it’s from a key that is stored in the phone (and if done properly, in a secure anti-tampering chip secure enclave on the phone). what the UK is asking for should get the reply : we cannot. we do not have the key. the key never leaves the device itself”

apple should turn icloud off in the UK and display the message “sorry, the UK government does not allow iCloud in your country unless we give them full access to your data, all the time. your current icloud data is no longer available, please ask the UK government for a solution for this”

governments have NO right to have access to any information on a device or cloud unless there is a judge behind and “probable cause” justifying it.

what the UK want is full access, so every time they have a new keyword in mind they can get to iCloud, and search EVERYONE’s data for anything related to it, and grab it.

Stasi dramed of it

i am not surprised. the UK is no democracy. they are the country when several thousands of underage girls have been raped, everyone from the police to the services in charge of child protection KNEW and they did NOT...
