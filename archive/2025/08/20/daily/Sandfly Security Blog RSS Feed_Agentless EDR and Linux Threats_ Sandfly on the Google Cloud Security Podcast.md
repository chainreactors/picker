# Agentless EDR and Linux Threats: Sandfly on the Google Cloud Security Podcast

19 August 2025

If your team manages Linux infrastructure, you know the security challenges are unique. Teams are massively understaffed, and traditional agent-based solutions often struggle with compatibility across complex environments.

Sandfly's CEO, Craig Rowland, recently joined the [Google Cloud Security Podcast (EP239)](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep239-linux-security-the-detection-and-response-disconnect-and-where-is-my-agentless-edr/)to discuss how an agentless approach can solve these widespread security problems.

This episode is packed with insights for anyone looking to improve their Linux security posture.

Key discussion topics:

* The Agentless EDR debate and Sandfly's unique approach
* The Linux threat landscape, including "living off the land" attacks
* BPFDoor and other advanced stealth threats
* The key trade-offs between agentless vs. agent-based solutions
* How Sandfly uses AI to accelerate difficult security tasks

Craig also shares his recommended reading and tips for anyone wanting to level up their Linux security skills.
