# Suprnova’s Founder Speaks: 20 Years, Many Lessons, and a YouTube Empire

Two decades ago, the torrenting world lost a legend: Suprnova.org. This pioneering file-sharing site, once a hub for millions of users, was abruptly shut down on December 19th, 2004. Today, we revisit the Suprnova story and speak with the site's founder about its lasting impact and the YouTube empire he built in recent years.

![suprnova](https://torrentfreak.com/images/suprnova-logo.png)
In the fall of 2002, [Suprnova.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprnova.org) launched as one of the first sites dedicated to sharing ‘torrents’.

At the time, Napster has just shut down, leaving a void in the file-sharing landscape. A Slovenian teenager named Andrej Preston has just discovered the new BitTorrent protocol at the time and decided to embrace it.

Andrej, commonly known under the nickname ‘Sloncek’, started Suprnova out of personal interest, as he couldn’t watch some TV-shows in his home country. Like many of these early hobby projects, it started as a very primitive setup, hosted on a Linux box at Peston’s home.

In the weeks that followed, word of the “Universal BitTorrent Source” spread like wildfire, maxing out the meager 16kb/s upload capacity of the residential internet connection. Faced with this explosive growth, Suprnova was moved to an external hosting company, with many mirror sites later helping to distribute the traffic.

## December 19, 2004: Suprnova.org Shuts Down

In record time, Suprnova became one of the most visited websites on the Internet. It became the go-to site for pirates who had discovered the unlimited sharing capacity of BitTorrent and the community that came with it. It also served as inspiration for other torrent sites that launched later, The Pirate Bay included.

20+ Years Ago…

Just as quickly as it rose to stardom, exactly twenty years ago today on December 19, 2004, [Suprnova went dark](https://torrentfreak.com/suprnovaorg-two-years-since-the-shutdown/). Initially, not much was known about the circumstances, but Andrej later said that he pulled the plug after he started reading about himself in the newspapers. Something [didn’t feel right](https://torrentfreak.com/sloncek-uncovers-the-truth-about-suprnovaorg/).

In hindsight, this was likely a pivotal decision. A month after the shutdown, police raided Andrej’s home, taking equipment and media as part of a criminal investigation. The case was closed in October 2005, but it’s not hard to see how things may have ended differently if the site had been active.

Not all decisions made at the time were great. Following the demise of Suprnova, Andrej became the spokesperson for the ambitious file-sharing software startup [eXeem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXeem), which failed miserably. The same can be said for the [relaunch of Suprnova](https://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-says-goodbye-to-suprnova-100804/) in 2009 by The Pirate Bay, which Andrej wasn’t actively involved in. That never really took off.

## Academy of Art University

Instead of focusing on new file-sharing ventures, Andrej explored his creative side. He dreamed of being in the film and TV business and wanted to study in the United States, close to LA. Eventually, he was admitted to Academy of Art University in San Francisco.

Ironically, the funds he earned from Suprnova helped him pursue this dream, but the money eventually dried up and Andrej worked as a Resident Assistant to get free room and board. Together with funds scraped together by his parents, he made it though school.

During this time, Andrej also gained experience at an online video production company, working for free. He was also the driving power and creative mind behind [TorrentFreak TV](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTvQPLQTQgA6juIgOsQiE_tUDNWLW-lWJ), which offered more room to improve his skills between 2008 and 2010. While that project stopped after two seasons, the passion for online video certainly wasn’t over.

## A YouTube Star…

Today, Andrej is the owner of “[The Infographics Show](https://www.youtube.com/%40TheInfographicsShow)” a YouTube channel with more than 14 million subscribers. The first videos were posted on Suprnova’s video portal back in 2011. There are still traces of Suprnova.org on YouTube today, as the channel’s oldest videos [display its logo in their intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjSUg6JsLYw&t=1s).

With more than a decade of YouTube experience, six billion video views, and a team that consists of nearly 200 people, Suprnova’s founder has come a long way. But what was this journey like? About time to hear his thoughts again, twenty years after he pulled the plug.

We typically don’t post interviews in full, but we gladly make an exception here for what is a truly authentic story, with remarkable depth and detail tracing back to the early days of torrents. In addition, it offers a unique perspective on copyright, online entertainment, and life in general.

**TF:** Looking back 20 years, what’s your overriding feeling about Suprnova.org? Pride, regret, something else?

**Andrej:**  *Honestly I feel like I’ve lived quite a few lives. Do I look at it with a particular feeling? It’s kind of hard to put into words. I’d say for most of my adult life, I saw it as just something that happened. It’s the only life I know.*

As I’m quickly approaching 40, I view the past with quite different eyes. I am proud of myself and the size of the project I ran starting at the age of 15. Is my view of copyrights and business in general as naive as it was back then? Absolutely no, and I wouldn’t risk doing something like that today.

But overall, in short, yeah, I am proud. I am proud of the project and who it made me today. I also feel so lucky for the life long friends I made because of it.

**TF:** The profits generated though Suprnova allowed you to study in the United States. Why did you choose the Academy of Arts in San Francisco? How did that go?

**Andrej:**  *I used all the money I made to put myself through school. I loved film & tv and I felt that, the only way to do it at the scale I dreamt of, required me move to the states. But I was never a great student.*

My grades through school were pretty much between a C and a D. I attended a Waldorf school through all my school years but even that felt like it wasn’t right for me in terms of education. So, I had to choose a school that offered a TV Producing major that had open enrollment and I really wanted to be close to LA.

I worked through the whole school process. I was a Resident Assistant for 3 out of 4 years to get room and board for free and I worked for almost two years for free as an intern at an online video production company to gain addition...
