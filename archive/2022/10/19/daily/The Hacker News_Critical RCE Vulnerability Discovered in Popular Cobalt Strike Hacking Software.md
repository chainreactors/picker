[![Cobalt Strike Hacking Software](data:image/png;base64... "Cobalt Strike Hacking Software")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXgAtwQ41j1C3dJ9RBWFxdCkF5-a-URgxLKasvXftojzUU-WZDSSLJzqPz0k2tHPQ4BXX15QYYBtzAUYHQw_0sgQqDX1xsqDvdKa7muvA4YXvW4CZbFOXKajPluOeOqoONNWk_Xep9yblJgbWzHkImJ843eyIDGKbAcxN1-xdHMc6Uda_lVaGPx4-R/s790-rw-e365/cobalt-strike.jpg)

HelpSystems, the company behind the Cobalt Strike software platform, has released an out-of-band security update to address a remote code execution vulnerability that could allow an attacker to take control of targeted systems.

Cobalt Strike is a commercial red-team framework that's mainly used for adversary simulation, but cracked versions of the software have been [actively](https://thehackernews.com/2022/10/black-basta-ransomware-hackers.html) [abused](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cobalt-strike-malleable-c2-profile/) by ransomware operators and espionage-focused advanced persistent threat (APT) groups alike.

The [post-exploitation tool](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/defining-cobalt-strike-components) consists of a team server, which functions as a command-and-control (C2) component, and a beacon, the default malware used to create a connection to the team server and drop next-stage payloads.

The issue, tracked as **CVE-2022-42948**, affects Cobalt Strike version 4.7.1, and stems from an incomplete patch released on September 20, 2022, to rectify a cross-site scripting ([XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)) vulnerability ([CVE-2022-39197](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/out-of-band-update-cobalt-strike-4-7-1/)) that could lead to remote code execution.

"The XSS vulnerability could be triggered by manipulating some client-side UI input fields, by simulating a Cobalt Strike implant check-in or by hooking a Cobalt Strike implant running on a host," IBM X-Force researchers Rio Sherri and Ruben Boonen [said](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/analysis-rce-vulnerability-cobalt-strike/) in a write-up.

However, it was found that remote code execution could be triggered in specific cases using the [Java Swing framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_%28Java%29), the graphical user interface toolkit that's used to design Cobalt Strike.

"Certain components within Java Swing will automatically interpret any text as HTML content if it starts with <html>," Greg Darwin, software development manager at HelpSystems, [explained](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/out-of-band-update-cobalt-strike-4-7-2/) in a post. "Disabling automatic parsing of HTML tags across the entire client was enough to mitigate this behavior."

[![CIS Build Kits](data:image/png;base64...)](https://thehackernews.uk/platform-shield-d)

This means that a malicious actor could exploit this behavior by means of an [HTML <object> tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object), utilizing it to load a custom payload hosted on a remote server and inject it within the [note field](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/beacon_health_check) as well as the graphical file explorer menu in the Cobalt strike UI.

"It should be noted here that this is a very powerful exploitation primitive," IBM researchers said, adding it could be used to "construct a fully featured cross-platform payload that would be able to execute code on the user's machine regardless of the operating system flavor or architecture."

The findings come a little over a week after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [cautioned](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/asa/ocio/hc3/products/index.html) of the continued weaponization of legitimate tools such as Cobalt Strike in attacks aimed at the healthcare sector.
