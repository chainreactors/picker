# Seekee Browser App is a Magnet for Movie, TV Show, and Anime Pirates

Technically speaking, any modern web browser can stream pirated movies and TV shows, but some make it easier than others. The Seekee app, available on iOS and indirectly on Android, markets itself as a browser with AI capabilities and fast video streaming. The latter stands out, as pirated content is surprisingly easy to find and is organized for optimal viewing pleasure. But at what cost?

The internet has made video entertainment more accessible than ever before. With plenty of legal streaming services releasing new content every week, there’s no shortage of options.

While this is good news, choice brings its own difficulties. Because there are a myriad of legal options available today, paying several monthly subscription fees can become a costly endeavor. As a result, pirate streaming sites and services are thriving.

Hollywood and other copyright holders are trying to tackle this problem through enforcement. This has resulted in both large crackdowns and smaller successes, but new threats are always lurking around the corner. Sometimes they pop up in unexpected places.

## A Piracy Optimized Browser?

Browser app Seekee has attracted quite a lot of attention recently, particularly on social media where people have noticed that the app is surprisingly good at accessing pirated content.

The app advertises itself as a fast and safe browser with built-in AI capabilities. While that sounds intriguing, the true appeal appears to lie in its entertainment offering, which is accessible via a single click on the “movies and series” and “animes” tabs.

*Seekee*

These tabs take users to an overview of trending content, which can be watched instantly. There’s no indication that Seekee hosts any of the content it links to, but videos from third-party pirated sources are conveniently organized.

In fact, trying to find links to legal alternatives is quite a challenge. When we [searched for](https://torrentfreak.com/images/laststream.jpg) “The Last of Us”, we had to scroll down past a list of pirate sources, before the Wikipedia and IMDb entries [finally appeared](https://torrentfreak.com/images/lastwikif.jpg).

For good measure, users can also watch the offerings listed by streaming platform, including Netflix, Prime Video, and Max, but links to these official services are not presented anywhere near the top of results.

*Hot Streaming*

The videos we checked were being streamed from the unknown h5.swplayer.com domain and similar variants. In addition to subtitles and original audio, many videos are also available with Portuguese and Spanish audio. This may explain why the app is particularly popular in Latin America, both on social media and in [the press](https://www.adslzone.net/noticias/operadores/operadores-ofrecen-router-wifi-7-gratis-0425/).

## Google Play & iOS App Store

When we started writing this article, the Seekee app had five million downloads in the Google Play store, most of which were added this month. However, it appears that this exposure turned out to be too much. The app was [deleted without explanation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enzo.paulo&hl=en), possibly following rightsholder complaints. APK versions are still floating around, however.

*Update: a new Seekee appeared in the Play Store. As noted below, there are many reasons to avoid these types of apps, including copyright, privacy, and security.*

*Five Million Users… Gone*

In the iOS store, Seekee [remains available](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seekee-safe-fast-browser/id6741893485) for now, listed as a fast and safe browser with intelligent search, AI creation, and multimedia processing. That includes the aforementioned streaming options.

“Easily search for movies and TV resources across the entire network and get accurate and reliable results. With a massive library updated daily, you can seamlessly access entertainment anytime, anywhere,” the iOS listing reads.

*Update: Apple removed the Seekee app*

*Seekee in the App Store*

The app is published by the Chinese company Xiji Information Technology Co., Ltd, which also has a [web presence](https://seekeeweb.com/) with a privacy policy and user agreement. We reached out to the company requesting additional information on its unique offering, but we didn’t hear back.

## At What Cost?

Aside from copyright concerns, using new apps from unknown developers always comes with risks. In this case, the privacy policy mentions that users have to give up a lot of information, including the following selection of data;

*Advertising IDs, cookies, identifiers, IP addresses, social media IDs and profile pictures, IMEI/OAID, GAID numbers, IMSI numbers, MAC addresses, serial numbers, system versions and types, ROM versions, Android versions, Android ID, Space ID, SIM card operator and region, screen display information, device model name, activation time, network operator, connection type, hardware details, sales channels, CPU data, storage info, battery usage, screen resolution, temperature, camera model, and wake/unlock frequency.*

Again, that’s just a selection, there [is more](https://seekeeweb.com/doc/Privacy_Policy). And that’s only what is disclosed, there may be more dangerous things going on in the background, including broad phone-related permissions. Seekee 1.5.3 had permission to access the phone camera, call log, and external storage, among other things.

This is a lot of data, and it may very well explain why the app is free; the user and their data are the product.

It is hardly groundbreaking for apps like these to attract millions of users, with help from social media. However, the people who fall for the hype should be aware of the potential risks, dangers, and trade-offs, especially if they are not bombarded by ads.

At the end of the day, someone is making money from the app. In this case, it’s not the people who make the films, series and anime, but some unknown people in a land far, far away.
