### This tools is very helpful for finding [vulnerabilities](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/vulnerabilities "vulnerabilities") present in the Web ***Applications***.

* A web application scanner explores a web application by crawling through its web pages and examines it for security vulnerabilities, which involves generation of malicious inputs and evaluation of application's responses.

+ These scanners are automated tools that scan web applications to look for security vulnerabilities. They test web applications for common security problems such as [cross-site scripting](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Cross-site%20Scripting "cross-site scripting") (XSS), SQL injection, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
+ This scanner uses different tools like nmap, dnswalk, dnsrecon, dnsenum, dnsmap etc in order to scan ports, sites, hosts and network to find vulnerabilites like OpenSSL CCS Injection, Slowloris, Denial of Service, etc.
