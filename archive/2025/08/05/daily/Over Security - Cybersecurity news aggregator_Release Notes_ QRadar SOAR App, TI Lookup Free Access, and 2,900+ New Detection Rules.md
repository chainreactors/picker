Release Notes: QRadar SOAR App, TI Lookup Free Access, and 2,900+ New Detection Rules

July brought powerful new updates to help your SOC catch threats faster, reduce manual effort, and make more confident decisions, right inside your existing workflows. From fresh integrations to better detection coverage, these changes are built to support your team every step of the way.

In this update:

* New **IBM QRadar SOAR integration** to automate investigations and speed up response

* Launch of a free **TI Lookup** plan, giving all users access to live attack data from 15K SOCs

* New **Debian ARM VM** for analyzing malware targeting IoT and embedded systems

* Expanded detection with **163 new behavior signatures**, **13 YARA rules**, and **2,772 Suricata rules**

Keep reading to explore what’s new and how these updates can improve your daily workflows and threat visibility.

## Product Updates

## IBM QRadar SOAR Integration: Faster, Smarter Incident Response

We’ve officially launched the [**ANY.RUN app for IBM QRadar SOAR**](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ibm-qradar-soar-anyrun-integration/), helping SOC teams move faster, reduce manual effort, and make smarter decisions without leaving their existing workflows.

With this integration, analysts can detonate suspicious files and URLs in [ANY.RUN’s interactive sandbox](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_july_25&utm_term=040825&utm_content=linktolanding) directly from QRadar SOAR, and get verdicts, behavioral logs, and IOCs pushed back into the incident automatically. This not only speeds up triage, but also cuts Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) and reduces the risk of missing stealthy threats.

You can also enrich key indicators using [ANY.RUN’s Threat Intelligence Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=release_notes_july_25&utm_term=040825&utm_content=linktotilookup), pulling in fresh, real-world threat context from live malware samples observed across 15,000+ organizations.

### What Your Team Gains: Business and Operational Impact

The new IBM QRadar SOAR integration delivers **real performance and value across your SOC**. By combining automated sandbox detonation with live threat intelligence enrichment, ANY.RUN helps security teams reduce alert fatigue, move faster, and make better-informed decisions.

* **Lower workload and faster response:** Automation cuts down manual triage and enrichment, letting analysts focus on critical threats, not routine tasks.

* **Improved efficiency across tiers:** Tier 1 and Tier 2 analysts benefit from streamlined investigation and escalation, while senior staff gain the bandwidth to focus on strategy and tuning.

* **Smarter decisions, better processes:** Sandbox reports and TI Lookup insights feed directly into playbooks and detection rules, driving continuous improvement.

* **Early visibility into stealthy threats:** Real-time behavioral data exposes multi-stage and evasive attacks that traditional tools often miss.

* **Stronger ROI from existing tools:** The integration adds powerful behavioral context to your SOAR workflows, without requiring new infrastructure or steep learning curves.

### How to Get Started

Getting started is easy, just install the [**ANY.RUN app from IBM App Exchange**](https://apps.xforce.ibmcloud.com/extension/06dbb4c6b59fc59ed9c277b0bb1a3f7d) and connect your account using an API key. You can enable sandbox analysis, Threat Intelligence Lookup, or both, depending on your workflow.
