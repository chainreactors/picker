# Weekly Update 467

31 August 2025

Using AI to analyse photos and send alerts if I've forgotten to take the bins out isn't going to revolutionise my life, no more so than using it to describe who's at the mailbox when a letter arrives and at the front door when they buzz. But that's really not the point; it's by playing with tech like this that firstly, you come to understand it better and secondly, you find *genuinely* impactful use cases. I keep scratching my head to try to work out where AI can do something *really* useful in HIBP and little exercises like throwing it into the home automation help get that part of the brain working. No epiphanies as yet, unfortunately. Got any good ideas?
