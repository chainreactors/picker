Top Email Security Risks for Businesses and How to Catch Them Before They Cause Damage

Even with all the new ways we stay in touch, Slack, Teams, DMs, email is still the backbone of business communication. That also makes it one of the easiest ways in for attackers.

A single message with the right subject line or attachment can lead to stolen logins, malware infections, or even full network access. It happens so fast that many employees don’t notice until it’s too late.

Let’s take a closer look at the most common security risks businesses face when it comes to email, and what you can do to avoid falling into those traps.

## Why Email is Still a Big Risk for Businesses

For security teams, email is often the most unpredictable part of the attack surface. Firewalls, EDR, and filters help but one convincing message can still get through.

Here are a few reasons why email remains a top security concern:

* **It’s too familiar:** Employees open dozens (or hundreds) of emails a day. One click on a fake invoice or calendar invite is all it takes.

* **Threats are getting smarter:** Attackers use trusted services like SharePoint or QR codes. They design malware that doesn’t trigger alerts.

* **Some attacks don’t need clicks:** Zero-click exploits can launch as soon as the message is previewed.

* **Traditional tools miss behavior:** Filters and antivirus might scan attachments, but they don’t show what the file *does* once it’s opened.

To reduce risk, businesses need visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes; what gets triggered, what connects where, and what the real intent is.

[Sandboxes like ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=email_security_risks&utm_term=240725&utm_content=linktolanding) makes that possible. It lets security teams safely detonate suspicious emails and watch every step of the attack before it reaches users or spreads across the network.

## Check Out Real Email Attacks That Target Businesses Now

The following real-world cases, captured inside ANY.RUN’s sandbox, show how today’s most common email threats actually unfold. From malware-laced attachments to zero-click exploits, these examples reveal the tactics that put businesses at risk every day.

### 1. Malware Attachments: A Hidden Threat in Everyday Emails

Malware-laced attachments remain one of the most effective ways for attackers to break into corporate systems. According to Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Report, more than 50% of successful email-based attacks involved malicious attachments, often disguised as invoices, contracts, or shipping documents. All it takes is one click from a distracted employee.

These files can open the door to data theft, ransomware, and full system compromise.

Here’s a real-world example that shows exactly how this happens, captured in an ANY.RUN sandbox session where the entire attack chain unfolds in front of you.

[***Real Case: A Dangerous PDF That Looks Legit***](https://app.any.run/tasks/ee027b22-dca2-480c-a217-60e8f6c90f7e/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=email_security_risks&utm_term=240725&utm_content=linktoservice)

In this analysis, the file is named Rauscher-Fahrzeugeinrichtungen.pdf; harmless enough at first glance. But once opened, it immediately starts reaching out to a [phishing](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/phising-types-of-attacks/) page hosted on SharePoint. That’s your first red flag.

Why SharePoint? Because it’s a legitimate Microsoft domain, often trusted by corporate environments. Hosting a phishing link there increases the chance of bypassing security filters and convincing the user to trust it.
