# Marvel Wants Reddit to Expose Mods Suspected of Ant-Man 3 Leak

In January, a month before Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was released in theaters, a link to a leaked script was posted on the Marvel Studios Spoilers subreddit. Last Friday, a Marvel Studios affiliate filed DMCA subpoena applications to compel Reddit and Google to expose the leakers. One named user account is shared among the subreddit's moderator team. Court documents indicate the plan is to force Reddit to expose them all.

On February 17, 2023, Marvel’s [Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania](https://www.marvel.com/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania) officially kicked off ‘Phase 5’ of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Distributed by Disney to lukewarm reviews, the movie took $105 million at the box office in its first week and then plummeted 70% to $32 million in week two.

Thanks to a leak posted online around a month before the movie’s theatrical debut, some fans already had an idea of how the movie would play out. Marvel’s pursuit of the leakers is likely to have a storyline all of its own.

## MVL Film Finance LLC Targets Google

When MVL Film Finance LLC (MVL) was incorporated in 2004/5, its purpose was to finance Marvel Studios’ production of 10 “live-action or animated films” based on up to 10 of Marvel’s comic book characters. Several related business entities, including Marvel Studios and parent company Marvel Entertainment, are owned by The Walt Disney Company.

Last Friday at the United States District for the Northern District of California, Marvel Studios’ submitted a declaration in support of a DMCA subpoena application targeting Google. Matthew Slatoff, Marvel’s Vice President, Global Security & Content Protection, informed the Court that his responsibilities include monitoring and addressing infringement of MVL Film Finance’s rights.

According to Slatoff’s declaration, on January 21, a Disney anti-piracy analyst submitted a copyright infringement notice to Google after discovering that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania content had been uploaded to systems operated by Google, without MVL’s authorization. The takedown notice, submitted via Google’s webform, contained a prompt from Google and a response from the rightsholder.

Identify and describe the copyrighted work: *Unreleased leaked script of the new Disney movie Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania.*

Marvel supplied a docs.google.com/document/ URL as the location for the allegedly infringing content. The content no longer exists at that location.

On January 23, Disney’s analyst received confirmation that while the takedown notice had been received by Google, the company wasn’t able to take any content down. Sometime during the previous couple of days the file had already been removed, leaving Google with nothing to do.

That didn’t mean the document couldn’t be retrieved from elsewhere, however.

## The Document Detailed in the DMCA Subpoenas

The document in question reveals a few interesting details. It’s 63 pages long, and in an introduction written by an unidentified person, the ‘script’ text is attributed to screenwriter [Jeff Loveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Loveness) and described as “translated dialogue.”

The script was edited and/or displayed in a Portuguese web interface, but since both Portugal and Brazil are mentioned in the source, neither can be ruled in or out. Other evidence points to the likelihood that the text was intended for use in subtitles. A date reference is also interesting.

The Reddit thread mentioned in the document is [still online](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/yckepo/tales_from_the_mod_queue_quantumania_plot_leak/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). It provides a number of spoilers but doesn’t carry any text from the leak.

The ‘leaked’ document Marvel is interested in mentions the Reddit thread above as being two months old at the time the document was written or edited. Both DMCA subpoena applications seek information relating to Google and Reddit users and their alleged activities between January 15 to February 15, 2023.

The timeframe seems relevant; around January 20 it was reported that the entire plot of the movie had [been leaked online](https://bgr.com/entertainment/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-subtitles-leak-spoils-the-films-entire-plot/).

While that ties in with the newer Reddit thread, the older Reddit thread suggests a much earlier plot leak, around October 2022. Substantial plot leaks date back [even further than that](https://web.archive.org/web/20220711000557/https%3A//www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/vw4iki/quantumania_plot_leak_from_danielrpk/) but nothing on the scale of an entire script.

## MVL Wants Reddit to Unmask Leakers

When information about the script/subtitle file was posted on Reddit mid-January, leak-loving Marvel fans were both excited and impressed. “Yeah this is some next level leak” and “This legit might be the biggest leak in this subs history” set the tone, but the fun didn’t last.

A moderator of the subreddit commented that since the information was receiving copyright notices, any “future sharing of the material will result in a ban.”

The thread is [still live today](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/10hj44a/tftmq_antman_and_the_wasp_quantumania_detailed/) and there’s no doubt that Marvel is aware of it.

[![reddit-next-level-leak](https://torrentfreak.com/images/reddit-next-level-leak-1.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/reddit-next-level-leak-1.png)

The DMCA subpoena application specifically mentions the thread alongside an email from Reddit’s legal team, which had previously agreed to take the infringing content down.

In common with the takedown notice sent to Google, the allegedly infringing content may have been deleted before Reddit could remove it. There’s no mention of a copyright complaint, instead the post notes, “Sorry, this post was deleted by the person who originally posted it.”
