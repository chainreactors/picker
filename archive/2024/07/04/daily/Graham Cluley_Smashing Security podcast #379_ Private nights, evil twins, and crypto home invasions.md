Apps can let you spy on strangers in bars, a gang of cryptocurrency thieves turns to kidnap and assault, and have you joined the mile-high evil twin club?

All this and much much more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by Mark Stockley of the brand-new [‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast](https://theaifix.show) (co-hosted with Graham!).

Talk about nepotism.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
