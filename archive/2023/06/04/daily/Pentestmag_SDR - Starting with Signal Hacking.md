# SDR - Starting with Signal Hacking

Not all sensible data is exposed on the Internet through the IP transport layer. Some particular data are transmitted using radio waves or frequencies that are needed for specific types of attacks for this new perimeter, much different considering our normal ethical hacker activities (we cannot use NMAP for example in order to do first analysis based on the network because we have no IP layer as mentioned before). In order to reduce the attack perimeter in this new situation, some companies don’t allow their employees to have devices that can meddle with computer range. But, first of all, can we define radio frequencies in order to speak about that argument without any blunder?

Following Wikipedia’s official page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio\_frequency), Radio frequency (identified even as RF) is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage, or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz. This type of signal is distributed through coaxial cable or it is spread in space directly. This wave spread is called carrier wave, a sinusoidal signal with known frequency, amplitude and phase characteristics, modified by a modulating signal, digital or analog; in detail:

Analog modulation, where the analog signal (sinusoidal wave signal) is used as a carrier wave that modulates the message signal or data signal

Digital modulation, very similar to analog modulation but this is a signal of discrete amplitude whose values....
