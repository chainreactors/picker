2024-11-24 (SUNDAY): "REDTAIL" BASH SCRIPT FOR LINUX MALWARE HOSTED ON 45.202.35[.]190

NOTES:

- This is my investigation from a sample of "redtail" bash script pushed by scans/probes hitting one of my webservers.
- After downloading an ELF for the proper CPU architecture, the initial bash script changes the name of the ELF to ".redtail"
- I've noticed versions of this script for several months now, so I wanted to see traffic generated from an infection.
- The initial URL hosting the Redtail bash script at hxxp[:]//45.202.35[.]190/sh has been active as early as 2024-11-23 at
  21:28 UTC.
