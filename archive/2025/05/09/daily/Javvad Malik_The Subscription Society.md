4 Minutes

In the quaint town of Everyville, USA, Sarah starts her day with a familiar routine. She wakes up in her rented apartment, checks her phone (leased through her mobile plan), and streams her favourite morning playlist on Spotify. As she sips her coffee, brewed from beans delivered monthly by a subscription service, Sarah reflects on how different her life is from her parents’ at her age. They owned their home, their car, even their music collection. Sarah, on the other hand, seems to own very little. Welcome to the subscription economy, where ownership is passé, and access is king.

This shift from ownership to subscription isn’t just about Netflix and Spotify. It’s a fundamental reimagining of our relationship with the things we use and consume.

Consider the case of Rent the Runway, a service that allows women to rent designer dresses for special occasions. What began as a niche offering has exploded into a $1 billion business. Women who once saved for months to buy a single designer piece now have access to an ever-rotating wardrobe of high-end fashion. It’s the democratization of luxury, but it comes with a twist: these women never actually own the clothes they wear.

But why stop at clothes? In Japan, a country known for its innovative solutions to urban living, you can now rent a family. Yes, you read that correctly. Companies like Family Romance offer actors who can play the role of family members for various occasions. Need a father figure for a school event? A girlfriend to impress your colleagues? In this brave new world, even relationships can be subscribed to.

The subscription model has even infiltrated the world of fine art. Companies like Turning Art allow subscribers to rotate curated artworks in their homes or offices. Gone are the days when owning art was the exclusive domain of the wealthy. Now, for a monthly fee, anyone can play at being a collector, swapping out Picassos (well, prints of Picassos) as easily as changing their socks.

Speaking of socks, let’s not forget about Blacksocks, a Swiss company that will send you a fresh pair of socks every month. It’s a solution to a problem you probably didn’t know you had, but it speaks to the heart of the subscription economy: the promise of convenience, novelty, and freedom from the burdens of ownership.

But perhaps the most striking example of this trend comes from the world of agriculture. Farmers, long seen as the epitome of ownership culture (after all, what’s more fundamental than owning the land you work?), are now subscribing to their tractors. John Deere, the agricultural machinery giant, has begun offering tractors as a service. Farmers pay for the use of the tractor, complete with software updates and maintenance, rather than owning the machine outright.

This shift has profound implications. On one hand, it offers flexibility and access to the latest technology without the burden of large capital investments. On the other, it raises questions about autonomy and control. When a farmer doesn’t own their tractor, who really controls the harvest?

As we weave through these examples, from rented dresses to subscribed socks to leased tractors, a pattern emerges. The subscription economy is not just about convenience; it’s about a fundamental shift in our relationship with the material world. We’re moving from a society of owners to a society of users.

This transition echoes the shift Sarah experienced in her morning routine. Her parents’ generation found security and identity in ownership. A house, a car, a record collection – these were not just possessions, but markers of achievement and personality. Sarah’s generation, by contrast, finds its identity in experiences and access. Why own a car when you can use a ride-sharing app? Why buy a house when you can rent a fully-furnished apartment in any city you choose?

But as we embrace this new paradigm, we must also grapple with its implications. In a world where everything is rented, subscribed to, or accessed temporarily, what becomes of the stability and autonomy that ownership once provided? When we own nothing, do we risk becoming dependent on the companies that provide these services?

As Sarah finishes her coffee and prepares to leave for work (in a shared electric scooter, naturally), she pauses to consider this new world she inhabits. She may not own much, but she has access to more than her parents could have dreamed of at her age. Is this freedom? Or a new kind of constraint?

The answer, like Sarah’s wardrobe from Rent the Runway, is likely to change with the seasons. But one thing is certain: the subscription economy is here to stay, transforming not just what we have, but who we are. As we navigate this brave new world, we would do well to remember that while we may subscribe to services, we should never subscribe to complacency about the world we’re creating.

In the end, whether we’re renting families in Tokyo or tractors in Iowa, we’re all participants in a grand experiment. The question is, will we shape this new economy, or will it shape us? As Sarah steps out into the morning sun, ready to face another day in the subscription society, that question hangs in the air, unanswered but ever-present, like a notification on a rented smartphone, waiting to be addressed.
