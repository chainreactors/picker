How many times do you pull out your driver’s license a week? Maybe two to four times to purchase age restricted items, pick up prescriptions, or go to a bar. If you get a mobile driver’s license (mDL) or other forms of digital identification (ID) being offered in Google and Apple wallets, you may have to share this information much more often than before, because this new technology may expand the scope of scenarios demanding your ID.

These mDLs and digital IDs are being deployed faster than states can draft privacy protections, including for presenting your ID to more third parties than ever before. While proponents of these digital schemes emphasize a convenience factor, these IDs can easily expand into new territories like controversial [age verification bills that censor everyone](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/age-verification-mandates-would-undermine-anonymity-online). Moreover, digital ID is simultaneously being tested in sensitive situations, and expanded into a potential regime of unprecedented data tracking.

In the digital ID space, the question of “how can we do this right?” often usurps the more pertinent question of “should we do this at all?” While there are [highly recommended](https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-identity) safeguards for these new technologies, we must always support each person’s right to choose to continue using physical documentation instead of going digital. Also, we must do more to bring understanding and decision power over these technologies to all, overzealously promoting them as a potential equalizer.
