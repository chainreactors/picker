In episode 36 of The AI Fix, Graham and Mark take a long look at DeepSeek, an upstart AI out of China that was trained on a shoestring, shook up Wall Street, kneecapped Nvidia, and challenged America‚Äôs AI hegemony.

Graham also discovers a remarkably f\*\*\*ing effective way to remove AI snippets, a personal mobility robot gets a bit over-excited, some aliens regret installing an FTP server, and Mark explains what o3-mini owes to Spinal Tap.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
