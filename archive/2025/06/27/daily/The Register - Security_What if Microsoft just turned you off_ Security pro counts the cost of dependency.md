Comment A sharply argued blog post warns that heavy reliance on Microsoft poses serious strategic risks for organizations – a viewpoint unlikely to win favor with Redmond or its millions of corporate customers.

Czech developer and pen-tester Miloslav Homer has an interesting take on reducing an organization's exposure to security risks. In an article headlined "[Microsoft dependency has risks](https://blog.miloslavhomer.cz/p/microsoft-dependency-has-risks)," he extends the now familiar arguments in favor of [improving digital sovereignty](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/09/open_source_policy_summit/), and [reducing dependence](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/) on American cloud services.

The argument is quite long but closely reasoned. We recommend resisting the knee-jerk reaction of "don't be ridiculous" and closing the tab, but reading his article and giving it serious consideration. He backs up his argument with plentiful links and references, and it's gratifying to see several stories from *The Register* among them, including [one from the FOSS desk](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/...
