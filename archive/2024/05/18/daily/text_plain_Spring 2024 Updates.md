# Spring 2024 Updates

Posted by[ericlaw](https://textslashplain.com/author/ericlaw1979/)[2024-05-172024-05-20](https://textslashplain.com/2024/05/17/spring-2024-updates/)Posted in[life](https://textslashplain.com/category/life/), [running](https://textslashplain.com/category/life/running/), [travel](https://textslashplain.com/category/life/travel/)

After a slow and painful [2024 Cap10K](https://textslashplain.com/2024/04/09/a-slow-10k/), I ran the [HEB Sunshine Run 10K](https://www.austinsunshinerun.com/) on May 5th in [1:05:53](https://www.mychiptime.com/searchevent.php?id=15674&bib=1989), just 22 seconds faster, but without pain or surprises. After months without running several hours per week, my fitness has definitely fallen off a cliff. I either need to get back to the treadmill or restart the bike. Or maybe the rower? I’ve been feeling both busy and lazy.

The afternoon after the Sunshine Run, my sons and I adopted two 6mo kittens, eventually settling on the names Luna and Tigra. They’re super-cute and lots of fun. I would wish that I’d gotten a new cat sooner ([I had promised my kids Thanksgiving 2021](https://textslashplain.com/2020/11/16/objectively-the-best-cat/)), except that these two are so wonderful that I’m glad I waited.

I need a big trip to look forward to. Originally, I thought this was going to be [Aconcagua](https://57hours.com/review/aconcagua-rock-climbing/), but it’s a three+ week commitment and that seems like it would be hard to swing for work. I’ve back-burnered Aconcagua now, thinking that I will perhaps try to do it if I make it to 2028 at Microsoft, when I’ll be eligible for an 8-week sabbatical. I may still take a [short trip up Mount Shasta](https://www.rei.com/adventures/trips/weekend/shasta-climb-south.html) in Spring 2025, a leftover step in my plan to train (and learn/test gear) for Aconcagua.

With Aconcagua out, I need another big plan, and I’ve settled on doing Kilimanjaro again, this time the northern [“Grand Traverse” route](https://www.thomsontreks.com/route/the-grand-traverse/#itinerary) to see some new trails and to enjoy a slightly fancier tent. I’ll be going with a friend the last week of 2025 — plenty of time for us to get in shape. And get in shape I must, because I’m currently signed up for the Dash Dash 10K and the Run for the Water 10 Miler this fall, and the 2025 3M Half Marathon, 2025 Cap10K, and the 2025 Galveston Marathon. I think it’s unlikely that I’ll (ever) be in full-Marathon shape, so my current plan is to run the first half and speed-walk the second. :)

In terms of *family* trips, this summer I’ll be going on a cruise to Bermuda, Bahamas, and Royal Caribbean’s private island waterpark with my kids, parents, and brother’s family. It’s a 9-day voyage on older and [smaller ship](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/cruise-ships/vision-of-the-seas), so we’ll have to entertain each other. :)
