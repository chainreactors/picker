***The Customer Engagement Partner Academy is now offered in a convenient, anytime format***

*![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/10/289620_GettyImages-1214001332_small.jpg)*

Partners are crucial to SAP‚Äôs success, and there are many factors that help partners thrive in their SAP business. One key factor is building lifetime value with customers. This is the primary role of the customer engagement executive, or CEE.

The partner CEE‚Äôs focus is to connect with cloud customers on a deeper level, ensuring they get the most from their SAP investment over time. The CEE serves as an advisor and guide, proactively checking in on customers to provide insight as they grow with their SAP solution.

Through the Customer Engagement Partner Academy, SAP gives partner CEEs access to experts, best practices and tools to build their own successful customer engagement practice. As of October 2022, CEEs can now access the academy on-demand in the [SAP Learning Rooms](https://jam2.sapjam.com/groups/xuXgMdJ4DYtHvWvesPK2nw/overview_page/Gb65wyl1lmNUT40WPlr8Ly).

As with the live virtual academy, CEEs will need to complete a¬†[Partner CEE training](https://learning-journeys-prod.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/learning-journeys/overview?role=CEE)¬†for an SAP solution of their choice prior to enrolling in the on-demand Customer Engagement Partner Academy.¬† Once the academy is completed, the CEE has the opportunity to demonstrate their competence and receive a digital badge to share on their social profiles.

‚Äú**Exceptional!‚Äù ‚ÄúWell Done!‚Äù ‚ÄúEnriching!‚Äù The Customer Engagement Partner Academy Wins Rave Reviews**

In just five months, more than 1,350 partner CEEs participated in the location-based virtual academies in 2022, with Germany leading the way with 359 attendees.

The four-part training was productive and well received. Here are a few quotes from participants:
> *‚ÄúI**t was very well done and provided a lot of useful information and tools for the CEE role. Thank you for having this enablement session available.‚Äù*
>
> *‚ÄúIt is a very good opportunity and the training is very enriching."*
>
> *‚ÄúI really like the academy because it‚Äôs very practical and contains a lot of tools where I can start.‚Äù*
>
> *‚ÄúThe presenters were exceptional.¬† They were happy, personable, and used their experience as CEEs to share knowledge and provide personal experience.¬† I loved the academy.‚Äù*
