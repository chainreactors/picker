Delta Air Lines is suing CrowdStrike in a bid to recover the circa $500 million in estimated lost revenue months after the cybersecurity company "caused" an infamous global IT outage.

Delta, a major US carrier, was among the most vocal victims of the outage in July, reporting thousands of canceled flights which affected more than a million customers, and explored legal avenues to recoup the lost funds early on, [hiring David Boies](https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/30/crowdstrike_delta_microsoft_lawsuit/) of Boies Schiller Flexner.

Delta had to cancel about 7,000 flights over the five-day period from July 19 to July 24 – a huge disruption hitting around 1.3 million customers and leading to multiple class-action lawsuits from affected passengers.
