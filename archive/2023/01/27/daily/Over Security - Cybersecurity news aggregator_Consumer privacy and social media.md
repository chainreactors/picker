# Consumer privacy and social media

Posted: January 25, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Looking at the privacy related stories of 2022, it’s not hard to see that much of the focus was on the social media giants. [Banning TikTok](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/12/indiana-sues-tiktok-describes-it-as-chinese-trojan-horse) is slowly becoming a trend among US states. [Google and Facebook](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/01/google-and-facebook-fined-240-million-for-making-cookies-hard-to-refuse)’s owner [Meta](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/11/mega-facebook-data-breach-sees-meta-fined-277m) was fined on several occasions for amounts that would have put other companies out of business, and Twitter fell victim to a power struggle that made victims left and right.

## Social media

The problem for social media users is that there will always be voices telling them it’s their own fault. But is it really? Can you blame users for being unable to stop using apps that have algorithms which are fine-tuned to a tee to keep them hooked. Social media platforms like TikTok are designed to serve you the content you have shown an interest in. The result? According to [research](https://headphonesaddict.com/teen-kids-screen-time-statistics/), the average American teenager spends 7 hours and 22 minutes on their phone every day.

For many users, social media is a way to stay in touch with people to a level that would be impossible if they have to resort to physical contact or even phonecalls. For others, social media a way of showing the fruits of their creativity. For some, it’s a way of keeping up with current events, some of which is fake news.

It’s easy to tell social media users that they are responsible for providing their personal data themselves. In a breach you can point at the company that was supposed to keep your data safe, but when it comes to social media you are expected to read hundreds of pages of legalese and understand that the platforms will share your data with third parties.

For companies, social media platforms have become invaluable tools in education, marketing and communication. Stop using them and you are giving the advantage to your competition, allowing them to take your place.

## Cookies and advertising

Internet giants like Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Alphabet (Google) depend on advertising. Advertising represented 98% of Facebook’s $86 billion revenue in 2020, and more than 80% of Alphabet’s revenue comes from Google ads, which generated $147 billion in 2020.

Now that awareness, regulation, and tools to control [cookies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/computer/what-are-tracking-cookies) have become mainstream, these advertising moguls have started looking at other ways to capitalize on their user numbers. Google has started experimenting with its [FLoC alternative](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/04/millions-of-chrome-users-quietly-added-to-googles-floc-pilot) and others have looked at alternatives like [TrustPID](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/06/trustpid-is-another-worrying-imperfect-attempt-to-replace-tracking-cookies).

## Harvesting data

Social networking companies harvest huge amounts of sensitive data about their users’ activities, interests, personal characteristics, political views, purchasing habits, and online behavior. A...
