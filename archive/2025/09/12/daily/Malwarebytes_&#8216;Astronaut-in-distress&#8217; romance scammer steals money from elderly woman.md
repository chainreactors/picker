# ‘Astronaut-in-distress’ romance scammer steals money from elderly woman

Posted: September 11, 2025

A Japanese octogenarian from Hokkaido Island lost thousands of dollars after being scammed by someone who described himself as a desperate astronaut in need of help.

According to [Hokkaidō Broadcasting](https://www.hbc.co.jp/news/d9ebf3a9f4ea7f4d9f9cca5fb0e8ad4a.htm), police in Sapporo say the fraudster contacted the woman on social media in July. After several weeks of exchanging messages, the ‘astronaut’ claimed he was under attack in space and asked her to send money for “life-saving oxygen” through prepaid systems at five different convenience stores in the city.

The money requests escalated as the woman got more romantically attached to the scammer, resulting in a total loss of around 1 million Yen (US$6,700). At that point she told her family and reported the scam to the police.

Romance scammers typically target individuals on social media or online dating platforms, building trust over time, before convincing victims to send money, personal information, or valuable items—sometimes to help the scammer launder funds or goods.

These scams have grown significantly in recent years, driven by the widespread [loneliness epidemic](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf) and the increase in online activity.

Police in Sapporo’s Teine district are now treating the case as a romance scam and have warned residents to be cautious of similar social media encounters.

## How to s**tay safe from romance scammers**

It’s very easy to look at a case like this and think “How could they not know they were being scammed?” But anyone can fall for a scam, especially as scammers get more and more sophisticated and their use of AI increases.

Here are some tips to stay safe:

* Don’t send money or disclose [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) to anyone you have never met in person.
* Take it slow and read back answers. Scammers usually have a playbook, but sometimes you can spot inconsistencies in their answers.
* Cut them off early. As soon as you expect you are dealing with a scammer, stop responding. Don’t fall for sob stories or even physical threats they’ll use to keep the connection alive.
* Check their profile picture using an online search. You may find other profiles with the same picture (a huge red flag) or even reports of scammers using that picture.
* If they ask you to move to another platform to chat, this is another red flag. They are not doing this for privacy reasons, but to stay under the radar of the platform where they first contacted you.
* Consult with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide an objective opinion if you’re offered an investment opportunity.
* Share examples (anonymized) to help others. One way to do this is to use [Malwarebytes Scam Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/solutions/scam-guard), which also helps you assess if a message is a scam or not.
* Don’t do this alone. If you have any doubts, share your concerns with someone in your life that you trust. Their perspective may keep your feet on the ground.
* If you encounter something suspicious, report it to the appropriate authorities—such as local law enforcement or the FBI via its [Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/). Your actions could...
