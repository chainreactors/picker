US security leaders have urged lawmakers to reauthorize two key pieces of cyber legislation, including one that facilitates threat-intel sharing between the private sector and federal government, before they expire at the end of the month.

The House Homeland Security Committee advanced both bills during a [markup session](https://homeland.house.gov/hearing/full-committee-markup-10/) on Wednesday, but little time remains to have them signed into law despite infosec luminaries deeming them [critical components of US national security](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/cisa_cuts_threat_intel/).

"The federal government needs to be able to collaborate closely and efficiently with the private sector to secure critical infrastructure against cyber actors attempting to preposition destructive capabilities in our systems," [said](https://homeland.house.gov/2025/09/03/cyber-leaders-across-sectors-endorse-homeland-republicans-legislation-to-extend-reform-critical-tools-before-they-expire/) retired US Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, who also serves as senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation.
