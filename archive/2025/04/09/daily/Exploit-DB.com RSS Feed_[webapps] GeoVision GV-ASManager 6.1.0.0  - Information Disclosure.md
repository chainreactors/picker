Information disclosure vulnerability in Geovision GV-ASManager web application with version v6.1.0.0 or less.

Requirements
To perform successful attack an attacker requires:
- GeoVision ASManager version 6.1.0.0 or less
- Network access to the GV-ASManager web application (there are cases when there are public access)
- Access to Guest account (enabled by default), or any low privilege account (Username: Guest; Password: <blank>)

Impact
The vulnerability can be leveraged to perform the following unauthorized actions:
A low privilege account is able to:
- Enumerate user accounts
- Retrieve cleartext password of any account in GV-ASManager.
After reusing the retrieved password, an attacker will be able to:
- Access the resources such as monitoring cameras, access cards, parking cars, employees and visitors, etc.
- Make changes in data and service network configurations such as employees, access card security information, IP addresses and configurations, etc.
- Disrupt and disconnect services such as monitoring cameras, access controls.
- Clone and duplicate access control data for further attack scenarios.
- Reusing retrieved password in other digital assets of the organization.

##### About The Exploit Database

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in ...
