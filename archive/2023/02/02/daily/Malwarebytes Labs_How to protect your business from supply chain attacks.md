## How to protect your business from supply chain attacks

February 1, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

Threat actors know that attacking the supply chain is not just a smart strategy but also a winning one.

When American store Target found a Trojan designed to steal card details on its POS (point-of-sale) systems in 2013, no one expected that the route into its secure environment was its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) supplier, Fazio Mechanical Services. Because a smaller, less secure company like Fazio has access to a bigger, more secure company’s system, attackers took the path of least resistance to install malware and steal credentials. As a result, 40 million credit and debit card details were stolen, and Target spent a total of $202 million to recover from the hack.

This attack was a watershed moment in securing against supply chain attacks.

## What is a supply chain attack?

A supply chain attack is, essentially, another way for attackers to compromise their target company. Instead of them attacking their target—which systems might be secured to the bone—directly, they go for the weakest link in that company’s supply chain: a vendor that may not have as secure a system as their main target. Several threat actor groups, including those that use ransomware, have been pivoting to this attack scheme before 2013, and occurrences of such attacks have only [gone up exponentially](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researchers-find-633-increase-in-cyber-attacks-aimed-at-open-source-repositories) through the years.

Many high-profile attacks that happened during the last two years have been supply chain attacks. A sophisticated hacking group was in [SolarWinds](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/12/advanced-cyber-attack-hits-private-and-public-sector-via-supply-chain-software-update)‘ production environment as early as 2019 before affecting [18,000](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/12/advanced-cyber-attack-hits-private-and-public-sector-via-supply-chain-software-update) of its clients, which include private companies like FireEye and Microsoft and several US federal agencies, via an embedded backdoor to updates of its network monitoring software, Orion.

A malformed software update also affected [Kaseya’s](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/07/shutdown-kaseya-vsa-servers-now-amidst-cascading-revil-attack-against-msps-clients) clients in 2021. VSA, the company’s remote monitoring and management software, distributed a patch that pushed REVil ransomware onto the systems of several managed service providers (MSPs), which then further infected their clients’ systems.

Breaches on SolarWinds and Kaseya are examples of what can be generally termed as a ***software supply chain attack***, wherein a weakness in software was found and exploited by threat actors to affect and reach as many organizations as they can using only a single point of entry. This type of attack is very difficult to detect as it exploits the trust that organizations have in the software they use coming from their legitimate suppliers. Attackers who typically go this route usually have a strong technical aptitude and the means to pull such an attack off, such as advanced persistent threat (APT) actors.

Software supply chain attacks have three common techniques, [according to CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/defending_against_software_supply_chain_attacks_508_1.pdf):

* Hijacking updates
* Undermining code signing
* Compromising open-source code

The Target breach, on the other hand, can be classed as, in MITRE term...
