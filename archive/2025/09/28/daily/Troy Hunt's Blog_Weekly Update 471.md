# Weekly Update 471

27 September 2025

I'm so happy to finally be getting those HIBP demos out! The first couple are simple, but as I say in this week's vid, it's the simple questions we're still dealing with. As if to taunt me (or prove my point), we got this ticket just a couple of hours ago:

> Iâ€™m looking at 10-12k api calls per year. Do you have a custom package that will fit this range?

Now, let's see what happens if you drop *that exact text* into the chatbot on [support.haveibeenpwned.com](https://support.haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com):

[*There's literally a dedicated KB article about this!*](https://support.haveibeenpwned.com/hc/en-au/articles/13868920521103-What-subscription-size-do-I-need-to-use-the-API?ref=troyhunt.com) In fact, I wrote it only yesterday, yet here we are. Which perhaps says that putting the exact answers people need out there won't actually save us from support queries like this anyway... ðŸ¤”
