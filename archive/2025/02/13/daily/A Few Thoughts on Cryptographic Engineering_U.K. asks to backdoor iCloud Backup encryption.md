I'm a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University. I've designed and analyzed cryptographic systems used in wireless networks, payment systems and digital content protection platforms. In my research I look at the various ways cryptography can be used to promote user privacy.

*I’m supposed to be finishing a wonky series on proof systems ([here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/04/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-1/) and [here](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/06/how-to-prove-false-statements-part-2/)) and I promise I will do that this week. In the midst of this I’ve been a bit distracted by world events.*

Last week the Washington Post [published a bombshell story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/) announcing that the U.K. had filed “technical capability notices” demanding that Apple modify the encryption used in their [Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756) for iCloud. For those who don’t know about ADP, it’s a system that enables full “end-to-end” encryption for iCloud backups, including photos and other data. This means that your backup data should be encrypted under your phone’s passcode — and critically, neither Apple nor hackers can access it. The U.K. request would secretly weaken that feature for at least some users.

Along with Alex Stamos, I wrote a [short opinion piece](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/u-k-kicks-apples-door-open-for-china-encryption-data-protection-deb4bc2b) (version [without paywall](https://archive.is/CnTke)) at the Wall Street Journal and I wanted to elaborate on the news a bit more here.

### What’s iCloud and what’s ADP?

Most Apple phones and tablets are configured to automatically back their contents up to a service called iCloud Backup, which maintains a nearly-mirror copy of every file on your phone. This includes your private notes, contacts, private iMessage conversations, personal photos, and so on. So far I doubt I’m saying anything too surprising to the typical Apple user.

What many people don’t know is that in normal operation, this [backup is not end-to-end encrypted.](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2022/12/07/apple-icloud-and-why-encrypted-backup-is-the-only-privacy-issue/) That is, Apple is given a decryption key that can access all your data. This is good in some ways — if you lose your phone and also forget your password, Apple *might* still be able to help you access your data. But it also creates a huge weakness. Two different types of “bad guys” can walk through the hole created by this vulnerability: one type includes hackers and criminals, including sophisticated [state-sponsored cyber-intrusion groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Typhoon). The other is national governments: typically, law enforcement and national intelligence agencies.

Since Apple’s servers hold the decryption key, the company can be asked (or their servers can be hacked) to provide a complete backup copy of your phone at any moment. Notably, since this all happens on the server side, you’ll never even know it happened. Every night your phone sends up a copy of its contents, and then you just ha...
