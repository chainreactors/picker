## **Highest Willingness to Recommend Score of All Gartner Customers’ Choice Vendors**

For cybersecurity professionals evaluating new technologies, there's nothing more illuminating than the real-world experiences of peers who defend against threats every single day. The 2025 Gartner® Peer Insights™ Voice of Customer Report captures this practical reality with insight spanning hundreds of companies worldwide.

In this year’s report, the verdict is clear: Palo Alto Networks [Cortex XDR](/cortex/cortex-xdr)® is a Gartner Customers’ Choice for Endpoint Protection Platforms. An extraordinary 98% of reviewers are willing to recommend our industry-leading endpoint security to their peers, the highest of all Customers’ Choice vendors. This isn't theoretical analysis, it's real-world validation from the users who depend on this technology to protect their organizations' most valuable assets.

## **What the Voice of Customer Report Reveals**

The Gartner Voice of Customer Report stands apart from typical analyst evaluations by putting customers at the center of the assessment. It aggregates verified reviews exclusively from organizations with annual revenue exceeding $50 million, transforming individual experiences into collective wisdom.

For security buyers evaluating [endpoint protection platforms (EPP)](/cyberpedia/what-is-an-endpoint-protection-platform-epp), this represents the unfiltered voice of their peers – professionals who have implemented, managed and relied on these solutions in environments similar to their own.

Cortex XDR's performance in this report is exceptional across all dimensions:

* **98% Willingness to Recommend – the highest of all Customers’ Choice vendors**
* **4.9 out of 5 stars for product capabilities**
* **4.7 out of 5 stars for both sales and deployment experience**
* **4.6 out of 5 stars for support experience**

These metrics earned Cortex XDR placement in the "Customers' Choice" quadrant, reserved for vendors who exceed market averages in Overall Experience and User Interest and Adoption, indicating strong ratings for product capabilities, service and support, as well as high willingness to recommend.

## **Why This Matters**

The willingness-to-recommend metric is particularly important. When Gartner asks, "How likely is it that you would recommend this product or service to a friend or colleague?" on a scale of 0-10, only ratings of 8 or higher count as "willing to recommend." **Achieving a 98% rating represents an unmatched level of customer satisfaction and confidence in Cortex XDR's capabilities.**

## **What Sets Cortex XDR Apart**

Recognition in Gartner Peer Insights underscores Cortex XDR's industry-leading security outcomes:

* **100%** technique detections in Round 6 of the MITRE ATT&CK Evals, with no delays or configuration changes – [an industry first](/cortex/cortex-xdr/mitre).
* **98%** reduction in alerts with advanced AI that groups all related alerts into unified incidents, allowing security teams to escape alert fatigue.
* **8x** faster investigations with automated root cause analysis driving rapid response times and minimizing breach impact.

## **Pioneering the XDR Category with Continuous Innovation**

Since first pioneering the XDR category, Palo Alto Networks has consistently innovated to transform endpoint security as a whole. The result is a comprehensive endpoint security solution that delivers superior protection for your organization.

Cortex XDR’s key strengths:

* **AI-driven prevention** that stops malware, ransomware and fileless attacks before they can cause damage.
* **AI-driven detection proven by MITRE** that leverages behavioral analysis and machine learning to identify even the most evasive threats.
* **Automated root cause analysis** that dramatically accelerates investigation and remediation workflows.
* **Unified agent across enterprise and cloud** **environments** providing seamless protection, regardless of where your assets reside.

Organizations can expand XDR with industry-leading NG-SIEM, [SOAR](/cyberpedia/what-is-soar), [ASM](/cyberpedia/what-is-attack-surface-management) and other critical SOC capabilities, all in one unified backend, frontend and analyst experience with Cortex XSIAM®. This enables security teams to detect, investigate and respond to threats with unprecedented speed and accuracy across their entire attack surface.

By bringing together best-in-class endpoint protection with advanced detection and response capabilities, Cortex XDR continues to lead the industry in defending against evolving and accelerating cyberthreats.
