![WordPress File Permissions](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Blog-Post-WordPress-File-Permissions-820x385.png)

File permissions might seem like a small part of managing a WordPress site, but they play a key role in your website’s security and functionality. Incorrect permissions can leave your site vulnerable to attacks, while overly restrictive settings can hinder its operation.

This guide is designed to walk you through the essentials of WordPress file permissions, from basic concepts for beginners to advanced configurations for tech-savvy users. By the end of this post, you’ll be equipped to set, manage, and troubleshoot file permissions like a pro.

## File permissions basics

To begin, let’s take a look at the basics of file permissions and how they affect your website’s security.

### What are file permissions?

File permissions are rules used by your server to determine who can read, write, and execute files on your website. Used in Linux server environments, these permissions are especially useful for protecting your site’s files and directories from unauthorized access and manipulation.

Linux, an open-source operating system, is widely favored in the hosting world for its stability and security features. This guide primarily addresses file permissions in Linux, as the rules and methods differ on Windows hosting environments.

### How permissions affect your WordPress security

Correct file permissions can help safeguard your site by limiting interactions with your files.

For example, setting the wrong permissions on a crucial file like **wp-config.php** could allow unauthorized users to view or modify sensitive information, leading to security breaches and compromise.

### Basic permission settings explained

First, let’s take a look at some common permissions:

* **Read (4)**: Allows content to be read or viewed.
* **Write (2)**: Permits content modification or deletion.
* **Execute (1)**: Allows running the file as a program or script.

Each number corresponds to a level or combination of permissions. In fact, there’s number defined for each possible levels of file permissions, like so:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Number** | **File Permission** |
| 0 | No access |
| 1 | Execute |
| 2 | Write |
| 3 | Write and execute |
| 4 | Read |
| 5 | Read and execute |
| 6 | Read and write |
| 7 | Read, write and execute |

These permissions can be set individually or combined for different types of users:

* **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
* **Group**: Users who are part of a defined group.
* **Public**: Everyone else.

Understanding these basics is the first step towards configuring your WordPress site securely (and efficiently). As we progress, we’ll dive deeper into how you can apply these principles effectively across your site’s architecture.

### Can website malware affect your file permissions?

Some website malware infections are known to [change the file permissions for **index.php** and **.htaccess** to **444**](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/12/php-re-infectors-the-malware-that-keeps-on-giving.html), essentially locking the files down and attempting to prevent the automated removal of malware.

## Setting up your file permissions

To manage WordPress file permissions, you’ll need access to tools like FTP clients, cPanel, or SSH terminals, depending on your hosting setup. Ensure you have the correc...
