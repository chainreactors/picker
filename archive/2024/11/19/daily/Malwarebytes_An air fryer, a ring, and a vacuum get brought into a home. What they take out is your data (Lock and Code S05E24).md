# An air fryer, a ring, and a vacuum get brought into a home. What they take out is your data (Lock and Code S05E24)

*This week on the Lock and Code podcast…*

The month, a consumer rights group out of the UK posed a question to the public that they’d likely never considered: [Were their air fryers spying on them?](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/11/air-fryers-are-the-latest-surveillance-threat-you-didnt-consider)

By analyzing the associated [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) apps for three separate air fryer models from three different companies, a group of researchers learned that these kitchen devices didn’t just promise to make crispier mozzarella sticks, crunchier chicken wings, and flakier reheated pastries—they also wanted a lot of user data, from precise location to voice recordings from a user’s phone.

“In the air fryer category, as well as knowing customers’ precise location, all three products wanted permission to record audio on the user’s phone, for no specified reason,” the group wrote in its findings.

While it may be easy to discount the data collection requests of an air fryer *app*, it is getting harder to buy any type of product today that doesn’t connect to the internet, request your data, or share that data with unknown companies and contractors across the world.

Today, on the Lock and Code pocast, host David Ruiz tells three separate stories about consumer devices that somewhat invisibly collected user data and then spread it in unexpected ways. This includes kitchen utilities that sent data to China, a smart ring maker that published de-identified, aggregate data about the stress levels of its users, and a smart vacuum that recorded a sensitive image of a woman that was later shared on Facebook.

These stories aren’t about mass government surveillance, and they’re not about spying, or the targeting of political dissidents. Their intrigue is elsewhere, in how common it is for what we say, where we go, and how we feel, to be collected and analyzed in ways we never anticipated.

Tune in today to listen to the full conversation.
