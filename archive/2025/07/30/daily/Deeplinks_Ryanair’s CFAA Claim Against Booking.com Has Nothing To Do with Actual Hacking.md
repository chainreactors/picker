The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is supposed to be about attacks on computer systems. It is not, as a federal district court suggested in *Ryanair v. Booking.com*, applicable when someone uses valid login credentials to access information to which those credentials provide access. Now that the case is on appeal, EFF has filed an amicus brief asking the Third Circuit to clarify that this case is about violations to policy, not hacking, and does not qualify as access “without authorization” under CFAA.

The case concerns transparency in airfare pricing. Ryanair complained that Booking republished Ryanair’s prices, some of which were only visible when a user logged in. Ryanair sent a cease and desist to Booking, but didn't deactivate the usernames and passwords associated with the uses they disliked. When the users allegedly connected to Booking kept using those credentials to gather pricing data, Ryanair claimed it was a CFAA violation. If this doesn’t sound like “computer hacking” to you, you’re right.

The CFAA has proven bad for research, security, competition, and innovation. For years we’ve worked to limit its scope to Congress’s original intention: actual hacking that bypasses computer security.
