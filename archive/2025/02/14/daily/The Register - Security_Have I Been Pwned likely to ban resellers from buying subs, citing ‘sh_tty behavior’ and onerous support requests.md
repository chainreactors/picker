Troy Hunt, proprietor of data breach lookup site Have I Been Pwned, is likely to ban resellers from the service.

Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) has gathered data stolen in 866 breaches and appearing at thousands of paste sites, and allows anyone to search for email addresses or text that trove contains. If personal info is present in a data breach or paste site, HIBP advises users of the fact. Folk who find their addresses were pwned hopefully go on to do sensible things like reset passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.

HIBP also offers paid subscriptions that allow access to an API that handles bulk queries of its database. The subs range from $39.50 a year to $1,370.
