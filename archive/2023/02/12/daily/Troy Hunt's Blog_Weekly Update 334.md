# Weekly Update 334

11 February 2023

Did I *really* need to get a connected BBQ? No more than I needed to connect most of the other things in the house which is to say "a bit useful but not entirely necessary". But it's a fascinating process when looked at through the lens of how accessible the technology is to your average person given it's embedded in a consumer-orientated product. In short - it's painful - but listen to this week's update to hear precisely why. Plus, there's a heap of new data breach and some really, really good news about the NTLM hashes now being available in Pwned Passwords. Enjoy ðŸ˜Š
