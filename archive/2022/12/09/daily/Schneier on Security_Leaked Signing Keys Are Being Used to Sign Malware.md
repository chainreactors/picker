## Leaked Signing Keys Are Being Used to Sign Malware

A bunch of Android OEM [signing keys](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/samsungs-android-app-signing-key-has-leaked-is-being-used-to-sign-malware/) have been leaked or stolen, and they are actively being used to sign malware.

> Łukasz Siewierski, a member of Google’s Android Security Team, has a post on the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative (AVPI) issue tracker detailing [leaked platform certificate keys](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/apvi/issues/detail?id=100) that are actively being used to sign malware. The post is just a list of the keys, but running each one through [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) or Google’s [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) site will put names to some of the compromised keys: [Samsung](https://www.apkmirror.com/?post_type=app_release&searchtype=app&sortby=date&sort=desc&s=34df0e7a9f1cf1892e45c056b4973cd81ccf148a4050d11aea4ac5a65f900a42), [LG](https://www.apkmirror.com/?post_type=app_release&searchtype=app&sortby=date&sort=desc&s=4274243d7a954ac6482866f0cc67ca1843ca94d68a0ee53f837d6740a8134421), and [Mediatek](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/19c84a2386abde0c0dae8661b394e53bf246f6f0f9a12d84cfc7864e4a809697/details) are the heavy hitters on the list of leaked keys, along with some smaller OEMs like [Revoview](http://www.revoview.com/gms/) and Szroco, which makes [Walmart’s Onn tablets](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/07/the-100-tablet-shootout-amazon-fire-8-hd-plus-vs-walmart-onn-8-tablet-pro/).

This is a huge problem. The whole system of authentication rests on the assumption that signing keys are kept secret by the legitimate signers. Once that assumption is broken, all bets are off:

> Samsung’s compromised key is used for everything: Samsung Pay, Bixby, Samsung Account, the phone app, and a million other things you can find on the 101 pages of results for that key. It would be possible to craft a malicious update for any one of these apps, and Android would be happy to install it overtop of the real app. Some of the updates are from *today*, indicating Samsung has still not changed the key.

Any useful advice for those of us who are not security experts?

@ Bruce,

> “leaked or stolen”

Are not the only options…

There is also “Hanlon’s Razor”[1] of,

“Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”

There is also “Murphy’s Law”[2],

“The perversity of inanimate objects, or what can go wrong, will go wrong in the worst possible way at the worst possible time and place.”

Both of which predate the perversion that is “code signing”.

We’ve known for a long time “code signing” is actually a very fragile and mostly pointless thing, and we should have replaced it a long time ago.

But heck even Stuxnet did not wake people up…

The big problems that nobody talks about are,

1, Tolkien’s rule.

Tolkien’s “One ring to rule them all” adiquately doescribes the most obvious problem of,

“The further up the hierarchy you go the more power you get”

We’ve seen this problem so badly with CA’s it’s almost a standing joke, that the time validity on CS certs is now so short that new keys will have be replaced before you get them…

Just about every human system follows this hierarchy power issue and as far as I’m aware they all fail. Primarally because of the second problem.

But the simple fact is this was guaranteed to happen by design from day zero with “code signing” and the fact it’s happened yet again, means we will do the same thing to fix the problems as previous times which is basically “flap and do nothing”[3].

[1] Fun fact Robert J. Hanlon’s proffession “computer programmer”. The description was used to follow the principle of Oakham’s Razor that technically was named after a place, a small insignificant but pleasant place in the English “countryside”.

[2] Murhpy’s law goes by a number of names and variations one is known by soldiers as “Deadman’s click” or “The sound you hear when your gun does not fire when your heavily armed enemy is just infront of you”. I can assure you that once experienced and if lucky survived this version tends to haunt you for a very long time…

[3] Yes there is a law for this but I’ll let people look it up…

@Clive,

Hanlon had it backwards.

Loss or compromise of private keys is as old as PKI infrastructure. And so is the solution:

1. time-stamps: Code signatures are also co-signed by a trusted (!) time-stamping authority
2. key revocation: This requires that public keys are checked against a cached list or preferably online (Android’s master?) which is expected to be up to date.
3. liability: code signers should suffer some penalty if they don’t report in time that the key is compromised. After all, they were supposed to keep it safe.

@Andy,

[3] requires that they know when they are violated. Some are so big and complicated (eg. Samsung) it can take quite a while to (a. discover a breach, then (b. move the message to the right place to get action.

Some are so small they suffer the Alfred E. Neuman syndrome, “Wot, me compromised?”

@AM Okay… we should replace key signing. With **what**, exactly?

Do I understand it correctly that it is “only” the App signing key but not the firmware/secure boot signing key? In tha...
