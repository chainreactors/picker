# WhatsApp for Windows vulnerable to attacks. Update now!

Posted: April 9, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

In a [security advisory](https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/cve-2025-30401), Meta has disclosed a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to run arbitrary code on a user’s system that existed in all WhatsApp versions before 2.2450.6.

WhatsApp offers a desktop application for Windows and macOS, which users can synchronize with their mobile devices. Desktop versions of WhatsApp are generally used as extensions of mobile apps rather than primary platforms. So, while wide usage of these apps exists, their adoption rate lies likely significantly lower when compared to mobile platforms.

WhatsApp has over 3.14 billion monthly active users as of January 2025, with 73% using [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) and 22% using iOS. Using WhatsApp on your desktop offers some advantages that users might appreciate. My excuse is that I can type faster on my laptop and I can make better [screenshots of my conversations](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/i-spoke-to-a-task-scammer-heres-how-it-went).

If you use WhatsApp for Windows, you should update as soon as you can.

## How to update WhatsApp for Windows

You can find the current version of your WhatsApp for Windows by clicking on the **Settings** (gear symbol) > **Help**.

![find version info](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Find_version.jpg)

If your version number is lower than 2.2450.6, install a new version by following these steps:

1. Click the **Start** menu and search for **Microsoft Store** to open it.
2. In the Microsoft Store, click on **Library** located at the bottom left corner.
3. Scroll through the list or use the search bar to find **WhatsApp Desktop**.
4. Click on **Get Updates** or look for an **Update** button next to WhatsApp Desktop. If an update is available, it will appear here.
5. Click the **Update** button to download and install the latest version of WhatsApp Desktop.
6. Once the update is complete, restart the application to ensure all changes are applied.

My WhatsApp was already up to date because I have automatic updates turned on. This is how Microsoft Store on Windows can automatically install app updates.

1. Select **Start**, then search for and select **Microsoft Store**.
2. In the Microsoft Store app, select **Profile**(your account picture) > **Settings**.
3. Make sure **App updates** is turned **On**.

## The vulnerability

The vulnerability tracked as [CVE-2025-30401](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-30401) is described by Meta as:

> “A [spoofing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spoofing) issue in WhatsApp for Windows prior to version 2.2450.6 displayed attachments according to their MIME type but selected the file opening handler based on the attachment’s filename extension. A maliciously crafted mismatch could have caused the recipient to inadvertently execute arbitrary code rather than view the attachment when manually opening the attachment inside WhatsApp.”

In other words, it was possible for a sender to disguise the true nature of their attachment by changing the file extension to something harmless, like a jpeg, when in reality it ...
