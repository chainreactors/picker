# Crypto-inspired Magecart skimmer surfaces via digital crime haven

Posted: January 9, 2023
 by [Threat Intelligence Team](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/threatintelligence)

*This blog post was authored by Jérôme Segura*

Online criminals rarely reinvent the wheel, especially when they don’t have to. From [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) to password stealers, there are a number of toolkits available for purchase on various underground markets that allow just about anyone to get a jumpstart.

During one of our crawls, we spotted a skimmer using the ‘Mr.SNIFFA’ framework that targets e-commerce sites and their customers. In recent years, this skimmer has adopted various obfuscation techniques as well as steganography to load its malicious code and exfiltrate stolen credit card data. While Magecart threat actors usually pick domain names after third-party libraries, or Google Analytics, in this case they went with a crypto-inspired theme which we had not seen before.

Digging further into the skimmer’s infrastructure on Russian-based hosting provider DDoS-Guard, we came across a digital crime haven for cryptocurrency scams, [Bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin) mixers, [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) distribution sites and much more. This blog post will cover the technical details of the skimmer and its crime-filled ecosystem.

## Overview

When looking for malicious code on the web, we tend to inspect HTML code, JavaScript dependencies as well as redirects. What makes some attacks interesting is how they will purposely avoid leaving obvious signs, try to only load one time or maybe dynamically in some unsuspecting format.

In this case, we saw an e-commerce website that was injected with a link to an external website named after American Entrepreneur and BTC supporter Michael J. Saylor (saylor2xbtc[.]com). We should note that the sites we found injected with this skimmer had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies themselves. However, interest in targeting this industry has been shown before and likely such attacks are still happening.

As the skimmer code is dynamically unpacked in the DOM it will harvest card payment details and exfiltrate those in a similar fashion. In the next section, we will show exactly what happens during this process of data collection and exfiltration.

## Technical details

### Mr.SNIFFA skimmer

Back in the spring of 2020, an [advert](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1264471311327387648?s=20&t=SGC7gSgPxxFgiNMBbudnTA) for a new skimmer was posted to a criminal forum. The product, called mr.SNIFFA, claims to have code that cannot be seen using browser tools and works across different browsers. More importantly, the author offers free bug fixes and 24/7 support.

*Figure 3: Tweet about new product being advertised*

It seems some of those promises were true as a clever feature that hides the skimmer was [implemented](https://twitter.com/AffableKraut/status/1380022959272787970?s=20&t=fnMayBQqn6nGvVSxcAxZMQ) later on:
