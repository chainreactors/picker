# Ho, ho, no! Scams to avoid this festive season

Posted: December 7, 2022
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

Whether you’ve been naughty or nice, someone will try and stuff a scam down your chimney either way. The FBI is warning of [several likely ways to be parted from your funds or logins](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/pittsburgh/news/press-releases/fbi-warning-tis-the-season-for-holiday-scams-1), and we’re going to give some additional context along with tips to avoid these digital lumps of coal.

## Social media shopping scams

**The FBI says**:

> Consumers should beware of posts on social media sites that appear to offer vouchers or gift cards. Some may appear as holiday promotions or contests. Others may appear to be from known friends who have shared the link. Often, these scams lead consumers to participate in an online survey that is designed to steal [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

**We say:**

Social media scams largely lean into [cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) giveaways and other similar get rich quick schemes. You may see the occasional gift card thrown into the mix, but these tend to be related to survey scams. Having said that, we covered [3 popular forms of gift card scam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/11/please-dont-buy-this-3-gift-card-scams-to-watch-out-for-this-black-friday) in the run up to Black Friday:

* Fake gift cards for sale at a discount. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Search out the official card distributor and check if they actually do have a sale on, and then purchase directly.
* Gift card generators. Tools which claim to create genuine codes have been around for years, and they’re all fake. At best you’ll see one of the previously mentioned surveys. At worst, you could run into [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware).
* Services you encounter online which claim to perform a task in return for gift cards should be avoided. You’ll send them a code, and never hear from them again.

## Work from home scams

**The FBI says**:

> Consumers should beware of sites and posts offering work they can do from home. These opportunities rely on convenience as a selling point but may have fraudulent intentions. Consumers should carefully research the job posting and individuals or company offering employment

**We say:**

Work from home scams are big business over the holiday season, especially with people potentially looking for a little extra cash in the run up to the new year. These scams became incredibly popular with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, often [tying into cryptocurrency](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/03/coronavirus-bitcoin-scam-promises-millions-working-from-home).

Other scams of this nature will make use of [cryptocurrency ATMs and QR codes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2021/08/if-a-qr-code-leads-you-to-a-bitcoin-atm-at-a-gas-station-its-a-scam). They’ll set up fake job hunt websites for you to upload your resume to, or post bogus ads on real sites. If you take part in an interview via WhatsApp or Telegram, that may be a red flag. If they send you money to buy work equipment, and then ask you to send the rest of the money to another bank account, that’s a whole box of red flags. You may well be walking into a short lived career as a money mule. It’s simply not with the risk.

## Charity scams
