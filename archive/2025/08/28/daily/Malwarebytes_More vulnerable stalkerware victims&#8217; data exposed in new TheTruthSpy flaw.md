# More vulnerable stalkerware victims’ data exposed in new TheTruthSpy flaw

Posted: August 27, 2025
 by [Danny Bradbury](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/dbradbury)

TheTruthSpy is at it again. A security researcher has discovered a flaw in the Android-based stalkerware that allows anyone to compromise any record in the system.

TheTruthSpy stalkerware is designed to be installed surreptitiously on a victim’s [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) phone. It then monitors that phone’s activities and sends the information it gathers back to a central server. On Monday, TechCrunch [revealed](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/a-new-security-flaw-in-thetruthspy-phone-spyware-is-putting-victims-at-risk/)—not for the first time—that the servers are vulnerable to attack. It found that anyone can reset the password of any account on the app, meaning they could hijack anyone’s data.

The security researcher, Swarang Wade, demonstrated the vulnerability to TechCrunch by changing the passwords on several tests accounts. The publication isn’t revealing exactly how it was done, to prevent anyone from abusing the flaw.

TheTruthSpy gathers a lot of data about its victims. It provides the person who installed it with information about what calls or texts were made or received on the victim’s phone, and its location (harvested from the GPS), along with activities associated with messaging apps and files.

This isn’t the first time that TheTruthSpy has suffered from security issues:

* In 2018, a [hacker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) [gained access](https://www.vice.com/en/article/thetruthspy-spyware-domestic-abusers-hacked-data-breach/) to all its servers.
* In 2019, it [exposed pictures of kids](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2022/06/photos-of-kids-taken-from-spyware-ridden-phones-found-exposed-on-the-internet) taken with infected phones online.
* In 2024, stalkerware researchers [found an unpatched flaw](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/02/thetruthspy-stalkerware-still-insecure-still-leaking-data) that rendered all data on the app’s servers accessible.

This would all be very bad if people using the app knew that they were doing so, and that their personal usage data was stored online. But many of them are oblivious to the fact.

TheTruthSpy’s vendor, Vietnam-based 1Byte Software, warns that people must obtain consent before installing the app on someone else’s phone. However it also specifically advertises ‘stealth mode’, which makes it “completely invisible to users on phones/tablets where it’s installed.”

The software’s website touts its ability to spy on phone users as a way for parents to monitor and protect their children. That raises its own ethical questions, especially given the multiple [data leaks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-breach). But that isn’t its only use. Abusers will use apps like these to monitor their current or ex-partners, or other stalking targets.

Once a victim has this installed on their phone without their knowledge, the installer can monitor their photos, social media interactions, emails, and internet browsing history. It will also record audio and log keystrokes without them being aware.

Van (Vardy) Thieu, owner of 1Byte Software, told TechCrunch that its source code was lost. He claimed to be building a n...
