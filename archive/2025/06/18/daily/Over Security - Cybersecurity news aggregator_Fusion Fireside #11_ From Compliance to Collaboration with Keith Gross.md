Announcing the New Episode of Fusion Fireside, featuring Keith Gross, Chairperson of the European FI-ISAC

In this episode of Fusion Fireside, we are joined by Keith Gross, Chairperson of the European FI-ISAC, for an in-depth discussion on the evolving world of financial crime, compliance and cybersecurity leadership.

With over 17 years at the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland and a background as Head of Compliance and AML, Keith has long been at the forefront of fraud prevention, e-crime and high-tech threats. His expertise covers anti-money laundering, cybercrime and physical security, making him one of Europeâ€™s most well-rounded voices in financial crime prevention.

## A journey shaped by collaboration

Keith shares his path to becoming Chairperson of the European FI-ISAC and explains why collaboration is not just valuable but essential. From partnerships with the European Banking Federation to work with Europol, he highlights the strength of collective intelligence in fighting financial crime.

## Lessons from the front line

We hear about a real case that left a lasting impact, showing how fast-moving cross-border fraud requires not only a rapid response but also trust between institutions.

## Looking ahead

Keith offers his outlook on emerging threats in financial services and what needs to change across the industry to stay ahead. Expect insights on partnerships, data sharing and a few surprising trends.

If you stay to the end, there is a behind-the-scenes moment that captures a real-time curveball and how Keith and host Eward Driehuis handle it like seasoned professionals.
