# Appsec Roundup - Jan 2025

An exciting month, with new threat modeling tools, cool thoughts on STAMP, bounds checking, ADRs and more!

What a month! It was even eventful in the appsec world, with new threat modeling tools, a self-servingly dramatic fork of semgrep, and oh, let's not talk about ‚Äúregulation.‚Äù Oh, fine, lets, but only towards the end.

### Secure by Design and threat modeling

* Hendrik Ewerlin [shared](https://threatmodelingconnect.discourse.group/t/meet-threatpad/741) ThreatPad, a lightweight editor with some nice prompts . (It could use more emojis, somehow. üòâ)
* [Guardio](https://dev.guardio.click/app) is another lightweight tool for recording threats.
* [Generating 1000 Threat Models Using Gemini 2.0 and AI Security Analyzer](https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/scaling-threat-modeling-with-ai/) by xvnpw. Fascinating.
* [The Evolution of SRE at Google: Using STAMP to improve resilience in Google production systems](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/evolution-sre-google) is fascinating. I think one of the advantages of rebuilding tech stacks the way Google does is that it gives you a chance to think about interfaces and the optionality they give a caller. The models that evolved for successful interactive computing have very flexible interfaces, where adding controls and ensuring they do what you want is hard.

### Appsec

* [Story-time: C++, bounds checking, performance, and compilers](https://chandlerc.blog/posts/2024/11/story-time-bounds-checking/)  by Chandler Carruth.
* [How to create Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) ‚Äî and how not to](https://medium.com/olzzio/how-to-create-architectural-decision-records-adrs-and-how-not-to-93b5b4b33080) and [How to review Architectural Decision Records](https://medium.com/olzzio/how-to-review-architectural-decision-records-adrs-and-how-not-to-2707652db196), both by Doc SoC in April, 2023 but I'd missed them.
* [What‚Äôs going on with (Sem|open)grep?](https://joshcgrossman.com/2025/01/28/whats-going-on-with-sem-open-grep/) by Josh Grossman and relatedly [Opengrep - The Security Industry Deserves Better](https://crashoverride.com/blog/opengrep-the-security-industry-deserves-better?utm_content=354884849&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lis-FEfOQ2e04a) by Mark Curphey.

### Regulation

* [HHS proposes major overhaul of HIPAA security rule](https://iapp.org/news/a/hhs-proposes-major-overhaul-of-hipaa-security-rule/) by Jim Dempsey gives an overview of a proposed update to regulation for hospitals.
* [Secure by Demand Priority considerations for operational technology owners and operators when selecting digital products](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/governance-and-user-education/secure-by-design/secure-demand-priority-considerations-operational-technology-owners-and-operators-when-selecting-digital-products) (I like the Australian version, in HTML.)
* The final Biden executive order on cyber is out, and this Reuters article ([As China hacking threat builds, Biden to order tougher cybersecurity standards](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/china-hacking-threat-builds-biden-order-tougher-cybersecurity-standards-2025-01-10/)) gives some good context: ‚ÄúBiden's proposal calls for tougher standards for secure software development, the ability to verify that those standards have been met, and a process for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to evaluate the process, according to the draft.‚Äù And while that‚Äôs a lot of process, it reflects a growing perception that the ‚Äúimpose costs‚Äù team has failed to score a goal, and the ‚Äúnorms‚Äù people have been hoisted on their own peTAOrd.

As of this writing on Feb 3, neither seems to be cancelled, and Joe Menn [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/03/cisa-china-trump-noem-hacking-cyberthreats/) that the cybersecurity one may not be.

### Books

I‚Äôm enjoying [Medical Device Cybersecurity for Engineers and Manufacturers, Second Edition](https://amzn.to/3PUwWcD) by Axel Wirth, Christopher Gates and Jason Smith. I expect to write up a fuller review, but it‚Äôs an excellent broad overview. Wish I‚Äôd had it when I started collaborating with the FDA.

### Shostack + Associates updates

* We delivered a new mini-course overlay, ‚ÄúFacilitating Effective Threat Modeling‚Äù for a longtime customer. The course helps experienced threat modelers add nuance to their practice as they support their teams.
* My paper, [Who are we: Power Centers in Threat Modeling](https://shostack.org/blog/who-are-we/) was accepted for [Rossfest](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/rossfest/).
* Our Quad paper, [Lessons for Cybersecurity from the American Public Health System](https://shostack.org/blog/lessons-for-cyber-from-the-public-health-system/) was released by the Computing Research Association.
* The final version of [Handling Pandemic-Scale Cyber Threats: Lessons from COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1145/3703465.3703466 "Handling Pandemic-Scale Cyber Threats: Lessons from COVID-19") was added to the ACM library.
* At RSA, Adam and Tanya Janca will be presenting ‚ÄúRed Teaming AI: 50 Years of Failure, But This Time, For Sure!‚Äù (May 1, 10:50 AM).
