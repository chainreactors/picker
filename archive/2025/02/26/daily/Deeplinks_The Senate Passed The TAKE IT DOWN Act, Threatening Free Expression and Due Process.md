Earlier this month, the Senate passed the TAKE IT DOWN Act ([S. 146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/146)), by a voice vote. The bill is meant to speed up the removal of non-consensual intimate imagery, or NCII, including videos that imitate real people, a technology sometimes called “deepfakes.”

**Protecting victims of these heinous privacy invasions is a legitimate goal. But good intentions alone are not enough to make good policy.** As currently drafted, the TAKE IT DOWN Act [mandates a notice-and-takedown system](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/take-it-down-act-flawed-attempt-protect-victims-will-lead-censorship) that threatens free expression, user privacy, and due process, without addressing the problem it claims to solve.

This misguided bill can still be stopped in the House of Representatives. Help us speak out against it now.
