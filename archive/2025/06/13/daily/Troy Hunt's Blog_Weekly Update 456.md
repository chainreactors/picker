# Weekly Update 456

12 June 2025

It's time to fly! It's two months to the day since we came back from the last European trip, again spending the time with some of the agencies and partners we've fostered at HIBP over the years. This time, it's [the driving tour I talked about earlier last month](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-have-i-been-pwned-alpine-grand-tour/), and we have absolutely jam-packed it! But hey, it's a part of the world I love driving in, it's summer over there (I know, it's a bit upside-down in that half of the world), and there are lots of cool people and places to see. Interesting, Switzerland was by far the most dominant "come and say g'day" country, and we've ended up with events or meetups in Zurich, Bern and Geneva, along with invites in other places we just didn't have time to make work. But Switzerland is awesome, so perhaps that's a place for a longer stay next time with a little less grand touring. Regardless, I'll come to you with another live stream next Friday from Monaco ðŸ˜Ž
