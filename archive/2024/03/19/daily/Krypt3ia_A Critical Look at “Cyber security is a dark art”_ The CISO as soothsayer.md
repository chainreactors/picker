## A Critical Look at “Cyber security is a dark art”: The CISO as soothsayer

The recent study by Joseph Da Silva and Rikke Bjerg Jensen, titled “Cyber security is a dark art”: The CISO as soothsayer,” ventures into uncharted territory, offering a interesting narrative on the interpretive role of CISOs within commercial organizations. While the study is laudable for its insightful exploration, a critical examination reveals areas that invite further reflection and scrutiny.

#### The Insightful: What the Study Gets Right

Da Silva and Jensen’s research commendably highlights the multifaceted role of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), positioning it beyond the confines of technical expertise. By drawing parallels between CISOs and modern-day soothsayers, the study broadens the discourse on cybersecurity, transitioning the focus from mere technical proficiency to encompass strategic leadership and organizational culture integration. This nuanced approach is instrumental in illuminating the complex challenges that CISOs encounter as they endeavor to translate intricate cyber threats into digestible and actionable intelligence for stakeholders lacking technical background.

Historically, not all individuals appointed as CISOs have possessed deep technical backgrounds. This diversity in background has led to a rich debate about the essential qualifications for the role, particularly in the face of an evolving cyber threat landscape that demands a profound understanding of both the technical and strategic facets of cybersecurity. The technical acumen of a CISO is paramount for several reasons: it ensures credibility within the cybersecurity and IT teams; enables the CISO to make informed decisions about security technologies and architectures; and facilitates a deeper understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures employed by adversaries. However, as the role has evolved, it has become clear that technical skills alone are not sufficient. A CISO must also possess strong leadership capabilities, an understanding of business processes, and the ability to communicate complex security concepts in terms that are meaningful to the business.

The qualitative approach adopted by Da Silva and Jensen, through semi-structured interviews, significantly enriches the study by offering firsthand narratives from CISOs and senior leaders. These narratives delve into the mystique that often surrounds cybersecurity and articulate the precarious position CISOs find themselves in within organizations. Such insights are crucial in advancing our comprehension of cybersecurity as an “expert system” that requires not only technical expertise but also strategic foresight and adaptability. The balancing act that CISOs must perform—navigating between their technical responsibilities and their role as strategic advisors—underscores the importance of a comprehensive skill set that includes, but is not limited to, technical knowledge. This duality of the CISO role reinforces the imperative for ongoing education and development to ensure that CISOs can effectively protect their organizations in an ever-changing cyber threat environment.

#### The Constructive: Where It Falls Short

Despite its strengths, the study navigates through several areas that require critical attention:

**Scope and Diversity**: The research’s focus on commercial businesses with a limited sample size may not fully capture the broader spectrum of challenges faced by CISOs across various sectors. A more diversified approach, incorporating non-profits, government agencies, and global entities, could provide a richer, more encompassing view of the CISO’s role.

**Methodological Considerations**: While the qualitative insights are rich, the study’s reliance on self-reported data without external validation or quantitative analysis may introduce bias. Incorporating a mixed-methods approach could strengthen the findings and offer a more balanced view of the CISO’s role and effectiveness.

**Strategic Depth**: The paper skims over the strategic implications of its findings. A deeper dive into how organizations can structurally and culturally embed CISOs in decision-making processes, combat ‘cyber sophistry,’ and align cyber security with business objectives would offer valuable guidance to practitioners.

**Competencies and Skills**: The portrayal of CISOs as soothsayers is intriguing but begs the question of what specific competencies, beyond interpretive skills, are essential for success in this role. Future research could benefit from exploring the balance between technical expertise, strategic foresight, and leadership acumen necessary for effective cyber security leadership.

**Future Directions**: The call for further research into the diverse roles of CISOs is timely. Expanding this inquiry to examine how these roles evolve in response to the dynamic cyber threat landscape and technological innovations would be particularly beneficial for both academic and practical fields.

#### Comparing Cybersecurity and CISOs to Religion and Religious Oracles

The analogy that positions cybersecurity and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) within the realm of religion and oracles, as suggested by the metaphorical framing in “Cybersecurity is a dark art”: The CISO as soothsayer,” invites a thought-provoking but potentially problematic comparison. While such a comparison aims to highlight the enigmatic and interpretive aspects of the cybersecurity domain, it inadvertently introduces a layer of critique concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of this analogy.

**Oversimplification of Complex Realities**

Firstly, equating the cybersecurity field with religious beliefs simplifies the highly technical, evidence-based nature of cybersecurity work. Cybersecurity, at its core, relies on empirical data, rigorous analysis, and methodical problem-solving to address and mitigate threats. Unlike religious faith, which often accepts mysteries and unknowns as matters of belief, cybersecurity thrives on demystifying the unknown, uncovering evidence, and applying logical solutions to protect digital assets. This critical difference suggests that comparing cybersecurity to religion may obscure the scientific and analytical foundations upon which the field stands.

**The Risk of Misplaced Authority**

The portrayal of CISOs as oracles or religious figures carries the risk of misplacing authority and creating an undue sense of infallibility around their decisions. In religious contexts, oracles are seen as conduits to divine wisdom, often unquestioned and revered. Transposing this concept to the role of CISOs could foster an environment where decisions are accepted without the necessary scrutiny, debate, or empirical validation that is essential in cybersecurity. Such a dynamic is counterproductive, as it may discourage critical questioning and the collaborative problem-solving essential in identifying and mitigating cyber threats effectively.

**Undermining the Collaborative Nature of Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity is inherently a collaborative endeavor, relying on the collective expertise of diverse stakeholders, including IT professionals, software developers, policy makers, and end-users. Framing CISOs and their work in quasi-religious terms might unintentionally elevate them above this ecosystem, undermining the importance of collaboration and the distributed nature of cybersecurity responsibilities. It’s essential to recognize that protecting against cyber threats requires a concerted effort, not just the foresight or directives of a single individual or elite group.

**Ethical and Cultural Sensitivities**
