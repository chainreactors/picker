Ivanti has [released](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Endpoint-Manager-Mobile-EPMM?language=en_US) security updates to address two security flaws in Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) software that have been chained in attacks to gain remote code execution.

The vulnerabilities in question are listed below -

* **CVE-2025-4427** (CVSS score: 5.3) - An authentication bypass in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to access protected resources without proper credentials
* **CVE-2025-4428** (CVSS score: 7.2) - A remote code execution vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system

An attacker that successfully exploits these flaws could chain them together to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device without authentication.

The flaws impact the following versions of the product -

* 11.12.0.4 and prior (Fixed in 11.12.0.5)
* 12.3.0.1 and prior (Fixed in 12.3.0.2)
* 12.4.0.1 and prior (Fixed in 12.4.0.2)
* 12.5.0.0 and prior (Fixed in 12.5.0.1)

Ivanti, which credited CERT-EU for reporting the issues, [said](https://www.ivanti.com/blog/epmm-security-update) it's "aware of a very limited number of customers who have been exploited at the time of disclosure" and that the vulnerabilities are "associated with two open-source libraries integrated into EPMM."

The company, however, did not disclose the names of the impacted libraries. It's also not known what other software applications relying on the two libraries could be affected. Furthermore, the company said it's still investigating the cases, and that it does not have reliable indicators of compromise associated with the malicious activity.

"The risk to customers is significantly reduced if they already filter access to the API using either the built-in Portal ACLs functionality or an external web application firewall," Ivanti noted.

"The issue only affects the on-prem EPMM product. It is not present in Ivanti Neurons for MDM, Ivanti's cloud-based unified endpoint management solution, Ivanti Sentry, or any other Ivanti products."

Separately, Ivanti has also [shipped patches](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Neurons-for-ITSM-on-premises-only-CVE-2025-22462?language=en_US) to contain an authentication bypass flaw in on-premise versions of Neurons for ITSM (CVE-2025-22462, CVSS score: 9.8) that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative access to the system. There is no evidence that the security defect has been exploited in the wild.

With zero-days in Ivanti appliances becoming a [lightning rod for threat actors](https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/critical-ivanti-flaw-actively-exploited.html) in recent years, it's imperative that users move quickly to update their instances to the latest versions for optimal protection.

### Update

watchTowr Labs has [released](https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/watchTowr-vs-Ivanti-EPMM-CVE-2025-4427-CVE-2025-4428) a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the Ivanti EPMM exploit chain that combines CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428 to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.

The cybersecurity company noted that, while a third-party called "hibernate-validator" has been updated from version 6.0.22 to 6.2.5, it found that it was able to successfully execute arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to "/mifs/admin/rest/api/v2/featureusage."

It also pointed out CVE-2025-4427 isn't actually an authentication bypass, but more of an [order of operations vulnerability](https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/leveraging-an-order-of-operations-bug-to-achieve-rce-in-sitecore-8-x---10-x), which occurs when logic flaws exist within the order in which security boundaries are applied in code. "Is this really a vulnerability in a third-party library, or incorrect and dangerous usage of known-scary functions?," security researcher Piotr Bazydlo [posed](https://labs.watchtowr.com/expression-payloads-meet-mayhem-cve-2025-4427-and-cve-2025-4428/).

### Wiz Warns of Ivanti EPMM RCE Vulnerability Chain Exploitation

Cloud security company Wiz said it has observed ongoing exploitation of CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428 targeting susceptible EPMM instances since May 16, 2025, coinciding with the release of PoC by watchTowr and [ProjectDiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/ivanti-remote-code-execution).

Successful exploitation has been followed by the deployment of command-and-control (C2) frameworks like Sliver that uses the IP address 77.221.157[.]154 as its C2 server.

CVE-2025-4428 "arises from the unsafe handling of user-supplied input within error messages processed via Spring's AbstractMessageSource, which allows attacker-controlled EL (Expression Language) injection," Wiz researchers [said](https://www.wiz.io/blog/ivanti-epmm-rce-vulnerability-chain-cve-2025-4427-cve-2025-4428). "CVE-2025-4427 is an authentication bypass caused by improper request handling in EPMM's route configuration."
