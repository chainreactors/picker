If you are wondering what an SAP STAR intern does, you are at the right place! My name is Sohan Pujar and I am based in Melbourne, Australia. I have worked with SAP as a Student Training and Rotation (STAR) intern from 2021 – 2022. This blog is the first part of a two-part blog series. In this blog, I hope to share with you my personal experience in the SAP STAR program rotations.

It is important to note that all experiences shared in this blog pertains to the SAP STAR Program in Australia & New Zealand and are also my personal experiences. Other locations could have its SAP STAR Program structured differently and other STAR interns could have a different experience.

## What is the SAP STAR Program?

To be eligible for the STAR program, you must:

* Have a minimum of two years remaining in your degree

* Be a permanent resident or citizen of Australia or New Zealand

The SAP STAR Program are for students to gain work experience while studying. The program is structured so the student can rotate across various teams within the business every six months (duration can be extended if approval is granted). This program facilitates for students to understand roles applicable to their interests.

The SAP lines of business are:

* Industry & Customer Advisory (ICA) *otherwise known as ‘Presales’*

* Sales

* Customer Success Services (CSS)

Personally, I rotated within the Innovation team (ICA), Business Technology Platform team (ICA), Enterprise Markets team (Sales) and the Analytics & Insights team (CSS) across my two years.

## Onboarding

As I commenced my onboarding with SAP, I was introduced to senior leaders in the business who would talk to the critical nature of SAP software and some of SAP’s well-known customers. After, I was provided with office tours, company-wide kick-off calls which usually discusses the company’s strategy for the year while completing logistical tasks such as attaining a work laptop, a security access pass to the office, etc. Additionally, I was occupied with understanding the various internal tools and processes such as submitting extra day timesheets, accessing e-learnings, claiming travel expenses, booking certifications, etc. I was also completing numerous mandatory e-learning modules ranging from compliance to data privacy and security.

Some of the key highlights of onboarding included receiving free lunch and an off-site excursion to bowling and laser-tag (if you are lucky!)

## First rotation: Innovation Team (ICA)

The Innovation team reimagines the way SAP software is used. They facilitate design thinking workshops to discover unconventional creative ways of solving problems through the application of SAP software. They build customer demonstrations and show the ‘art of the possible.’ They usually maintain a walk-in space known as the ‘D-shop’ which hosts the creative customer demonstrations. Lastly, they also present on topical concepts and ideas.

During my first rotation in the Innovation Team, I worked with another STAR intern in developing a presentation on the topic of ‘Supercharging customer relationships with Gen-Z’. Unfortunately, the event was cancelled due to the pandemic, but nonetheless was a great learning opportunity.

I later was involved in creating demonstrations for customers and revamping the D-shop space. One of the tasks included bringing to life an SAP solution named as the ‘[SAP Vaccine Collaboration Hub’](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2022/02/44074330-187e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html) which was used in Okinawa City, Japan. One of the most powerful methods of understanding a solution is by physically interacting with it. As most software is demonstrated digitally, I took on the challenge of creating a physical demonstration for the customers to interact with. I 3D printed ships, trucks, distribution centers, hospitals, etc. with a script for the demonstration so customers have a tangible interactive experience.

Finally, I assisted in creating sustainability-related videos to assist the sales teams in understanding the sustainability solution portfolio of SAP and how to pitch them adequately to customers.

## Second rotation: Business Technology Platform Team (ICA)

The SAP [Business Technology Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html) (SAP BTP) is the underlying core platform in which SAP and non-SAP solutions and extensions are built and integrated on. The team are experts in various solutions on SAP BTP and demonstrate its capabilities to customers, assuring them the capabilities exist in the platform to solve the customers’ business challenges. The team also responds to tenders and requests for proposals and information, answering hundreds of technical capability questions to win a deal.

During my rotation in the Business Technology Platform team, I learnt of several SAP solutions existing on the SAP Business Technology Platform which include SAP Build Apps (formerly known as SAP Appgyver) and SAP Analytics Cloud. Having studied these solutions, I was able to deliver a demonstration to the SAP partner ecosystem on SAP Build Apps.

Similar to my rotation in the Innovation team, I was creating videos for customers. I also had the opportunity to shadow SAP colleagues when they attended customer meetings. This g...
