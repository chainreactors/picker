Trump administration policies that allowed Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access systems and data at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) have left the org “more vulnerable to hacking” according to federal Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in New York City.

Judge Engelmayer used that phrase in an [order](https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/02/10/ny_dotgov_york_vs_trump.pdf) [PDF] filed in Feb 8 in the case of State of New York *et al* vs Trump *et al*, which saw 19 State attorneys’ general argue that allowing the Trump-blessed Elon-Musk-led [Department of Government Efficiency](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/21/doge_us_digital_service_renamed/) to access systems and data at the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) broke at least one law and violates the US Constitution, among other legal errors.

A related lawsuit has already seen another judge [order](https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/06/federal_court_leashes_doges_tresury_access/) that just two special government employees, aka DOGE agents, be allowed to access BFS systems and data.
