# Exploit Title: SOUND4 IMPACT/FIRST/PULSE/Eco v2.x - Directory Traversal File Write Exploit
# Exploit Author: LiquidWorm

Vendor: SOUND4 Ltd.
Product web page: https://www.sound4.com | https://www.sound4.biz
Affected version: FM/HD Radio Processing:
                  Impact/Pulse/First (Version 2: 1.1/2.15)
                  Impact/Pulse/First (Version 1: 2.1/1.69)
                  Impact/Pulse Eco 1.16
                  Voice Processing:
                  BigVoice4 1.2
                  BigVoice2 1.30
                  Web-Audio Streaming:
                  Stream 1.1/2.4.29
                  Watermarking:
                  WM2 (Kantar Media) 1.11

Summary: The SOUND4 IMPACT introduces an innovative process - mono and
stereo parts of the signal are processed separately to obtain perfect
consistency in terms of both sound and level. Therefore, in moving
reception, when the FM receiver switches from stereo to mono and back to
stereo, the sound variations and changes in level are reduced by over 90%.
In the SOUND4 IMPACT processing chain, the stereo expander can be used
substantially without any limitations.

With its advanced functionalities and impressive versatility, SOUND4
PULSE gives clients the ultimate price - performance ratio, providing
much more than just a processor. Flexible and powerful, it ensures perfect
sound quality and full compatibility with radio broadcasting standards
and can be used simultaneously for FM and HD, DAB, DRM or streaming.

SOUND4 FIRST provides all the most important functionalities you need
in an FM/HD processor and sets the bar high both in terms of performance
and affordability. Designed to deliver a sound of uncompromising quality,
this tool gives you 2-band processing, a digital stereo generator and an
IMPACT Clipper.

Desc: The application suffers from an unauthenticated directory traversal
file write vulnerability. Input passed through the 'filename' POST parameter
called by the 'upgrade.php' script is not properly verified before being used
to upload .upgbox Firmware files. This can be exploited to write to arbitrary
locations on the system via directory traversal attacks.

Tested on: Apache/2.4.25 (Unix)
           OpenSSL/1.0.2k
           PHP/7.1.1
           GNU/Linux 5.10.43 (armv7l)
           GNU/Linux 4.9.228 (armv7l)

The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.
