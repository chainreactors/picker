Were you sifting through an old iPhone, iPad, iMac, or MacBook looking at the photos you had taken on that device (or another device made by Apple)? Did the .heic file extension catch your eye, and now you’re wondering *what is an .heic file*? You aren’t the first and you won’t be the last iPhone or Mac user to scratch their head at this interesting file format.

HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format) is a file format used for images. It is developed by Apple and is the default image format for the latest versions of their operating systems like iOS and MacOS. HEIC is designed to provide superior image quality to traditional image formats such as JPEG while reducing file size. It’s not difficult to imagine how mobile devices benefit greatly from being able to more efficiently utilize limited storage space. HEIC uses advanced compression techniques to achieve these goals and also supports advanced features such as editing metadata without recompressing the entire image and saving multiple images in a single file.
