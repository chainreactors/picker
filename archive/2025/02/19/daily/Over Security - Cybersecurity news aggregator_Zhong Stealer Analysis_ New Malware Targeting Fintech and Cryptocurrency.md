Zhong Stealer Analysis: New Malware Targeting Fintech and Cryptocurrency

***Editor’s note:*** *The current article is authored by Mauro Eldritch, offensive security expert and threat intelligence analyst. You can* [*find Mauro on X*](https://x.com/MauroEldritch)*.*

From December 20 to 24, 2024, the Quetzal Team identified a phishing campaign targeting the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors. This campaign aimed to distribute a newly discovered stealer malware, which we have named Zhong Stealer, as there were no prior public references to this threat.

The attackers exploited chat support platforms like Zendesk, posing as customers to trick unsuspecting support agents into downloading the malware.

In this article, we’ll use [ANY.RUN’s real-time malware analysis capabilities](http://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=zhong_stealer_analysis&utm_term=180225&utm_content=linktolanding) to cover:

* **Execution flow**: How the malware runs from initial launch to full system infiltration.
* **Data exfiltration tactics**: How Zhong transmits stolen credentials to a C2 server hosted in Hong Kong.
* **Persistence techniques**: How it modifies registry keys and scheduled tasks to survive reboots.

## A Flood of Phishing Attempts

The attack pattern was simple yet persistent:

1. Open a new support ticket from a freshly created, empty account.

2. Use broken language and ask for help in Chinese.

3. Attach a ZIP file containing screenshots or additional details.

4. Insist that support staff open it, growing frustrated when they refused.

During this period, we managed to collect several suspicious ZIP file samples, all named with Simplified Chinese characters:

* 图片\_20241224 (2).zip (Image\_20241224 (2).zip).

* Android 自由截图\_20241220.zip (Android Free Screenshot\_20241220.zip)

* Android – Screenshots2024122288jpg.zip

Each ZIP file contained an EXE file inside, which immediately raised red flags:

* 图片\_20241224.exe (Image\_20241224.exe – Simplified Chinese)

* 圖片2024122288jpg.exe (Image2024122288jpg.exe – Traditional Chinese)

* 图片\_20241220.exe (Image\_20241220.exe – Simplified Chinese)

## The Zhong Stealer Revealed

Over four days, we received multiple samples of what appeared to be the same malware. Initially, only one global detection flagged it as “Unsafe,” a vague and generic label.

As time passed, some samples began to receive more global detections, but with a twist: all of them were either generic or driven by heuristic/machine learning/artificial intelligence-powered systems.

However, these detections lacked meaningful naming conventions, making tracking difficult.

Generic conventions (such as “*Win.MSIL*”, “*Detected*”, or “*Unsafe*”) and AI-generated names (like “*AIDetectMalware*”, “*Malware.AI*”, “*ML.Attribute.HighConfidence*”, “*malicious\_confidence\_90%*”, “*Static AI*”) may be useful for internal classification or as temporary indicators but their lack of specificity makes it difficult to track malware over time or correlate research findings.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/5-1024x759.png)

To solve this, we decided to give this malware a proper name: **Zhong Stealer**, inspired by the email address of the first submitter to hit the ticketing system. From now on, we’ll track all these strains under this family name.

Now that we’ve made a new “friend”, let’s play with it a little bit.

## Dissecting Zhong

Running Zhong Stealer in ANY.RUN revealed its behavior almost immediately. Upon execution, it queried a C2 server based in Hong Kong, hosted by Alibaba Cloud.
