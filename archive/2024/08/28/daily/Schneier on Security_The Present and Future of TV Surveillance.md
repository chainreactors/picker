## The Present and Future of TV Surveillance

Ars Technica has a [good article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/tv-industrys-ads-tracking-obsession-is-turning-your-living-room-into-a-store/) on what’s happening in the world of television surveillance. More than even I realized.

“Some TVs remove basic features like Internet connectivity if you don’t let them track you.”

At least for now, my TV works fine as a TV without being connected to the internet.

We have a nice smart TV but have never connected it to our network: it gets its signal strictly from the cable box, or from attached HDMI doodads (Amazon Fire stick, etc.), and in this respect we can keep our television from spying on us to the extent we’re not watching Amazon.

I guess the next step in the arms race are televisions that will simply not function without an internet connection, which will require more shenanigans to get around.

> what’s happening in the world of television surveillance

This is specifically about televisions surveilling their users—bad, but only the tip of the iceberg. Also, avoidable by using computer monitors and digital signage displays. Yeah, I know they cost more and are not as easy to get, particularly in large sizes, but it’s up to you to decide how much your privacy is worth. I grew up with a 20-inch television as my main set, and later a 27-incher—often using smaller ones when the main one was occupied—so I don’t quite get why people think it’s crazy to have anything less than 40 or 50.

(I don’t put much stock in the common advice of “just don’t connect it to your wi-fi”. It may work for now, but the data’s probably still accumulating on the device with no way to wipe it, set to be leaked when you get rid of it or when a kid or guest connects it to be “helpful” because your Netflix button wasn’t working. Eventually, manufacturers may just make the devices scan for open wi-fi, or make deals to use Xfinity and the like. Also, data-only cellular devices and plans are so cheap—like 7 USD each in bulk for chips, and a similar amount for 10 years of service—that it’s hard to believe the manufacturers haven’t considered them.)

20-25 years ago, nobody knew what you were watching. Well, sometimes I did, when I saw 4 dark apartments flashing in the same way and flicked through the channels to match it, or when someone simply left their curtains open. But a broadcaster wouldn’t know what channel you were tuned to (unless you chosen by Neilson, kept an accurate log, and sent it in); a cable company wouldn’t know. Nobody was collecting bulk data without consent.

That changed with digital cable. Now, not only does a subscriber have to wait hundreds or thousands of milliseconds to tune a channel, their box has to request the channel from the provider. So, assuming the cable-network has stopped running analog signals, they know exactly what everyone’s watching. Do you think they’re passing up that income? Internet-based streaming makes that even more obvious: everything’s by specific request only, and for shows rather than channels. Netflix was already suspected to be in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act in 2009, and the law was amended and I guess Netflix changed some things, but there are new providers all the time—often located in other countries than their users. I expect the illegal-data-sharing wrist-slap cycle to continue.

Repurposing old hardware seems to be a way around this, although you would need a pre-existing TV that doesn’t record your screen:

The article just states the obvious.

What i seldom see connected is the Orwellian [Telescreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen) concept of joining smartphone under-screen camera technology and smart TVs.

@ b tyson, ALL,

Re : You don’t need eyes to see.

For quire sometime now I’ve been warning about “Smart-meters” and their ability by “power signature” to know what you are doing.

Your,

> “20-25 years ago, nobody knew what you were watching. Well, sometimes I did, when I saw 4 dark apartments flashing in the same way and flicked through the channels to match it”

Can be done by any smart-meter in any home and “signal it back” to the Power Grid utility monitoring center (or elsewhere with GSM modems built in).

The reason it can be done, is the more “power efficient” a flat screen TV or even computer is the more information it conveys through the Switch Mode PSU to the wiring in your home.

Thus the “low frequency” of screen background changes –at frame rate– gets easily seen. The only question is how many seconds does it need to identify which channel you are watching of “live broadcast” or “broadcast streaming” or identify the film from “on demand” or even DVD/BlueRay?

The answer is surprisingly little where there is for instance dialogue and the camera switches from face to face and the backgrounds change with it, or there is a slow pan or street scene with vehicles moving.

And because it’s “low frequency data” –integrated over ten frames or so– the amount of storage required for the signature for a two hour move is really quite small (say 72,000 bytes).

This data can be further compressed i...
