The UK government is on the hunt for a new CTO after incumbent David Knott announced his departure, citing family reasons.

The role is [advertised](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/jobs.cgi?jcode=1975626) with a starting salary of between £100,000 and £162,500, although the online post makes clear that anyone coming from outside the civil service "will be expected to start at the salary minimum if successful." Alongside the salary, a pension contribution of £28,970 will be made.

The starting salary is not promising. [One estimate](https://www.morganmckinley.com/uk/salary-guide/data/chief-technology-officer-cto/london) suggests a CTO in London might be paid between £130,000 and £160,000 a year, but that could be a business of any size. The average salary for a CTO in the UK ranges from £100,000 to £250,000 per year, according to [another estimate](https://churchill-executive.co.uk/salary-analysis-for-chief-technical-officers-insights-for-executive-recruitment/).
