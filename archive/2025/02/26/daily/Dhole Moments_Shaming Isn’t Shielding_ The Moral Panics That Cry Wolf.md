If you’ve been around the furry fandom for a while, you will notice that discourse tends to have a cyclical nature to it. I’ve [written about this topic before](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/24/resolving-the-reoccurring-discourse-on-furry-twitter/). [More than once](https://soatok.blog/2022/06/21/a-greymuzzles-lament/). And even covered it [from a security nerd’s perspective](https://soatok.blog/2022/03/30/on-the-insecurity-of-social-media-callouts/).

Most of the time, when unproductive discourse happens in the furry parts of social media, it’s promulgated by individuals that usually employ the same tactics and rhetoric.

After you’ve observed enough bad faith call-out posts on social media over the years, a rough outline for a playbook starts to emerge, which I will now describe.

## A Playbook For Harassment

First, collect a bunch of screenshots from kink-oriented chat rooms and private 1:1 conversations that involve popular furries (content creators, etc.). Secret “After Dark Twitter” accounts for relatively popular furries are perfect for this.

The deeper you can sink your hooks into the private lives of adults that happen to have any sort of social media following, the better. Social engineering skills are useful here, but basic social-climbing behaviors can also be effective.

Next, sort the illicitly obtained screenshots into vague categories. It’s important that these categories be as ambiguous as possible.

You can spend as much time as you want on the first two steps. Once you have enough “dirt”, it’s time to weave your narrative.

Choose one of these vague categories from step two, and then describe it poorly. For example:

* If your victims are into [ABDL](https://www.beknowntherapy.com/blog/abdl) kink, call it “cub porn”, so as to imply that they’re all pedophiles without actually calling them pedophiles (and opening yourself up to the possibility of being sued for libel).
* If their fursonas are typically drawn on four legs, your call-out is going to be about “feral” to imply that everyone involved is a zoophile.

To obfuscate your sleight-of-hand and lend your call-out some cheap credibility, include some people who are actually known pedophiles or zoophiles.

Next, dump all of this together into a Google Doc, making sure to confuse the topic as much as possible in your write-up so they think everyone is maximally terrible.

Once this is all done, post a link to your Google Doc on social media (usually with an accompanying video, so your victims cannot find it if they search for their own names, and so it’s more attractive to the sort of Internet users that have short attention spans and therefore more likely to “go viral”).

Have other people in your group boost it onto everyone else’s timelines. Sextortion cults like [Furry Valley](https://soatok.blog/2021/01/14/welcome-to-the-furry-fandom/#furry-valley) are useful for this, but so are private Discord servers full of people as hateful as you.

Now kick back and watch a mob get whipped up into a frenzy, as they spread hate towards someone for having a poorly-understood kink that they were practicing safely with other consensual adults.

Congratulations, you just made the Internet a worse place for everyone!

## This Is Stupid

If you want to make the furry fandom a safer place–especially for younger furries–this isn’t going to accomplish *jack shit*.

Sexual abuse is a topic filled with unfortunate realities that society fails to grapple with. The biggest danger of sexual abuse isn’t some random sicko, but [someone you know and probably somewhat trust](https://rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens).

![Circle graph explaining that 93 percent of child victims know their perpetrator. 59% of perpetrators are acquaintances, 34% are family members, and 7% are strangers.](https://i0.wp.com/soatok.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png?resize=768%2C603&ssl=1)

From RAINN (see previous link)

A random adult that roleplays on the Internet with other consenting adults isn’t inherently a risk to any child, anywhere–no matter how weird you may find their roleplay.

And I write this as someone who is personally *severely uncomfortable* with many of the kinks in question!

Just because something squicks you personally doesn’t mean it’s harmful. The people that employ the sort of playbook I sketched out above are ***counting on*** that initial emotional reaction overtaking your ability to reason.

The purpose of these campaigns isn’t to protect children or animals from being harmed.

They aren’t even meant to enact vigilante justice on the abusers that evade law enforcement (though some of them do adopt that aesthetic if their audience is more amenable to it).

The goal of these campaigns is to provoke other people to harass them, so they’ll feel a deep sense of shame about something that *isn’t fucking hurting anyone*.

> As with [stochastic terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_terrorism), the goal is to harm by proxy so that the person writing the Google Doc is never directly liable for any violence enacted on their victims.
>
> If that sounds cowardly, that’s because it is.

### This Isn’t Actually Helping Anyone

People that care about protecting kids from sexual predators don’t creep on strangers then drop intimate conversations into Google Docs to spread on harassment websites.

They help their communities organize resistance to the tactics employed by abusers.

They provide resources and help to people who are at risk of being victimized, or of being groomed into being an accomplice.

This is all boring, thankless, exhausting work–often done under some level of necessary anonymity.

Sure, it doesn’t get you a hundred thousand followers on your favorite social media platform. But having skin in the game and *actually helping solve the problem* isn’t meant to earn clout.

### Why The Harassment Playbook Works

The main reason this works is because recent history has several noteworthy examples of furries with large followings being outed as [horrible](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Hakan_Yote#Controversies) [people](https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Hypnotist_Sappho#Controversy).

In the aftermath of these discoveries, many of their fans dug their heels in and maintained absolute loyalty to the influencer in question. This fanned the flames of discourse for years....
