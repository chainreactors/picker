# Perplexity AI ignores no-crawling rules on websites, crawls them anyway

Posted: August 6, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Imagine putting up a no-trespassing sign for people walking their dogs, and then finding out that one person dresses up their Great Dane as a calf and walks it on your grounds.

Well that’s sort of what [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) answer engine Perplexity has been doing, by evading the no-crawl directives of websites, according to [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives).

The no-trespassing sign in this case would be a robots.txt file—a small text file placed on a website that tells search engines and other automated tools (often called “bots” or “crawlers”) which pages or sections of the site they are allowed to access and which parts they should not visit.

Cloudflare started an investigation after customers complained that Perplexity accessed their content despite the fact that they had disallowed Perplexity crawling activity in their robots.txt files. They had also created Web Application [Firewall](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/firewall) (WAF) rules to specifically block both of Perplexity’s declared crawlers: PerplexityBot and Perplexity-User.

So Cloudflare set up some test domains and queried Perplexity about them to see if it would return the information that it shouldn’t be able to access. What the researchers found was surprising, because it looks like Perplexity uses a very deliberate system to bypass the no-crawling directives.

The researchers discovered the use of a [user-agent](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/08/explained-user-agent) designed to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS (to look like a regular user) when their declared crawler was blocked. The User Agent String shows the website you’re visiting some basic information about your browser and operating system, so the site can provide an experience optimized for that setup. The Perplexity crawler camouflaged by this User Agent String used regularly changing IP-addresses outside of Perplexity’s official [IP](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) range, allowing it to successfully access the content it wasn’t supposed to.

I wondered Perplexity’s view on the whole thing, so I asked it whether it knew what a robots.txt file was for and why it was bad to ignore one. It returned the following:

> Why is it wrong to ignore robots.txt?
>
> * Respect for Privacy and Security: Some parts of a website may contain private, sensitive, or unfinished content not meant for public search engines. Ignoring robots.txt can expose data that should remain private.
> * Fair Resource Usage: Crawling websites takes up [bandwidth](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bandwidth) and server resources. By telling robots where not to go, website owners can prevent wasteful use of these resources, ensuring the site runs smoothly for real users.
> * Legal and Ethical Standards: Ignoring robots.txt can be considered unethical, and in certain circumstances, it might even break terms of service or data protection regulations depending on what information is accessed and how it’s used.
