Denmark‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Government is [phasing out](https://politiken.dk/viden/tech/art10437680/Caroline-Stage-udfaser-Microsoft-i-Digitaliseringsministeriet "Link to media report") its use of Microsoft Office‚Ä¶ to switch to open source alternatives like LibreOffice instead.

Why? Because relying too heavily on a US tech giant for your nation‚Äôs digital infrastructure is starting to feel a bit‚Ä¶ well, risky.

Denmark‚Äôs relationship with the US is under strain, following Donald Trump‚Äôs clearly stated ambition to seize control of Greenland, and recent reports of increased spying by the States on Greenland and Denmark.

You can‚Äôt blame Denmark for being concerned. Its government‚Äôs sensitive data is nestled deep within a proprietary cloud on another country. One that is being less than friendly to you. It seems fair for Denmark to ask ‚Äì is this sensible?

Ultimately it‚Äôs a question of cost, trust, national security, and digital resilience.

I would be surprised if more countries weren‚Äôt considering a similar move.
