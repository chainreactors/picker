One of the greatest challenges for any cybersecurity professional is keeping up with the constantly-evolving threats that emerge on a daily basis. The standard operating procedure for most infosec teams is to develop a “security mesh” of overlapping defenses, typically anchored around detection and response tools that identify malicious activity in the environment and alert on these threats. These solutions tend to take a reactive approach that often leaves the organization in question vulnerable to net new (novel) attacks.

Many cybersecurity professionals have started taking more proactive approaches to security, leveraging methods that disrupt and neutralize threats before they take action. By bolstering defenses with tools powered by the advanced adoption of modern technologies that harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, security teams are able to anticipate and disrupt novel methods introduced in these attacks.
