# Neo-Nazis Linked to “Terrorist Activities” to Host Budapest Concert

January 30, 2025

A branch of an international neo-Nazi network the UK government [suspects](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/extreme-right-wing-group-sanctioned-by-hm-treasury-under-domestic-counter-terrorism-regulations) of involvement in terrorist activity is organising a two-day concert in Budapest. It won’t be for the first time.

“More than 10 bands from Europe” will take the stage in early February, according to the Hungarian affiliate of [Blood & Honour](https://www.counterextremism.com/supremacy/blood-honour-bh) (B&H), a UK-founded international neo-Nazi music network.

The gig is the most recent in a series of international neo-Nazi [events](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/05/03/international-far-right-fight-night-comes-to-budapest/) held in the [Hungarian capital](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/18/from-pittsburgh-to-budapest-hungary-to-play-host-to-another-far-right-extremist-meetup/), some of which have been [banned](https://balkaninsight.com/2022/02/02/hungary-bans-annual-neo-nazi-gathering-in-budapest/) in previous years. [February](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/2/8/neo-nazis-from-across-europe-rally-in-budapest) is especially important for Hungarian and international far-right groups. Many travel to Budapest to honour Nazi and collaborationist forces who attempted to flee the besieged Hungarian capital in February 1945. They have billed these events as a ‘Day of Honour’.

“Blood & Honour is an international right-wing terrorist network,” Thorsten Hindrichs, an expert on European far-right music scenes from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, told Bellingcat.

“I fear that the festival will contribute to the further normalisation of right-wing extremism and terrorism, especially if [state security authorities and political officials](https://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/police-in-hungary-stand-ready-to-prevent-repeat-of-antifa-attacks) simply let it happen without further ado,” Hindrichs added.

“Hungary.….has declared zero tolerance against Nazi ideology, open anti-Semitism and racism,” a representative for the country’s national police told Bellingcat. The police “will take firm, unambiguous action against extremist manifestations, in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, where necessary.”

## Concerts Are a Significant Source of Revenue

Concerts aren’t just about music for the far-right. They are also an important source of income from ticket sales and merchandise, researchers of the International Centre for Counter-terrorism (ICCT), a Netherlands-based think tank, wrote in a 2024 [analysis](https://icct.nl/publication/tuning-hate-uncovering-risks-associated-far-right-music-festivals-france). Far-right fashion items are especially important merchandise, as Bellingcat has [shown](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/05/24/fascist-fashion-how-mainstream-businesses-enable-the-sale-of-far-right-merchandise/).

The cost of the February 2025 concert is advertised on Blood & Honour’s website at €30 as a “support fee both days” (*“támogatás mindkét nap”* in Hungarian), though it is unclear from the wording in both languages whether this fee is for the whole event or 30 euros for each day. Organisers only accept cash payments and indicated the concert would take place “on private land somewhere in Hungary.”

Last February, Blood & Honour’s Hungarian branch charged a total of €45 for a two-day event. They also highlighted the opportunity to buy merchandise, including items from the so-called Blood & Honour “support shop”. While the branch advertises merchandise on its website, it is only available for sale at in-person events. Many of the items use open Nazi symbolism, with one shirt bearing a Totenkopf over a swastika with text beneath reading ‘White Power.’

In October 2024, another two-day neo-Nazi concert took place at a [community hall](https://www.muvhazcsomor.hu/) in Csömör, a village near Budapest. Ticket prices were €100; a Telegram channel promoting the concert claimed 300 tickets would be available, suggesting that ticket sales alone likely brought in tens of thousands of euros in revenue. Hungarian media [reports](https://telex.hu/belfold/2025/01/27/budaors-raktarepulet-titkos-neonaci-buli-december-rendorseg-nav) have suggested that the community hall was rented under false pretences by the neo-Nazis, with a private individual reportedly claiming it was for a birthday party with foreign guests. The event was promoted as the ten-year anniversary of the [French neo-Nazi](https://www.streetpress.com/sujet/1615331185-fights-clubs-neonazis-extreme-droite-zouaves-generation-identitaire-hooligans-supremacistes) and Blood & Honour [affiliate](https://www.belltower.news/kampf-der-nibelungen-eine-sportveranstaltung-von-und-fuer-neonazis-42850/) Tomasz Szkatulski’s fashion brand.

Local activists [identified](https://archive.ph/eYtey) the location after the concert. Using a video posted on Szkatulski’s Telegram channel from the event and comparing it to imagery from the community hall, Bellingcat was able to independently confirm the geolocation.

Szkatulski was banned from entering Germany and Bulgaria in 2023, following a Bellingcat [investigation](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/05/03/international-far-right-fight-night-comes-to-budapest/) into the far-right “International Fight Night” planned for Budapest in May that year.  Szkatulski was a co-organiser and participant of the event.

In December 2024, yet another neo-Nazi [concert](https://telex.hu/belfold/2025/01/27/budaors-raktarepulet-titkos-neonaci-buli-december-rendorseg-nav) was held just west of Budapest, as reported by Hungarian media outlet [Telex](https://telex.hu/english/2025/01/27/police-and-the-tax-authorities-raided-a-secret-neo-nazi-night-in-budaors). Hosted by a Budapest-based “cultural association” and music label with ties to Blood & Honour, this concert featured international neo-Nazi bands with antisemitic lyrics, including a Greek [band](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/09/04/the-hardcore-russian-neo-nazi-group-that-calls-ukraine-home/) that openly advocates violence against Jews in their songs.
