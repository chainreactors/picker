# Newspaper evades Russian censors, hides news in Counter-Strike map

Posted: May 5, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

A Finnish newspaper is making clever use of popular video game titles to promote press freedom and [bypass Russian media restrictions](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/03/finnish-newspaper-hides-news-reports-for-russians-in-online-game) regarding the invasion of Ukraine. The plan: Hide a secret room underneath a map, which players can stumble upon and see facts, figures, and photographs of what’s been going on.

The map is a custom built design intended to be used in the game [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/), playable via the Steam platform. We decided to take a look at how effective this is in practice, and what’s contained in the hidden room.

Is this the part where I fire up my ancient Counter-Strike account? It sure is.

## Finding the map

First thing’s first. The map is a custom build, not designed by the game developers. How do you find it? The answer is to [visit the game’s Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969831273). This is where custom made content for eligible games on Steam can be found, from maps and weapons to in-game objects or playable characters, depending on the title.

![The Most Popular Maps panel on the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Workshop page](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/easset_upload_file18100_265972_e.jpg)

The map, *de\_vonya*, currently displays as the most popular map of the week so it’s off to a good start. The map description says:

> On the surface, it seems like a normal Slavic city. However, there might be something hidden underneath.

If you click on the map to open its page, and then hit the green “Subscribe” button, the map will be available next time you load up the game.

## Finding the room

Counter-Strike is a team based first person shooter, where small teams race to complete objectives. I haven’t played in years, so I took the easy way out and set up a custom game with the only other combatants being bots. Playing against other people would be a surefire way to make a mess of this exploratory adventure.

The central idea of this map is to accidentally stumble upon the room containing the free press style content. In practice, this proves to be rather difficult.

The first problem: You can’t access the secret room unless you’re dead (don’t worry, I’ll come back to this). While playing normally, the door remains resolutely shut no matter what you try.

“How do I access the room when I’m dead,” you say? Well, when you die in Counter-Strike you can watch your teammates or you can float around the whole map and take in all of the action. In this state, you have no collision detection. In other words, players who are still alive will stop moving if they walk into an object like a wall. While dead, you’re essentially a floating camera and will pass right through it.

The second problem: Counter-Strike rounds are *short*, around a couple of minutes. They’re short enough with [bot](https://www.malwarebytes.com/bot), but with actual humans playing, everything can be over very quickly indeed. Even with bots set to the easiest difficulty...
