Israeli private electric plane will soon be ready for take off

“The day when you will be able to enter your garage, hop into a personal aircraft and cruise above the congested traffic on the streets below is coming closer.

Air EV, based in Pardes Hana, Israel, expects to start delivering its two-seater, battery-operated electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft late next year, with hundreds of people already signed up to join the urban air mobility revolution.

Leveraging major advances in electric propulsion, eVTOL aircraft offer the average person the ability to “drive in the sky,” while providing an environmentally sustainable solution to a growing urban transportation problem. Simple to fly, and priced to compete with a high-end luxury car, Air EV’s AIR ONE aircraft is designed for private commuter and recreational use.

“We sell the aircraft for a base price of $150,000. It will probably come closer to $200,000 by the time we deliver,” says CEO and Co-Founder Rani Plaut. “We intend to deliver the first units at the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025.”

Plaut estimates that potential revenue could be in the billions of dollars.

The startup is on track to receive clearance from the US Federation Aviation Administration. The company plans to transfer most of its operations and research and development to the US for further flight testing and certification collaboration with the FAA.

AIR ONE recently reached a major milestone with its first unmanned flight over the skies of southern Israel, successfully transitioning from hover flight to cruise flight. Its next text phase will be with someone onboard, Plaut says.

==>The vehicle has a range of 100 miles on a single charge, and can fly up to 155 miles per hour at an altitude of 1,200 feet. The aircraft, powered by a battery much like an electric car battery, is zero-emission and designed to take off and land on any flat surface.
Measuring about 25 feet by 8 feet, it has collapsible wings to allow easy parking. It requires only about 15 to 30 hours of training. The company’s goal is that no pilot’s license will be necessary.”

Computer scientist and author Brian Christian talks to MSM about one of the fundamental problems of AI development in his book *The Alignment Problem*: how do we ensure machine learning systems represent the best human values rather than magnify the worst?

represent the best human values

Right.

The best human values require the virtues of prudence and equity, whose decisions can’t be legislated/calculated in advance and are not available to a machine. Reality will always hack the machine.

Just a few weeks ago, there was some discussion here of an intelligence summary concerning the mysterious “Havana syndrome.”

Three days ago, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a detailed report (with heavy redactions) which perhaps contradicts that summary.

<https://media.salon.com/pdf/22-cv-674%20Final%20Response%20Package.pdf>

Some conclusions:

• the syndrome has no identifiable natural cause

• it is not consistent with mass psychogenic illness

• pulsed electromagnetic energy remains a plausible explanation for some of the cases

@MarkH noone on earth believes ‘Havana Syndrome’ is real. It’s just CIA and State Department filth mad that they didn’t get stationed in Paris having a hissy fit.

@MarkH

The term AHI is preferred as incidents began in other locations long before any reports came out of Havana. Where those exact locations are, what happened, – classified. How it works – classified.

synergistic and combined EM/thermal effects

No one is allowed inside reactors either when they are operating. They put microwave screens inside the doors of microwave ovens for a good reason. The two are completely different technologies, but they will both cook your face if you play around with them.

However in the case of AHIs it is a slightly different property we are looking at in the transmission of energy and the induction over the surface of the skin. Pop a fork in a power socket (don’t do this) and what happens?

On December 10th of 2013, CVE-2013-3900 was published pertaining to a vulnerability in WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation, which allows attackers to exploit the padding of a Windows Authenticode signature to gain control of a system. Microsoft’s solution was to offer a ‘opt-in’ solution that could be activated by adding a pair of registry keys.
