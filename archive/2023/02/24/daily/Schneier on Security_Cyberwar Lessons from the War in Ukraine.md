## Cyberwar Lessons from the War in Ukraine

The Aspen Institute has published a good analysis of the successes, failures, and absences of cyberattacks as part of the current war in Ukraine: “[The Cyber Defense Assistance Imperative ­ Lessons from Ukraine](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/the-cyber-defense-assistance-imperative-lessons-from-ukraine/).”

Its conclusion:

> Cyber defense assistance in Ukraine is working. The Ukrainian government and Ukrainian critical infrastructure organizations have better defended themselves and achieved higher levels of resiliency due to the efforts of CDAC and many others. But this is not the end of the road—the ability to provide cyber defense assistance will be important in the future. As a result, it is timely to assess how to provide organized, effective cyber defense assistance to safeguard the post-war order from potential aggressors.
>
> The conflict in Ukraine is resetting the table across the globe for geopolitics and international security. The US and its allies have an imperative to strengthen the capabilities necessary to deter and respond to aggression that is ever more present in cyberspace. Lessons learned from the ad hoc conduct of cyber defense assistance in Ukraine can be institutionalized and scaled to provide new approaches and tools for preventing and managing cyber conflicts going forward.

I am often asked why where weren’t more successful cyberattacks by Russia against Ukraine. I generally give four reasons: (1) Cyberattacks are more effective in the “grey zone” between peace and war, and there are better alternatives once the shooting and bombing starts. (2) Setting these attacks up takes time, and Putin was secretive about his plans. (3) Putin was concerned about attacks spilling outside the war zone, and affecting other countries. (4) Ukrainian defenses were good, aided by other countries and companies. This paper gives a fifth reason: they were technically successful, but keeping them out of the news made them operationally unsuccessful.

> (4) Ukrainian defenses were good, aided by other countries and companies

I think eight years of Russian cyber-warfare have forced the Ukrainian defenses, and infrastructure, to be very resilient.

*Key lessons from Ukraine’s eight-year struggle against russian cyber warfare*

> Many experts correctly predicted that kinetic military actions in Ukraine would be synchronized with extensive cyber operations. The russian invasion of Ukraine proves that we live in a world where businesses and governments must consider simultaneous threats as inherently intertwined: both nation-backed cyber-attacks on local IT systems and infrastructure, and traditional military threats directly resulting from war. Since the beginning of russia’s full-scale war in February 2022, Ukraine has been the target of numerous cyber-attacks that have impacted public institutions, private organizations, and individual citizens. This includes attacks on energy, telecommunications, media, and financial entities considered part of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure.

> What can the Ukrainian experience of successful defending infrastructure teach other countries about building cyber resilience? And how can other countries best implement these lessons?

In relation to this story, [a report in The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/23/russia_fake_missile_alerts/?td=rt-3a), it appears that hackers, purported to be of Ukrainian origin (if you take the propaganda at face value, which you probably shouldn’t), are faking “missile attack” alerts in Russia.

Rather horrifying if these are actually taking place, since they potentially push us to a disastrous nuclear exchange with Russia, which nobody will win.

I see basically two types of actors who would try such a thing:

* 1. Ukrainians or allies want to show Russians how the Ukrainians feel
* 1. Russian propagandists want to create a war spirit against Ukraine/USA/NATO

The Record provides some additional background on the development of the Cyber Defense Assistance Collaborative (CDAC).

It also links to a Click Here episode (and transcript) featuring a personal account from CDAC’s founder Greg Rattray and others.

> TEMPLE-RASTON: It was the Ukrainian version of one of those old Brooklyn deals: He knew a guy who knew a guy who might know some other people who might lend a hand. It turns out that around the same time Vol began looking for extra help protecting Naftogaz and other critical infrastructure in Ukraine, Greg Rattray was looking for ways he could help.

@ Bruce, ALL,

Re : Lessons that should be learned.

These cyber-attacks as we now call them have a long history of institutional failure for profit behind them going back oh four decades or so to my certain knowledge.

This is a little long, but hopefully worth the read by most people as it has important lessons from repeated failings in it.

Long term readers will know that I think using the Internet to carry critical infrastructure “command and control” to save a few pennies...
