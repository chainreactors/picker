This year, nearly half of U.S. states passed laws imposing age verification requirements on online platforms. EFF has opposed these efforts because they censor the internet and burden access to online speech. Though age verification mandates are often touted as “online safety” measures for kids, the laws actually do more harm than good. They undermine the fundamental speech rights of adults and young people alike, create new barriers to internet access, and put at risk all internet users’ privacy, anonymity, and security.

Age verification bills generally require online services to verify all users’ ages—often through invasive tools like ID checks, biometric scans, and other dubious “age estimation” methods—before granting them access to certain online content or services. Some state bills mandate the age verification explicitly, including [Texas’s H.B. 1181](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HB01181H.htm), [Florida’s H.B. 3](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/BillText/er/PDF), and [Indiana’s S.B. 17](https://legiscan.com/IN/text/SB0017/id/2950361/Indiana-2024-SB0017-Enrolled.pdf). Other state bills claim not to require age verification, but still threaten platforms with liability for showing certain content or features to minor users. These bills—including [Mississippi’s H.B. 1126](https://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2024/pdf/HB/1100-1199/HB1126SG.pdf), [Ohio’s Parental Notification by Social Media Operators Act](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-1349.09), ...
