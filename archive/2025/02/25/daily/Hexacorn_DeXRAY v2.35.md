# DeXRAY v2.35

Posted on [2025-02-24](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/02/24/dexray-v2-35/ "10:58 pm")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

Today I got an updated version of DeXRAY from [TheMythologist](https://github.com/TheMythologist). He was kind enough to add code to support Fortinet quarantine files (using the [maldump](https://github.com/NUKIB/maldump) guys’ research as a base).

Thanks to TheMythologist and maldump researchers!

Download the latest version [here](https://hexacorn.com/d/DeXRAY.pl).
