## Critical Vulnerability in Open SSL

There are no details yet, but it’s really important that you [patch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/openssl-warns-of-critical-security-vulnerability-with-upcoming-patch/) Open SSL 3.x when the new version comes out on Tuesday.

> How bad is “Critical”? According to OpenSSL, an issue of [critical severity](https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html) affects common configurations and is also likely exploitable.
>
> It’s likely to be abused to disclose server memory contents, and potentially reveal user details, and could be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or execute code execute remotely. In other words, pretty much everything you don’t want happening on your production systems.

@ ALL,

Re : There are no details yet.

So one “YOU HAVE TO ACT ON” if you run SSL 3.x… Because the last SSL critical warnings were nasty nasty nasty, so you don’t want to be on the list of entities “Shish kebabed” by this one.

But to little is currently “public” to say what is or is not vulnerable or why, thus how to mitigate it.

My advice based on what I know from past experience is “mittigation in advance” rarely is actually counter productive, if done judiciously.

But like most you probably do not have sufficient technical information available to you to do any mittigation with a surgical precision. Thus any systems with SSL 3.x on them, even if you do not think it’s in use need to be put on a list to be mitigated.

But that just brings up the “How to mitigate?” question to which there are only realy two answers currently,

1, Not being communications connected.

My reasoning would be the first for a few days might be the only option for most systems. With the second reserved only for systems that have to be connected.

Oh and remember, by “connected” I do not just mean “the Internet” because if this vulneravility is in use, then it can also be used on any and all networks where an attacker internal or externally could have reached…

So fingers crossed folks, and lets hope the law of,

“Target Rich Environment Probability”

Rolls the dice favourably for you.

@ Clive Robinson,

That’s OpenSSL 3.x, not to be confused with the deprecated SSL 3.0 protocol (from 1996) that people should’ve stopped running long ago.

> But that just brings up the “How to mitigate?” question to which there are only realy two answers currently,

You missed one that seems obvious to me: switching to another implementation. Perhaps you intentionally omitted it—it could easily be counter-productive, as you hint. But there are several other choices of implementation that could be used in principle, including the long-term-supported OpenSSL 1.x.

There’s also the general idea of privilege separation, which should be used as much as possible. For example, there’s no good reason to run an ASN.1 parser in any context with access to private keys, or to have two TLS clients sharing heap memory (Heartbleed should’ve made that obvious). That said, there’s a good chance privsep would do nothing against this specific problem.

@ Reba, ALL,

> “You missed one that seems obvious to me: switching to another implementation.”

Yes it’s possible, but…

In theory come Nov 1st there will be a seamless series of patches / upgrades, so time or more correctly the shortness of it comes into play.

Based on that you can make an argument –and some already have– that the time window is too short for attackers to find / reverse / use the vulnerability.

Which brings in the question of available resources within the time frame and how best to deploy them.

If the “they can not find / use” argument is true, and I’m not saying it is, then one option is the,

“Do nothing other than watch intently and pull the switch if things look hinky.”

It falls in line with the notion of a “target rich environment” and the number of potential attackers is very small, hence the probability of being attacked for most in the short time frame is low.

However it was not that long ago about teb months, that the “Online World” apparently very nearly died due to Log4J and the resulting Log4Shell vulnerability.

Of which the following was said[1],

> *“Log4Shell, an internet vulnerability that affects millions of computers, involves an obscure but nearly ubiquitous piece of software, Log4j. The software is used to record all manner of activities that go on under the hood in a wide range of computer systems.”*

You could take out of that “Log4Shell”, and replace with “Open4Hell” or what every the new vulnerability will be named. And likewise replace “Log4j” with “OpenSSL 3.0”, oh and replace “to record” with just a simple “for” and it would be right on the button (so one “Press release intro written”).

Now “if” and it’s a very big “if” people have done not just “software inventories”, “dependency graphs” and the like that got pushed out from the Oval Office, then in theory they could pull out OpenSSL 3.x and drop in something else.

But really? One thing developers are known to do is “abuse interfaces” and sadly in many cases just “cut-n-paste example code” from the web or similar is not the least of what they do… So much so in fact you get,

<https://www.openssl.org/policies/technical/api-compat.html>

As a result with it’s warning of,

> *“No changes to existing public API functions and data are permitted. “*

Is as much applicable to developers using OpenSSL as much as it is to the developers of the OpenSSL package. Many still have quite bitter memories of what happened in the history of SSL and the sense of betrayal etc that came out, and the long months trying to sort out the resulting mess.

So whilst I’m not adverse to people doing a “plug-n-play swap” to a different package (but not 1.1.1r[2]) the questions arise of,

1, Can they?
2, Correctly tested?
3, In the time fram...
