# Protect your clouds

Sponsored Post According to the [2024 IBM Cost of the Data Breach Report](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-07-30-ibm-report-escalating-data-breach-disruption-pushes-costs-to-new-highs) 40 percent of data breaches identified between March 2023 and February 2024 involved data stored across multiple environments, including the cloud.

What's more, the cost of breached data stored in public clouds during that period incurred the highest average breach cost at US$5.17m (compared to US$4.88m averaged across all environments).

Those figures highlight the importance of safeguarding cloud infrastructure against potential data losses which can come from multiple sources - everything from sophisticated cyber attacks and unauthorised access to skill shortages and misconfiguration errors. The subsequent damage to organisational finances and reputations this type of incident causes pushes cyber security professionals to constantly be on top of their game, which means adopting new defensive skills and strategies whenever the opportunity is available.
