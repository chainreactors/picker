## Hacking Digital License Plates

Not everything needs to be digital and “smart.” License plates, [for example](https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/):

> Josep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a technique to “jailbreak” digital license plates sold by Reviver, the leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a cable to its internal connectors, he’s able to rewrite a Reviver plate’s firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show any characters or image.
>
> […]
>
> Because the vulnerability that allowed him to rewrite the plates’ firmware exists at the hardware level­—in Reviver’s chips themselves—Rodriguez says there’s no way for Reviver to patch the issue with a mere software update. Instead, it would have to replace those chips in each display.

The whole point of a license plate is that it can’t be modified. Why in the world would anyone think that a digital version is a good idea?

I remember someone trying to do this a couple decades ago, wonder if it is the same people.

Maybe for their next trick, they could try digital physical currency. Why shouldn’t your Dollar become a Euro on demand?

I think it would be great for privacy if your license plate number changed every 24 hours, and only the state could translate the plate number to a specific car and owner.

Color me completely unsurprised that these turned out to be easy to hack.

The one plausible use case I’ve heard for a digital plate is to be able to press a button in the car and have the plate change to flash “call police” if, like, someone carjacks you and forces you to drive somewhere. But there are still a myriad of problems with that idea, and even if there weren’t, it still doesn’t justify this otherwise totally unnecessary and problematic technology.

It’s not just ‘this new technology adds obvious and unacceptable security risks’, it’s ‘what does it gain us?’ What new features does a digital license plate enable that couldn’t be done with a screwdriver in five minutes?

Is the eventual goal to have all cars equipped with this from the factory? Is there some kind of privacy-enabling feature that lets people get new plate numbers periodically so that private ALPRs can’t do long-term tracking? (I would be very surprised if that were the intent)

The point of the digital plates is to normalise vehicle tracking through a hardware that has to be fitted to every car, no matter how old, that’s on the road.

Three reasons I can think of.

This is good for a few individuals, but not for society at large.

The problem is that they focused on front-end presentation first. What they should have done is build a blockchain back-end, and *then* pulled the presentation from the blockchain.

One purpose of digital plates is that they flash the word STOLEN when stolen. So that’s pretty handy.

But criminals who know of this exploit can just put on their own fake digital plate instead.

So it’s a question of whether this prevents recovery of stolen cars more than the amount of people stealing them and using a digital plate to make it easier.

You have a typo: “Think” not “thing” in your last sentence

thing -> think

(And yes, my thought exactly.)

@ Bruce, All,

With regards,

> “The whole point of a license plate is that it can’t be modified. Why in the world would anyone thin[k] that a digital version is a good idea?”

That might be easier to explain than you might think…

First off store “shelf price labels” have gone E-Paper rather than be printed out and stuck on the front of the shelf as they used to be. They are sold as saving time and money (though the jury might be out for quite some time).

If you think about it a “one time price label” is in many ways the same as a “one time licence plate”.

Once you’ve “made the technology” changing it to do what on the surface is the same job is just a tiny change in a business model.

More interestingly it can be sold as “more secure” simply by having a hand unit/scanner that reads the vehicles VIN into the system to associate with the licence plate.

I can think of a whole load of other desirable sales features, including the various ways to reduce costs.

So unless people “understand” and most don’t then fundamental, foundational, failings, will cause the house of cards to fall.

The most fundamental problem of all is it is not possible in an “Off Line System” to,

“Tie an information object to a physical object.”

People keep trying and as we see with National and Similar ID Card systems they keep failing.
