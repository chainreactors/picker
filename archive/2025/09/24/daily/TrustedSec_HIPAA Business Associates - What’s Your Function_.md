Many organizations that work with health care providers receive requests to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) or inquiries about their compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security, Breach Notification, and Privacy Rules. In many cases these requests are an unnecessary result of the sender not understanding the HIPAA requirements related to Business Associates or choosing to treat every partner as a Business Associate because they feel that it results in less liability versus only sending BAAs to partners that fit the HIPAA definition of a Business Associate. This post takes a deep dive into the HIPAA definition of Business Associate to help organizations determine whether HIPAA applies to them.

This post is part of a series that helps understand HIPAA applicability. For other posts in this series see:

## Unnecessary BAA Problems

While some organizations may believe that sending BAAs to all partners reduces liability, this raises a few concerns.

Organizations that send unnecessary BAAs are excluding themselves from working with partners that may be a better fit but are not willing to agree to implement HIPAA requirements that don’t apply to them. Instead, these organizations are setting themselves up for partnerships with organizations that do not understand HIPAA well enough to realize the requirements do not apply (which does not bode well for their ability to implement the requirements).

Meanwhile, organizations that receive and sign unnecessary BAAs are wasting time and money attempting to comply with HIPAA requirements that should not apply to them. They are also exposing themselves to [direct liability for their non-compliance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.ht...
