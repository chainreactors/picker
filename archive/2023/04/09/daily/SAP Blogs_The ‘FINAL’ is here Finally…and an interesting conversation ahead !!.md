**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):**While writing code in ABAP, we often would like to declare **immutable variables** instead of mutable variables to avoid state like overwritten results or any unwanted changes

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Certainly. But do we have something of that sort in ABAP ?

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):**  Absolutely ![:slightly_smiling_face:](/html/@CB193FD929C1B3F628B5259D5B23C3AB/emoticons/1f642.png ":slightly_smiling_face:")

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Did we mean that we have something like FINAL ?

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):** Absolutely..So the **FINAL operator** is **finally here ![:smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:](/html/@07E15E26FDBEA98F7284414C1DA418B0/emoticons/1f60a.png ":smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:")**

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Woohoo !! Can you tell me a bit more about it ?

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):** So, whenever you want a variable to be filled at **exactly one write position** and to be read only at all other positions, we use an immutable variable. The value **cannot be changed at other write positions.**

They **prevent unwanted changes to the value of a variable** and guarantees the consistency of the value since the last/first write access.

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Cool !!

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):** They can be declared inline with the **declaration operator FINAL** of an declaration expression.

The inline declaration with **FINAL** works similar to the inline declaration with **DATA** for mutable variables.

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Sounds good till now !!

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):** It combines the robustness of a CONSTANT with the ability to be filed at any write position with multiple write access at the same position.

**Curious Developer ![:busts_in_silhouette:](/html/@4271BA37FC59DE9FAE633ABDC92331C1/emoticons/1f465.png ":busts_in_silhouette:"):** Gotcha. But could you explain what you meant by ***'filled at exactly one write position and to be read only at all other positions'***

**Helper Bot ![:robot_face:](/html/@6B5FDCB75BCB21A5598689D3A7A4F3A6/emoticons/1f916.png ":robot_face:"):** Sure. I'll explain that. Two things to consider here regarding the write access.

* a) *They can be filled at Single Write position*

```
1 DATA: lv_name TYPE matnr VALUE '888888888888_0_1  '.

2 FINAL(lv_trim) = shift_right( val = lv_name sub = '1').

3 "lv_trim = shift_right( val = lv_name sub = '_') <== Syntax Error / uncatchable exception MOVE_TO_LIT_NOTALLOWED_NODATA
```

Here immutable variable lv\_trim declared using FINAL is filed at Line 2.Hence this becomes its first and last write position.

If any other position i,e at Line 3 is used for write access for the same variable, then either a syntax error or uncatchable exception MOVE\_TO\_LIT\_NOTALLOWED\_NODATA will be raised.

* b) *They can be filed at Single Write position but Multiple Write access*

```
1 LOOP AT lt_data INTO FINAL(ls_data).

2  ls_data-bedat = sy-datum. <== Syntax Error / uncatchable exception MOVE_TO_LIT_NOTALLOWED_NODATA

3 ENDLOOP.
```

If you are declaring an immutable variable inside a loop, similar to the above example, here you have a write position at Line 1. You can be sure that your value is stable in each loop pass. Also here at the same write position i,e Line 1, through each loop pass, different values are assigned to the variable. ...
