**Ahead of the EU芒聙聶s Digital Market Act forcing Apple芒聙聶s hand to permit alternative app download options, is the amount of malware in the existing grey-market for sideloading iPhone apps a portent for things to come? Or has Apple芒聙聶s approach, despite its controversy, hit the right balance to keep iPhone users secure?**

On 7th March, the European Union芒聙聶s Digital Market Act (DMA) comes into effect, designed to encourage fair competition across key digital platforms within the single market. The regulation compels Apple (and other 芒聙聹gatekeepers芒聙聺) to [open their platforms to third parties](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en).

Unlike Android where supported alternatives to the Google Play Store already exist芒聙聰through third party stores like [Amazon Appstore](https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/android/) and directly downloading apps from the web, known as 芒聙聹sideloading芒聙聺芒聙聰iPhone has no authorized alternative to Apple芒聙聶s App Store.

As part of [its planned response](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/) to the DMA, for the first time Apple is set to allow EU-based iPhone users to install apps outside its own App Store from third-party marketplaces. Apple remains at pains to point out the [risks of this approach to iPhone users](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#ios-app-eu), echoing its 2021 [position paper](https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf) on the risk of sideloading.

The current state of grey-market iOS sideloading methods may explain some of Apple芒聙聶s hesitancy. Misusing functionality intended for developers, current alternative marketplaces for iOS offer modified versions of popular apps with pirated content, additional or removed features, ads removed, or privacy features adjusted. In a recent study, Netcraft identified malware in around 5% of sampled iOS apps on third-party marketplaces.

At first glance, these changes appear to be a considerable risk for Apple. However, Apple芒聙聶s proposed solution keeps them in the driver's seat with the ability to review all apps芒聙聰whether distributed through Apple芒聙聶s own App Store or third-party marketplaces. This is a material improvement on the current sideloading scene on iOS and gives Apple much more control. However, whether the EU will accept Apple's interpretation芒聙聰seen by some as [insufficient to comply with the DMA](https://theplatformlaw.blog/2024/01/26/when-apple-takes-the-european-commission-for-fools-an-initial-overview-of-apples-new-terms-and-conditions-for-ios-app-distribution-in-the-eu/)芒聙聰is yet to be seen in the coming weeks.

This blog post explores these trade-offs, highlights malicious sideloaded apps, and the potential impact for Apple and the millions of iPhone users in the EU and further afield.

## 芒聙聹Difficult trade-offs芒聙聺

Within Apple芒聙聶s response to the EU Digital Markets Act, it announced several security measures designed to retain control over apps released for iPhone (notably iPadOS is not included). All apps distributed via the authorized third-party app stores will have to go through a notarization process. This will be an enhanced version of the existing notarization process for third-party apps on macOS, which will check apps for malware, functionality, safety, privacy, and metadata accuracy. Apple states this will be achieved through automated processes with additional human input.

The EU will only assess Apple's plan for compliance after the law comes into effect, which will include taking feedback from third parties. It has publicly stated that it will take "strong action" if the proposed solutions are "[not good enough](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-faces-strong-action-if-app-store-changes-fall-short-eus-breton-says-2024-01-26/)".

In addition to the EU, other jurisdictions, including [Japan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Japan-to-crack-down-on-Apple-and-Google-app-store-monopolies) and [the UK](https://www.sidley.com/en/insights/newsupdates/2023/04/new-uk-digital-markets-regime-key-differences-with-the-eu-digital-markets-act), continue working on similar legislation with all eyes on the outcomes and determinations made by the EU and Apple芒聙聶s compliance with new requirements.

## Sideloading and malicious apps

Sideloading describes the act of installing an application on a device directly without using the device芒聙聶s *official* application distribution method. So, for iPhone users, sideloading involves installing an app on their device without using Apple芒聙聶s App Store.

Right now, there are already options for iPhone users芒聙聰both inside and outside the EU芒聙聰to sideload apps. The most accessible option involves using the same [mechanisms designed for developers](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-macos) to install their own apps onto iOS for development and testing purposes.

Several platforms have been created (such as [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)) that take advantage of these developer mechanisms to create consumer-facing third-party app stores, albeit with some friction involved. A computer must be connected to the device during installation, apps must be [updated weekly](https://faq.altstore.io/how-to-use-altstore/activating-apps) to remain installed and a maximum of three such apps can be installed at once. Other options that require [jailbreaking the device](https://github.com/iOS17/Jailbreak) are far less accessible.

These platforms allow users to download and install [any app from the web](https://faq.altstore.io/how-to-use-altstore/sources), and web searches reveal many sites that allow users to download apps for the purposes of sideloading on ...
