Hello community... here is a recap from this morning's key notes.... (a couple more announcements were not captured in my scree shots so I didn't include them in the blog below.)

**Global User Identifier**

SCIM (system for cross-domain identity management) is used to simplify the management of cloud-based applications while SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based open-standard that allows an identity provider (IdP) to authenticate users to another service provider.

**One Domain Model**

Shared master data?¬† Master data should not be shared, instead it is already master data so it should be the only copy across SAP systems. Master Data integration will allow SAP systems to use the same master data model across all the individual SAP products such as SAP Success Factors, SAP S/4HANA cloud, SAP Fieldglass, SAP Concur‚Ä¶ to mention a few.

**Robotic Warehouse Management**

Locus robotic automation. During the developer keynote on the second day, there was a demo that showcased a robotic warehouse management solution that is already used in some companies and it simplifies the delivery, stacking, and retrieval of packages/products in a warehouse. It seemed futuristic but I know it is already happening. I was surprised and at the same time glad to see this type of solutions within the SAP world using other products to improve the cycle of product development to delivery and everything connecting what happens in the back house to the front part of the house (S/4 system).

**SAP Fiori Horizon theme**

I am pleased to see the new theme called Fiori Horizon which has soft looking, more neutral colors and slicker UI. All the new version of S/4HANA has the theme. I believe it will easily and joyfully be adopted on the new development. It looks like this [https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/17/sap-fiori-new-horizon-visual-theme-available-as-preview-we-want-you...](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/11/17/sap-fiori-new-horizon-visual-theme-available-as-preview-we-want-your-feedback/)

**MS Teams and Google Workspace collaboration**

There was a section during the demo where they showed the S/4 Fiori application being able to integrate with MS teams to provide collaboration between teams and also to show the S/4 app within a new tab in MS teams. A solution like this greatly benefits clients because they are no longer going to be passing file or hyperlinks within emails and would allow real time collaboration between the different tools that we‚Äôre already using at our jobs.

Similarly, to MS teams, there is also an integration section with the Google workspaces where the S/4 users can connect directly to the Google Workspaces and be able to extract, analyze and make changes to data (sheets) or via G chat all from the Google workspace while maintain the system in sync. There are plans in the road map to integrate additional solutions between SAP and Google. I think the partnership will be good but I also have questions/doubts on mixing personal google accounts with work google workspaces.
