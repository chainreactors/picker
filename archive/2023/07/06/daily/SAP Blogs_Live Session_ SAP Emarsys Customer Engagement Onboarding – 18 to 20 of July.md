This 3-day Live Session will present a first onboarding and an overview of SAP Emarsys for beginner-level audiences.

### What is it about?

The SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement Onboarding sessions will offer you a hands-on experience through the main functionalities. You will be guided by a real-life Use Case to which a solution will be designed – and built by you throughout the exercises, step by step.

### Who is it for?

This live session is designed for Marketing Managers, Consultants, Partners, and other roles involved in day-to-day marketing operations.

This is a 3-day (6 hours in total) instructor-led hands-on session. We offer you:

* Access to a training account (after registration)
