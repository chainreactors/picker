The dust of the U.S. election is settling, and we want you to know that EFF is ready for whatever’s next. Our mission to ensure that technology serves you—rather than silencing, tracking, or oppressing you—does not change. Some of what’s to come will be in uncharted territory. But we have been preparing for whatever this future brings for a long time. EFF is at its best when the stakes are high.

No matter what, EFF will take every opportunity to stand with users. We’ll continue to advance our mission of user privacy, free expression, and innovation, regardless of the obstacles. We will hit the ground running.

During the previous Trump administration, EFF didn’t just hold the line. We pushed digital rights forward in significant ways, both nationally and locally.  We supported those protesting in the streets, with expanded [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org/) guides and our [Security Education Companion](https://www.securityeducationcompanion.org/). The first offers information for how to protect yourself while you exercise your First Amendment rights, and the second gives tips on how to help your friends and colleagues be more safe.

Along with our allies, we fought government use of face surveillance, [passing municipal bans on the dangerous technology](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/year-fight-against-government-face-surveillance). We urged the Supreme Court to expand protections for your cell phone data, and in *Carpenter v United States*, [they did so](https://www.eff.org/cases/ca...
