Sponsored Post This year's CyberThreat returns to London to provide a place for cybersecurity professionals to share experiences, new tools and techniques to help organisations stay ahead of the latest cyber threats.

The two-day event is hosted by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre and SANS Institute, with a packed agenda promising to cover some of the key skills and knowledge that cyber security practitioners need to hone their skills and further their careers. Focus areas include a broad portfolio of disciplines typically needed to work in the cybersecurity industry spanning both the offensive and defensive disciplines.

Held at the Novotel London West between the 9 and 10 December, CyberThreat24 visitors have the option of either coming along in person or attend virtually from wherever they happen to be. Those attending in-person get the opportunity to hear inspiring keynote presentations whilst networking with like-minded cyber security practitioners.
