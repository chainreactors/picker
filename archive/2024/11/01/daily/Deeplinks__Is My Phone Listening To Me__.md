The short answer is no, probably not! But, with EFF’s new site, [Digital Rights Bytes](https://www.digitalrightsbytes.org/), we go in-depth on this question—and many others.

Whether you’re just starting to question some of the effects of technology in your life or you’re the designated tech wizard of your family looking for resources to share, Digital Rights Bytes is here to help answer some common questions that may be bugging you about the devices you use.
