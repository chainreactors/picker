# Billions of logins for Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and more found exposed online

Posted: June 19, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

When organizations, good or bad, start hoarding collections of login credentials the numbers quickly add up. Take the [184 million logins for social media accounts](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/05/184-million-logins-for-instagram-roblox-facebook-snapchat-and-more-exposed-online) we reported about recently. Now try to imagine 16 billion!

Researchers at [Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/security/billions-credentials-exposed-infostealers-data-leak/) have discovered 30 exposed datasets containing from several millions to over 3.5 billion records each. In total, the researchers uncovered an unimaginable 16 billion records.

The likely source: [information stealers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threats/info-stealers), or infostealers for short. Infostealers are malicious software designed specifically to gather [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) from infected devices. These [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) variants silently extract credentials stored in browsers, email clients, messaging apps, and even [crypto](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cryptocurrency) wallets, and send the data to cybercriminals.

The only silver lining here is that all of the datasets were exposed only briefly: long enough for researchers to uncover them, but not long enough to find who was controlling vast amounts of data. And no chance for us to cross-reference the data with our sources to find out more about their origin and age.

But that doesn’t take away from the fact that these credentials are in the hands of cybercriminals who can use them for:

* **Account takeovers**: Cybercriminals can use stolen credentials to hijack social media, banking, or corporate accounts.
* **[Identity theft](https://www.malwarebytes.com/identity-theft)**: Personal details enable fraud, loan applications, or impersonation.
* **Targeted [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing)**: Combining leaked data allows cybercriminals to engage in very convincing and personalized scams.
* **Ransomware/business email compromise (BEC) attacks**: Compromised business credentials facilitate network intrusions or fraudulent wire transfers.

The leak includes credentials for virtually every large online service. Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, developer platforms, VPNs, and more.

And the number is so massive it exceeds our imagination. If you printed each credential (16 billion usernames + passwords) on a single line, using standard paper, and stacked the pages, the pile would reach far beyond the edge of the stratosphere (roughly 35 miles).

## How to protect against infostealers

There are a few things you can do to limit the dangers of infostealers:

* **Use an up-to-date and [active anti-malware solution](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium)** that can detect and remove infostealers.
* **Do not reuse passwords across different sites and services.** A [password manager](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager) can be very helpful to create safe passwords and remember them for you.
* **Enable two-factor [authentication](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-authentication) ([2FA](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/b...
