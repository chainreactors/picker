# The North American Have I Been Pwned Tour

30 August 2024

It was 2019 that I was last in North America, spending time in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vegas, Denver, Minnesota, New York and Seattle. The year before, it was Montreal and Vancouver and since then, well, things got a bit weird for a while. It's a shame it's been this long because North America is such an important part of the world for so many of the things we (including Charlotte in this too) do; it's the lion's share of the audience for my content, the companies whose services we rely on, and the customers for the various things we do to make a living. In fact, North America is so important, that we're coming back next month 😄

The reason I'm writing this post is because in the past, when I've announced travel plans a whole bunch of really interesting people at cool place have reached out and said "hey, come and say g'day while you're here". So, here's the plan over late September and early October:

1. Washington DC
2. Pittsburgh
3. Montreal
4. Ottawa
5. San Francisco

Things have panned out that way to align with where various partners we want to visit in government, law enforcement and other services are located. I'll wait until I'm there to share more about most those visits, but one I can share in advance is this one:

I'm *really* happy to be joining my friends from 1Password at the Presidents Cup and I'm looking forward to giving them a hand to get the good word out to those tens of millions of people around the world.

On one of my last visits to San Francisco before the world went strange, I spent several days visiting companies in the city and in Silicon Valley. It was very much just that "say g'day" sort of casual visit, and that's where we'll have the most availability on that trip. Time is always finite, of course, but if you're on the path of our travels and would like a visit, please [get in touch](https://www.troyhunt.com/contact/).

Oh, and just so we don't make it all hard work, Charlotte and I might take a few days out between Canada and San Franciso. If you have any suggestions for epic locations along the way, drop us a comment below.
