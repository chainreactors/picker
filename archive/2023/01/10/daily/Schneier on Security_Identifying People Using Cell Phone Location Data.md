## Identifying People Using Cell Phone Location Data

The two people who shut down four Washington power stations in December [were arrested](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/politics/washington-power-substation-attacks/index.html). This is the interesting part:

> Investigators identified Greenwood and Crahan almost immediately after the attacks took place by using cell phone data that allegedly showed both men in the vicinity of all four substations, according to court documents.

Nowadays, it seems like an obvious thing to do—although the search is probably [unconstitutional](https://www.webpronews.com/judges-rules-blanket-cellphone-location-tracking-is-unconstitutional/). But way back in 2012, the Canadian CSEC—that’s their NSA—did some top-secret work on this kind of thing. The document is part of the Snowden archive, and I [wrote](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/02/csec_surveillan.html) about it:

> The second application suggested is to identify a particular person whom you know visited a particular geographical area on a series of dates/times. The example in the presentation is a kidnapper. He is based in a rural area, so he can’t risk making his ransom calls from that area. Instead, he drives to an urban area to make those calls. He either uses a burner phone or a pay phone, so he can’t be identified that way. But if you assume that he has some sort of smart phone in his pocket that identifies itself over the Internet, you might be able to find him in that dataset. That is, he might be the only ID that appears in that geographical location around the same time as the ransom calls and at no other times.

There’s a whole lot of surveillance you can do if you can follow everyone, everywhere, all the time. I don’t even think turning your cell phone off would help in this instance. How many people in the Washington area turned their phones off during exactly the times of the Washington power station attacks? Probably a small enough number to investigate them all.

The trick is not to bring any phone or transmission device to your chosen crime scene, leaving whatever devices you own at home, turned on. Also do not bring your car etc. Before you start going out committing crime, go out frequently for long walks or jogs without any device – it will both normalize leaving your phone at home and make you fit to run from justice.

I don’t see where the cops in this case were “following everyone, everywhere, all the time”. They didn’t follow anyone. They just did some correlation: get the numbers of all phones that were at any of those four locations at the times of the attacks, and see if any of them appear more than once. Aha! Some of them do. Check out those phones, find the bad guys, delete all the rest of the data because it’s of no further interest. Seems a smart piece of detective work to me, though I’m not qualified to comment on the constitutionality.

I doubt it needs to be a smart phone, tracking doesn’t need Internet IDs. Any mobile phone will suffice. Dumb phones ping the cell towers also.

Turning the phone off is a signal also. Stands out just fine in the data of everyone else leaving theirs on.

Leaving the phone turned on at home seems like a good option. Or perhaps travel to a woodland area with no coverage and turn it off there, do your dastardly deeds, then return there before turning it on again.

Wear a disguise and take public transport, or ride a bike, or something, but whatever you do don’t drive a motorised vehicle with a license plate. Automated license plate readers are a thing.

No one said, that they were “following everyone, everywhere, all the time”.

“delete all the rest of the data because it’s of no further interest”

Why? Maybe something else is of interest.
No one in advance knew there would be a murder. They still had the data. Just in case.

The prerequisite for a correlation is that everything and everyone is permanently stored in a database. Data will not be deleted since it is needed to create correlation.
If you consider this to be smart detective work, then a librarian who can look up where a book is, is also doing smart detective work…

On one hand, I’m sure that anyone who got their stolen property back because the popo had access to the IMEI locations or license plate data are quite happy that data was available and usable to the cops.

On the other hand, I’m also sure that that same data can be abused in many ways by shady elements within law enforcement to do malevolent acts.

On the gripping hand, I’m sure that all kinds of “other entities” have access to the SAME data including the vendors of the systems, the cell companies and ISPs, and whichever hackers and nation-state spying agencies have an interest in that data for profit, espionage, crime or whatever.

Privacy laws and controls may limit the access to this information by the “overt” law enforcement agencies, but those same laws and controls will have NO effect on “other entities” and what they do.

The fact is that the “expectation of privacy” touted by laws and regulation is far out of sync with the technological reality.
