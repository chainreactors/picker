## AI Will Write Complex Laws

Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative AI in the process of drafting a bill.

In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and [legislatures around the world](https://www.popvox.org/blog/assessing-us-congressional-ai-adoption) to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more. A Brazilian municipality [passed the first known AI-written law](https://apnews.com/article/brazil-artificial-intelligence-porto-alegre-5afd1240afe7b6ac202bb0bbc45e08d4) in 2023.

That’s not surprising; AI is being used more everywhere. What is coming into focus is how policymakers will use AI and, critically, how this use will change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government. Soon, US legislators may turn to AI to help them keep pace with the increasing complexity of their lawmaking—and this will suppress the power and discretion of the executive branch to make policy.

### Demand for Increasingly Complex Legislation

Legislators are writing increasingly long, intricate, and complicated laws that human legislative drafters have trouble producing. Already in the US, the [multibillion-dollar lobbying industry is subsidizing lawmakers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/lobbying-as-legislative-subsidy/AE4B5D8AB9C2487BB78C2A51BB53E03F) in writing baroque laws: suggesting paragraphs to add to bills, specifying benefits for some, carving out exceptions for others. Indeed, the [lobbying industry](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/lobbying-in-the-21st-century_c6d8eff8-en.html) is growing in complexity and influence worldwide.

Several years ago, [researchers studied bills](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673X18776628) introduced into state legislatures throughout the US, looking at which bills were wholly original texts and which borrowed text from other states or from lobbyist-written model legislation. Their conclusion was not very surprising. Those who borrowed the most text were in legislatures that were less resourced. This makes sense: If you’re a part-time legislator, perhaps unpaid and without a lot of staff, you need to rely on more external support to draft legislation. When the scope of policymaking outstrips the resources of legislators, they look for help. Today, that often means lobbyists, who provide expertise, research services, and drafting labor to legislators at the local, state, and federal levels at no charge. Of course, they are not unbiased: They seek to exert influence on behalf of their clients.

[Ano](https://doi.org/10.1086/714933)[ther study](https://doi.org/10.1086/714933), at the US federal level, measured the complexity of policies proposed in legislation and tried to determine the factors that led to such growing complexity. While there are [numerous ways](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217430499.pdf) to measure legal complexity, these authors focused on the specificity of institutional design: How exacting is Congress in laying out the relational network of branches, agencies, and officials that will share power to implement the policy?

In looking at bills enacted between 1993 and 2014, the researchers found two things. First, they concluded that ideological polarization drives complexity. The suggestion is that if a legislator is on the extreme end of the ideological spectrum, they’re more likely to introduce a complex law that constrains the discretion of, as the authors put it, “entrenched bureaucratic interests.” And second, they found that divided government drives complexity to a large degree: Significant legislation passed under divided government was found to be 65 percent more complex than similar legislation passed under unified government. Their conclusion is that, if a legislator’s party controls Congress, and the opposing party controls the White House, the legislator will want to give the executive as little wiggle room as possible. When legislators’ preferences disagree with the executive’s, the legislature is incentivized to write laws that specify all the details. This gives the agency designated to implement the law as little discretion as possible.

Because polarization and divided government are increasingly entrenched in the US, the demand for complex legislation at the federal level is likely to grow. Today, we have both the [greatest ideological polarization](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades) in Congress in living memory and an increasingly divided government at the federal level. Between 1900 and 1970 (57th through 90th Congresses), we had 27 instances of unified government and only seven divided; nearly a four-to-one ratio. Since then, the trend is roughly the opposite. As of the start of the next Congress, we will have had 20 divided governments and only eight unified (nearly a three-to-one ratio). And while the incoming Trump administration will see a unified government, the extremely closely divided House may often make this Congress look and feel like a divided one (see the [recent government shutdown crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/21/trump-musk-shutdown-demands-defeat/) as an exemplar) and makes truly divided government a strong possibility in 2027.

Another related factor driving the complexity of legislation is the need to do it all at once. The lobbyist [feeding frenzy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lsq.12266)—spurring major bills like the Affordable Care Act to be thousands of pages in length—is driven in part by gridlock in Congress. [Congressional productivity has dropped so low](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/118th-congress-track-become-productive-us-history/story?id=106254012) that bills on any given policy issue seem like a once-in-a-generation opportunity for legislators—and lobbyists—to set policy.

These dynamics also impact the states. States often have divided governments, [albeit less often than they used to](https://www.multistate.us/insider/2024/2/13/state-trifectas-hit-a-new-record-in-2024-only-10-states-have-divided-government), and their demand for drafting assistance is arguably higher due to their significantly smaller staffs. And since the [productivity of Congress has cratered](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-CONGRESS/PRODUCTIVITY/egpbabmkwvq/) in recent years, significantly more policymaking is happening at the state level.

But there’s another reason, particular to the US federal government, that will likely force congressio...
