Google has joined Microsoft in publishing intel on Iranian cyber influence activity following a recent uptick in attacks that led to data being leaked from the Trump re-election campaign.

The tech giant's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) confirmed that Iran was behind [the incident](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/12/trump_campaign_hacked_iran_claim/), specifically its APT42 group which is part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

It also said that numerous other attacks were thwarted prior to that after [Iranian activity ramped up](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/09/iran_state_groups_lay_groundwork/) in May. Active attacks that are continuing to be blocked include several targeting the teams of President Joe Biden, vice-president and current Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and Donald Trump, who is challenging for a second stint in the Oval Office.
