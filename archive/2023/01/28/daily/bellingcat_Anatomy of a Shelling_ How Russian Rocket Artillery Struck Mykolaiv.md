On April 4, 2022, Russian rocket artillery struck the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv with cluster munitions. On the night of April 3, the Furshet shopping centre and nearby city hospital were attacked. Local media had [published images](https://t.me/novostiniko/13593) to their Telegram channels at around midnight. At 8:03 in the morning of April 4, eyewitnesses [told](https://news.pn/ru/RussiaInvadedUkraine/270093) the Ukrainian website Prestupnosti.Net of damage to residential areas in the Zavodskyi District. Later, on the afternoon of April 4, a second attack followed in which a shopping precinct and a children’s hospital were attacked. Both were located in densely populated residential areas. According to the [Mykolaiv regional prosecutor](https://www.facebook.com/mykprok/posts/279327524378101), 12 people died and 41 were injured from the attacks.

Videos of rocket launches began to appear on social media after the attacks, with the uploaders claiming that they were firing towards Mykolaiv. A close inspection of one of these videos has allowed Bellingcat to verify the location of the rocket launches likely behind the afternoon attack on the shopping precinct and children’s hospital. It is as yet unclear whether the same location and rocket launchers were implicated in the early morning attack that day.

Our geolocation suggests that the strike was launched by Russian forces from a location near the Inhulets River in the north of Russian-occupied Kherson Region; a chronolocation of the same videos indicates that one launch likely took place just minutes before the afternoon’s explosions at the shopping precinct and children’s hospital occurred.

This attack was one of dozens launched against the port city throughout the spring and summer of 2022, after Russian forces from occupied Crimea swept through Ukraine’s south and were held back by the Ukrainian army just outside Mykolaiv city. It came just days after a Russian cruise missile [destroyed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60914019) the regional government office on March 29, which Ukrainian officials say killed 12 people.
Mykolaiv’s Regional Governor Vitaly Kim narrowly avoided that attack on his workplace. By the time Ukraine’s army retook Kherson in November, Kim [estimated](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20221112-in-ukraine-s-martyred-mykolaiv-residents-hail-russian-retreat-dread-revenge-attacks) that around 200,000 of Mykolaiv’s 470,000 residents remained in the city.

## The Aftermath

As soon as news of the April 4 attacks broke, imagery emerged showing the scale of destruction. Locals shared videos and images on social media. These sources indicate that most casualties that day appeared to be concentrated in the commercial area where people had been working and shopping. There was also a public transit stop at this location.

Security footage from the paediatric hospital first appeared online the day after the attack on the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/mykolaivskaODA/977) of Governor Vitaly Kim, who shared it at 13:58 (local time). It was then widely [amplified](https://t.me/suspilnemykolaiv/7256) by the channel of the local branch of Suspilne, a Ukrainian media network. The video showed that the submunitions, which detach from the launch rocket close to impact and spray over a target area, hit the hospital at around 15:30, according to the timestamp of the CCTV camera. On April 8 Chief Doctor Oleksandr Plitkin [told](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvqz1pKXzeU) reporters for the TPK channel that nobody at the hospital was harmed physically, but that the hospital building did take exterior damage, of which photojournalists from NPR [also published](https://twitter.com/timkmak/status/1516413107647782912) photographs.

The timing of these video clips offered clues as to when precisely the projectiles hit downtown Mykolaiv that afternoon. But where did they originate from?

## The Trajectory

Statements by people who witnessed the attacks offer some clues as to the origin of the projectiles.

On April 5 Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Head of Mission in Ukraine Michel-Olivier Lacharité [stated](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/msf-says-its-team-witnessed-bombing-during-mykolaiv-hospital-visit-2022-04-05/) that “Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes.” Staff of the international medical charity were visiting the city’s oncology hospital at the time.

In a Twitter thread on the same incident, MSF Ukraine stated that their team had been about 300 metres away from the paediatric hospital and saw small holes in the ground which may have indicated the use of cluster munitions.

> The team reported that the regional paediatric hospital, about 300 m away, was also hit. No large crater was visible. In the wake of the explosions, they saw numerous small holes in the ground, scattered over a large area. This could be consistent with the use of cluster bombs.
