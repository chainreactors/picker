In the **December 2024** survey we received responses from **1,149,724,280** sites across **272,582,582** domains and **13,260,653** web-facing computers. This reflects an increase of 8.6 million sites, 550,526 domains, and 146,420 web-facing computers.

nginx experienced the largest gain of 6.4 million sites (+2.92%) this month, and now accounts for 19.7% (+0.41pp) of sites seen by Netcraft. Cloudflare made the next largest gain of 2.6 million sites (+1.90%).

Apache experienced the largest loss of 1.1 million sites (-0.54%) this month, reducing its market share to 17.3% (-0.23pp). OpenResty suffered the next largest loss, down by 1.0 million sites (-0.88%).

### 000webhost shutdown

Earlier this year, Hostinger [announced the closure of its 000webhost brand](https://www.hostinger.com/blog/000webhost-closes), which provided free web hosting. It has now shut down all remaining 000webhost sites, resulting in the number of sites hosted at Hostinger dropping by just under 50% this month - from 15.3 million to 8.1 million.
