You‚Äôve heard of ransomware, deepfake scams, and business email compromise. But what about bread bag cybercrime awareness?

In Belgium, police have taken to [printing cybersecurity tips on bakery bags](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/regio/vlaams-brabant/halle-vilvoorde/pajottegem/politie-waarschuwt-voor-internetcriminaliteit-via-broodzakken-niet-iedereen-is-actief-op-sociale-media/77720193.html "Link to Belgian news report"). Yes, really. Forget TikTok or Instagram ads, this is crime prevention via a crusty sourdough. Crumbs!

The initiative targets people who aren‚Äôt scrolling social media 24/7. The idea is simple: warn people about online fraud and digital scams using something they actually see every day. And the cost is low.

I think it‚Äôs a great idea. Lets face it, your nan isn‚Äôt going to read a blog post about malicious QR codes, but she might read the side of a baguette bag while tucking into her lunch.

It‚Äôs easy to forget that not everyone is immersed in the world of technology and cybercrime. Sometimes cybersecurity needs to go low-tech to reach high-risk users.
