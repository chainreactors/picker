## Nick Weaver on Regulating Cryptocurrency

Nicholas Weaver wrote an [excellent paper](https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/isp/documents/weaver_death_of_cryptocurrency_final.pdf) on the problems of cryptocurrencies and the need to regulate the space—with all existing regulations. His conclusion:

> Regulators, especially regulators in the United States, often fear accusations of stifling innovation. As such, the cryptocurrency space has grown over the past decade with very little regulatory oversight.
>
> But fortunately for regulators, there is no actual innovation to stifle. Cryptocurrencies cannot revolutionize payments or finance, as the basic nature of all cryptocurrencies render them fundamentally unsuitable to revolutionize our financial system—which, by the way, already has decades of successful experience with digital payments and electronic money. The supposedly “decentralized” and “trustless” cryptocurrency systems, both technically and socially, fail to provide meaningful benefits to society—and indeed, necessarily also fail in their foundational claims of decentralization and trustlessness.
>
> When regulating cryptocurrencies, the best starting point is history. Regulating various tokens is best done through the existing securities law framework, an area where the US has a near century of well-established law. It starts with regulating the issuance of new cryptocurrency tokens and related securities. This should substantially reduce the number of fraudulent offerings.
>
> Similarly, active regulation of the cryptocurrency exchanges should offer substantial benefits, including eliminating significant consumer risk, blocking key money-laundering channels, and overall producing a far more regulated and far less manipulated market.
>
> Finally, the stablecoins need basic regulation as money transmitters. Unless action is taken they risk becoming substantial conduits for money laundering, but requiring them to treat all users as customers should prevent this risk from developing further.

“…ur financial system—which, by the way, already has decades of successful experience with digital payments and electronic money. ”

This is true only if you want your personal information: who you are, where you are, what you buy being available to banks, credit bureaus, governments, and all of their customers.

Also, that $10k limit on unjustified deposits should, thatnks to inflation, be $275k today, so the new $600 rule is just a slap in the face of everyone.

@anon

Unfortunately that also supports the use cases of drug traffickers, tax evaders, sanction evaders, ransomware developers, and scammers.

You forgot to mention pedophiles in your scaremongering listing, nona.

@ ALL,

Re : Intro says it all…

From the essay introduction,

> *“Despite the repeated failures of major cryptocurency projects, the space is seamingly inescapable. Immense investments into cryptocurency projects drive a hype cycle that keeps promising a set of revolutions that are not materializing.”*

If you read it backwards you get,

1, Empty / faux / void promises
2, Promoted loudly and ceaselessly
3, Demanding inordinate large sums of money
3a, To develop the project.
3b, To invest in the project.
4, The endless nature of “new thing” money hungry projects prevents coherent development.
5, As marks are told it’s the next “sure thing”.
6, All the projects fail as the marks realise they have been duped.

There are a number of con-games in progress. But essentialy they are all to create money traps that only a tiny handfull of those involved canbprofit by. The rest, including the low level investors get fleeced very badly as the money goes around around like a merry go round but is not there when the music stops and the lights get switched off, leqving the investors empty handed and mostly even the piper and friends who made the music unpayed.

But hey there is always another party next door with a new band playing new tunes with more promises of a good time than an old west whore house…

Have I left out anything important?

“Regulating” is an extremely vague political term.

It somehow assumes that unspecified government “Experts” should rightfully control some activity of the populace.
These experts are assumed to instantly have complete superior knowledge of the regulated area, and 100% selfless honesty & dedication to the supposed “Public Good’.
…where exactly does one recruit such noble persons ??

In reality, government ‘regulators’ are merely ordinary politicians & bureaucrats with the same human self-interest & shortcomings… thought only to exist in the selfish private sector.

Hordes of U.S. government regulators have a long history incompetence, corruption and public harm (e.g., SEC, FTC, DOA, FDD Reserve).

Be careful what you wish for ….

@ Durbin
Very true! I suppose there needs to be some sort of “regulation”(not just cyrpto),but I’m leary of governments in general. Thanks for posting.

The greatest benefit of cryptocurrencies will be ending the ridiculous idea that politicians and bureaucrats should have anything to do with regulation.
