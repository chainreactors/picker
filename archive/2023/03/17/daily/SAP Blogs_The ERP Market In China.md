# The ERP Market In China

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/03/ERP-market-in-China-Tenba-Group-2.jpg)

With a strong focus on manufacturing under the “Made in China 2025” strategy, efficient resource planning is more important than ever for companies sourcing from and collaborating with the Chinese market.

The Chinese ERP market started in the late 1980s, and with today’s increased demand for such solutions, the requirements have also increased. Today, [many Chinese enterprises (around 35%) also have implemented SAP systems](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-influence-of-ERP-system-in-enterprises-%E2%80%99-%E2%80%93-Case-Tang/9d43b43d3f5ee3ba6e9829409a22d023affd9774/figure/2).

Generally, the ERP process is designed for rule-based mature economies that promote knowledge sharing and transparency. This can lead to conflicts in governance based systems like China. As part of the industrial internet industry, policies for ERP systems have been intensified. At the same time, the development speed of the ERP software industry is expected to continue to accelerate.
