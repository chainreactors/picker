# Microsoft advertisers phished via malicious Google ads

Posted: January 30, 2025
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Just days after we uncovered a [campaign](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/01/the-great-google-ads-heist-criminals-ransack-advertiser-accounts-via-fake-google-ads) targeting Google Ads accounts, a similar attack has surfaced, this time aimed at Microsoft advertisers. These malicious ads, appearing on Google Search, are designed to steal the login information of users trying to access Microsoft’s advertising platform.

Microsoft does purchase ad space on its rival’s dominant search engine; however, we found Google sponsored results for “Microsoft Ads” (formerly known as Bing Ads) that contained malicious links created by impostors.

Through shared artifacts, we were able to identify additional [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) infrastructure targeting Microsoft accounts going back to a couple of years at least. We have reported these incidents to Google.

## Fake Microsoft Ads caught on Google Search

Microsoft made an [estimated $12.2 billion](https://backlinko.com/bing-users) in search and news advertising revenues (including Bing) in 2023, which pales in comparison to its rival, Google, holding a much larger share of the search engine market.

Since the advertising ecosystem allows for an open competition between brands, Microsoft is trying to get traffic and earn clicks from Google searches. During our investigation, we saw sponsored results for Microsoft Ads and Bing Ads that managed to slip through Google’s security checks:

## Redirection, cloaking and Cloudflare

The threat actors are using different techniques to evade detection and drop traffic from bots, security scanners and crawlers. Unwanted [IP addresses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) (*e.g.* VPNs) are immediately redirected to a bogus marketing website (*Figure 2*). This is also known as a “white page”, meaning it looks innocent and hides its maliciousness.

[![Figure 2: Cloaking page](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/image_5b8f26.png)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/image_5b8f26.png)

Figure 2: Cloaking page

Users that appear to be genuine are presented with a Cloudflare challenge to verify they are human. This is a legitimate instance of Cloudflare, unlike the [“ClickFix” type-of-attacks](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/12/fix-it-social-engineering-scheme-impersonates-several-brands) that have become very common place and trick people into pasting and executing malicious code.

## Rickroll for the cheaters

After a successful Cloudflare check, users are redirected to the final phishing page via a special URL, that acts as some sort of entry point for the malicious domain *ads[.]mcrosoftt[.]com*. You can see the network requests related to this redirection chain in *Figure 4* below.
