**Introduction**

In today's fast-paced business environment, efficient Vendor onboarding is crucial for organizations to maintain a competitive edge. However, many companies face significant challenges when it comes to streamlining this process. Lengthy onboarding times, redundant efforts across multiple systems, and lack of transparency can hinder procurement managers and result in lost opportunities. To address these issues, our customer has leveraged Unified Vendor Enablement on the SAP Business Technology Platform, a comprehensive solution that combines the power of Ariba and Fieldglass to revolutionize their Vendor onboarding process.

**Customer Requirements**

Traditionally, onboarding and hiring resources from Vendors can take an extended period of time causing delays in project timelines. Moreover, the use of three different systems - Ariba, Fieldglass, and SAP ERP - often requires duplication of effort and materials, leading to redundant tasks. This not only consumes valuable time and resources but also increases the risk of errors and inconsistencies. Additionally, the lack of end-to-end visibility makes it challenging for procurement managers to oversee the onboarding process and take proactive actions.

To address these challenges, Our customers seek automation in the Vendor onboarding process to reduce onboarding time and enable employees to focus on high-value activities. They require a solution that eliminates duplication of effort and materials by integrating Ariba, Fieldglass, and SAP ERP. Furthermore, they need a consistent and easily repeatable Vendor onboarding sequence that minimizes errors and redundancies. Finally, providing procurement managers with end-to-end visibility throughout the Vendor registration process is crucial to facilitate proactive decision-making.

**Persona**

Persona Buyer Vendor Management, Buyer Account Payable, IT, Internal compliance.

Persona Vendor Account receivables and IT.

**ConvergentIS Proposition**

ConvergentIS offers a cutting-edge SAP Business Technology-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution designed to streamline the vendor onboarding process across Ariba and Fieldglass. By consolidating responses and providing a single pane of glass, this solution removes the duplication of data capture and ensures a seamless experience for all parties.

**Solution**

Key Benefits and Features:

1. Streamlined Onboarding: Unified Vendor Enablement significantly reduces onboarding time, transforming a lengthy process into a quick and efficient one. Vendors can be onboarded in a matter of days rather than months, enabling organizations to kickstart projects promptly.

3. Enhanced Visibility: Procurement managers gain end-to-end visibility into the Vendor registration process. They can easily track the progress of each step, and proactively request any necessary action items, eliminating bottlenecks and delays.

4. Persona-based Approach: Unified Vendor Enablement caters to the needs of various personas involved in the Vendor onboarding process, including buyer vendor management, buyer accounts payable, IT, internal compliance, and vendor account receivables. Each persona benefits from tailored functionalities and streamlined workflows.
