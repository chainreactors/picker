# Update now! Google Chrome’s first weekly update has arrived

Posted: August 25, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Google has [published](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/08/chrome-desktop-stable-update.html) details about the first weekly update for the Chrome browser. Recently Google [announced](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/an-update-on-chrome-security-updates.html) that it would start shipping weekly security updates for the [Stable channel](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1086915?hl=en) (the version most of us use). Regular Chrome releases will still come every four weeks, but to get security fixes out faster, updates to address security and other high impact bugs will be scheduled weekly.

This should also help in the reduction of a patch gap in the Chome release cycle. When a Chrome security bug is fixed, the fix is added to the public Chromium source code repository. The fix is then tested and evaluated before it goes to the Stable Channel. The gap is the time between the patch appearing in the Chromium repository and it being shipped in a Stable channel update.

The latest update has fixes for five vulnerabilities. Four of these vulnerabilities have been classified with a High importance and one as Medium. All these vulnerabilities have been reported by external researchers between August 1 and August 7, 2023.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. The CVEs patched in these updates are:

[CVE-2023-4430](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4430), a use after free (UAF) vulnerability in Vulkan, in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.110, which allowed a remote attacker to potentially [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. Vulkan is a modern cross-platform graphics and compute API (application programming interface) that provides high-efficiency, low-level access to modern GPUs (graphics processing units) used in a wide variety of devices from PCs to smartphones.

UAF is a type of vulnerability that is the result of the incorrect use of dynamic memory during a program’s operation. If, after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to manipulate the program.

Heap corruption occurs when a program modifies the contents of a memory location outside of the memory allocated to the program.

[CVE-2023-4429](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4429) is another use after free vulnerability, this time in Loader, in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.110, which allows a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.

[CVE-2023-4428](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4428) is an out of bounds memory access in CSS, in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.110, which allows a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a crafted HTML page.

An out-of-bounds write or read flaw makes it possible to manipulate parts of the memory which are allocated to more critical functions.

[CVE-2023-4427](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4427) is an out of bounds memory access in V8, Google’s open-source JavaScript engine, in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.110, which allows a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory read via a ...
