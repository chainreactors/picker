Firstly, I  would like to express my gratitude for SAP Inside Track Bengaluru. **#SITBLR** was my first in-person Inside Track experience. Previously, I was presenting SIT sessions online with great SAP Community Champions.IT events with physical attendance made me feel different, more involved, and more focused.SAP Inside Track Bengaluru was literally a mind-shifter event for me and I am already encouraging other colleagues to participate in their regional SIT Events.

Now I would like to turn my SAP Inside Track Bengaluru Experiences. I stepped into the SAP LABS Bengaluru office and was amazed to see many colleagues showing interest in the SIT event over the weekend. It was like a **mini SAP -TechEd.**

My session was in the afternoon, hence I had ample time to check other sessions. The sessions were remarkable and so informative. It was a pleasure to meet the colleagues with whom I interact virtually through Hackathons/SAP Community and many more virtual events. I was glad to meet ruthvik.chowdary2 who is one of the  SAP Champions and we worked together during SAP Intelligent RPA Online Track events in 2020,2021.

I walked to the App house and was amazed to see the enthusiasm of the participants to gain knowledge on SAP Build. Participants had built simple Apps and automated business processes.

I had lunch and was ready for my session on **SAP Build Process Automation and Google Cloud Integration.**

The session included an overview of the offerings by SAP Build Process Automation to automate Google Cloud Applications ( Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Sheets, and Google Document AI) with a LIVE demo.

The thirst of the participants to continue learning new things was still ON. Post my session, it was a great opportunity to discuss with the participants their use cases and queries in the SAP Build Process automation, and a few of them approached me as their organizations were using Google Suite as their office product and requested deep diver series on the topic.

To gain more knowledge on the topic, please find additional resources.

One of the sessions which caught my eye was  **Writing an SAP Book: Why and How?** by  maheshkumar.palavalliand krishnakishor.kammaje2This session was a great insight for aspiring SAP Authors like me who have the thirst to contribute to SAP Press Book. Thanks for the session.

The event was concluded with certificate distribution and I carried wonderful memories .

Special thanks to maheshkumar.palavalli, kavya.krishnan, ruthvik.chowdary2, abhishek.chatterjeeabhishek.chatterjeeabhishek.chatterjee, and the entire team organizing this wonderful event.

Looking forward to the next SIT event!
