# Canadian ISPs Blocked Pirate IPTV & Logged Customer IP Addresses

When Canada's Federal Court issued an injunction compelling ISPs to block pirate IPTV services on behalf of NHL broadcasters, the judge ordered a report to ensure compliance with the order. This report offers considerable insight into the blocking process but also reveals how some of Canada's ISPs logged customers' connections and shared data on their attempts to access pirate IPTV services.

[![iptv](https://torrentfreak.com/images/iptv.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/iptv.png)When the first pirate site blocking applications began to gather momentum in Europe, those concerned about where it all might lead spoke of slippery slopes and thin ends of wedges.

More than 15 years later, judges in dozens of countries have not only approved blocking injunctions that target static sites but are also happy to hand down flexible orders designed to rapidly counter new domains, proxies, and mirrors.

When pirate IPTV services hit the mainstream less than 10 years ago, the legal and technical challenges of blocking content quickly were considerable. But by carefully tapping in the wedge, showing patience, and not asking for too much at the wrong time, rightsholders can now block pirate IPTV services while judges are tucked up in bed.

## Canada’s Blocking Fast Track

Canada’s Federal Court approved the country’s [first IPTV blocking order](https://torrentfreak.com/federal-court-approves-first-pirate-site-blockade-in-canada-191118/) in 2018, and the Federal Court of Appeal [upheld it in May 2021](https://torrentfreak.com/federal-court-of-appeal-court-upholds-canadian-pirate-site-blocking-order-210526/).

Just two months later, the architects of the first order – Rogers, Bell, TVA, and others – filed a new application demanding [faster, more flexible blocking](https://torrentfreak.com/media-giants-request-dynamic-order-to-block-pirated-nhl-streams-in-canada-210709/). The Federal Court obliged and in 2022, Justice William F. Pentney handed down [Canada’s first dynamic pirate IPTV blocking order](https://torrentfreak.com/nhl-broadcasters-win-canadas-first-dynamic-pirate-iptv-blocking-order-220608/), crafted to protect the NHL broadcasters’ revenues.

Justice Pentney also issued instructions for one or more experts to review the process to ensure compliance with the Court’s criteria for identifying ‘pirate’ IP addresses. Dates and times when the IP addresses were supposed to be blocked, and whether they actually were, for example. A report on general compliance was the overriding theme.

## Report Satisfied Judge, New Injunction Awarded

Before Rogers, Bell, TVA, and the other plaintiffs were able to renew their injunction, the Court reviewed the experts’ report to ensure that its instructions had been followed. The report was produced by IP lawyer [David Lipkus](https://twitter.com/lipkus?lang=en) and Jon Wilkins, co-founder of [Quadra Partners](https://www.quadrapartnersllc.com/).

While both men have business connections with the plaintiffs, the Court saw no issues with their work, and ultimately [renewed the injunction](https://torrentfreak.com/canadas-federal-court-grants-nhl-pirate-streaming-blockade-for-22-23-season/). The report’s key findings were as follows: *(Note: FMTS is a reference to Friend MTS, an anti-piracy company heavily involved in live pirate IPTV blocking)*

*– Experts verified the criteria used by Friend MTS to select IP addresses for blocking
– ISPs used automated blocking, 9 out of 10 blocked 100% of the IP addresses tested
– No legitimate complaints from individuals or businesses related to blocking
– Data supports the assessment that availability of infringing content was reduced
– Blocking considered effective; delivered a measurable benefit for a low cost*

The report itself wasn’t available when mentioned last year, but recently appeared on the docket at Canada’s Federal Court. It reveals how the review was conducted and how the data was verified, plus additional details that help paint a bigger picture on site-blocking measures when combined with existing information.

## All About The Blocklist

FMTS provided the experts with a spreadsheet containing a confidential blocklist of 568 IP addresses and timestamps indicating when they were added to the blocklist. To verify the selection criteria, the experts used a randomized sample set of 181 IP addresses and were able to confirm that all 181 were added to the blocklist.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect here is that ancillary comments appear to add weight to the theory that IP addresses aren’t spotted ‘live’ and then immediately blocked; they’re on the blocklist before live games even begin.

> *IP addresses added to the blocklist are those determined by FMTS to be part of streaming infrastructure making the Copyrighted Content available without authorization during the NHL Live Game Windows, as well as during the Pre-Monitoring Period*

What constitutes a ‘Live Game Window’ is not detailed in the report since this and similar information is considered highly confidential. However, data made available in other jurisdictions suggests that ‘windows’ go way beyond the competitive live action taking place ‘now’ on TV.

In orders issued to ISPs in other countries where FMTS blocks live football streams, “Match Periods” refer to other days in a given week where pirate IPTV services have already been observed illegally streaming matches owned by the same rights owner. It seems likely that ‘Live Game Window’ is the NHL equivalent.

Similarly, the ‘Pre-Monitoring Period’ is a block of time that precedes one or more ‘Match Periods’ in the same week as the current live match. Pirate IPTV services that show a) a subscription channel on which match footage is due to be broadcast or b) a sports-related subscription channel operated by a specified broadcaster, are eligible for IP address blocking.

## Identifying Pirate Streams

According to the Canadian report, FMTS uses a proprietary technology that allows it to compare legitimate samples of existing NHL game footage with content being made available on pirate platforms.

“When matches are detected, the IP addresses of the source and associated streaming infrastructure are flagged for potential inclusion in the blocklist. Screenshots and video footage of the matched content are retained [and] were made available, along with thumbnail images of the identified content and the legitimate sample content it was found to match,” the experts note.

The report says that some of the 181 IP addresses in the sample were matched with multiple games in the Pre-Monitoring Period and NHL Live Game Windows, together generating 356 hits.

After reviewing thumbnail images, screenshots, and video captured from streams for each, the experts concluded that 178 IP addresses were valid matc...
