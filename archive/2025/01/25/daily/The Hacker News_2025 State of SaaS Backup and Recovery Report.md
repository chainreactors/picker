[![SaaS Backup and Recovery](data:image/png;base64... "SaaS Backup and Recovery")](https://www.backupify.com/resources/global-saas-backup-and-recovery-report-2025/)

The modern workplace has undergone a seismic transformation over recent years, with hybrid work becoming the norm and businesses rapidly adopting cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications to facilitate it. SaaS applications like Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace have now become the backbone of business operations, enabling seamless collaboration and productivity. However, this dependence on SaaS solutions has also attracted a surge in cyberthreats, exposing critical business data to risks like ransomware and phishing attacks.

Amid these challenges, the **[2025 State of SaaS Backup and Recovery Report](https://www.backupify.com/resources/global-saas-backup-and-recovery-report-2025/)** offers a timely analysis of the SaaS data protection landscape. By surveying over 3,700 IT professionals from diverse industries and company sizes, this report highlights trends, challenges and solutions shaping the future of SaaS data resilience. For organizations seeking clarity in navigating these turbulent waters, the findings provide invaluable guidance.

Key revelations from the report are both eye-opening and concerning. For instance, **87% of IT professionals reported experiencing SaaS data loss in 2024**, with malicious deletions as the leading cause. Moreover, while 61% of applications and workloads are expected to run on public cloud platforms in the next two years, only **14% of IT leaders feel confident they can recover critical SaaS data within minutes** following an incident. These findings underscore an urgent call to action for businesses to strengthen their data resilience strategies.

In this blog, we'll uncover the survey's key findings, revealing how organizations are adapting to meet the ongoing challenges. From revealing the biggest threats to understanding the strategies IT leaders are leveraging to stay ahead, you'll gain a clear picture of the trends shaping SaaS data protection.

## The shift toward cloud: Major trends reshaping modern IT operations

Organizations worldwide are increasingly relying on hybrid cloud environments, with **54% of workloads and applications already cloud-hosted**. This trend shows no signs of slowing down, as businesses anticipate growing this figure to **61% by 2026**. The acceleration of cloud adoption reflects the critical role cloud solutions play in driving digital transformation and enabling organizations to scale effectively.

### What's driving cloud adoption?

The benefits propelling rapid cloud migration are clear: leveraging cloud platforms allows organizations to enhance operational efficiency, optimize strategic analytics and support real-time decision-making. However, this enthusiasm comes with a caveat — companies are carefully navigating concerns about data sensitivity, security and compliance as they transition.

#### **Data types moving to the cloud**

Certain types of data dominate cloud migration trends, illustrating where organizations feel confident leveraging the cloud's potential. The top candidates for data migration to the cloud include:

1. **Non-sensitive analytics data (39%)**: Leading the pack, these datasets highlight the cloud's role in powering strategic insights.
2. **The Internet of Things (IoT) and edge data (34%)**: The inclusion of high-velocity datasets reflects growing trust in the cloud's ability to handle real-time analytics at scale.
3. **Sales and orders data (34%)**: Organizations are increasingly turning to cloud-hosted solutions to drive operational efficiency in sales processes.

#### **Data that's staying on-premises**

Despite the allure of the cloud, businesses are cautious about entrusting their most sensitive information to third-party environments. The top candidates for data to remain on-premises include:

1. **Personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) (42%)**: Strict regulations and concerns about breaches keep this data largely on-premises.
2. **Corporate financial data (42%)**: Companies remain wary of potential risks in the cloud for critical financial records.
3. **Sensitive intellectual property (40%)**: Maintaining tight control over proprietary assets remains a top priority.

#### **Top use cases for public cloud adoption**

Cloud adoption is driven by practical needs that align with modern business challenges:

* **Collaboration (39%)**: The flexibility and scalability of cloud solutions are essential for supporting hybrid and remote work environments.
* **Disaster recovery (37%)**: Ensuring fast recovery and protecting data from loss or downtime remain critical priorities.
* **Data warehousing and Database-as-a-Service (32%)**: Organizations value the cloud's ability to manage large datasets and enable seamless data-driven operations.

### SaaS application trends in 2024

The adoption of SaaS applications continues to transform how businesses collaborate, manage operations and scale their services. Collaboration platforms remain at the forefront of SaaS adoption, reflecting their critical role in today's hybrid and remote work environments.

#### **Microsoft 365 retains leadership while Google Workspace gains momentum**

Microsoft 365 maintains its position as the leader in SaaS collaboration solutions, with **a 53% adoption rate** among survey respondents. However, this represents **a decline from its 71% adoption rate in 2022**, indicating a potential shift in preferences or increasing competition in the SaaS space.

Meanwhile, Google Workspace has seen a consistent rise in adoption, climbing to **35% in 2024 compared to 25% in 2022**. This growth is particularly pronounced among SMBs, with 38% adoption compared to 32% among enterprises.
