Belarusian hacktivist group Cyber Partisans has hacked the [Russian General Radio Frequency Center](https://grfc.ru/) (GRFC), a smaller sub-agency that's part of the Roskomnadzor, the Russian government's telecommunications watchdog.

In [Telegram](https://t.me/cpartisans/960) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cpartisans/status/1593634667147988993) posts, the Cyber Partisans said they gained access to the agency's internal network, from where they stole more than 2TB of emails and documents before trashing its domain controller and encrypting local workstations.

"The work of the chief Kremlin censor has been disrupted," the group boasted.

"We also have a huge amount of material proving **large-scale surveillance** on the network and attempts to establish **total control over everyone** who has spoken out **against the Putin regime** over the past 20 years," they added, promising to share the stolen data with journalists.

The GRFC confirmed the breach to *[Kommersant](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5678906)*and blamed the hack on the use of a "*previously unused vulnerability*," but the agency vehemently denied that any employee workstations were encrypted.

The incident marks the second time the Roskomnadzor has dealt with a major security breach this year after the Anonymous hacker collective also breached and then leaked more than 800TB of data from the agency's servers [earlier this year in March](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-700940). The leaked documents showed the agency actively intervening and censoring the narrative around Russia's role in Ukraine, such as prohibiting the use of the word invasion to describe Russia’s so-called "*special military operation*."

### Breaches and hacks

**Vanuatu ransomware attack:** The government of the small island nation of Vanuatu was hit by a [ransomware attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63632129) that crippled most of the government's IT networks and forced staff back to pen and paper. According to a report from the [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/world/oceania/australia-called-in-to-help-after-hackers-shut-down-vanuatu-government-systems-20221114-p5by7a.html), a team from the Australian Cyber Security Centre is currently helping Vanuatu officials recover their network from the attack.

**AirAsia ransomware attack:** Malaysian airline AirAsia was the victim of a ransomware attack earlier this month. According to a report in [DataBreaches.net](https://www.databreaches.net/airasia-victim-of-ransomware-attack-passenger-and-employee-data-acquired/), the company was hit by the Daixin Team ransomware group, which claims to have stolen data on more than five million of the airline's passengers, data they are now threatening to leak online.

### General tech and privacy

**Wickr shuts down free IM service:** Secure instant messaging service Wickr announced that it would [shut down](https://wickr.com/our-focus-on-end-to-end-encrypted-enterprise-communications/) its free service to focus on its commercial offering. The company said it would not accept new user registrations after December 31, 2022, and will discontinue the Wickr Me service on December 31, 2023. Amazon acquired Wickr in [June 2021](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-welcomes-wickr-to-the-team/) and was planning to use it as an E2EE service for its commercial enterprise offerings—now known as [AWS Wickr](https://aws.amazon.com/wickr/).

**Twitter does its thing:** A network of Twitter bot accounts has been blamed for stoking riots and physical clashes between Indian and Pakistani supporters at the end of August in the UK city of Leicester. More than 500 accounts were spotted urging both groups to violence, with some accounts tweeting as much as 500 times per minute. [*Additional coverage in [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-16/india-based-twitter-accounts-fanned-uk-unrest-researchers-say?leadSource=uverify%20wall)*/[non-paywalled](https://archive.ph/GFtbj)]

> "After the first instances of fake videos spread on Twitter, a 'highly orchestrated echo chamber,' from India kicked into amplify tweets 'solely blaming Muslims for the events in Leicester,' the report claimed, which in turned spurred even more violence against Hindus in Leicester."

**Passkeys support directory:** After it [added support for passkeys](https://blog.1password.com/passkeys-are-coming-to-1password/) in its password manager, 1Password has also created a [web directory](https://passkeys.directory/) listing all online services currently supporting passkey authentication.

### Government, politics, and policy

**Quantum encryption deadline:** The Office of Management and Budget has ordered federal agencies to scan their systems and provide an inventory of assets containing cryptographic systems that could be cracked by quantum computers in the coming years. Agencies have a deadline until May 4, 2023, according to an OMB memo [[PDF](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf)]. The memo comes after the White House directed US government agencies to mitigate risks from quantum computers [earlier this year](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/) and after the NSA ordered that all government agencies that handle classified information must use quantum-resistant encryption algorithms [by 2035](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/3148990/nsa-releases-future-quantum-resistant-qr-algorithm-requirements-for-national-se/). [*Additional coverage in [FedScoop](https://www.fedscoop.com/omb-quantum-vulnerable-systems-memo/)*]

**AGs ask FTC for online privacy regulation:** A [coalition of 33 state attorneys general](https://www.nmag.gov/ag-balderas-joins-bipartisan-coalition-urging-the-ftc-to-account-for-consumer-risks-of-online-surveillance/) have urged the US Federa...
