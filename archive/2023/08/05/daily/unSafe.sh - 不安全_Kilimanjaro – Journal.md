This is an index post with links to the day-by-day journal of my [Kilimanjaro trip](https://textslashplain.com/tag/projectk/).

*I’ve split the posts up by day because the idea of summarizing the entire trip in a single post seems like as overwhelming endeavor as the trek itself. As each post is written, I’ll add its link here.*

* Day -4,-3 (June 25,26) **Flights**
* Day -2 (June 27) **Coffee Tour**
  *We tour a coffee farm and “factory” near Arusha.*
* Day -1 (June 28) **Mini Safari**
  *We visit Arusha National Park for a mini-Safari*.
* Day 0 (June 29) **Meet the Team, To Ndarakwai Lodge**
  *We meet our team and headed to a lodge in the wild.*
* Day 1 (June 30) **Entry Gate to Forest Camp**
  *Our first day of hiking as a team.*
* Day 2 (July 1) **To Shira 1** **Camp**
  *We clear the clouds and finally see Kilimanjaro for real.*
* Day 3 (July 2) **To Shira 2** **Camp**
  *Perched above the clouds*.
* Day 4 (July 3) **To Lava Tower** and **Barranco Camp**
  *We hike high (>15k feet), then descend to sleep “low*“.
* Day 5 (July 4) **Up Barranco Wall to Karanga Camp**
  *An intimidating rock scramble turns out to be the best part of the trip so far.*
