# Weekly Update 448

22 April 2025

I'm a few days late this week, finally back from a month of (almost) non-stop travel with the last bit being completely devoid of an internet connection ðŸ˜² And now, the real hard work kicks in as we count down the next 25 days before launching the full HIBP rebrand. I'm adamant we're going to push this out on the 17th of May, and I reckon it's looking absolutely awesome! Do please feel free to check out what we're doing and chime in on the GitHub repository via the links below. I'm sure there's a lot of untapped potential yet to be unlocked.
