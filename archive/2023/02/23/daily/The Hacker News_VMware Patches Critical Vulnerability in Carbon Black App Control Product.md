[![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhp5l0X9bWwwy-mjQkIk81a4TjxAWJheoLDbatqVQprXnohqe_-zqVUM0ZHOQuAuDCYcu8BqSHP8Clh9clsxPJkjmz2Bzo-1EAr_mGVUwWt5Q1JeOhe3gJcdb6GWM92f6xd_jqzG2LvFLmOkqYzqACRiyk-2OP2e1CWg-dNDcY8a7-6u74W87nn2pWG/s790-rw-e365/vmware.png)

VMware on Tuesday released patches to address a critical security vulnerability affecting its Carbon Black App Control product.

Tracked as **CVE-2023-20858**, the shortcoming carries a CVSS score of 9.1 out of a maximum of 10 and impacts App Control versions 8.7.x, 8.8.x, and 8.9.x.

The virtualization services provider describes the issue as an injection vulnerability. Security researcher Jari Jääskelä has been credited with discovering and reporting the bug.

"A malicious actor with privileged access to the App Control administration console may be able to use specially crafted input allowing access to the underlying server operating system," the company [said](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0004.html) in an advisory.

VMware said there are no workarounds that resolve the flaw, necessitating that customers update to versions 8.7.8, 8.8.6, and 8.9.4 to mitigate potential risks.

It's worth pointing out that Jääskelä was also credited with reporting two critical vulnerabilities in the same product ([CVE-2022-22951 and CVE-2022-22952](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/vmware-issues-patches-for-critical.html), CVSS scores: 9.1) that were resolved by VMware in March 2022.

Also fixed by the company is an XML External Entity ([XXE](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_%28XXE%29_Processing)) Vulnerability (CVE-2023-20855, CVSS score: 8.8) affecting vRealize Orchestrator, vRealize Automation, and Cloud Foundation.

"A malicious actor, with non-administrative access to vRealize Orchestrator, may be able to use specially crafted input to bypass XML parsing restrictions leading to access to sensitive information or possible escalation of privileges," VMware [said](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2023-0005.html).

It's not uncommon for threat actors to target VMware product vulnerabilities in their attacks so it's crucial that users install the patches as soon as possible.
