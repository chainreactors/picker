Judicial courts and mayor officers across several Russian regions have been hit by a new data-wiping trojan, according to reports from Russian antivirus maker [Kaspersky](https://securelist.ru/novyj-troyanec-crywiper/106114/) and local news outlet [Izvestia](https://iz.ru/1433190/ivan-chernousov/stiratelnyi-pocherk-gosstruktury-atakoval-novyi-virus-shifrovalshchik).

Named CryWiper, the malware goes through the motions of a ransomware attack, where it scrambles files and leaves a ransom note demanding money. But Kaspersky researchers say they found evidence of data destruction routines, meaning that even if victims paid the attackers, they would not be able to recover their files.

Neither Kaspersky nor Russian government officials have formally attributed CryWiper to any specific group or entity, but the attacks over the past month are most likely connected to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which involved the deployment of multiple wipers, on both sides of the conflict.

Ukraine was [hit the most](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/01/isaacwiper-hermeticwizard-wiper-worm-targeting-ukraine/), with wipers such as WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper, CaddyWiper, and DoubleZero.

Russia wasn't spared either, being [hit in March](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/c/new-ruransom-wiper-targets-russia.html) by another wiper posing as run-of-the-mill ransomware, a wiper named [RuRansom](https://blogs.vmware.com/security/2022/04/ruransom-a-retaliatory-wiper.html).

### Breaches and hacks

**LastPass discloses second breach this year:** Password management utility [LastPass says](https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/11/notice-of-recent-security-incident/) that a threat actor has breached one of its cloud storage servers using information the company believes was initially stolen during a previous security incident that took place in August 2022. LastPass says the intruder gained access to "certain elements of our customers' information," but that account master passwords remain safely encrypted. The company says it is working with Mandiant and law enforcement to investigate the incident. The incident also impacted the infrastructure of [GoTo](https://www.goto.com/blog/our-response-to-a-recent-security-incident), a sister company part of the [LogMeIn group](https://www.lastpass.com/company/newsroom/press-release/lastpass-to-establish-cloud-security-company-independent-of-goto).

**Guatemala ransomware attack:** The Guatemala government says it is investigating a ransomware attack that impacted the IT network of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry's data was added to the leak site of the Onyx ransomware group on September 27 and was added again on November 21, according to a report from *[The Record](https://therecord.media/guatemalas-foreign-ministry-investigating-ransomware-attack/)*.

**Full Medibank dump:** The REvil ransomware gang has released the entire data set the group has stolen from Australian healthcare insurer Medibank. The data was published after the Australian company refused to pay the gang's extortion demand following a security breach in mid-October. Medibank has officially [confirmed](https://www.medibank.com.au/livebetter/newsroom/post/medibank-cybercrime-update1Dec) the leak of its entire data, which includes the personal and medical information of 9.7 million current and former customers.

**Nomad Bridge hack:** Google's Mandiant has a [post-mortem report](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/dissecting-nomad-bridge-hack) on the bug that led to the very "public" hack of the Nomad Bridge cryptocurrency exchange.

**Vatican DDoS:** The official website of the Vatican went offline on Wednesday following a DDoS attack carried out by pro-Russian hacktivists. As [CNA](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/252951/vatican-confirms-its-website-was-hacked) points out, the attack came a day after Moscow [criticized](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-protests-vaticans-criticism-special-military-operation-ukraine-2022-11-29/) Pope Francis's latest condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

### General tech and privacy

**Google sues review scammer:** Google has [filed a lawsuit](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/protecting-small-businesses-from-scammers/) against the owners of an online service called G Verifier that was allegedly defrauding small businesses by impersonating Google in telemarketing calls. Google said G Verifier was calling small business owners and offering to set up Google Business Profiles, a service that Google was providing for free. In addition, Google said that G Verifier agents also offered to provide fake reviews on the Business Profiles and boost a company's reputation. The lawsuit also alleges that G Verifier also ran websites that sold fake reviews, either positive or negative, to manipulate a company's business profile in Google Search results and Google Maps listings.

**12k Twit accounts unsuspended:** Twitter has unsuspended [more than 12,000 accounts](https://jmberger.substack.com/p/hug-a-mole) this past week, and the vast majority are linked to QAnon, the far-right, and old Russian bot farms.

**Amazon Security Lake:** Amazon has launched a new product called [Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/amazon-security-lake-preview/), a service that can aggregate security feeds and data from cloud systems, on-premises, and custom sources, to help security teams have a better view of their security posture and threat levels. The service is currently in preview.

**TrustCor removed from Mozilla root store:** Mozilla's security team has [decided to remove](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4/m/yLohoVqtCgAJ) the TrustCor certificate authority from the Firefox root store, a system that controls which certificates are trusted by the Firefox browser. The decision comes after a group of academics [found ties](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4) between the Panamanian company and companies from the...
