SUSE has kicked the Deepin Desktop Environment (DDE) out of its community-driven Linux distro, openSUSE, and the reasons it gives for doing so are revealing.

SUSE's security team published a blog post – [Removal of Deepin Desktop from openSUSE due to Packaging Policy Violation](https://security.opensuse.org/2025/05/07/deepin-desktop-removal.html) – that makes for eye-opening reading. The news comes just a week after [openSUSE Leap 16 entered beta](https://news.opensuse.org/2025/04/30/leap-16-enters-beta/), a release which contains some interesting wrinkles of its own.

Deepin is the desktop of Chinese vendor Uniontech's OS, Linux Deepin, which we [last looked at in August 2024](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/23/deepin_23/). In terms of appearance, the Deepin desktop is gorgeous. It's colorful, fluid, and friendly. It has a strong Windows 11 influence on its layout, but it's not a direct clone like the [strange Wubuntu distro](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/wubuntu/). It is also found on a few other distros, such as [Ubuntu DDE](https://ubuntudde.com/), which we last looked at when [the 22.04 version appeared](https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/28/ubuntu_dde_...
