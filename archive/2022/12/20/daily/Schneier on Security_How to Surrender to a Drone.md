## How to Surrender to a Drone

The Ukrainian army has released an [instructional video](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-army-video-tells-russians-how-to-surrender-to-drone-2022-12) explaining how Russian soldiers should surrender to a drone:

> “Seeing the drone in the field of view, make eye contact with it,” the video instructs. Soldiers should then raise their arms and signal they’re ready to follow.
>
> After that the drone will move up and down a few meters, before heading off at walking pace in the direction of the nearest representatives of Ukraine’s army, it says.
>
> The video also warns that the drone’s battery may run low, in which case it will head back to base and the soldiers should stay put and await a fresh one.
>
> That one, too, should be met with eye contact and arms raised, it says.

Incredible.

I think of this as just an extension of the classic person with bullhorn saying ‘come out with your hands up’

> Incredible

Some people made an effort to make surrendering “fool proof”.

Sounds like the Ukrainians, or their advisors, are thinking this through, contrary to their opponents who seem to have abandoned “thinking” as a strategy.

It is odd, that the drone doesn’t have a PA ability. Lots of police style drones do.

Sticking your hands up to an unknown operator of a drone could be just as hazardous as not doing so. Imagine the carnage. Imagine if you surrender but the drone turns out to be your own side == own goal; you’d be lucky not to face a firing squad or a hail of bullets.

So long as the drone is, as @jbmartin6 said “person with bullhorn”, no big deal.

…until the drone has a firearm or other weapon on it. Then ware become one sided where some will kill without prejudice because they are safe behind the remote controls, while the other side is still flesh and blood bodies in the line of fire.

Drone warfare, just because we can doesn’t mean we should.

This protocol assumes the drone is under human control, and isn’t some autonomous loitering weapon.

Also, Russian soldiers (“orcs”) aren’t well-liked by many Ukrainians. I think I’d be inclied to run and hide, rather than risk coming out with my hands up.

I don’t know what Ukraine does with captured prisoners; if it were down to me, I guess I’d put them to work cleaning up the cities they’ve flattened. The native Ukrainian workforce is kinda busy just now. I also don’t know what resources Ukraine has for looking after thousands of Russian prisoners.

I imagine some Russians would be willing to defect, and join the Ukrainian army. I have no idea what tasks such a defector might be assigned; I would be disinclined to arm them, and would instead assign them to a catering battallion or something.

Basically, they are treated according to the Geneva convention. Because, the sponsors of Ukraine demand that in return for support.

… many Russian grunts on the front lines are miserable & disillusioned, and eager to surrender to change their desperate situation — any opportunity to surrender can be attractive.

the history of warfare has many odd instances of surrender actions by desperate soldiers.

but note that the Ukrainian government is heavily into self serving propaganda…

So it is good that NGOs, Red Cross, and journalists are able to roam the free part of Ukraine.

@ ALL,

Remember there are two sides in a surrender and they both start off armed, and mostly they all want to go home.

During WWII it was not unknown for various sides to use a faux-surrender as an ambush stratagem. Some were actually what we would now call “suicide bombers”. All they realy achieved was the loss of more life for their own side.

Whilst surrendering has risks for both sides, but usually both sides play by the rules such as they are (flag of parole etc).

Using a drone by the accepting side is a fairly good way to take a surrender safely. Also an unarmed drone can usually be seen as such so gives confidence to those surrendering they are not going to be hurt or baddly treated.

As for the current combatants, I know people are saying the Ukranian’s would rather XXX…

Actually it’s not true. Whilst there are always a few, most Ukranian’s know the more Russiab troops they accept the surrender from and ...
