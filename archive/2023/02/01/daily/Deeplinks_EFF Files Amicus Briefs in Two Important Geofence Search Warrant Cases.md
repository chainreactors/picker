Should the police be able to identify everyone who was in a busy metropolitan area, just because a crime occurred there? In two amicus briefs just filed in appellate courts, we argue that’s a clearly unconstitutional search.[[1]](#_ftn1)

The two cases are *[People v. Meza](https://www.eff.org/document/people-v-meza-geofence-warrant-eff-amicus-brief-support-appellant-california-court-appeal)*, in the California Court of Appeal, and *[United States v. Chatrie](https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-chatrie-nyueff-amicus-brief-support-appellant-fourth-circuit)*, in the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In each case, the defendant is challenging the police use of a surveillance tool we’ve [written](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/geofence-warrants-threaten-civil-liberties-and-free-speech-rights-kenosha-and) [about](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/new-federal-court-rulings-find-geofence-warrants-unconstitutional-0) [before](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/its-time-google-resist-geofence-warrants-and-stand-its-affected-users) called a “geofence warrant.” In both cases, the lower courts denied motions to suppress. In *Chatrie*, however, the district court issued a [lengthy opinion](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/federal-court-virginia-holds-geofence-warrant-violates-constitution) holding the geofence warrant was unconstitutional before ruling that police relied on the warrant in “good faith” and therefore the evidence from their search was admissible.

Unlike traditional warrants for electronic records, a geofence warrant doesn’t start with a particular suspect or even a device or account; instead police request data on every device...
