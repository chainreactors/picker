Run native PE or .NET executables entirely in-memory. Build the loader as an .exe or .dll—DllMain is Cobalt Strike UDRL-compatible

**MemLoader** is a proof-of-concept framework for running native **PE** executables or **.NET** assemblies *entirely* from memory.
It ships with two independent loaders:

| Loader | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **pe-loader** | Reflectively loads and runs a native PE (`.exe`) |
| **dotnet-loader** | Hosts the CLR and executes a managed assembly |

Both loaders can be built either as a console **EXE** or as a **DLL**.

## Features

* **In-memory execution** – no payload ever touches disk once the loader starts.
* **RC4 payload encryption** – use `Common/Encrypt.py` to encrypt your binary and generate the header file included at build time.
* **Evasion techniques**
