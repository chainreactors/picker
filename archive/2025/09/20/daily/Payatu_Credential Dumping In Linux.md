### Introduction: What is Credential Dumping?

Credential dumping refers to the systematic extraction of usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information from operating systems by malicious actors. This technique poses a significant threat, particularly within Linux environments, where successful credential extraction can lead to unauthorised access to user accounts, services, and network resources. Understanding the mechanisms of credential storage in Linux, the vulnerabilities that may expose these credentials, and the strategies for safeguarding them are essential for enhancing system security.
