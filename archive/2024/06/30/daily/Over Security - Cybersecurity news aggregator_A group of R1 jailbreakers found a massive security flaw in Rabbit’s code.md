# A group of R1 jailbreakers found a massive security flaw in Rabbit’s code

The company behind the R1 is under fire once again, this time for failing to keep sensitive API keys secure.

Rabbit and its R1 AI gadget are under fire again, and it’s much more serious than the time we found out [its launcher really could just be installed as an Android app](/2024/4/30/24145838/rabbit-r1-android-app-pixel-6a). A group of developers and researchers called [Rabbitude](https://rabbitu.de/) says it [discovered API keys](https://rabbitu.de/articles/security-disclosure-1) hardcoded in the company’s codebase, putting sensitive information at risk of falling into the wrong hands.

These keys essentially provided access to Rabbit’s accounts with third-party services like its text-to-speech provider ElevenLabs and — [as confirmed by *404 Media*](https://www.404media.co/researchers-prove-rabbit-ai-breach-by-sending-email-to-us-as-admin/) — the company’s SendGrid account, which is how it sends emails from its rabbit.tech domain.

Since then, the group says its access to most of the keys has been revoked, suggesting that the company rotated them, but as of earlier today, it [still had access to the SendGrid key](https://rabbitu.de/articles/security-disclosure-2).

Rabbit responded to our request for comment by pointing us to [a page on its site](https://www.rabbit.tech/security-investigation-062524), published midday on Wednesday. Company spokesperson Ryan Fenwick says that the company will be updating the page to “provide updates as they become available.” The statement on its site echoes a post Rabbit made to its Discord channel yesterday, saying that it is in the midst of investigating the incident but hasn’t yet found “any compromise of our critical systems or of the safety of customer data.”
