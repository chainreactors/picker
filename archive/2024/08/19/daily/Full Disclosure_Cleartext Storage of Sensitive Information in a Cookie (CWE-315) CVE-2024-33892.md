Hash: SHA512

Advisory ID:               SYSS-2024-017
Product:                   Ewon Cosy+
Manufacturer:              HMS Industrial Networks AB
Affected Version(s):       Firmware Versions: < 21.2s10 and < 22.1s3
Tested Version(s):         Firmware Version: 21.2s7
Vulnerability Type:        Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie (CWE-315)
Risk Level:                Low
Solution Status:           Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2024-03-27
Solution Date:             2024-07-18
Public Disclosure:         2024-08-11
CVE Reference:             CVE-2024-33892
Author of Advisory:        Moritz Abrell, SySS GmbH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Ewon Cosy+ is a VPN gateway used for remote access and maintenance
in industrial environments.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"The Ewon Cosy+ gateway establishes a secure VPN connection between
the machine (PLC, HMI, or other devices) and the remote engineer.
The connection happens through Talk2m, a highly secured industrial
cloud service. The Ewon Cosy+ makes industrial remote access easy
and secure like never before!"

Due to cleartext storage of the password in a cookie, an attacker with
appropriate access is able to retrieve the plaintext administrative
password.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

The credentials used for the basic authentication against the web
interface of Cosy+ are stored in the cookie "credentials" after a
successful login.

An attacker with access to a victim's browser is able to retrieve the
administrative password of Cosy+.

In addition, the cookie is not secured (no HttpOnly, Secure or
SameSite attribute is set). Thus, the credentials could also be extracted
in combination with cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Note: During the responsible disclosure process, SySS GmbH became aware of
CVE-2015-7928[8], which describes an issue with password autocomplete
in Ewon devices. Since this function contains the problematic cookie,
this CVE may already describe the insecure cookie. SySS GmbH would therefore
like to credit the reporter of CVE-2015-7928, Karn Ganeshen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

1. "credentials" cookie value: YWRtOlN1cDNyUzNjcjN0IyM=

2. Decoded credentials:
    #> echo -n "YWRtOlN1cDNyUzNjcjN0IyM=" | base64 -d
        adm:Sup3rS3cr3t##

Bonus: accessing the cookie from JavaScript code:
<script>alert("Credentials can be access via JavaScript" + document.cookie)</script>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

According to the manufacturer note[4], the vulnerability was fixed
with the firmware versions 21.2s10 and 22.1s3.
