> What I cannot create, I do not understand. -Richard Feynman

In this course we will build a Storyteller AI Large Language Model (LLM). Hand in hand, you'll be able to create, refine and illustrate little [stories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) with the AI. We are going to build everything end-to-end from basics to a functioning web app similar to ChatGPT, from scratch in Python, C and CUDA, and with minimal computer science prerequisites. By the end you should have a relatively deep understanding of AI, LLMs, and deep learning more generally.
