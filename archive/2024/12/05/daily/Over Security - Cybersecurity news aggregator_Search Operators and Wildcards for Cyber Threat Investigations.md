Search Operators and Wildcards for Cyber Threat Investigations

Finding information on specific cyber threats in a vast amount of data can be challenging. Threat Intelligence Lookup from [ANY.RUN](?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=operators_wildcards&utm_term=041224&utm_content=linktolanding) simplifies this task with wildcards and operators that provide you with the ability to create flexible and precise search queries.

Let’s take a look at how you can use them to identify and collect intel on malware and phishing attacks more effectively.

## **About Threat Intelligence Lookup**

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/mainscreen-1024x597.png)

[Threat Intelligence (TI) Lookup](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=operators_wildcards&utm_term=041224&utm_content=linktoti) is a fast and efficient tool designed to simplify cyber threat investigations. It allows for flexible searches for [Indicators of Compromise](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/malconf-in-ti-lookup/) (IOCs), Indicators of Attack (IOAs), and Indicators of Behavior (IOBs).

TI Lookup provides access to a constantly updated database of threat data collected from millions of [public malware and phishing samples](https://app.any.run/submissions/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=operators_wildcards&utm_term=041224&utm_content=linktoservice) analyzed in ANY.RUN’s Interactive Sandbox.

Each sandbox session contains detailed logs of system and network events that occur while a threat is executing. By searching through this comprehensive data, you can easily find connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of information and tie them to a specific threat.

Here’s how TI Lookup can help you and your organization:

* **Investigate Threats Quickly**: Gather extensive and in-depth information on emerging and persistent cyber threats with [over 40 search parameters](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-lookup-search-parameters/) (e.g. threat names, command lines, registry logs, etc.).

* **Receive Real-Time Updates**: Stay informed with [real-time updates](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/ti-lookup-notifications/) on results for your search queries.

* **Enrich Threat Intelligence**: Get relevant context, indicators, and samples manually analyzed by threat analysts.

## **Search Operators in TI Lookup**

Search operators are essential tools in TI Lookup that allow you to combine several indicators to refine your search queries effectively. They act as logical connectors that help you specify the relationships between different conditions in your search and achieve greater flexibility and precision in your searches.

TI Lookup supports logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT, as well as grouping with parentheses. Let’s take a closer look at each of these.

### **AND**

**What it does**

The AND operator helps you combine multiple conditions.

**Why use it**

AND is great for narrowing down your search to find threats by including as many unique indicators as possible.

It is equally effective in situations when you have several completely disparate artifacts, like an IP address and a mutex, and want to link them to a particular threat.

**Example**

| [domainName:"thum.io" AND domainName:"logo.clearbit.com"](https://intelligence.any.run/analysis/lookup/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=operators_wildcards&utm_term=041224&utm_content=linktolookup#%7B%2522query%2522:%2522domainName:%255C%2522thum.io%255C%2522%2520AND%2520domainName:%255C%2522logo.clearbit.com%255C%2522%2522,%2522dateRange%2522:180%7D) |
