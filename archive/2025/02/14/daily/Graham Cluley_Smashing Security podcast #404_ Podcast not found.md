The story of how hackers managed to compromise the US Government‚Äôs official SEC Twitter account to boost the price of Bitcoins, AI isn‚Äôt helping reduce the rife conspiracy theories inside classrooms, and is the funeral bell tolling for ransomware?

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, joined this week by special guest Jane Wakefield.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
