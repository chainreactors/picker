# The Trouble with Procurement Departments, Resellers and Stripe

23 August 2024

It should be so simple: you're a customer who wants to purchase something so you whip out the credit card and buy it. I must have done this *thousands* of times, and it's easy! I've bought stuff with plastic credit cards, stuff with Apple Pay on my phone and watch and, like all of us, loads of stuff simply by entering credit card details into a website. A lot of that has been business expenses for which I've obtained a receipt and then claimed back, either in my joyful life of independence or in [a decade and a half at one of the world's largest companies](https://www.troyhunt.com/today-marks-two-important-milestones/).

Don't get me wrong, credit cards have their faults too. I've had them defrauded many times now, [but that's usually just a minor inconvenience](https://www.troyhunt.com/relax-its-only-your-credit-card-near/). Getting one can be painful if you're young and have no credit record, but a debit card is much more easily obtainable and still gives you all the same purchasing power so long as you've got cash in the account. And, well, that's about it. Frankly, I find it increasingly weird when a credit card *can't* be used. I travel a lot to different corners of the world, and it's extraordinarily rare not to pay for pretty much everything with "plastic". Increasingly, that's the only possible way with it not just being the defacto payment standard in most countries I visit but increasingly being the *only* form of payment accepted by many stores. Not using a card is becoming increasingly antiquated; today, I stood behind a woman buying a carton of milk with a $20 note, and geez, it was slow compared to the 5 seconds it took me to buy a few bucks of potatoes with my watch. Which makes me all the more frustrated by what I'm about to write:

Five years ago, we started charging [a few bucks to use the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) API](https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/). It was primarily to stop abuse, and it worked *beautifully!* Turns out that once you have to stump up a credit card tied your IRL identity, you're a lot less inclined to do nasty things. Implementing this via Stripe was a breeze, and as the years progressed, that model gradually evolved. A few years later, [we added higher rate limits, and with that came annual billing as well](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-have-i-been-pwned-api-now-has-different-rate-limits-and-annual-billing/). The following year, [we put a price on searches of the largest domains](https://www.troyhunt.com/welcome-to-the-new-have-i-been-pwned-domain-search-subscription-service/) and coincidental to this blog post, that was about a year before the time of writing. This led to a lot of new subscriptions, which means now is when those that were taken out annually are starting to renew and subsequently, now is when the problems are really hitting.

Let's scroll back a bit and talk about "Neville". Neville works in the procurement department of a large organisation, and his job is to take that dead simple credit card purchase process and turn it into the most convoluted, laborious, and mind-numbingly stupid exercise possible. That all begins with wanting a quote for the product. Now, you might reasonably look at this request and think "Neville, why on earth do you want a quote when the price is already on the website?!" These services start at $3.95; does creating a quote that merely reproduces the publicly published price and puts Neville's company name on it *actually* achieve anything? No! Occasionally, Neville will just ask for an invoice, which again, just reproduces publicly available information in a PDF just for him. But that's "protocol", and Neville is a stickler for doing things by the book. Oh - and no credit cards. WTF Neville?! Yep, electronic funds transfer only and that'll be on 60 day terms in arrears too, thankyou very much. That's just Neville's way.

I often liken this to when I'd travel to Hong Kong for work. It was always a multi-day trip and inevitably, I'd need to eat. So, I'd find a nice noodle bar somewhere and order my fill, probably paying about the same amount as that $3.95 HIBP entry price. Now, imagine a Neville driving my noodle purchasing such that as I rocked up for lunch, ordered my noodles and was presented with the EFTPOS machine I said "No, I'm going to need a quote first". For noodles. And further, once I accept that quote, I'll need an invoice which I'll pay within 60 days (which really means somewhere between 59 and 60 days, because "Neville"), and I'll need your banking details too please, because we don't do credit cards. I never tried that, but I'm confident that if I did, I'd get a stern Cantonese version of GTFO. And rightly so.

But that's where we quite literally are with HIBP; the Nevilles of the world eschewing the most simple, universal form of payment in favour of, well, the exact opposite. Every organisation is different, of course, but these are the patterns that play out over and over again. The "we can't purchase anything by credit card" line in particular is pervasive, and in all seriousness, I do wonder: WTF do you do when you travel?! *Surely* there are people within your organisation that go far enough away from HQ to legitimately justify a meal somewhere, and clearly they're playing out the scenario described in the previous para. So, you have a way, it's just selective. But Neville persists, and [we make it possible to do quotes and invoices for sufficiently sized subscriptions](https://support.haveibeenpwned.com/hc/en-au/articles/7675764827535-Can-you-raise-an-invoice-before-payment-is-made?ref=troyhunt.com) at the expense of our own time. Neville is now happy - almost.

"We can't pay by credit card". Over and over again, we get this line. Often it's not even that blunt, it's more akin to "can we have an invoice" which usually turns out to be code speak for "can we have an invoice and pay by EFT". Now, I don't particularly mind electronically transferring funds around account to account, but it's messy. We've got BSBs identifying the bank here in Australia but then it's typically SWIFT codes elsewhere. No problem, we can do that, but then we have the next problem: who just paid us? I mean, there's a sum of money that has appeared and it's identical to all the other sums because we're providing the same service to many different parties, so... who just paid? You can always reference an invoice number in the description of the payment, but that's up to the sender of the money and *very* frequently, that just doesn't happen. The sender's name doesn't necessarily make sense either, and even if it does, we're now burning time doing manual reconciliation. Further, it's not instantaneous like a credit card so not only are we waiting around for a payment before being able to do reconciliation and then turn on the service, the purchaser is *also* waiting around; they've just been notified a bunch of their staff are caught in the latest data breach that could have serious impact on the org and they need to... wait. And all of that doesn't matter anyway because we have another major problem: Stripe.

You know how earlier I said that Stripe was a breeze? Let me clarify that by saying that Stripe *can* be a breeze, and it can be an absolute nightmare. If you've implemented their service before and read the previous paragraph you may be thinking "why aren't you just using [their bank transfer payments feature](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers?ref=troyhunt.com)", and you click on that link and realise why:...
