There's a Max Schrems-shaped object standing in the way of Meta's plans to train its AI on the data of its European users, and he's come armed with several justifications for why Zuckercorp might be violating EU regulations with its stated plans.

> Noyb contends it's 'absurd' for Meta to argue it needs the personal data of every single user's post and comments from the past 20 years to adequately train its AI

The Austrian lawyer's noyb (None Of Your Business) privacy advocacy group sent a [cease and desist](https://noyb.eu/en/noyb-sends-meta-cease-and-desist-letter-over-ai-training-european-class-action-potential-next-step) letter to Meta Wednesday. Noyb's letter tells the Facebook giant that, if it opts not to discuss the matter or agree to make user data for AI data training an explicit opt-in, as opposed to the [opt-out approach](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/15/meta_resume_ai_training_eu_user_posts/) Meta is currently pursuing, Schrems and company are ready to file an injunction, or even take the matter to court in a class-action case.
