### Crack Me If You Can

Our contest is split into two brackets, Pro category and Street.

In Pro, HashMob had a narrow victory over hashcat, with Cynosure Prime
taking third.

In Street, ThatOnePasswordWas40Passwords dominated.

First time in years that hashcat has been knocked off of the top spot!

We had 35 teams compete, which may be a new record.

This year's data sets included a lot of nested puzzles - user passwords
that once cracked could also open encrypted files or archives, which
then contained hints and other information that would aid in cracking
more, higher-point-value user passwords. We got everything from
encrypted Arj to Zip, and a range of password hash algorithms including
ones made up for the contest that teams had to reverse-engineer or work
off of spotty hints in notes they recovered.

You also asked for interesting things that happened, for the first time
in 3 years someone figured out that they can script the UI to do things
like automatically eat the fruit when it re-spawns and maximize their
points collection.

We also got a really cool homemade "Green Book of Green Things"
scavenger hunt item turned in by Claudus. It was very obviously made
with care and love just for us so an extra shout-out for that turn-in.
