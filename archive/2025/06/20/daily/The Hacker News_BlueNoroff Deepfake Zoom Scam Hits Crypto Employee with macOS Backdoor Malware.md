[![Deepfake Zoom Scam](data:image/png;base64... "Deepfake Zoom Scam")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwJcIEkVVfT0uAQTl1EBl8RxZ_IorTAFwekZ8ZmTGcl-y8GQK6w0WJyravHlIykzVos-sUFVpPHa4egQh97guUPftdYCsaafAIa9cYN-L0ZtI0Z0pSCNoIKkfyIZVSfIkywPYRXglIaGZ9sMYwLllhnQieInF7NU2VQ_Ccktv51LhsmvTUl3FqHwYtgKEq/s790-rw-e365/deepfake.jpg)

The North Korea-aligned threat actor known as [BlueNoroff](https://thehackernews.com/2022/12/bluenoroff-apt-hackers-using-new-ways.html) has been observed targeting an employee in the Web3 sector with deceptive Zoom calls featuring deepfaked company executives to trick them into installing malware on their Apple macOS devices.

Huntress, which revealed details of the cyber intrusion, said the attack targeted an unnamed cryptocurrency foundation employee, who received a message from an external contact on Telegram.

"The message requested time to speak to the employee, and the attacker sent a Calendly link to set up meeting time," security researchers Alden Schmidt, Stuart Ashenbrenner, and Jonathan Semon [said](https://www.huntress.com/blog/inside-bluenoroff-web3-intrusion-analysis). "The Calendly link was for a Google Meet event, but when clicked, the URL redirects the end user to a fake Zoom domain controlled by the threat actor."

After several weeks, the employee is said to have joined a group Zoom meeting that included several deepfakes of known members of the senior leadership of their company, along with other external contacts.

"It's unclear if a legitimate Zoom meeting took place, but there is evidence that they used Zoom favicon that was hosted outside of Zoom, which would appear when the victim visited the malicious link," Jamie Levy, director of adversary tactics at Huntress, told The Hacker News. "Looking at that and previous reports, it's not far-fetched to think that it was something outside of legitimate Zoom infrastructure."

However, when the employee said they were unable to use their microphone, the synthetic personas urged them to download and install a Zoom extension to address the supposed issue. The link to the extension, shared via Telegram, downloaded an AppleScript that went by the name "zoom\_sdk\_support.scpt."

This AppleScript first opens a legitimate webpage for the Zoom software development kit (SDK), but is also configured to stealthily download a next-stage payload from a remote server ("support[.]us05web-zoom[.]biz") and executes a shell script.

The script begins by disabling bash history logging and then checks if Rosetta 2 is installed on the compromised Mac, and if not, installs it. [Rosetta](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102527) is a software that enables Macs running Apple silicon to run apps that were built for a Mac with an Intel processor (x86\_64).

The script then proceeds to create a hidden file called ".pwd," and downloads a binary from the malicious Zoom web page ("web071zoom[.lus/fix/audio-fv/7217417464") to the "/tmp/icloud\_helper" directory. It also performs another request to "web071zoom[.]us/fix/audio-tr/7217417464" to fetch another unspecified payload.

The shell script also prompts the user to provide their system password and wipes the history of executed commands to avoid leaving a forensic trail. Huntress said its investigation led to the discovery of eight distinct malicious binaries on the victim host -

* **Telegram 2**, a Nim-based binary responsible for starting the primary backdoor
* **Root Troy V4**, a fully-featured Go backdoor that's used to run remote AppleScript payloads, shell commands, and download additional malware and execute them
* **InjectWithDyld**, a C++ binary loader downloaded by Root Troy V4, which, in turn, drops two more payloads: A **benign Swift application** to facilitate process injection and a different **Nim implant** that enables the operator to issue commands and receive responses asynchronously
* **XScreen**, an Objective-C keylogger with features to monitor the victim's keystrokes, clipboard, and the screen, and send the information to a command-and-control (C2) server
* **CryptoBot**, a Go-based information stealer that can collect cryptocurrency related files from the host
* **NetChk**, an almost empty binary that's designed to generate random numbers forever

BlueNoroff, also tracked under the names Alluring Pisces, APT38, Black Alicanto, Copernicium, Nickel Gladstone, Stardust Chollima, and TA444, is a sub-cluster within the Lazarus Group that has a [history](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-hackers-target-macos-using.html) of [striking](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/north-korean-hackers-steal-10m-with-ai.html) financial institutions, cryptocurrency businesses, and ATMs for [monetary gain](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-assessment-north-korean-threat-groups-2024/) and generate revenue for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

The group is best known for orchestrating a series of cryptocurrency heists known as [TraderTraitor](https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/north-korean-hackers-pull-off-308m.html) to target employees of organizations engaged in blockchain research with malicious cryptocurrency trading applications. Some of the significant cases include the hacks of [Bybit](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/safewallet-confirms-north-korean.html) in February 2025 and [Axie Infinity](https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-use...
