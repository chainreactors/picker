On the first day, Pwn2Own Vancouver 2023 hacking challenge participants compromised Windows 11, Tesla, macOS, and Ubuntu Desktop.

AbdulAziz Hariri of Haboob SA, who completed his attack against Adobe Reader utilizing a 6-bug logic chain leveraging many failed fixes that escaped the [sandbox](https://cybersecuritynews.com/what-is-sandboxing/) and overcame a banned API list, gave the first demonstration of the day. 5 Master of Pwn points and $50,000 are awarded to him.

Microsoft SharePoint was the target of a 2-bug chain that STAR Labs was able to run. They receive 10 Master of Pwn points and $100,000.

Oracle VirtualBox was exploited by Bien Pham (@bienpnn) of Qrious Security (@qriousec) via an OOB Read and a stacked-based buffer overflow. 4 Master of Pwn points and $40,000 are awarded to him.

Tesla – Gateway was the target of a TOCTOU attack by Synacktiv (@Synacktiv). They receive a Tesla Model 3 and $100,000, and 10 Master of Pwn points.

> CONFIRMED! [@Synacktiv](https://twitter.com/Synacktiv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) successfully executed a TOCTOU exploit against Tesla – Gateway. They earn $100,000 as well as 10 Master of Pwn points and this Tesla Model 3.

Although the exploit was already known, STAR Labs (@starlabs sg) was successful in its attack against Ubuntu Desktop. They still receive $15,000 in addition to 1.5 Master of Pwn points.
