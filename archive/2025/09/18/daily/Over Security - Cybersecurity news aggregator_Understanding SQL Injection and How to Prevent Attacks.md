![Understanding SQL Injection and How to Prevent Attacks](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Understanding-SQL-Injection-and-How-to-Prevent-Attacks-820x385.png)

SQL injection, also known as SQLi, is a technique that targets websites and apps using SQL databases. It works by inserting SQL code into a website’s input fields to gain access to sensitive information, including customer records, intellectual property, and personal data.

Any app (web, desktop, or mobile) that uses SQL databases and processes data can get hit by SQL injection. The fallout can be serious, as attackers might snag admin credentials and completely take over affected websites, apps, or database servers.

## How SQL Injection Works

### Understanding SQL Queries

Structured Query Language (SQL) is declarative: developers tell the database what they want, not how to get it. A classic query might be:

```
SELECT email, password_hash FROM users WHERE username = 'alice';
```

When that statement is embedded in a programming language, developers frequently build it via string concatenation:

```
$username = $_POST['user'];
$query    = "SELECT email, password_hash FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";
```

If **`$username`** contains a single quote, the string literal in SQL ends prematurely. Supplying **`alice' OR '1'='1`** produces:

```
SELECT email, password_hash FROM users WHERE username = 'alice' OR '1'='1';
```

Because **`'1'='1'`** is always true, the WHERE clause returns every record. Understanding how tokens, literals, and operators assemble inside a parser is the bedrock for grasping injection. The problem is magnified in ORMs that build queries automatically: developers trust the abstraction and overlook the importance of parameter binding. Every entry vector that ultimately joins user text to an SQL string needs protective handling, whether it originates from a search box or a hidden mobile API parameter.

### The Process of Exploiting SQL Injection

Attackers approach methodically. Recon starts with a simple apostrophe to trigger a syntax error and confirm that input reaches the database. Once the error reveals table or column names, the attacker adjusts payloads.

Next, **`UNION SELECT`** joins are used to align result sets because they return data without breaking application flow. A carefully staged series of queries can enumerate the schema via **`information_schema.tables`**, then pull sensitive fields in chunks to evade detection. Modern exploits frequently employ time-based **`SLEEP()`** functions to extract data through blind injection where no output is directly visible: differing response times encode bits.

If error handling is silent, attackers fall back on out-of-band (OOB) channels such as **`load_file()`** or writing web-accessible files that the attacker then downloads. The entire process is scriptable; tools like sqlmap automate discovery and exploitation, meaning a single vulnerable endpoint is enough for mass attacks across thousands of sites in minutes.

### Types of SQL Injection

According to the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), injection attacks were the third most serious web application security risk in 2025. SQL injection can go down in a few different ways, each with its own tricks and consequences.

* **Union-Based SQL Injection:** This is the most common way. Attackers use the UNION SQL operator to mash up results from the original query with extra data, which then shows up in the response.
* **Blind SQL Injection:** This one’s tougher and harder to pull off. Blind SQL injection happens when the app only spits out generic error messages. Attackers send queries that result in true or false responses, figuring things out based on how the database replies, or with time-based attacks, how long it takes to respond.
* **Boolean-Based SQL Injection:** This attack messes with query logic and conditions (often aiming at authentication queries) to trick the database into giving higher permissions or access. Boolean-based injections are also used in blind SQLi, grabbing data by sending tons of conditional requests and checking the results.
* **Error-Based SQL Injection:** Here, attackers take advantage of messy inputs to make the database throw errors thr...
