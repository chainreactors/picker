 The [**SAP Champion Spotlight Interview Series**](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/spotlight-interview/) highlights key strategic topics and provides insights from SAP Champions and SAP leaders on turning ideas into innovative approaches that impact people, process, and technology. |

Most of the innovative discoveries in business and IT have something in common – they are the result of curiosity.

Curiosity is how we grow individually and collectively. For developers, tech visionaries, innovators, and leaders, it fuels learning, discovery, innovation, and engagement.

Due to a lack of time and social norms, curiosity may feel out of reach at times. Some struggle and jump to conclusions rather than explore further. It can be uncomfortable not to know the right answer.

Adapting to uncertain market conditions and external pressures reminds us that keeping an open mind and staying curious helps achieve successful outcomes. It represents a never-ending cycle to make better decisions and address more effective solutions.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/CircleProfile-1.png)

Staying curious should be *practiced* *purposefully* every day.

For murali.shanmugham, SAP Champion, SAP Mentor Alumni, SAP PRESS author, Forbes online contributor, SAP Customer Success Manager for SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), he has a long-standing curiosity about software technology.

From his early community experiences, there were times that he would be stuck on an issue or need some advice to arrive at a solution. After a few years of asking questions, he got more confident with what he was doing with SAP technology, which led to him answering questions and posting over 200 blogs on a variety of SAP BTP topics.

It was great to catch-up with Murali in his North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia home office.

**Stacey Fish (SF):** **Hi Murali! You have two degrees in Computer Software Engineering – a bachelor’s from Periyar University, and a master’s from Bharathiyar University. What sparked your interest in software and technology, leading to your current role as** **Customer Success Manager – SAP Business Technology Platform at SAP?**

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/11/Murali1.png)Murali Shanmugham (MS):** In my school days, software technology was something I was always curious to know more about. I enjoyed learning new things that involved programming, website development, photoshopping images, or editing videos.

After graduating, I chose software technology as a career since I could see a big demand in digitizing processes within organizations, and an opportunity to be able to create impact and be part of such initiatives. In my current role at SAP Australia, there is always something new and exciting to learn, and opportunities to help deliver solutions that can transform industries.

**SF:****As an SAP Champion, how did you first contribute and connect to the Community to become a Technology Ambassador? In this role, how do you engage with Community members?**

**MS:** I started using the SAP Community around 2005 with my first SAP engagement as an SAP ABAP developer. Being new to SAP technology, I used the Community a lot to get help when I was stuck with some issues or when I needed some advice on how to arrive at a solution.

Like many others, I used the Community to get answers whenever I needed help. However, few years (when I got more confidence with what I was doing with SAP technology), I started to help and answer questions in the forum. The more time I spent in these forums, the more I learned from others.

I was fortunate to work on SAP HANA Cloud Platform (which is now SAP Business Technology Platform) in early 2013 and I had many opportunities to engage with customers who were looking to use it to address different requirements. I started to write blog posts to share my experiences with the platform – these blog posts were mostly coming from customer requirements which show how BTP services can be orchestrated to provide a solution.

I have posted more than 200 blog posts on different BTP topics, and I’m always amazed by the response from the Community. Apart from being on the Community platform, I also enjoy collaborating with community members in face-to-face events like SAP Inside Track & SAP Stammtisch events in Sydney.

**SF:** **Enjoyed reading your blog, “**[**Collaboration in SAP AppGyver Projects**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/09/23...
