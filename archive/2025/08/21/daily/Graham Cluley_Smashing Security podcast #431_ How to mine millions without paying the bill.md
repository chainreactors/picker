In episode 431 of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast, a self-proclaimed crypto-influencer calling himself CP3O thought he had found a shortcut to riches ‚Äî by racking up millions in unpaid cloud bills.

Meanwhile, we look at the growing threat of EDR-killer tools that can quietly switch off your endpoint protection before an attack even begins.

And for something a little different, we peek into the Internet Archive‚Äôs dystopian Wayforward Machine and take a detour to Mary Shelley‚Äôs resting place in Bournemouth.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veterans Graham Cluley, joined this week by special guest Allan ‚ÄúRansomware Sommelier‚Äù Liska.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
