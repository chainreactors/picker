Updated Fortinet has gone public with news of a critical flaw in its software management platform.

The security vendor [apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortinet/comments/1g6vspq/why_was_fortimanager_728_released/) began informing customers privately about the issue a few days ago but has since opened up about the issue in its FortiManager control software. The vulnerability, [CVE-2024-47575](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-47575), has a CVSS score of 9.8 and would allow a remote attacker to run code on unpatched systems – and, given the application's management tools, possibly spread further over a network.

"A missing authentication for critical function vulnerability [CWE-306] in FortiManager fgfmd daemon may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands via specially crafted requests," states Fortinet’s [advisory](https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-24-423#:~:text=Summary,be%20exploited%20in%20the%20wild.), which adds the words no user wants to read: "Reports have shown this vulnerability to be exploited in the wild."
