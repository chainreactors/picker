# Weekly Update 462

28 July 2025

This will be the title of the blog post: "Court Injunctions are the Thoughts and Prayers of Data Breach Response". It's got a nice ring to it, and it resonates so much with the response to other disasters where the term is offered as a platitude that has absolutely no practical benefit at all. You know, like the Qantas injunction to prevent data from their breach being examined by other parties. So, whilst it means journos won't be poring over it (and we won't be loading it into HIBP), criminals will pay no attention to it whatsoever. More to come in the forthcoming blog post.
