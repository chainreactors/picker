![What is Steganography? How Hackers Hide Malware On Websites](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/23-BlogPost_Feature-Image_1490x700_What-is-Steganography-820x386.jpg)

As a child, I loved sending secret messages to my friends using invisible ink. A quick squeeze of lemon juice was all I needed to jot down my secret message. When combined with a simple heat source (I used the heat of the wood stove), the contents of my top secret note were revealed in shades of brown on the paper.

If this sounds familiar to you, then you too have participated in the ancient art of steganography. But how does it relate to website security? In this blog post, we will delve into the world of steganography, exploring what it is, how it works in the context of malware, and implications for your website’s environment.

## What is steganography?

Steganography is the art of concealing secret information within (or even on top of) seemingly innocuous files or objects. It’s a bit like playing hide and seek, where data is hidden in a way that nobody even suspects it’s there.

In the context of website security, steganography is sometimes used by bad actors to camouflage their malware in typical website files — for example, by [embedding malware within CSS files](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/02/whitespace-steganography-conceals-web-shell-in-php-malware.html) or concealing a [credit card skimmer inside a seemingly benign audio file](https://blog.sucuri.net/2022/06/it-takes-2-seconds-of-silence-to-skim-a-credit-card.html).

Don’t make the mistake of confusing steganography with cryptography, which involves scrambling data and secret keys for decoding. While it’s common for them to appear hand-in-hand in the real world, cryptography aims to ensure privacy — steganography’s main objective is secrecy and deception.

## How does steganography work?

One popular method of steganography is called **least significant bit (LSB) steganography,** which essentially tucks away secret data in the tiniest bits of a media file.

For example, imagine you have an image file. Each pixel has three bytes of data for red, green, and blue colors (and sometimes a fourth one for transparency, called “alpha”). With LSB steganography, the last bit of each of these bytes is altered to hide secret data. So, if you want to hide 1 MB of data, you’ll need an 8 MB image file.

Most importantly, changing the last bit of the pixel value doesn’t actually change how the image looks. So, when someone’s looking at the original and the modified images, they won’t be able to spot any difference. Sneaky, right?

You can accomplish the same result with other digital media, like audio and video files, by hiding data in parts of the file that don’t really change how it sounds or looks.

Another less common steganography technique involves hiding the message in a larger text by using word or letter substitutions. The sender hides the message by putting the secret words at specific intervals. This method is easy to use, but it can make the text look weird and out of place since the hidden words might not fit well in their sentences.

## Recent examples of steganography

While detecting steganography on websites can be a challenging task, we rounded up a few recent examples of steganography found on hacked websites in recent years:

### Steganography conceals web shell in PHP malware

In 2021, Sucuri Malware Researcher [Denis Sinegubko](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/denis) documented how seemingly benign [CSS and PHP files were being used to hide malicious code](https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/02/whitespace-steganography-conceals-web-shell-in-php-malware.html). An inconspicuously named **license.php** file was found to contain text for a license agreement, but hidden within the file on line 134 was a gap between two comments containing malicious PHP containing a whitespace decoder.
