As we navigate through 2024, the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, bringing new challenges for both businesses and individual consumers. The latest OpenText Threat Report provides insight into these changes, offering vital insights that help us prepare and protect ourselves against emerging threats. Here’s what you need to know:

## The resilience of ransomware

[Ransomware](https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/11/07/opentext-security-solutions-2022-global-smb-ransomware-survey-fighting-more-with-less/) remains a formidable adversary, with groups like LockBit demonstrating an uncanny ability to bounce back even after significant law enforcement actions. Despite a recent crackdown that saw authorities dismantle its infrastructure, LockBit swiftly resumed operations, even taunting law enforcement agencies in the process. This adaptability highlights how resourceful ransomware groups have become, enabling them to evade detection and persistently challenge defenders.

For businesses, this means implementing a comprehensive incident response plan that includes secure, immutable backups and regular testing to ensure rapid recovery in the event of an attack. Consumers should also take measures like frequently backing up their data to an external drive or cloud solution. This resilience requires ongoing vigilance and robust security measures for everyone involved.

## Malware infections on the rise

[![Chart showing rise in malware infections for business and consumer PCs.](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06121348/threat-report-bar-chart-1024x586.jpg)](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06121348/threat-report-bar-chart.jpg)

For the first time in years, [malware infection](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection) rates are rising among both businesses and consumers. The uptick is primarily attributed to attackers leveraging advanced tools like generative artificial intelligence (AI), which helps them craft malware that’s more sophisticated and adaptive. Malware variants are becoming more difficult to detect, and infection methods are increasingly creative, such as using enticing email attachments or redirecting users to malicious sites via QR codes.

This new wave of malware infections serves as a stark reminder for businesses and individuals to strengthen their cyber defenses. Keep all devices updated with the latest security patches, and use reputable antivirus solutions that can block suspicious downloads and identify malicious software. Additionally, be wary of unexpected attachments or links and avoid clicking on anything that looks suspicious.

## Phishing gets personal

Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated, thanks to tools like generative AI, which enable attackers to personalize their campaigns for maximum impact. What was once a clear distinction between mass phishing emails and more targeted [spear-phishing](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/spear-phishing-explained) attempts is now blurring, making it harder to distinguish between the two. Attackers can craft convincing emails that mimic legitimate brands, logos, and domains to trick unsuspecting victims into providing sensitive information or clicking malicious links.

For both businesses and consumers, this trend emphasizes the need for increased vigilance and cybersecurity awareness. Educate yourself on common phishing tactics and train employees to recognize fraudulent emails. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) can add a vital layer of protection, and carefully inspect email addresses and links before taking any action.

## The critical role of cyber resilience

The report underscores the importance of adopting a [multi-layered defense strategy](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/corporate-internet-security) to mitigate the impact of these evolving threats. Cyber resilience involves proactive measures to prevent attacks while also ensuring you can quickly recover if a breach occurs. For businesses, this means implementing strong antivirus software, endpoint protection solutions, and regular software updates. For consumers, being alert to suspicious emails, using secure passwords, and frequently backing up data is crucial.

A multi-layered approach integrates different layers of defense, making it much harder for an attacker to compromise all systems simultaneously. Combine antivirus tools with DNS protection, endpoint monitoring, and user training for comprehensive protection.

## Regional disparities in cyber threats

[![Map showing cyber threat increases on each continent from 2022 to 2023.](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06121611/threat-report-map-1024x595.jpg)](https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/06121611/threat-report-map.jpg)

Geographical factors significantly influence the prevalence and nature of cyber threats. The report identifies regions like Asia, Africa, and South America facing higher infection rates than North America and Europe, partly due to differing economic conditions, cybersecurity maturity, and regulatory environments. Malware campaigns are often tailored to exploit regional nuances, such as the availability of local payment methods or common software vulnerabilities.

Businesses operating globally should adapt their cybersecurity strategies to account for these disparities, ensuring protections are tailored to local ris...
