# New AI “agents” could hold people for ransom in 2025

Posted: February 4, 2025
 by [David Ruiz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/davidruiz)

A paradigm shift in technology is hurtling towards us, and it could change everything we know about cybersecurity.

Uhh, again, that is.

When [ChatGPT](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/chatgpt-ai-security) was unveiled to the public in late 2022, security experts looked on with cautious optimism, excited about the new technology but concerned about its use in cyberattacks. But two years on, much of what ChatGPT and other generative [AI](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-was-the-mirai-botnet) chat tools offer attackers is a way to improve what already works, not new ways to deliver attacks themselves.

And yet, if artificial intelligence achieves what is called an “agentic” model in 2025, novel and boundless attacks could be within reach, as AI tools take on the roles of “agents” that independently discover vulnerabilities, steal logins, and pry into accounts.

These agents could even hold people for ransom by matching stolen data online with publicly known email addresses or social media accounts, composing messages and holding entire conversations with victims who believe a human [hacker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/hacker) out there has access to their Social Security Number, physical address, credit card info, and more. And if the model works for individuals, there’s little reason it wouldn’t work for individual business owners.

This warning comes from our 2025 State of [Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) report, which compiled a year’s worth of intelligence to identify the most pressing cyberattacks on the horizon. Though the report’s guidance serves IT teams, its threats will impact individuals and small businesses everywhere. Remember that just last year a widespread IT outage grounded flights globally, cementing the relationship between companies, cybersecurity, and everyday people.

In 2025, agentic AI may further reveal just how closely tied everyone is in the battle for cybersecurity. Here’s what we might expect.

[You can find the full 2025 State of Malware report here](https://www.threatdown.com/dl-state-of-malware-2025/).

## **The generative AI non-revolution**

The November 2022 launch of ChatGPT ushered forth a new relationship with our computers. No longer would we need to use our laptops, smartphones, and tablets to record or assist our creative work. Now, we could make those same machines complete the creative work for us.

AI image tools like Midjourney and DALL-E can create images when given simple text prompts. They can even mimic the styles of famous artists, like Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Picasso. AI chat tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude—from OpenAI competitor Anthropic—can brainstorm ideas for marketing materials, write book reports, compose poems, and even review human-written text for legibility. These tools can also answer an endless array of factual questions, much like the separate AI tool Perplexity, which advertises itself not as a “search engine,” but as the world’s first “answer engine.”

This is the potential of “generative AI,” a term used to describe AI tools that can generate text, images, movies, summaries, and more, limited only by our imagination.

But where has that im...
