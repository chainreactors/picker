# Consent to gather data is a “misguided” solution, study reveals

Posted: February 13, 2023

When researchers from the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication conducted a survey to see if “informed consent” practices are working online with regard to user data gathering, the results revealed weaknesses in a framework that, for decades, has served as the basis for online privacy regulation in the US. This framework, which is commonly known as “notice of consent,” usually allows organizations to freely collect, use, keep, share, and sell customer data *provided* they inform them about their data-gathering practices and get their consent. However, [as the New York Times noted](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/technology/online-privacy-tracking-report.html), the survey results add another voice to “a growing body of research suggesting that the notice-of-consent approach has become obsolete.”

## “Informed consent is a myth”

The [report](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/2023-02/Americans_Can%27t_Consent.pdf), entitled “Americans Can’t Consent to Companies’ Use of Their Data,” contains the results, expert analyses, and interpretation of survey results. The authors not only give attention to the gap in American users’ knowledge of how companies use their data but also reveal their deep concern about the consequences of its use yet feel powerlessness in protecting it. Believing they have no control over their data and that trying would be pointless is what the authors call “resignation,” a concept they introduced in 2015 in the paper, [“The Tradeoff Fallacy.”](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2820060)

As the Annenberg School report said:

> “High percentages of Americans don’t know, *admit* they don’t know, and believe they can’t do anything about basic practices and policies around companies’ use of people’s data.”

The authors define genuine consent as people having “knowledge about commercial data-extraction practices as well as a belief they can do something about them.” The survey finds that Americans have neither.

“We find that informed consent at scale is a myth, and we urge policymakers to act with that in mind,” the report said.

The New York Times noted a handful of regulators agreeing to the report’s findings.

“When faced with technologies that are increasingly critical for navigating modern life, users often lack a real set of alternatives and cannot reasonably forgo using these tools,” said Lina M. Khan, a chairperson of the Federal Trade Commission, in a [speech](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Remarks%20of%20Chair%20Lina%20M.%20Khan%20at%20IAPP%20Global%20Privacy%20Summit%202022%20-%20Final%20Version.pdf) last year.

Digital consent has had critics as early as 1999, denoting that its weakness remained unaddressed for almost 25 years. Paul Schwartz, a professor at the University of California and author of the paper [“Privacy and Democracy in Cyberspace,”](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=205449) had warned that consent that was given via privacy policy notices was “unlikely to be either informed or voluntarily given.” The notices were “meaningless,” he said, as most people ignore them, were written in a vague and legalistic language that very few people understand, and “fail to present meaningful opp...
