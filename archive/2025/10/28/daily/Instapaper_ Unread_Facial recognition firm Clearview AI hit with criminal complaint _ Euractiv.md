Max Schrems attacca Clearview. In punta di diritto potrebbe avere ragione. (oltre a fare la cosa giusta)

> European privacy rights group noyb filed a criminal complaint against the controversial US facial recognition company Clearview AI and its leadership on Tuesday.
>
> …
>
> But despite multiple GDPR fines being issued on Clearview – in total the company has received €95.7 million in administrative fines from data protection authorities in Greece, France, Italy, and the Netherlands since February 2022 – EU authorities have struggled to collect the money. The US-based firm has been largely able to dodge GDPR enforcement in the EU, as it has no formal representation on the continent.
>
> Noyb’s complaint accuses Clearview of simply ignoring EU law. By filing a criminal complaint, the privacy rights group said it hopes that – should Clearview be found guilty – its management would have to risk jail time or being held personally liable if they travel to the EU.
>
> …
>
> It points out that the GDPR gives scope to enforcement authorities to foresee criminal sanctions for certain data breaches if such a criminal provision has been implemented in national law – as is the case in Austria.
