# An Interview With the Target & Home Depot Hacker

November 14, 2024

[21 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/an-interview-with-the-target-home-depot-hacker/#comments)

In December 2023, KrebsOnSecurity revealed the real-life identity of **Rescator**, the nickname used by a Russian cybercriminal who sold more than 100 million payment cards stolen from **Target** and **Home Depot** between 2013 and 2014. Moscow resident **Mikhail Shefel**, who confirmed using the Rescator identity in a recent interview, also admitted reaching out because he is broke and seeking publicity for several new money making schemes.

Mr. Shefel, who recently changed his legal surname to **Lenin**, was the star of last year’s story, [Ten Years Later, New Clues in the Target Breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/12/ten-years-later-new-clues-in-the-target-breach/). That investigation detailed how the 38-year-old Shefel adopted the nickname Rescator while working as vice president of payments at **ChronoPay**, a Russian financial company that paid spammers to advertise fake antivirus scams, male enhancement drugs and knockoff pharmaceuticals.

Mr. Shefel did not respond to requests for comment in advance of that December 2023 profile. Nor did he respond to reporting here in January 2024 that he ran an IT company with a 34-year-old Russian man named **Aleksandr Ermakov**, who was sanctioned by authorities in Australia, the U.K. and U.S. for [stealing data on nearly 10 million customers of the Australian health insurance giant Medibank](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/who-is-alleged-medibank-hacker-aleksandr-ermakov/).

But not long after KrebsOnSecurity reported in April that Shefel/Rescator also was behind [the theft of Social Security and tax information](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/who-stole-3-6m-tax-records-from-south-carolina/) from a majority of South Carolina residents in 2012, Mr. Shefel began contacting this author with the pretense of setting the record straight on his alleged criminal hacking activities.

In a series of live video chats and text messages, Mr. Shefel confirmed he indeed went by the Rescator identity for several years, and that he did operate a slew of websites between 2013 and 2015 that sold payment card data stolen from Target, Home Depot and a number of other nationwide retail chains.

Shefel claims the true mastermind behind the Target and other retail breaches was [**Dmitri Golubov**](https://www.wired.com/2007/01/tracking-the-russian-scammers/), an infamous Ukrainian hacker known as the co-founder of Carderplanet, among the earliest Russian-language cybercrime forums focused on payment card fraud. Mr. Golubov could not be reached for comment, and Shefel says he no longer has the laptop containing evidence to support that claim.

Shefel asserts he and his team were responsible for developing the card-stealing malware that Golubov’s hackers installed on Target and Home Depot payment terminals, and that at the time he was technical director of a long-running Russian cybercrime community called [Lampeduza](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/cards-stolen-in-target-breach-flood-underground-markets/).

“My nickname was MikeMike, and I worked with Dmitri Golubov and made technologies for him,” Shefel said. “I’m also godfather of his second son.”

A week after breaking the story about the 2013 data breach at Target, KrebsOnSecurity published [Who’s Selling Cards from Target?](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/whos-selling-credit-cards-from-target/), which identified a Ukrainian man who went by the nickname **Helkern** as Rescator’s original identity. But Shefel claims Helkern was subordinate to Golubov, and that he was responsible for introducing the two men more than a decade ago.

“Helkern was my friend, I [set up a] meeting with Golubov and him in 2013,” Shefel said. “That was in Odessa, Ukraine. I was often in that city, and [it’s where] I met my second wife.”

Shefel claims he made several hundred thousand dollars selling cards stolen by Golubov’s Ukraine-based hacking crew, but that not long after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 Golubov cut him out of the business and replaced Shefel’s malware coding team with programmers in Ukraine.

Golubov was arrested in Ukraine in 2005 as part of a joint investigation with multiple U.S. federal law enforcement agencies, but his political connections in the country ensured his case went nowhere. Golubov later earned immunity from prosecution by becoming an elected politician and [founding the Internet Party of Ukraine](https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/dimitri-iwanowitsch-golubow-gesuchter-hacker-als-darth-vader-a-903751.html), which called for free internet for all, the creation of country-wide “hacker schools” and the “computerization of the entire economy.”

Mr. Shefel says he stopped selling stolen payment cards after being pushed out of the business, and invested his earnings in a now-defunct Russian search engine called [tf[.]org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170630180838/http%3A//tf.org/). He also apparently ran [a business called click2dad[.]net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sr3VIXwKMI) that paid people to click on ads for Russian government employment opportunities.

When those enterprises fizzled out, Shefel reverted to selling malware coding services for hire under the nickname “**Getsend**“; this claim checks out, as Getsend for many years advertised the same Telegram handle that Shefel used in our recent chats and video calls.

Shefel acknowledged that his outreach was motivated by a desire to publicize several new business ventures. None of those will be mentioned here because Shefel is already using my December 2023 profile of him to advertise what appears to be a pyramid scheme, and to remind others within the Russian hacker community of his skills and accomplishments.

Shefel says he is now flat broke, and that he currently has little to show for a storied hacking career. The Moscow native said he recently heard from his ex-wife, who had read last year’s story about him and was suddenly wondering where he’d hidden all of his earnings.

More urgently, Shefel needs money to stay out of prison. In February, he and Ermakov were arrested on charges of operating a short-lived ransomware affiliate program in 2021 called **Sugar** (a.k.a. Sugar Locker), which targeted single computers and end-users instead of corporations. Shefel is due to face those charges in a Moscow court on Friday, Nov. 15, 2024. Ermakov was recently found guilty and given two years probation.

Shefel claims his Sugar ransomware affiliate program was a bust, and never generated any profits. Russia is known for not prosecuting criminal hackers within its borders who scrupulously avoid attacking Russian businesses and consumers. When asked why he now faces prosecution over Sugar, Shefel said he’s certain the investigation was instigated by  **Pyotr “Peter” Vrublevsky** — the son of his former boss at ChronoPay.

ChronoPay founder and CEO **Pavel Vrublevsky** was the key subject of my 2014 book [*Spam Nation*](https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0), which described his role as head of one of Russi...
