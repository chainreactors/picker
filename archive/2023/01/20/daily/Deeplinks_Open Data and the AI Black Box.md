Embracing collaboratively maintained [Open Data](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/) sets in the development of AI would not only be a boon to transparency and accountability for these tools, but makes it possible for the would-be subjects to create their own innovative and empowering work and research. We need to reclaim this dat...
