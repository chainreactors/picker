# Update now! Apple fixes actively exploited vulnerability and introduces new features

Posted: March 30, 2023
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Apple has released security updates for several products. Most notably one of the updates fixes an actively exploited vulnerability in the WebKit component of iOS 15.7.4 and iPadOS 15.7.4 that was [fixed earlier](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/02/update-now-apple-patches-vulnerabilities-in-macos-and-ios) in macOS Ventura 13.2.1, iOS 16.3.1, iPadOS 16.3.1, and Safari 16.3.

You can find the specific security content for the devices you’re interested in by following the links below:

* [macOS Ventura 13.3](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213670 "About the security content of macOS Ventura 13.3")
* [Safari 16.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213671 "About the security content of Safari 16.4")
* [Studio Display Firmware Update 16.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213672 "About the security content of Studio Display Firmware Update 16.4")
* [iOS 15.7.4 and iPadOS 15.7.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213673 "About the security content of iOS 15.7.4 and iPadOS 15.7.4")
* [tvOS 16.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213674 "About the security content of tvOS 16.4")
* [macOS Big Sur 11.7.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213675 "About the security content of macOS Big Sur 11.7.5")
* [iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213676 "About the security content of iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4")
* [macOS Monterey 12.6.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213677 "About the security content of macOS Monterey 12.6.4")
* [watchOS 9.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213678 "About the security content of watchOS 9.4")

The updates may already have reached you in your regular update routines, but it doesn’t hurt to check if your device is at the [latest update level](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222). If a Safari update is available for your device, you can get it by updating or upgrading macOS, iOS, or iPadOS.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. The actively exploited vulnerability is listed as [CVE-2023-23529](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-23529): a type confusion issue that Apple says has been addressed with improved checks.

Type confusion vulnerabilities are programming flaws that happen when a piece of code doesn’t verify the type of object that is passed to it before using it. So let’s say you have a program that expects a number as input, but instead it receives a string (i.e. a sequence of characters), if the program doesn’t properly check that the input is actually a number and tries to perform arithmetic operations on it as if it were a number, it may produce unexpected results which could be abused by an attacker.

Type confusion can allow an attacker to feed function pointers or data into the wrong piece of code. In some cases, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device. So, an attacker would have to trick a victim into visiting a malicious website or open such a page in one of the apps that use WebKit to rende...
