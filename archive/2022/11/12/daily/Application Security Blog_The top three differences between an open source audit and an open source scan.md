One of the biggest challenges of helping organizations determine the correct approach to managing their open source usage is the range of risk profiles, standards, and even definitions of “audits” and “scans.” We frequently are asked, “Can you perform an open source scan?” or “Can you perform an open source audit?” The answer is we can do both, but we need to understand the use case to determine which approach makes the most sense.

Let’s start by defining what each of these terms mean. An open source scan is an entirely automated analysis, whereas an open source audit is a deeper analysis that involves experts reviewing and analyzing the results of an automated scan. The final output for both a scan and an audit is a [software Bill of Materials](/blog/software-bill-of-materials-bom.html) (SBOM)—an inventory of all the open source components in a codebase and the associated licenses and security vulnerabilities.

It’s important to note that most automated tools rely on information used by the build system. However, open source is often introduced into the code via other paths, so automated analysis comes up short. Also, build-oriented tools are designed to be integrated with the build system, so they are not suited to third-party analysis.

## Three main differences between an open source audit and an open source scan

###### Expert review

This is the biggest difference between an audit and a scan. An automated scan tool, even one like Black Duck® (which, unlike most, can discover open source snippets) is still just that—an automated tool. To create the most accurate SBOM, experts must review the results of any automated scan. Automated tools can’t always identify each open source component, often because open source components have additional open source components as dependencies. Automated tools take their best ...
