Infosec in brief Gravy Analytics, a vendor of location intelligence info for marketers which reached a settlement with US authorities last year over its alleged unlawful sale of location, has reportedly been hacked – potentially exposing millions of smartphone users.

A trove of Gravy Analytics data [reviewed and verified](https://www.404media.co/hackers-claim-massive-breach-of-location-data-giant-threaten-to-leak-data/) by 404 Media apparently indicates that advertisers are leveraging real-time bidding (RTB) processes to collect user data, which is then sold to brokers like Gravy Analytics and Mobilewalla. Both companies [settled with the FTC](https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/04/ftc_data_brokers/) in December over claims they bought and sold highly sensitive personal information without consent.

Startlingly, it appears this data collection occurs through advertising ecosystems, allowing brokers to gather location data without direct integration into apps and often bypassing user privacy permissions.
