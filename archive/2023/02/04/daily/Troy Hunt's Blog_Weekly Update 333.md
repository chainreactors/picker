# Weekly Update 333

03 February 2023

Getting everything out nice and early today so we can get out there in hit the wake park in the balmy "well over 30C" weather (the radio is talking about "severe heatwave weather" as I write this). But hey, we're surrounded by water and a beer delivery is due today so no crisis ðŸ˜Ž There's also a heap more data breach news and I'll be putting that connected BBQ to use for the first time today, stay tuned for epic pics on all of the above over the coming hours!
