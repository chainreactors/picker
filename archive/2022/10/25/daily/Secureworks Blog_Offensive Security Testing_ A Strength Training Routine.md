# Offensive Security Testing: A Strength Training Routine

Improving security maturity with offensive testing is a workout — so thoughtful structure is needed to prevent injury and maintain progress.

## Introduction

Offensive security testing is only a single facet of a complex system for improving an organization’s overall cybersecurity and resilience against threat actors. However, with a multitude of different options for testing and exercises, it can often be difficult to determine **when** and **what** to use for improvement.

A deep understanding of your organization’s security maturity is one important factor for this decision, but the thought process behind **why** and **how** to use certain types of tests or exercises bears even greater importance. Cognizance of these factors will improve the efficacy of offensive testing and exercises, and help to formulate a structured, cyclical plan. The result is an immense boost to an organization’s readiness when faced with a real-life threat.

The goal of this article is to enable a paradigm shift in the way organizations think about this decision-making process, and to dispel complexities by proposing a structured approach when creating a security improvement plan using offensive testing.

## Self-awareness

Improving cybersecurity is analogous to a properly structured workout regimen. When first starting, it’s important to understand initial limitations and to operate within realistic capabilities. When starting to incorporate weight training into a training regimen, it’s unlikely that it will be possible to lift an immense amount of weight with no prior training. There is a risk of performing the exercise incorrectly, which can cause injury and severely impede further progress and growth. Similarly, if an organization has not incorporated offensive testing into their security plan before, regardless of their assumptions about how solid their security may already be, it is best to start slowly and gradually level up. Failure to do this can limit the benefit and efficacy of a test or exercise, which is something every organization should want to avoid to maximize return on investment of these services.

## Posture and a Firm Foundation

Building a solid security foundation is paramount when it comes to offensive exercises. Having an ideal security posture comes from an intimate knowledge of your organization’s assets, as well as ensuring it has a minimal attack surface through the reduction of vulnerabilities. These are both important first steps towards maturity. Without these foundational steps, the security structure can easily collapse when introducing live threat actors into the environment.

To continue the weight training analogy, when learning how to correctly perform an exercise, such as a deadlift, perfect posture is key when aiming to lift heavier weight. While issues may not be apparent earlier on when lifting lighter weights, failure to implement correct posture and form will be detrimental later, when adding more weight and stress. The same is far truer for security as the complexity of environments and networks grows.

It’s recommended to begin by utilizing [vulnerability assessments](/services/vulnerability-assessment) to take inventory of assets and to identify and remediate easily exploitable low-hanging fruit. Next, [penetration testing](/services/penetration-testing) (pentesting) from different angles, such as external, internal, wireless, and [application testing](/services/application-security-testing), can identify deeper issues and misconfigurations present within the environment. Issues like gaps in detection, weak passwords, and poor security practices when remediated creates a firm foundational security posture ready for more advanced exercises.

**Applicable Tests:**

* Vulnerability Assessments
* External Pentests
* Internal Pentests
* Wireless Pentests
* Web Application Tests

### How Secureworks Can Help

The Secureworks Adversary Group offers a wide variety of offensive testing services to accommodate our customers’ needs. This ranges from traditional services such as pentesting and application security to highly specialized and custom engagements for autonomous vehicles, lost laptop, hardware, physical, and more.

Full details of all service offerings provided by the Secureworks Adversary Group can be found [here](/services/adversary-exercises).

## Developing Strength

After remediating based on lessons learned from previous test to establish a strong structural foundation where there is a deep understanding of assets and all low-hanging fruit has been removed, the next step is to examine and test assumptions for detection, prevention, and response capabilities.

While vulnerability assessments are primarily focused on the discovery of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, and pentests are noisy by nature without paying heed to stealth and advanced operational security factors, both can still contribute to painting a good picture of how well security devices such as EDRs and network-based intrusion detection systems alert to common activity. With this said, however, it is important to dig even deeper by applying a different strategy to look at elements that are not always apparent during traditional pentesting.

When starting endeavors to improve detection, prevention, and response capabilities, it is recommended to begin by first examining common tactics, techniques, and procedures that are used in the wild by known threat actors to ensure protection against what can be a large percentage of potential attacks. Leveraging opportunities to run through scenarios conducted by the Red Team gives the Blue Team a chance to learn about techniques and gain deeper insight about how they are used and what they look like from a telemetric standpoint in a safe environment, but also practice and gain game-time experience. This data can then be used to identify gaps in security controls and detections, which can be harnessed for detection creation and tuning to close visibility gaps and harden defenses even further.

**Applicable Exercises:**

* Collaborative exercises between the Red Team and Blue Team
* Emulation exercises

### How Secureworks Can Help

Secureworks Adversary Group offers several exercises under the Adversary Exercises service line that provide a collaborative approach to offensive testing via the use of various playbook scenarios, as well as a full scope threat intelligence-based emulation that explores known threat actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures.

## Leaving Comfort Zones

The threat landscape is continuously evolving with newer techniques and derivatives of techniques which aim to bypass detections. It is not enough to build detections or hunting playbooks around tools themselves.I Instead it’s critical to deeply understand the underlying primitives of the tools and techniques. Becomi...
