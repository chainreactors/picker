UPDATED Cisco has confirmed it is investigating claims of stealing — and now selling — data belonging to the networking giant.

This allegedly includes a ton of sensitive Switchzilla files, according to prolific extortionist IntelBroker — the moniker for one of several cyber criminals who allegedly own and operate [BreachForums](https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/28/breachforums_back_online/).

On Monday, the data thief [bragged](https://x.com/H4ckManac/status/1845884053574025416) about recently breaching Cisco with some help from a couple of other scumbag friends, and offered for sale on the darkweb souk a laundry list of private Cisco data: GitHub and GitLab projects, SonarQube projects, source code, hardcoded credentials, confidential documents, Jira tickets, API tokens, AWS private buckets, Docker builds, Azure storage buckets, private and public keys, SSL certificates, and product information.
