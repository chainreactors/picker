### Commit Details:

#### res_stasis: fix intermittent delays on adding channel to bridge
  Author: Mike Bradeen
  Date:   2024-07-10

  Previously, on command execution, the control thread was awoken by
  sending a SIGURG. It was found that this still resulted in some
  instances where the thread was not immediately awoken.

  This change instead sends a null frame to awaken the control thread,
  which awakens the thread more consistently.

  Resolves: #801

#### stir_shaken: CRL fixes and a new CLI command
  Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-19

  * Fixed a bug in crypto_show_cli_store that was causing asterisk
  to crash if there were certificate revocation lists in the
  verification certificate store.  We're also now prefixing
  certificates with "Cert:" and CRLs with "CRL:" to distinguish them
  in the list.

  * Added 'untrusted_cert_file' and 'untrusted_cert_path' options
  to both verification and profile objects.  If you have CRLs that
  are signed by a different CA than the incoming X5U certificate
  (indirect CRL), you'll need to provide the certificate of the
  CRL signer here.  Thse will show up as 'Untrusted" when showing
  the verification or profile objects.

  * Fixed loading of crl_path.  The OpenSSL API we were using to
  load CRLs won't actually load them from a directory, only a file.
  We now scan the directory ourselves and load the files one-by-one.

  * Fixed the verification flags being set on the certificate store.
    - Removed the CRL_CHECK_ALL flag as this was causing all certificates
      to be checked for CRL extensions and failing to verify the cert if
      there was none.  This basically caused all certs to fail when a CRL
      was provided via crl_file or crl_path.
    - Added the EXTENDED_CRL_SUPPORT flag as it is required to handle
      indirect CRLs.

  * Added a new CLI command...
  `stir_shaken verify certificate_file <certificate_file> [ <profile> ]`
  which will assist troubleshooting certificate problems by allowing
  the user to manually verify a certificate file against either the
  global verification certificate store or the store for a specific
  profile.

  * Updated the XML documentation and the sample config file.

  Resolves: #809

#### res_pjsip_config_wizard.c: Refactor load process
  Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-23

  The way we have been initializing the config wizard prevented it
  from registering its objects if res_pjsip happened to load
  before it.

  * We now use the object_type_registered sorcery observer to kick
  things off instead of the wizard_mapped observer.

  * The load_module function now checks if res_pjsip has been loaded
  already and if it was it fires the proper observers so the objects
  load correctly.

  Resolves: #816

  UserNote: The res_pjsip_config_wizard.so module can now be reloaded.

#### voicemail.conf.sample: Fix ':' comment typo
  Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-24

  ...and removed an errant trailing space.

  Resolves: #819

#### bridge_softmix: Fix queueing VIDUPDATE control frames
  Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-17

  softmix_bridge_write_control() now calls ast_bridge_queue_everyone_else()
  with the bridge_channel so the VIDUPDATE control frame isn't echoed back.

  softmix_bridge_write_control() was setting bridge_channel to NULL
  when calling ast_bridge_queue_everyone_else() for VIDUPDATE control
  frames.  This was causing the frame to be echoed back to the
  channel it came from.  In certain cases, like when two channels or
  bridges are being recorded, this can cause a ping-pong effect that
  floods the system with VIDUPDATE control frames.

  Resolves: #780

#### manager.c: Add entries to Originate blacklist
  Author: George Joseph
  Date:   2024-07-22

  Added Reload and DBdeltree to the list of dialplan application that
  can't be executed via the Originate manager action without also
  having write SYSTEM permissions.

  Added CURL, DB*, FILE, ODBC and REALTIME* to the list of dialplan
  functions that can't be executed via the Originate manager action
  without also having write SYSTEM permissions.

  If the Queue application is attempted to be run by the Originate
  manager action and an AGI parameter is specified in the app data,
  it'll be rejected unless the manager user has either the AGI or
  SYSTEM permissio...
