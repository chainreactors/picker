The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will vote soon on a [policy](https://sfbos.org/sites/default/files/bag112922_agenda.pdf) that would allow the San Francisco Police Department to use deadly force by [arming its many robots](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/24/san-francisco-police-propose-using-robots-capable-of-deadly-force).
