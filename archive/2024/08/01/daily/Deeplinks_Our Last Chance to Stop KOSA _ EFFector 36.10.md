EFF is chugging along, continuing to push for your rights online! We're sending out a last call for supporters to tell Congress to [vote NO on the Kids Online Safety Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/kosa-internet-censorship-bill-just-passed-senate-its-our-last-chance-stop-it), exposing the [flaws of the UN Cybercrime Treaty](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/eff-international-partners-send-urgent-appeal-eu-and-european-commission-delegates), and continuing to [update Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/why-privacy-badger-opts-you-out-googles-privacy-sandbox) to protect your privacy online.

EFFECTOR 36.10 - Our Last Chance to Stop KOSA

Since 1990 EFF has published EFFector to help keep readers on the bleeding edge of their digital rights. We know that the intersection of technology, civil liberties, human rights, and the law can be complicated, so EFFector is a great way to stay on top of things. The newsletter is chock full of links to updates, announcements, blog posts, and other stories to help keep readers—and listeners—up to date on the movement to protect online privacy and free expression.

Thank you to the supporters around the world who make our work...
