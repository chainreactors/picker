SAP Partners embracing Sustainability need to be able to deliver top-quality demonstrations to customers, and this program is designed to allow SAP to assist partners in that goal.

SAP Partners learn how to deliver engaging and value-based Sustainability focused demos and then present them back to an SAP panel which will give them feedback and validate their skills.

Our mutual success depends on our ability to deliver immersive presales presentations that demonstrate relevant business value to customers. The SAP Presales Validation program is designed to assist you in that goal.

When signing up, you will have access to enablement resources on how to deliver an engaging value-based experience, and then present a customer case to a SAP panel of experts who will give you feedback and validate your demo capabilities.

Upon successful assessment, you will receive a validation document and your digital badge.
