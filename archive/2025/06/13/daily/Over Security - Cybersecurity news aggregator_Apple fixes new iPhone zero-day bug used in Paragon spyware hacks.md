# Apple fixes new iPhone zero-day bug used in Paragon spyware hacks

[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)

10:06 AM PDT · June 12, 2025

Researchers revealed on Thursday that [two European journalists had their iPhones hacked with spyware made by Paragon](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/researchers-confirm-two-journalists-were-hacked-with-paragon-spyware/). Apple says it has fixed the bug that was used to hack their phones.

The Citizen Lab wrote in its report, shared with TechCrunch ahead of its publication, that Apple had told its researchers that the flaw exploited in the attacks had been “mitigated in iOS 18.3.1,” a software update for iPhones released on February 10.

Until this week, the advisory of that security update [mentioned](https://web.archive.org/web/20250514164408/https%3A//support.apple.com/en-us/122174) only one unrelated flaw, which [allowed attackers to disable an iPhone security mechanism](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/apple-fixes-iphone-and-ipad-bug-used-in-an-extremely-sophisticated-attack/) that makes it harder to unlock phones.

On Thursday, however, Apple [updated its February 10 advisory](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174#:~:text=Entry%20added%20June%2011%2C%202025) to include details about a new flaw, which was also fixed at the time but not publicized.

“A logic issue existed when processing a maliciously crafted photo or video shared via an iCloud Link. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals,” reads the now-updated advisory.

[In the final version of its report published Thursday](https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/), The Citizen Lab confirmed this is the flaw used against Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist.

It’s unclear why Apple did not disclose the existence of this patched flaw until four months after the release of the iOS update, and an Apple spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment seeking clarity.

The Paragon spyware scandal began in January, when WhatsApp notified around 90 of its users, [including journalists and human rights activists](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/whatsapp-says-it-disrupted-a-hacking-campaign-targeting-journalists-with-spyware/), that they had been targeted with spyware made by Paragon, dubbed Graphite.

Then, at the end of April, [several iPhone users received a notification](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/) from Apple alerting them that they had been the targets of mercenary spyware. The alert did not mention the spyware company behind the hacking campaign.

On Thursday, The Citizen Lab [published its findings](https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/) confirming that two journalists who had received that Apple notification were hacked with Paragon’s spyware.

It’s unclear if all the Apple users who received the notification were also targeted with Graphite. The Apple alert said that “today’s notification is being sent to affected users in 100 countries.”
