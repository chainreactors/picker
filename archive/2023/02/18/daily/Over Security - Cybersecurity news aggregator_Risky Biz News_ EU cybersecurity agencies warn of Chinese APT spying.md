ENISA, the EU's Cybersecurity Agency, and CERT-EU, the CERT team for EU official bodies and institutions, have published a [joint advisory](https://cert.europa.eu/blog/sustained-activity-by-specific-threat-actors) warning EU countries of the increasing threat of Chinese cyber-espionage operations.

The alert particularly warns about the activities of six Chinese groups (*or APTs, advanced persistent threats*)—namely APT27, APT30, APT31, Ke3chang, GALLIUM, and Mustang Panda.

ENISA and CERT-EU say operations conducted by these groups "pose a significant and ongoing threat to the European Union."

Officials say these groups breach their targets by establishing persistent footholds within the network infrastructure of targeted organizations.

Both public and private sector organizations are targeted, and attacks are primarily focused on information theft.

The joint advisory is the first major document published by the EU in relation to Chinese APT activity [since July 2021](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/), when the EU Council asked the Chinese government to "take action against malicious cyber activities undertaken from its territory."

The ENISA and CERT-EU joint advisory is accompanied by a [PDF](https://cert.europa.eu/files/data/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf) with details about each APT and various defensive recommendations.

"It is kind of a weird joint publication given that it talks about 'recently conducted malicious cyber activities' but then goes on to mention examples as far back as July 2021," [Stefan Soesanto](https://css.ethz.ch/en/center/people/stefan-soesanto.html), a Senior Cyber Defence Researcher at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, tells RiskyBizNews.

"On the one hand, this read to me as a stern reminder but also fairly desperate attempt by CERT-EU and ENISA to appeal to European public and private sector organizations.

"On the other hand, it was great to see all these past incidents being re-highlighted and Chinese threat actors being mentioned in the context of 'sustained activity'," Soesanto adds.

"I also think it's fantastic that the Belgian attribution was mentioned on the first page. In my opinion, the EU Council and the individual member states had forgotten that they left Belgium standing in the rain in mid-2022 when the [Belgian MFA called out](https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/news/declaration-minister-foreign-affairs-malicious-cyber-activities) APT 27, 31, and Gallium—and almost none of the member states supported them publicly," Soesanto says.

"Overall, I think this joint publication shows that the EU and member states still have a very fragmented common threat perception. It's a Belgian problem, a French problem, a German problem, and only when enough member states come together then it becomes a European problem.

"That's just not good enough in this day and age."

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Tonga ransomware attack:** TCC, Tonga's state-owned telecommunications company, was hit by ransomware. The company disclosed the incident in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=518654497083534&set=a.504685261813791). While TCC says the attack did not impact its voice and internet services, the company says the incident will slow down the delivery of bills, customer support, and connecting new customers. The Medusa ransomware gang [took credit](https://therecord.media/tonga-is-the-latest-pacific-island-nation-hit-with-ransomware/) for the attack.

**SAS cyberattack:** Scandinavian Airlines [says](https://www.sasgroup.net/newsroom/press-releases/2023/sas-cyber-attack--update/) it suffered a mysterious cyberattack during which its app and website went down and customer data leaked online. The airline says it's still investigating the incident, but it already confirmed that passengers who were using the app and website at the time of the attack had contact details, flight history, and the last four digits of their payment card number exposed.

**Atlassian hack:** Australian software company Atlassian has confirmed that hackers gained access to a contractor's systems and stole data on some of its employees. The stolen data contained the personal details of more than 13,000 employees, along with floor plans for two of Atlassian's offices. A hacking group named [SiegedSec](https://mastodon.social/%40AlvieriD%40infosec.exchange/109868863004996049) published the data online earlier this week, prompting an investigation. Atlassian told *[CyberScoop](https://cyberscoop.com/atlassian-hack-employee-data-seigedsec/)* the data was stolen from Envoy, a third-party app that Atlassian uses to coordinate in-office resources.
