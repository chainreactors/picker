We unpack how some password managers can be tricked into coughing up your secrets, with a clickjacking sleight-of-hand, what website owners can do to prevent it, and how to lock down your personal password vault.

Then we time-hop to the post-quantum scramble: ‚Äúharvest-now, decrypt later‚Äù, Microsoft‚Äôs 2033 quantum-safe pledge, and whether your printer will survive the update apocalypse.

All this, plus a gloriously dodgy URL ‚Äúshadyfier,‚Äù and turning the iconic iMac G4 into a modern media hub.

All this and more is discussed in the latest edition of the ‚ÄúSmashing Security‚Äù podcast by cybersecurity veteran Graham Cluley, joined this week by special guest Thom Langford.

Warning: This podcast may contain nuts, adult themes, and rude language.
