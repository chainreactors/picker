At EFF, we’re big fans of the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) project, which makes copyright work in empowering ways for people who want to share their work widely. EFF uses Creative Commons licenses on nearly all of our public communications. To highlight the importance of open licensing as a tool for building a shared culture, we are upgrading the license on our website to the latest version, [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Open licenses like Creative Commons are an important tool for sharing culture and learning. They allow artists and creators a simple way to encourage widespread, free distribution of their work while keeping just the rights they want for themselves—such as the right to be credited as the work’s author, the right to modify the work, or the right to control commercial uses.

Without tools like Creative Commons, copyright is frequently a roadblock to sharing and preserving culture. Copyright is ubiquitous, applying automatically to most kinds of creative work from the moment they are “fixed in a tangible medium.” Copyright carries draconian penalties unknown in most areas of U.S. law, like “statutory damages” with no proof of harm and the possibility of having to pay the rightsholder’s attorney fees.
