```
I tried to report these vulnerabilities to ImmuneFi, but they closed it
(report 62070) as "out of scope." I believe them when they tell me
something is out of scope, so now it's public.

https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap/pull/62

These vulnerabilities collectively enable fee theft, creator fee hijacking,
and potential user exploitation through uncapped fee rates. Issue #3 allows
attackers to steal all creator fees from pools they didn't create by
exploiting the UncheckedAccount validation gap.

I think the PoC speaks for itself.

P.S. If anyone would like to show their
appreciation, 0x24750B6b6B85dc01a4deCF764a999702550ccAe3 is my wallet
address.

Happy holidays, hackers!
