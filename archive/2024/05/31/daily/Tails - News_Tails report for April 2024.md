# Tails report for April 2024

# Highlights

* Spoiler alert! We are working on friendlier ways to back up *Persistent
  Storage*. We are working on a new flow that adapts *Tails Cloner* to the
  different stages of making backups (setting up, reminding, and updating) and
  integrating it with the *Persistent Storage* settings.
* We continued investing in making our infrastructure and services more robust,
  usable, and secure:

  + We continued making the development at Tails more pleasurable. Our test
    suite is much kinder to Tails developers now.
  + We fixed all the broken links on our website (hundreds!). We have now
    implemented a monthly automated check for new broken links.
  + Our new server is now breaking into a sweat! We deployed new internal
    services and made good progress in creating redundancies of our website
    and email systems.
* We have a new sponsors: Start Small Foundation! The generous (our
  largest ever, too) donation significantly prolongs our financial runway in
  the short to medium-term. We plan to use this platform to keep improving our
  infrastructure, and build on this platform to bring exciting, new functionality
  to Tails!

# Releases

ðŸ“¢ [We put Tails 6.2 out in the world](../version_6.2/)!

Tails 6.2 carries:

* support for 21 new languages on the Welcome Screen!
* the final set of improvements for better detection of hardware failures on Tails USB sticks

diversity. If that sounds like it could be you, do consider contributing to the
