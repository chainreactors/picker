Hey All,

This blog is purely going to be non-technical and it’s all about the mindset everyone needs to acquire to advance in their career irrespective of whatever Domain they are currently in.

For people who are wondering who I am, I am Joshua Arulsamy, **the first one to stay in the NCIIPC Newsletter as Top 15 Security Researchers in India for three consecutive times**.

Disclaimer: This is not a life advice so don’t take me wrong, these are just few stuffs I wish if I knew before I would not have wasted time overthinking and getting frustrated.

To make it simple I’ll put it down as points:

1. **No one is too smart, and no one is Dumb**

This world is surrounded by people who portray themself as super smart and intentionally or unintentionally make you feel inferior sometimes, but in reality, it doesn’t work that way, if someone is trying to make you feel inferior, they are just scared if you are superior to them in real would be a threat to their illusional superiority.

Just smile and accept what they say, never argue too much. You would never gain anything out of arguing, but your smile will drive them mad. In short Accept you’re dumb and time will make them understand the reality.

No one is too smart, and no one is Dumb

2. **It’s okay to lose your close circle of friends**

Make your priority strong, either find happiness in yourself by self-development and chasing your dreams or by spending time with your loved ones, either way it’s perfect to pick one and enjoy every single day of your life but it’s not at all a great idea to pick one and complain about losing the other.

Being alone is powerful

**3. Never get Satisfied with what you have**

Tasting success for the first time will drive you crazy and when you see people supporting you, it’s very common that you will become super confident but use it as a fuel to burn brighter not as water to make the burning fire inside you settle.

**4.Be Grateful to everyone who helped you to reach where you are today**

Never forget something!!

You are what you are today is just 50–60 % of your effort, 40 % of which is just because of people who helped you, pushed you up and selflessly worked for your success, never forget them!

Grateful

**5. Accept Failure**

Being born as a human everybody is prone to commit mistakes but accepting that would make you better and speed up your success rate by twice!’
