# Poisoned Search: How Hackers Turn Google Results into Backdoors

![malvertising image](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2130044327-e1761837203839.jpg)

That’s what researchers at Blackpoint Cyber’s Security Operations Center (SOC) discovered in their [recent analysis of the Oyster malware campaign](https://blackpointcyber.com/blog/malicious-teams-installers-drop-oyster-malware/). Attackers bought Google ads that led unsuspecting users to a fake site, teams-install.top, which delivered a Trojanized Microsoft Teams installer. Once installed, the malware established persistence through scheduled tasks and DLL registration, quietly stealing credentials and files.

“It’s a really clever twist,” said LMG Security’s Matt Durrin on a *[Cyberside Chats Live](https://www.lmgsecurity.com/event/cyberside-chats-live-poisoned-search/)*. “If you’re a Microsoft 365 user, you’d just go to Microsoft’s site. But Google Workspace users? They search for ‘download Teams’—and that’s exactly who these attackers targeted.”

This incident highlights a growing threat trend: **SEO poisoning and malvertising**, where attackers manipulate search results and paid ads to deliver malware or phishing pages. This social engineering attack is increasing in popularity and scope—and it’s catching both end users and IT staff off guard.

## **The Rise of Search-Based Phishing**

Attackers are moving beyond email because, quite simply, email defenses have improved. Filters are catching more spam, users are better trained, and companies are running phishing simulations. So, threat actors are going where users still click freely: search engines.

The [2025 Netskope Cloud Threat Report](https://www.netskope.com/resources/cloud-threat-report/cloud-and-threat-report-2025) found that enterprise employees clicked phishing links at a rate of **8 per 1,000 users per month**, up nearly **190% year-over-year**—and that **most of those clicks no longer come from email**, but from **search engines and ads**.

“Hackers are actually using a different method to phish you,” LMG founder Sherri Davidoff explained. “They’re not just relying on emails anymore.”

### **Case Study: The Payroll Pirates**

One of the most financially damaging examples of this trend is [the Payroll Pirates campaign, uncovered by Silent Push in late 2024 and expanded on by Microsoft in 2025.](https://www.silentpush.com/blog/payroll-pirates/)

Operating under the codename *Storm-2657*, these attackers created fake HR and payroll portals for well-known companies like Macy’s, Kaiser Permanente, New York Life, and multiple U.S. universities. They purchased search ads for phrases like “Workday login” and “ADP employee portal,” tricking employees into entering credentials on cloned sites built with platforms like Wix and Leadpages.

Once the attackers had access to legitimate HR accounts, they:

* **Changed direct-deposit settings** to route paychecks into attacker-controlled bank accounts.
* **Set up mailbox rules** to delete notification emails.
* **Added MFA...
