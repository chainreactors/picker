![SiteCheck Mid-Year 2024 Report](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Reports-Page-Thumbnail-SiteCheck-Mid-Year 2024-Report-820x387.jpg)

Conducting an external website scan for indicators of compromise is one of the easiest ways to  identify security issues. While remote website scanners may not provide as comprehensive of a scan as server-side scanners, they allow users to instantly identify malicious code and detect security issues on their website without installing any software or applications.

Our free SiteCheck [remote website scanner](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) provides immediate insights about malware infections, blocklisting, website anomalies, and errors for millions of websites every month.

In this report, we’ll be analyzing data from the first half of the year to identify the most common malware infections found by our SiteCheck remote scanner. We’ll also provide examples to help website owners understand how to identify malware in their own environments.

## Website Malware Infections

In the first half of 2024, SiteCheck scanned a total of **53,234,574** websites. From this number we detected**681,182** infected sites, while another **101,819** sites were found to contain blocklisted resources.

Website infections can occur for a multitude of reasons. But most often, they’re the result of an attacker exploiting a vulnerable website for its valuable resources — credit card information, traffic, SEO, or even server resources.

We analyzed the most common signatures to pinpoint which types of malware were frequently detected on compromised systems. Injected malware and redirects were the most common infection seen in our remote scan data, followed by SEO Spam.

An overlap in distribution percentages exist, as hacked websites are often infected with more than one type of malware.

### Malware & Redirects

A total of **473,135** sites were detected with injected malware and redirects, accounting for **69.46%** of website infections detected by SiteCheck in the first half of 2024.

Malware in this category are defined as malicious external script injections, iframes, inline scripts – and exclude any detections already flagged as SEO spam. They are typically found injected into JavaScript files or nestled within a site’s HTML code.

### Balada Injector

SiteCheck detected**100,470** sites injected with obfuscated scripts for the ongoing massive malware campaign known as [Balada Injector](https://sucuri.net/reports/sitecheck-mid-year-2024-report/), accounting for **21.23%** of malware injections in the first half of 2024.

The Balada malware campaign was among the top infections that Sucuri’s remediation team cleaned so far this year, and is known to redirect site visitors to scams, ads and other malicious resources.

The JavaScript injections for this campaign are typically typically found in database options of vulnerable plugins, or appended to one or several legitimate .js files or injected into a header and/or footer of the page so that they fire on every page load and redirect traffic to the attacker’s final destination.

Character code obfuscation (decoded using String.fromCharCode) is a tell-tale sign of Balada injections, although in 2024 it’s not that obvious as they try to add other obfuscation layers. For example, here’s the most detected variation of the Balada script (soft.specialcraftbox[.]com) injected using the [Popup Builder vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/2024/01/thousands-of-sites-with-popup-builder-compromised-by-balada-injector.html):
