# CIDR and Organization Finder

## Overview

The CIDR and Organization Finder is a powerful Python script designed to retrieve CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) blocks and associated organization information for given IP addresses. It utilizes multiple WHOIS data sources to provide comprehensive and accurate results.

## Features

* Retrieves CIDR blocks and organization names for IP addresses
* Uses multiple WHOIS data sources: CYMRU, ARIN, and IPWhois
* Implements a retry mechanism for resilience against temporary failures
* Provides asynchronous processing for improved performance
* Supports rate limiting to avoid overloading WHOIS servers
* Offers options for searching specific organizations and outputting raw data
* Groups and sorts results by organization and CIDR

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)
