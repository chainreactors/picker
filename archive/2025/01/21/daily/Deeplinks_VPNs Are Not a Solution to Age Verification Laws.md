VPNs are having a moment.

On January 1st, Florida joined [18 other states](https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/) in implementing an age verification law that burdens Floridians' access to sites that host adult content, including [pornography websites](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pornhub-pulling-out-of-florida-on-january-1st-2025/) like Pornhub.
