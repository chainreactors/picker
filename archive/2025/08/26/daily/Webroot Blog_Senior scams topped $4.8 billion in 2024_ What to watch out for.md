Americans aged 60 and older lost [$4.8 billion in 2024 to scammers](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/seniors-lost-48-billion-scammers-2024-fbi/story?id=121059590), according to a report released by the FBI. These figures represent real people, real families, and life-changing financial devastation.

The impact extends beyond just the numbers. [The average loss among people over the age of 60 was $83,000, more than four times the average overall loss in 2024](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/online-scams-2024-statistics-fbi/). This disparity highlights why seniors have become prime targets for sophisticated scam operations.

## Why seniors are targeted

Cybercriminals specifically target older adults for several reasons. Many seniors have accumulated substantial savings over their lifetimes, own their homes outright, and maintain good credit scores. Additionally, some may be less familiar with modern technology and digital security practices, making them more vulnerable to online deception.

## The 5 scams draining senior bank accounts

**1. Tech support fraud**

[Tech support scams](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams/tech-support-scams) happen when scammers pose as representatives of legitimate businesses like banks and utility companies. They reach out in various ways, including phone calls, texts and pop-up windows. They claim there’s an issue with a device or account and ask to send a fee to fix it. These fake alerts provide phone numbers that connect victims to scammers who then request remote access to computers and payment for unnecessary “repairs.”

**2. Romance scams**

Lonely seniors looking for love and companionship can easily fall victim to [romance fraud](https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/romance/?cmp=KNC-DMP-FRD-Fraud-Ongoing-RomanceScams-NonBrand-Exact-64840-GOOG-DatingScams-Exact-NonBrand&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11119750300&gbraid=0AAAAAC1RszuBsrItrfC6PUPfc0PuwAeBh&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvOSCi83ljgMVXEb_AR3DKwGFEAAYAiAAEgLnGvD_BwE). Criminals create fake profiles on dating sites and social media. These scammers build emotional relationships over weeks or months before requesting money to be wired or transferred to them for emergencies or travel expenses. [Romance scams cost seniors $277 million (up 16% from 2022)](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/ftc-issues-annual-report-congress-agencys-actions-protect-older-adults) according to the FTC’s latest report.

**3. Grandparent scams**

One of the most disturbing trends is the [grandparent emergency scam](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/scam-alert/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated). Fraudsters use AI to clone the voice of a grandchild in distress. Grandma or Grandpa gets a fake call from someone who sounds just like their grandchild saying need of money for bail, medical emergencies, or another crisis. They often request that the victim keep the call secret and send money immediately through wire transfers or gift cards. These scams work because they create emotional urgency.

**4. Investment fraud**

[Older adults report losing more money, $538 million—a 34% increase over 2022, to investment scams than any other type of fraud](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/ftc-issues-annual-report-congress-agencys-actions-protect-older-adults). These scams often originate from phone calls, emails, social media, or events where fraudsters promise “guaranteed” high returns with little to no risk. Many schemes use urgency (“act now before it’s too late”), pose as financial advisors, or an affinity group related to their community or church. Seniors may fall for them because they sound safe and tailored to their situation, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate opportunities and fraudulent ones until it’s too late.

**5. Government impersonation scams**

Scammers pose as representatives from Medicare, [Social Security](https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-and-scam-awareness/), or the IRS, claiming there are problems with benefits or threatening legal action unless immediate payment is made. For example, a call, text or social media message from someone who says they work at the Social Security Administration. They threaten to suspend the senior’s Social Security number or stop their Social Security payments unless they send them money owed. This type of claim is a scheme to steal both identity and money.  Social Security numbers can’t be suspended, and government agencies will never ask to be paid via wire transfer, cryptocurrency or payment apps.

## Signs that it might be a scam

* Unexpected phone calls or pop-ups claiming a computer is infected
* Requests for immediate payment via wire transfer, gift cards, or cryptocurrency
* High-pressure tactics demanding quick decisions
* Unsolicited romantic interest from strangers online
* Claims of emergency situations involving family members
* Promises of unrealistic investment returns
