[![Turla Exploits Pakistani Hackers](data:image/png;base64... "Turla Exploits Pakistani Hackers")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCY23PEAH9dtcI8bTqcR-D8CiNPAHOTqmX-FOG4TcttGlVtLEjNm7eSwBOTLjQ3PQ1YWMr8edIJ4dXJ-a5-MUJB7mT5t7irJg5zxwg5ufWQV1kOqbgxtYC2MlAcpRBeaqVPuaX-8W52JwFwnFcjtUc1mN7logWPhbqTACwtv0IZdOabPACxAkKdckbuUlK/s790-rw-e365/hacking.png)

The Russia-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as **[Turla](https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/turla-group-deploys-lunarweb-and.html)** has been linked to a previously undocumented campaign that involved infiltrating the command-and-control (C2) servers of a Pakistan-based hacking group named Storm-0156 to conduct its own operations since 2022.

The activity, first observed in December 2022, is the latest instance of the nation-state adversary "embedding themselves" in another group's malicious operations to further their own objectives and cloud attribution efforts, Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs said.

"In December 2022, Secret Blizzard initially gained access to a Storm-0156 C2 server and by mid-2023 had expanded their control to a number of C2s associated with the Storm-0156 actor," the company [said](https://blog.lumen.com/snowblind-the-invisible-hand-of-secret-blizzard) in a report shared with The Hacker News.

By leveraging their access to these servers, Turla has been found to take advantage of the intrusions already orchestrated by Storm-0156 to deploy custom malware families referred to as [TwoDash](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=TrojanDownloader:Win64/TwoDash!dha) and Statuezy in a select number of networks related to various Afghan government entities. TwoDash is a bespoke downloader, whereas Statuezy is a trojan that monitors and logs data saved to the Windows clipboard.

The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team, which has also released its findings into the campaign, said Turla has put to use infrastructure tied to Storm-0156, which overlaps with activity clusters tracked as [SideCopy](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/sidecopy-exploiting-winrar-flaw-in.html) and [Transparent Tribe](https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/icepeony-and-transparent-tribe-target.html).

"Secret Blizzard command-and-control (C2) traffic emanated from Storm-0156 infrastructure, including infrastructure used by Storm-0156 to collate exfiltrated data from campaigns in Afghanistan and India," Microsoft [said](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/04/frequent-freeloader-part-i-secret-blizzard-compromising-storm-0156-infrastructure-for-espionage/) in a coordinated report shared with the publication.

Turla, also known by the names Blue Python, Iron Hunter, Pensive Ursa, Secret Blizzard (formerly Krypton), Snake, SUMMIT, Uroburos, Venomous Bear, and Waterbug, is assessed to be affiliated with Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).

Active for nearly 30 years, the threat actor employs a [diverse and sophisticated toolset](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/turla-pensive-ursa-threat-assessment), including [Snake](https://thehackernews.com/2023/05/us-government-neutralizes-russias-most.html), [ComRAT](https://thehackernews.com/2020/05/gmail-malware-hacker.html), [Carbon](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/), [Crutch](https://thehackernews.com/2020/12/experts-uncover-crutch-russian-malware.html), [Kazuar](https://thehackernews.com/2023/11/turla-updates-kazuar-backdoor-with.html), [HyperStack](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0537/) (aka BigBoss), and [TinyTurla](https://thehackernews.com/2021/09/russian-turla-apt-group-deploying-new.html). It primarily targets government, diplomatic, and military organizations.

The group also has a history of hijacking other threat actors' infrastructure for its own purposes. In October 2019, the U.K. and U.S. governments [revealed](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims) Turla's exploitation of an Iranian threat actor's backdoors to advance their own intelligence requirements.

"Turla accessed and used the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure of Iranian APTs to deploy their own tools to victims of interest," the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) noted at the time. The Windows maker has since identified the Iranian hacking group to be [OilRig](https://thehackernews.com/2024/09/iranian-cyber-group-oilrig-targets.html).

Then in January 2023, Google-owned Mandiant [noted](https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/russian-turla-hackers-hijack-decade-old.html) that Turla had piggybacked on attack infrastructure used by a commodity malware called [ANDROMEDA](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cluster-andromeda-gamrue-c2) to deliver its own reconnaissance and backdoor tools to targets in Ukraine.

The third instance of Turla repurposing a different attacker's tool was [documented](https://thehackernews.com/2023/04/russian-hackers-tomiris-targeting.html) by Kaspersky in April 2023, when the Tomiris backdoor – attributed to a Kaz...
