The countdown is on to Ignite ’22, December 12-15, in Las Vegas. And, after more than two years of virtual events, I can’t wait to be back in person at the premier cybersecurity event of the year. I don’t know what is more exciting, hearing our inspiring keynote speakers, meeting and networking with attendees, or watching security teams tackle cyber simulations live on the Cyber Range. With more than 100 breakout sessions, there is always something going on.

For many of our customers, the most valuable part of any conference is the opportunity to get certified. Getting certified demonstrates that you’re committed to cybersecurity and that your work aligns to set standards. It is arguably one of the most important things you can do at Ignite ’22 to further your career.

## Closing the Skills Gap

Globally, there’s an urgent need to close the cybersecurity skills gap. There are [hundreds of thousands](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/trends/solving-cybersecurity-skills-gap/) of cybersecurity job openings in the US and [millions worldwide](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Cybersecurity-skills-gap-Why-it-exists-and-how-to-address-it#:~:text=How%20big%20is%20the%20gap,people%2C%20according%20to%20Cybersecurity%20Ventures.). At Palo Alto Networks, our mission is to make each day safer than the one before. With certification, you can focus on expanding your skill set to help your organization better defend against mounting cyberthreats while taking your career to the next level.
