Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor was unresponsive and did not answer to our communication attempts.
Therefore, a patch is not available for these security issues. End users of
this product should contact the vendor and demand a patch.

SEC Consult highly recommends performing a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unencrypted and Unauthenticated Communication (CVE-2025-10540)
The traffic between the EAM client agent and the EAM server, as well as between
the EAM monitor management software and the server is transmitted in plain
text. This means that neither the confidentiality nor the integrity of the
transmitted data is protected from an attacker with access to network traffic.

As the software captures and transmits highly sensitive data such as keylogger
history (which may include personally identifiable information, passwords, and
other sensitive data) this poses a considerable business risk. Furthermore,
an attacker can modify the command and control traffic to issue arbitrary
commands to agents, including commands to run arbitrary applications on the
agent machine.

2) Local Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-10541)
An attacker can exploit a built-in update mechanism of the agent component
eamusbsrv64.exe to elevate privileges on the local system to
NT Authority\SYSTEM.

3) Insecure Default Credentials (CVE-2025-10542)
After installing the EAM server, access to the monitor management software is
protected using the insecure default credentials with username 'admin' and a
very weak three-digit password. These default credentials are also listed in
the EAM monitor management software connection dialog for convenience. An
attacker can use these default credentials to connect to the server and
perform arbitrary actions on all agents in case the administrator does not
change the password.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unencrypted and Unauthenticated Communication (CVE-2025-10540)
The communication between the EAM client agent and the EAM server can be
observed using common package capturing tools such as Wireshark. The following
screenshot shows that the observed traffic is unencrypted and contains
sensitive data, such as passwords captured using the keylogger functionality:
<1_1_plaintext_agent_traffic.png>

The communication between the EAM monitor management software and the server is
also unencrypted. Sensitive data such as the EAM monitor password and all data
captured from the agents (which may include personally identifiable
information, passwords, and other sensitive data) can be found in the plain
text traffic, as the following screenshot shows:
<1_2_plaintext_monitor_traffic.png>

2) Local Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-10541)
The EAM agent installs a system service the runs the agent component
eamusbsrv64.exe as NT Authority\SYSTEM. This executable contains an update
mechanism to update the agent from files stored in path 'C:\sysupdate'. As any
user can create this directory and write to it, this mechanism can be abused by
a local attacker for privilege escalation.

When eamusbsrv64.exe is started, which happens automatically at system startup,
it tests if the file 'C:\sysupdate\finish.txt' exists. If that file exists, all
other files in that directory are moved to the EAM installation directory at
'C:\Windows\System\sys\syscon'. It is possible for an attacker to leverage this
for arbitrary code exection by writing a DLL file with malicous code that will
be loaded by eamusbsrv64.exe, for example wtsapi32.dll. The following
proof-of-concept C code was used to create the DLL:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ PoC removed ]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code can be compiled to a DLL using the following command:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc malicious-dll.c -shared -o wtsapi32.dll

To prepare the exploit, the malicious wtsapi32.dll needs to be copied to
'C:\sysupdate\wtsapi32.dll'. Furthermore, the empty file
'C:\sysupdate\finish.txt' needs to be created. The following screenshot shows
the prepared exploit state:
<2_1_sysupdate_contents.png>

To run the exploit, the eamusbsrv64.exe service must be restarted, which can be
accomplished by restarting the computer. After the restart, the 'C:\sysupdate'
directory is empty again, and the exploit has succeeded. The proof-of-concept
file 'C:\sec-consult-poc.txt' is now present and demonstrates that the exploit
runs with NT Authority\SYSTEM privileges, as the following screenshot shows:
<2_2_proof_of_concept_result.png>

3) Insecure Default Credentials (CVE-2025-10542)
After installing the EAM server, access to the monitor management software is
protected using the insecure default credentials with username 'admin' and
password '000'. These default credentials are also listed in the EAM monitor
management software connection dialog for convenience, as the screenshot below
shows. An attacker can use these default credentials to connect to the server
and perform arbitrary actions on all agents in case the administrator does not
change the password.
