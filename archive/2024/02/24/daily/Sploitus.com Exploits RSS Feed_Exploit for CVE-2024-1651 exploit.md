# CVE-2024-1651
This CVE was discovered by Carlos Bello from the Fluid Attack Offensive Team. The finding discusses Insecure Object Deserialization to obtain RCE (Remote Code Execution). Here, I have created a faster and easier-to-use PoC (Proof of Concept). Therefore, if anyone wants to reproduce the finding, they can use this as a reference example.
