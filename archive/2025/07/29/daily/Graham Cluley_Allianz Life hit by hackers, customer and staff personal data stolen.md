US insurance firm Allianz Life has [told the media](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/26/allianz-life-says-majority-of-customers-personal-data-stolen-in-cyberattack/ "Link to Techcrunch article") that hackers stole personal info of the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of its customers and staff earlier this month.

The company says that a hacker gained access to an unnamed third-party cloud-based CRM used by Allianz Life, using a social engineering attack.

The firm hasn‚Äôt said if it has received a ransom demand, and it hasn‚Äôt shared any details on who the hackers might have been.

However, we‚Äôve seen other insurance firms targeted recently, including [Aflac](https://grahamcluley.com/aflac-one-of-the-usas-largest-insurers-is-the-latest-to-fall-under-siege-to-hackers/).

What‚Äôs the betting that this is hackers once again using the Scattered Spider playbook ‚Äì calling up support teams posing as customers or employees, pretending to be locked out of their accounts, and tricking support staff into granting them access.

Maybe with a slice of phishing, SIM swapping, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) bombing too‚Ä¶
