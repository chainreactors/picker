# Fake reviewers face big fines

Posted: July 4, 2023
 by [Christopher Boyd](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/cboyd)

The FTC is cracking down on [fake reviews](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/30/fake-reviews-online-ftc/). Under the new proposed rules, organisations involved in the buying, selling, and manipulation of reviews could be very much out of pocket. Every time a consumer sees a fake review, it will carry a fine of “up to $50,000” per viewing.

From the [FTC release](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/federal-trade-commission-announces-proposed-rule-banning-fake-reviews-testimonials):

> Our proposed rule on fake reviews shows that we’re using all available means to attack deceptive advertising in the digital age,” said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The rule would trigger civil penalties for violators and should help level the playing field for honest companies.”

Fake reviews are a huge aggravation online. Quite often they’re not “just” a bogus review that doesn’t really matter. They trick you into buying substandard products. Bogus offers and deals float to the top of a site’s visibility if they have enough positive entries. People are so enamoured of the best scores imaginable that [threats can follow on](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airbnb-guest-threat-review-host-b2104933.html) even when a great (and entirely real) review has been left.

Can you be certain that those eBay reviews are genuine? What about that Etsy seller? Is the unusual but one of a kind item on Amazon being floated to the top of the pile with dozens of fake reviews?

These FTC rules aim to help you find out. The range of topics covered are very comprehensive and cover all the bogus review angles you can think of:

* **Selling or obtaining fake consumer reviews and testimonials**: The proposed rule would prohibit businesses from writing or selling consumer reviews or testimonials by someone who does not exist, who did not have experience with the product or service, or who misrepresented their experiences. It also would prohibit businesses from procuring such reviews or disseminating such testimonials if the businesses knew or should have known that they were fake or false.
* **Review hijacking**: Businesses would be prohibited from using or repurposing a consumer review written for one product so that it appears to have been written for a substantially different product. The FTC recently brought its first review hijacking enforcement action.
* **Buying positive or negative reviews**: Businesses would be prohibited from providing compensation or other incentives conditioned on the writing of consumer reviews expressing a particular sentiment, either positive or negative.
* **Insider reviews and consumer testimonials**: The proposed rule would prohibit a company’s officers and managers from writing reviews or testimonials of its products or services, without clearly disclosing their relationships. It also would prohibit businesses from disseminating testimonials by insiders without clear disclosures of their relationships, and it would prohibit certain solicitations by officers or managers of reviews from company employees or their relatives, depending on whether the businesses knew or should have known of these relationships.
* **Company controlled review websites**: Businesses would be prohibited from creating...
