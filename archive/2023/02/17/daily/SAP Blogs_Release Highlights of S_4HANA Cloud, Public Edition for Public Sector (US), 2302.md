With February underway, it marks the availability of the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition 2302 update release. Our SAP product team has been delivering new modern experiences, and enhancements in core enterprise resource planning (ERP), to enhance **Public Sector** efficiency and productivity.

Over the last quarter, we have been working on a range of enhancements and innovations through out the solution and, specifically, in the core areas of Grants and Budget Management.![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2023/02/2023-02-09_15-27-40-1.png)*Figure: My Homepage for a Grant & Budget Administrator.*

## **Optimize your Grants & Budget Management capabilities with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition**

The S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition, **for the US Public Sector** offers comprehensive ready to run functionality for **Budget Management, Grants Management and Fund Accounting** for U.S. public sector entities that include state and local governments, cities, counties, K-12 schools**,** and higher education.

The **Budget Management** solution supports the complete budget execution and control lifecycle. In this fully integrated solution, all budget-relevant financial and commitment postings will automatically check for available budgets and communicate relevant statuses.

The S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition for Public Sector also offers **Grants Management** functionality to enable Public Sector organizations (receiving the grants) to manage external financing within the scope of the related sponsored programs.  Automated functionality for cost sharing, indirect cost calculation, and billing is available out of the box.

The Grants Management solution makes controlling and distributing sponsored funds from grantors (e.g. funded/sponsored research) and the usage of sponsored funds (planning, budgeting, and invoicing) by recipients of sponsored funds more transparent. By recording external financing sources you can stay compliant with the sponsor rules and report accordingly. ​​

**Fund Accounting** is the act of recording, summarizing, reporting, analyzing, and interpreting the financial transactions of governments or non-profit organizations by using fiscal and accounting entities, such as a fund with a self-balancing set of accounts.  S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition for Public Sector provides functionalities that are unique to state, local governments and non-profit organizations, such as accounting principles for modified and full accrual accounting, accounting for pool funds, such as the treasurer's and payroll agency fund, and the ability to record and distribute interests from the pool to participating funds.

Before sharing the enhancements for Budget & Grants Management let me start off by providing you an update on some generic new UX and Extensibility improvements with the 2302 release:

## **Microsoft Teams Integration & Collaboration**

Streamline your institution’s performance with Collaborative ERP: make more informed decisions by combining information from the SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition ERP system (e.g. research project information, research purchase orders, etc) along with expertise from the right department and staff within your institution who are connected with Microsoft Teams.

Utilize the new ‘Share to Microsoft Teams’ feature in the Share menu for seamless collaboration in Microsoft Teams. Share links directly to ERP content, including context and reasoning, for efficient and informed decision-making.

## **Improved UX for My Home**

Enhance your daily tasks with the improved My Home Screen. The 2302 release introduced new and additional card types for the My Home screen, providing a centralized hub for information, tasks, and apps. Streamline and optimize your daily activities and work more effectively and efficiently with this powerful feature.
