# Unauthorized access to iCloud: analyzing an iOS vulnerability that could expose sensitive data to attackers

[Jamf Threat Labs](https://www.jamf.com/threat-labs/) has discovered a bypass vulnerability in the Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) subsystem in iOS that fails to notify users when another application tries to access sensitive information such as photos, GPS location, contacts and more. Read on to learn more about our findings.

Recently, [Jamf Threat Labs](https://www.jamf.com/threat-labs/) discovered a TCC bypass vulnerability affecting FileProvider in both macOS and iOS; if successfully exploited, the vulnerability could result in an app that is able to access sensitive data without the end user’s knowledge. We reported our findings to Apple, and in macOS 15 and iOS 18, Apple patched the vulnerability, assigning it [CVE-2024-44131](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-44131).

> [**File Provider**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider/)
>
> ​​An extension other apps use to access files and folders managed by your app and synced with remote storage.

Just like macOS, iOS implements the TCC mechanism to notify users when an application tries to access sensitive information such as photos, GPS location, contacts and more. Users are provided with an option to either grant or deny access to specific data on a per-application basis. When a vulnerability in the TCC mechanism allows a third-party application to access this data without regard for the user-specified policy, it is known as a TCC bypass.

In this blog, we will delve into the details of the iOS TCC bypass vulnerability (**CVE-2024-44131**) that allows a malicious application to copy extensive user data from iCloud. Alarmingly, this exploitation occurs without leaving any trace of the data accessed, posing a threat to user privacy and overall data security.

## What is the TCC bypass vulnerability?

Across Apple’s ecosystem of operating systems, Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC) serves as a crucial security framework, prompting users to grant or de...
