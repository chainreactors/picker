| The relationship between various TDSs and DNS associated with Vigorish Viper and the final landing experience for the user |

A Chinese organized crime syndicate with links to money laundering and human trafficking across Southeast Asia has been using an advanced "technology suite" that runs the whole cybercrime supply chain spectrum to spearhead its operations.

Infoblox is [tracking](https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/gambling-is-no-game%3A-dns-links-between-chinese-organized-crime-and-sports-sponsorships/) the proprietor and maintainer under the moniker **Vigorish** **Viper**, noting that it's likely synonymous with the Yabo Group (aka Yabo Sports), which has been linked to illegal gambling operations and [pig butchering scams](https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/crypto-analysts-expose-huione.html) in the past. In late 2022, it rebranded as Kaiyun Sports and has since been absorbed into another newly formed entity called Ponymuah.

The suite, marketed in China as "baowang" ("包网," meaning full package) encompasses several components such as Domain Name System (DNS) configurations, website hosting, payment mechanisms, advertising, and mobile apps. It also hosts thousands of domain names and numerous brands in an infrastructure that's tied to Hong Kong and China.

The enterprise hinges on securing European football club sponsorships using front companies or white label brands, and using them as a "force multiplier" to advertise illegal gambling sites in the region with the goal of attracting more bettors. In July 2023, it was [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/17/more-betting-firm-logos-in-televised-football-games-than-thought-study-finds-premier-league) that betting company logos appeared as often as 3,500 times during the course of a televised football match.

Yabo, Ponymuah, and other related offshoots like OB (aka OBGM), DB Gaming, Panda Sports, KM Gaming, and Smart King Games (SKG) are all part of Vigorish Viper's sprawling network, highlighting the tangled and murky ownership of the gambling companies and the painstaking steps undertaken to sidestep scrutiny.

It's not just English football clubs that have engaged in these sponsorships, as the investigation has unearthed that cricket and kabaddi teams in India have also entered into similar sponsorship agreements to advertise Vigorish Viper brands.

"Vigorish Viper operates a vast network of over 170,000 active domain names, evading detection and law enforcement through its sophisticated use of DNS CNAME traffic distribution systems," Infoblox researchers Maël Le Touz, Jacques Portal, Renée Burton, and Elena Puga in an exhaustive report shared with The Hacker News.

"In addition to gambling, Vigorish Viper's CNAME [traffic distribution systems] serve illegal streaming and pornography sites. Some of the domains used for streaming are long-registered domains that Vigorish Viper picked up after the original registration expired."

Burton, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, described the threat actor as "one of the most sophisticated and important threats to digital security" discovered to date.

| An overview of Vigorish Viper's sports sponsorship scheme |

"Vigorish Viper created a complex infrastructure with multiple layers of traffic distribution systems (TDSs) using DNS CNAME records and JavaScript, which makes it incredibly difficult to detect," Burton said in a statement. "These systems are complemented by their own encrypted communications and custom-developed applications, making their activities not only elusive but also remarkably resilient."

At the heart of the stealthy undertaking is the use of [DNS CNAME records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) to redirect traffic from one domain through another, a technique previously adopted by other DNS threat actors like [Savvy Seahorse](https://thehackernews.com/2024/03/cybercriminals-using-novel-dns.html). Furthermore, the system has the capability to differentiate between residential, mobile, and commercial IP addresses in China.

Earlier this January, the Danish Institute for Sports Studies' Play the Game initiative [uncovered](https://www.playthegame.org/news/a-match-made-in-heaven-the-explosion-of-betting-ads-in-european-football/) [connections](https://www.playthegame.org/news/meet-the-hydras-tracing-the-illegal-gambling-operators-that-sponsor-football/) between dozens of European football clubs and illegal gambling brands that can be traced back to Yabo and target jurisdictions like China where gambling is prohibited and considered an organized crime.

The online crimes also have an offline aspect involving [human trafficking](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221109-inside-the-living-hell-of-cambodia-s-scam-operations) wherein people are lured with the promise of high-paying jobs and are coerced into supporting sports betting schemes and promoting pig butchering scams and oth...
