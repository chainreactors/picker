# Trump 2.0 Brings Cuts to Cyber, Consumer Protections

February 23, 2025

[105 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/trump-2-0-brings-cuts-to-cyber-consumer-protections/#comments)

One month into his second term, President Trump’s actions to shrink the government through mass layoffs, firings and withholding funds allocated by Congress have thrown federal cybersecurity and consumer protection programs into disarray. At the same time, agencies are battling an ongoing effort by the world’s richest man to wrest control over their networks and data.

The Trump administration has fired at least 130 employees at the federal government’s foremost cybersecurity body — the **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency** (CISA). Those dismissals [reportedly](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/trump-guts-cyber-workers-00203087) included CISA staff dedicated to securing U.S. elections, and fighting misinformation and foreign influence operations.

Earlier this week, technologists with Elon Musk’s **Department of Government Efficiency** (DOGE) [arrived at CISA](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/02/doge-employee-edward-coristine-lands-cisa-dhs-email/403126/) and gained access to the agency’s email and networked files. Those DOGE staffers include **Edward “Big Balls” Coristine**, a [19-year-old former denizen of the “Com,”](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/) an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed [cybercriminal social network](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/).

The investigative journalist **Jacob Silverman** [writes](https://www.jacobsilverman.com/p/prominent-doge-staffer-is-grandson) that Coristine is the grandson of **Valery Martynov**, a KGB double agent who spied for the United States. Silverman recounted how Martynov’s wife **Natalya Martynova** moved to the United States with her two children after her husband’s death.

“Her son became a Virginia police officer who sometimes posts comments on blogs about his historically famous father,” Silverman wrote. “Her daughter became a financial professional who married Charles Coristine, the proprietor of LesserEvil, a snack company. Among their children is a 19-year-old young man named Edward Coristine, who currently wields an unknown amount of power and authority over the inner-workings of our federal government.”

Another member of DOGE is **Christopher Stanley**, formerly senior director for security engineering at X and principal security engineer at Musk’s **SpaceX**. Stanley, 33, had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service **LizardStresser**, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.

My [2015 story on that leak](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/) did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname “enKrypt,” and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called **error33[.]net**, as well as **theC0re**, a video game cheating community.

## “A NATIONAL CYBERATTACK”

DOGE has been steadily gaining sensitive network access to federal agencies that hold a staggering amount of personal and financial information on Americans, including the **Social Security Administration** (SSA), the **Department of Homeland Security**, the **Office of Personnel Management** (OPM), and the **Treasury Department**.

Most recently, DOGE has sought broad access to systems at the **Internal Revenue Service** that contain the personal tax information on millions of Americans, including how much individuals earn and owe, property information, and even details related to child custody agreements. The New York Times [reported Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/irs-doge-gavin-kliger.html) that the IRS had reached an agreement whereby a single DOGE employee — 25-year-old **Gavin Kliger** — will be allowed to see only anonymized taxpayer information.

The rapidity with which DOGE has rifled through one federal database after another in the name of unearthing “massive fraud” by government agencies has alarmed many security experts, who warned that DOGE’s actions bypassed essential safeguards and security measures.

“The most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted,” [wrote](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/doge-as-a-national.html) **Bruce Schneier** and **Davi Ottenheimer**, referring to DOGE as a national cyberattack. “It’s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—by removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.”

**Jacob Williams** is a former hacker with the **U.S. National Security Agency** who now works as managing director of the cybersecurity firm **Hunter Labs**. Williams kicked a virtual hornet’s nest last week when he posted on LinkedIn that the network incursions by DOGE were “a bigger threat to U.S. federal government information systems than China.”

Williams said while he doesn’t believe anyone at DOGE would intentionally harm the integrity and availability of these systems, it’s widely reported (and not denied) that DOGE introduced code changes into multiple federal IT systems. These code changes, he maintained, are not following the normal process for vetting and review given to federal government IT systems.

“For those thinking ‘I’m glad they aren’t following the normal federal government IT processes, those are too burdensome’ I get where you’re coming from,” Williams [wrote](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/red-tape-security-controls-jacob-williams-adwqe/?trackingId=l8be8vjAEQRKTRSklk%2BZrA%3D%3D). “But another name for ‘red tape’ are ‘controls.’ If you’re comfortable bypassing controls for the advancement of your agenda, I have questions – mostly about whether you do this in your day job too. Please tag your employer letting them know your position when you comment that controls aren’t important (doubly so if you work in cybersecurity). All satire aside, if you’re comfortable abandoning controls for expediency, I implore you to decide where the line is that you won’t cross in that regard.”

The DOGE website’s “wall of receipts” boasts that Musk and his team have saved the federal government more than $55 billion through staff reductions, lease cancellations and terminated contracts. But a team of reporters at **The New York Times** found the math that could back up those checks is marred with accounting errors, incorrect assumptions, outdated data and other mistakes.

For example, DOGE claimed it saved $8 billion in one contract, when the total amount was actually $8 million, The Times found.

“Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted,” reads [a Times story with six bylines](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-co...
