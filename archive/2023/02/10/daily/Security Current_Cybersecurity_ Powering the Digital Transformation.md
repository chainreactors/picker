# Cybersecurity: Powering the Digital Transformation

Cybersecurity is a growing concern for both business and government, as attacks on systems increase in frequency and severity. The COVID-19 crisis put the shift to digitization in high gear as businesses worked at top speed to allow ‒ and withstand ‒ persistent and increased remote access to their networks and data.

So far, the transformation has been largely successful, with unprecedented levels of business productivity. However, with the pandemic now officially over (kind of), the relentless focus on digital transformation must continue apace if we are to reap the benefits it promises.

Today’s hyper-connected world presents significant cybersecurity challenges. To ensure we are prepared for future threats, we must develop a robust framework that tackles these challenges head-on and provides the flexibility and agility to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. This is especially critical given the extent to which technology has become integrated into our daily lives and the dependence of all industries and sectors on digital infrastructure for their operations.

Over the last two decades or so, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the use of digital technologies in industries like banking and finance, healthcare, telecommunications, and retail. This revolution has profoundly changed the way we live our lives and the way businesses operate ‒ and this has ultimately given rise to the term “digital transformation” (or “digitization”).

At its core, digital transformation refers to the process of converting manual processes into automated ones through the introduction of technology like AI and ML, which enable organizations to become more agile and efficient in their operations. The benefits associated with digital transformation are numerous, including increased operational efficiencies and better customer service.

As businesses look to leverage new technologies to drive future growth and prosperity, cybersecurity has become a key concern ‒ but also a key accelerator ‒ of the ongoing digital evolution. Adopting a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity is critical, as it enables organizations to take a holistic approach to security while ensuring they maximize the value of their digital assets.

This is why Enterprise Risk Management frameworks are increasingly being adopted by companies in their bid to mitigate the risk of a security breach while still achieving their business objectives. A company’s risk management program plays an important role in ensuring that the organization is protected against potential risks such as data breaches, fraud, and reputational damage.

In today’s highly interconnected environment, no single industry or business can operate in isolation or remain secure on its own. Companies across all sectors must therefore take a collaborative approach and work with government and regulatory bodies as well as law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime and safeguard their valuable information and data.

Despite advances in cyber defense mechanisms over the last 20 years, cybercrime remains an ongoing and growing threat to businesses and society. It continues to pose major challenges for businesses across industries worldwide and has become increasingly sophisticated in its operations. With cybercrime cases on the rise every year, it has become one of the most important issues facing governments across the globe.

Data breaches cost organizations billions of dollars in damages each year and puts their security, as well as that of their consumers’ information, at risk. Cybersecurity should be a top priority for every business and organization; neglecting to do so puts both the company’s and its customers’ information at risk of attack and theft. And the cost of these attacks is often far more than the value of the stolen data itself.

According to IBM Security’s Cost of a Data Breach Study, the average cost of a breach for a business in the United States now stands at $4 million ‒ a figure that has increased six-fold since 2013. As businesses become more aware of the threat posed by hackers and other cybercriminals, they are being forced to invest more in security solutions to protect their networks. However, this investment only puts a bandage on the problem, as cyber threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated each day. Organizations need to develop more advanced solutions to combat new threats and defend themselves against advanced persistent threats, malware, ransomware, phishing attacks, social engineering scams, and insider data breaches.

During the pandemic, organizations rushed to modernize very quickly because people weren’t together in offices anymore. Many companies had to evolve very quickly to enable remote access connectivity so that remote users could access their networks outside of the office and still be effective. That put cybersecurity at the forefront of the evolution, which gave us a springboard to where we are today.

Most companies are operating in a mindset of digital workloads and environments. This is the basic foundation of how we think about security for organizations today. It doesn’t matter if it’s a cloud application that needs to be secured – either from an infrastructure perspective or a software perspective – or a hybrid environment. We put the same rigor around securing those workloads regardless of where they are implemented within an organization.

The level of protection we apply is the same regardless of how the workload is being run, whether it’s on-premises or in a cloud environment. There’s a paradigm shift now that we have the technology to accelerate our digital transformations because of the exposure to new exploits and new vulnerabilities that we’re finding.

The biggest challenge for most organizations today is changing how you approach security: how you view security from the IT operations team’s perspective and how you can apply those processes and technologies throughout the entire organization to help fight the threat of cyberattacks today.

Cybersecurity will continue to be a ke...
