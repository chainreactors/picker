# ‘Fix It’ social-engineering scheme impersonates several brands

Posted: December 19, 2024
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

More and more, threat actors are leveraging the browser to deliver [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) in ways that can evade detection from [antivirus](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/antivirus) programs. Social engineering is a core part of these schemes and the tricks we see are sometimes very clever.

Case in point, there has been an increase in attacks that involve copying a malicious command into the clipboard, only to be later pasted and executed by the victims themselves. Who would have though that copy/paste could be so dangerous?

The new campaign we observed uses a a combination of malicious ads and decoy pages for software brands, followed by a fake Cloudflare notification that instructs users to manually run a few key combinations. Unbeknownst to them, they are actually executing PowerShell code that retrieves and installs malware.

## The discovery

Our investigation into this campaign started from a suspicious ad for ‘notepad’ while performing a Google search. Such search queries have been a hot spot for criminals who want to lure victims that are looking to download programs onto their computer.

[![](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/image_d32618.png)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/image_d32618.png)

Based on previous evidence, criminals are tricking victims into visiting a lookalike site with the goal of downloading malware. In this case, the first part was true, but what unfolded next was new to us.

When we clicked the Download button, we were redirected to a new page that appeared to be Cloudflare asking us to “*verify you are human by completing the action below*“. This type of message is more and more common, as site owners try to prevent bots and other unwanted traffic.

But rather than having to solve a CAPTCHA, we saw another unexpected message: *“Your browser does not support correct offline display of this document. Please follow the instructions below using the “Fix it” button*“.

## Powerful technique

This technique is actually not new in itself, and similar variants have been seen both via email [spam](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spam) and compromised websites before. It is sometimes referred to as [ClearFake](https://rmceoin.github.io/malware-analysis/2024/05/07/clearfake2.html) or [ClickFix](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-clickfix-social-engineering-technique-floods-threat-landscape), and requires users to perform a manual action to execute a malicious PowerShell command.

Clicking on the ‘Fix It’ button copies that command into memory (the machine’s clipboard). Of course the user has no idea what it is, and may follow the instructions that ask to press the Windows and ‘R’ key to open the Run command dialog. CTRL+V pastes that command and Enter executes it.

Once the code runs, it will download a file from a remote domain (*topsportracing[.]com*) within the script. We test...
