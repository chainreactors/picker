After a good year of sustained exuberance, the hangover is finally here. It's a gentle one (for now), as the market corrects the share price of the major players (like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google), while other players reassess the market and adjust priorities. [Gartner calls it the trough of disillusionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle), when interest wanes and implementations fail to deliver the promised breakthroughs. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.

Let's be clear, this was always going to be the case: the post-human revolution promised by the AI cheerleaders was never a realistic goal, and the incredible excitement triggered by the early LLMs was not based on market success.

## AI is here to stay

What's next for AI then? Well, if it follows the Gartner hype cycle, the deep crash is followed by the slope of enlightenment where the maturing technology regains its footing, benefits crystallize, and vendors bring second and third-generation products to market. And if all goes well, it's followed by the hallowed plateau of productivity, where mainstream adoption takes off driven by the technology's broad market appeal. Gartner insists that there are a couple of big ifs: not every technology is destined to recover after the crash and what's important is that the product finds its market fit fast enough.

Right now, it looks almost certain that AI is here to stay. Apple and Google are bringing consumer products to market that repackage the technology into smaller, digestible, easy-to-use chunks (photo editing, text editing, advanced search). While the quality is still very uneven, it looks as if at least some players have found a way to productize generative AI in a way that's meaningful – both for consumers and their own bottom line.

## What did the LLM ever do for us?

OK, where does this leave enterprise customers – and cybersecurity applications in particular? The fact is that generative AI still has significant drawbacks that hinder its adoption at scale. One of these is the fundamentally non-deterministic nature of generative AI. Since the technology itself is based on probabilistic models (a feature, not a bug!), there will be a variance in output. This might scare some industry veterans who are expecting old-school software behaviors. It also means that generative AI will not be a drop-in replacement for existing tools – it's rather an enhancement and augmentation for existing tools. Still, it has the potential to perform as one layer of a multi-layered defense, one that's difficult to predict for attackers as well.

The other drawback causing adoption friction is cost. The models are [very costly to train](https://fortune.com/2024/04/18/google-gemini-cost-191-million-to-train-stanford-university-report-estimates/) and this high cost is currently being passed on to the consumers of the models. Consequently, there is a lot of focus on bringing down the per-query cost. Hardware advancements, coupled with breakthrough results in refining the models promise significant decreases in energy use of running AI models, and there's a reasonable expectation that (at least text-based output) will turn into a profitable business.

Cheaper and more accurate models are great but there is also a growing realization that the task of integrating these models into organizational workflows will be a significant challenge. As a society, we don't yet have the experience to know how to efficiently integrate AI technologies into day-to-day work practices. There is also the question of how the existing human workforce will accept and work with the new technologies. For example, we have seen cases where human workers and customers prefer to interact with a model that favors explainability over accuracy. A [March 2024 study](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/does-ai-help-or-hurt-human-radiologists-performance-depends-doctor) by the Harvard Medical School found that the effect of AI assistance was inconsistent and varied across a test sample of radiologists, with the performance of some radiologists improving with AI and worsening in others. The recommendation is that while AI tools should be introduced to clinical practice a nuanced, personalized, and carefully calibrated approach must be taken to ensure optimal results for patients.

What about the market fit we mentioned earlier? While generative AI will (probably) never replace a programmer (no matter what some companies claim), AI-assisted code generation has become a useful prototyping tool for a variety of scenarios. This is already useful to cybersecurity specialists: generated code or configuration is a reasonable starting point to build out something quickly before refining it.

The huge caveat: the existing technology has the chance to speed up the work of a seasoned professional, who can quickly debug and fix the generated text (code or configuration). But it can be potentially disastrous for a user who is not a veteran of the field: there's always a chance that unsafe configuration or insecure code is generated, that, if it makes its way to production, would lower the cybersecurity stance of the organization. So, like any other tool, it can be useful if you know what you're doing, and can lead to negative outcomes if not.

Here we need to warn about one special characteristic of the current generation o...
