The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) pledge period is underway and runs through **January 15, 2024**! If you're a U.S. federal employee or retiree, be sure to show your support for EFF by using our CFC ID **10437**.

Not sure how to make a pledge? No problem--it’s easy! First, head over to [GiveCFC.org](https://givecfc.org) and click “DONATE.” Then you can search for EFF using our CFC ID **10437** and make a pledge via payroll deduction, credit/debit, or an e-check. If you have a renewing pledge, you can also increase your support there as well!

The CFC is the world’s largest and most successful annual charity campaign for U.S. federal employees and retirees. Last year, members of the CFC community raised nearly $34,000 to support EFF’s work advocating for privacy and free expression online. That support has helped us:

* Push the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to find that geofence warrants are “categorically” unconstitutional.
* Launch Digital Rights Bytes, a resource dedicated to teaching people how to take control of the technology they use every day.
* Call out unconstitutional age-verification and censorship laws across the U.S.
* Continue to develop and maintain our privacy-enhancing tools, like Certbot and Privacy Badger.

Federal employees and retirees greatly impact our democracy and the future of civil liberties and human rights online. Support EFF’s work by using our CFC ID **10437** [when you make a pledge today](https://givecfc.org)!
