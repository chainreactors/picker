# IPTV Piracy Lawsuit Targets ‘Boss IPTV Cartel’, CDN, Hosts, Set-Top Box Supplier

A five-year-old investigation by US-based streaming service YuppTV features in a copyright complaint filed at a federal court in Pennsylvania. Alleging systematic piracy of YuppTV content, the complaint claims to identify the owner of various IPTV services and companies, collectively the 'Boss IPTV Cartel'. Allegations against CDN company Datacamp, set-top box manufacturer Infomir, and other intermediaries, add extra layers to an already complicated case.

Incorporated in Georgia, YuppTV USA Inc. markets itself as one of the world’s largest internet-based TV and on-demand platforms for South Asian content. Most of the company’s subscribers are described as “non-resident individuals.”

Filed at a federal court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, YuppTV’s copyright complaint begins by naming Canada-based Harpreet Singh Randhawa as the operator of one or more IPTV services, sold under multiple brand names. Those services allegedly infringed YuppTV’s rights in the United States and beyond.

Specifically, YuppTV claims that content for which it holds (or held) United States and Canadian licenses, has for years been illegally broadcast into homes in both countries by Randhawa’s platforms.

The complaint bundles the services together under the heading ‘Boss IPTV Platforms’ with the wider operation labeled the ‘Boss IPTV Cartel’.

The complaint says the services use common ‘pirate tactics’ including rebranding, renaming, closures and expansion “to evade detection and legal enforcement.” None of the nine domains appear functional at the time of writing.

## An Expensive and Lengthy Investigation

YuppTV says that its expensive investigation of Randhawa and his “illicit business activities” pre-dates 2020.

“Throughout the course of this investigation, YuppTV observed Mr. Randhawa wielding his vast enterprise to infringe repeatedly upon YuppTV’s licensed rights,” the plaintiff writes.

In March 2021, YuppTV filed a complaint with police cyber-crime investigators in Faridabad, India. The company informed police that Randhawa used a company called Rhysley Pvt. Ltd to perpetuate infringement of YuppTV’s content, leading to a [headline-making](https://www.medianews4u.com/major-piracy-racket-boss-iptv-exposed-numerous-arrested-for-illegally-streaming-indian-premium-content-across-the-globe/) police raid.

Six people were arrested including Sumit Sharma, an alleged director of Rhysley Pvt, and Harminder Sandhu, an alleged key employee of Calgary, Canada-based company, Server Center Ltd. Allegedly owned and operated by Randhawa, Server Center is described as an “integral part” and the “ostensible parent company” of “Randhawa’s criminal enterprise.”

What became of the raids four years ago is unclear, but Randhawa’s name wasn’t among those mentioned when the six individuals were arrested back in 2021. YuppTV’s lawsuit positions Randhawa as the lead defendant along with Rhysley Pvt. Ltd, Server Center Ltd, and 2144644 Alberta Ltd, a company linked to Server Center due to Randhawa sitting on the boards of both.

## Datacamp (CDN77) Named as Defendant

News reports covering the 2021 raids had already linked Datacamp to Randhawa’s piracy operation. The company was described as a vendor but beyond that, evidence of infringement, if indeed any existed at all, was not made public.

Four years later, Datacamp and several other companies reportedly used by Randhawa’s IPTV services, appear as defendants in YuppTV’s complaint.

Under the heading *“Datacamp Knowingly Provides Boss IPTV Platforms with the Means to Continue Pirating”* the complaint provides a detailed overview of Datacamp’s services, highlighting the “high efficiency and peak performance” provided by Datacamp’s geographically distributed network of datacenters.

“Boss IPTV Platforms, as unauthorized IPTV streaming services, depend on third-party CDNs to deliver Pirated Content to their subscribers. Boss IPTV Platforms could not operate without these CDNs,” the complaint reads.

The details span several pages, with numerous features available to any Datacamp customer framed as mechanisms through which the Boss Platforms were able to infringe the plaintiff’s rights more efficiently, with optimizations that “materially increase the quality” of the pirate streaming product.

## Failure to Terminate Repeat Infringers

Many years of so-called ‘repeat infringer’ lawsuits in US courts means the general parameters are broadly understood. When copyright holders repeatedly send DMCA takedown notices for infringing content, but that content isn’t removed and action isn’t taken against repeat infringers, webhosts and ISPs face potential lawsuits that attempt to hold them liable.

YuppTV’s complaint follows broadly the same framework. After highlighting CDN features that prevent or inhibit the ability to send DMCA notices directly to Boss IPTV’s ‘origin’ servers, YuppTV says that correspondence sent to Datacamp starting in 2020 nevertheless requested the removal of infringing content.

“Although DataCamp undertook some steps to address YuppTV’s complaints regarding the Pirated Content, it has failed to enact measures sufficient to curtail Boss IPTV’s infringement,” the complaint explains.

“As a result of DataCamp’s refusal to take appropriate measures to stop copyright infringement, Boss IPTV Platforms continue unhindered as DataCamp customers. Boss IPTV Platforms continue to purchase increasing amounts of bandwidth from DataCamp.”

## DMCA Notices Allegedly Ignored

Copies of the DMCA notices sent to Datacamp appear alongside the complaint, with a suggestion they represent the full set. A representative sample notice is shown here, and the remainder are linked below. Assuming these are indeed the originals, and haven’t been altered for any reason, issues are immediately apparent.

The presence of the letter ‘X’ multiple times in every URL may be a sign that complete URLs weren’t known to YuppTV. That wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if the infringing content could be identified by different means, but whether this alternative format was considered sufficient by the recipients isn’t made clear.

If the infringing content couldn’t be identified, that might raise questions of whether the notices were valid. In the complaint, YuppTV insists that it sent “proper notices” under the DMCA.

The URLs listed in the notices concern channels which presumably delivered a succession of copyrighted works (TV shows) for which YuppTV held or holds appropriate licenses. T...
