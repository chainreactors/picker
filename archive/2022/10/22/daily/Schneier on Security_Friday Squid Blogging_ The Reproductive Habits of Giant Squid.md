## Friday Squid Blogging: The Reproductive Habits of Giant Squid

[Interesting](https://featured.japan-forward.com/japan2earth/2022/10/1179/):

> A recent study on giant squid that have washed ashore along the Sea of Japan coast has raised the possibility that the animal has a different reproductive method than many other types of squid.
>
> Almost all squid and octopus species are polygamous, with multiple males passing sperm to a single female. Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.
>
> However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently.
>
> They examined 66 sperm “bags” attached to five different locations on the body of a female that washed ashore in Ine Town of Kyoto Prefecture in 2020, and found that all of them were from the same male.
>
> It is rare for a female with sperm attached to be found, and further verification is needed, but the study’s results indicate that giant squid, unlike other squids, may be “monogamous.” That is, females may receive sperm from only one certain male. Hirohashi and his colleagues published their findings in an international scientific journal in July of 2021.

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

This from Quanta magazine on privacy on the internet. Its somewhat beyond me but I thought some might be interested.

@lurker

Yes. I just skimmed the rest of the article after I saw that.

I was just wondering about whether the privacy protocol would actually work. I know protocols can leak data in very subtle ways and I am nowhere near expert enough to tell if that is going to happen.

@ JPA

Without digging very deep into Nym, I will just say that I do not think they have addressed the traffic analysis issue far enough. If you have to buy into the network, at some point, your fiat money transfer will be visible.

So, basically, you will stand out from the crowd, draw attention to yourself, and potentially become a subject of investigation without realizing it.

Same problem as using VPN or TOR.

@SpaceLifeForm

Thanks for pointing that out.

Fines for massive data breaches to increase to at least $50 million after Optus and Medibank hacks

The financial penalty imposed on companies that suffer serious or repeated privacy breaches will be increased to at least $50 million. Read the full story

The observational hypothesis that allow for giant squid to form more complex mating practices, i.e. monogamy, suggests to me that this species of squid may habit the same bars as do the genus octopi. It is understood recently that the octopus family consists of members provisioning high order control using distributed neuron-based components for sight, muscle, and endocrine modulation effecting textural surfaces. Instead of one centralized neural-net, six different physical structures are tied together and operator in a unitary fashion. Parallel processing in the animal kingdom, if you will. Consideration is also giving for a bifurcation in evolutionary biology near about the Paleozoic era, especially concerning cognitive optimizations.

@ JPA, lurker, SpaceLifeForm, ALL,

Re : Abonynous Networking

> “I was just wondering about whether the privacy protocol would actually work. I know protocols can leak data in very subtle ways and I am nowhere near expert enough to tell if that is going to happen.”

The article does not tell me much more than I’d found out a while ago and lost interest in (it had the hallmarks of a proof of work replacment scam).

However in the article it is noted that the best place to be anonymous is,

“In a crowd”

Which is correct but mixnets of which Nym is one provably do not give a crowd in the way they are currently implemented.

I’ve actually discussed these issues on this blog years ago and pointed out Tor was a bad design. I drew a lof of “fanboi ire” back then and like as not will do so again if I go through it again…

I guess I’ll have to read the Nym paper as earlier stuff I read was too vague, but in the past I was left with the feeling it was just another “proof of work” replacment (see Helium Mining for one existing example). So I’d long ago dropped Nym off my reading list.

@ &ers, Clive, ALL

Good story even though it almost 2 decades old. I’m surprised you found it because the original is 404. Ma...
