## Emerging Threat Trends for 2025 Threat Brief: What CTI Teams Need to Know

**Executive Summary:**

The year 2025 is poised to redefine the cybersecurity landscape, marked by a rapid evolution in both the sophistication of adversarial tactics and the complexity of the tools they wield. As organizations become increasingly reliant on interconnected systems, digital transformation initiatives, and globalized supply chains, they face an expanding attack surface that sophisticated threat actors are quick to exploit.

This dynamic environment necessitates that Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) teams remain vigilant, not only responding to immediate threats but also anticipating future developments. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and deepfake capabilities are shifting the paradigm, enabling attackers to scale their operations with unprecedented precision and speed. Moreover, geopolitical tensions are fueling a rise in state-sponsored campaigns, blurring the lines between criminal and nation-state actors as collaboration between these groups grows.

By analyzing trends and incidents from recent years, such as the rise of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, and AI-driven phishing campaigns, we can forecast significant changes in the cyber threat landscape. Predicting and preparing for these developments is critical for staying ahead of adversaries. CTI teams must adapt by integrating advanced technologies like machine learning for predictive analytics, enhancing collaboration with industry peers and government bodies, and fostering a culture of proactive risk management.

This report delves into key emerging trends for 2025, offering insights into areas such as AI-driven threats, evolving ransomware tactics, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the increasing weaponization of misinformation. By understanding these developments, organizations can build resilient defenses, ensuring they are not just reacting to today’s challenges but actively preparing for the threats of tomorrow.

This chart compares cyber threat trends from 2024 to predictions for 2025. Key observations include:

1. **Ransomware Attacks**: A notable increase, reflecting the growing sophistication of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and innovative extortion techniques.
2. **Supply Chain Attacks**: A rise due to attackers leveraging vulnerabilities in third-party vendors and software dependencies.
3. **AI-Driven Phishing**: Continued growth as adversaries employ AI for highly targeted phishing and spear-phishing attacks.
4. **Deepfake Scams**: Increasing use of deepfake technology in fraud, impersonation, and misinformation campaigns.
5. **Critical Infrastructure Attacks**: Heightened activity targeting energy grids, transportation systems, and healthcare.
6. **State-Sponsored Espionage**: Persistent growth, fueled by geopolitical tensions and advanced persistent threats (APTs).
7. **Quantum Computing Risks**: Although still minimal, risks associated with quantum breakthroughs are beginning to emerge.

### **AI-Driven Cyber Threats**

**Current Examples:**

* **AI-Generated Phishing Scams Targeting Executives (2024):** There has been a significant increase in hyper-personalized phishing attacks aimed at corporate executives, facilitated by AI tools. These scams utilize AI to analyze online profiles, crafting fraudulent emails that closely mimic the tone and style of legitimate communications, thereby evading traditional detection methods.
* **AI-Enhanced Cyberattacks Leading to Record Highs (2024):** The year 2024 witnessed a record number of cyberattacks, with economic losses doubling from the previous year, totaling €10 billion. AI has played a pivotal role in increasing the precision and personalization of these attacks, particularly through sophisticated phishing and vishing techniques.

**Future Predictions:**

* **Proliferation of AI-Driven Cybercrime:** The integration of AI into cybercriminal activities is expected to rise, leading to more sophisticated ransomware, phishing attacks, and business email compromise (BEC) schemes. This trend underscores the necessity for advanced AI-driven defenses to counteract these evolving threats.
* **Autonomous AI-Powered Attacks:** The development of AI technologies may enable autonomous cyber campaigns, where AI-driven bots adapt attacks in real-time based on the defenses they encounter, increasing the complexity and effectiveness of cyber threats.

**CTI Implications:**

* **Integration of AI in Defense Mechanisms:** CTI teams should adopt AI and machine learning tools for enhanced pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and predictive threat modeling to effectively counter AI-driven cyber threats.
* **Investment in Adversarial AI Testing:** Conducting adversarial AI testing (red-teaming) is crucial to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious AI, ensuring robust defense mechanisms are in place.

**Geopolitical Cyber Warfare**

**Current Examples:**

* **Escalation of Geopolitical Cyber Tensions (2024):** Geopolitical tensions, particularly involving China, the US, and the EU, have led to an increase in state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting political entities and critical infrastructure. These attacks are often aligned with geopolitical interests, aiming to disrupt, espionage, or influence public opinion.
* **State-Sponsored Cyber Operations (2024):** Nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea have continued to engage in cyber espionage, cybercrime, and disinformation campaigns, intensifying the landscape of geopolitical cyber warfare.

**Future Predictions:**

* **Intensification of Geopolitical Cyber Warfare:** Geopolitical cyber warfare is expected to intensify, with the “Big Four” actors (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea) continuing to align espionage, cybercrime, and disinformation campaigns with their geopolitical interests.
* **Escalation of Hacktivist Alliances:** Cyberattacks driven by ideological or political agendas are predicted to escalate, targeting governments, businesses, and critical infrastructure, further complicating the geopolitical cyber landscape.

**CTI Implications:**

* **Enhanced Geopolitical Threat Analysis:** CTI teams must improve their geopolitical threat analysis capabilities to understand regional motives and potential attack vectors, enabling proactive defense strategies.
* **Collaboration with National Security Agencies:** Working closely with national security agencies is essential to gain insights into geopolitical cyber threats and to coordinate effective responses to state-sponsored cyber activities.

By staying informed about these evolving threats and implementing strategic measures, CTI teams can better anticipate and mitigate the risks posed by AI-driven cyber threats and geopolitical cyber warfare in 2025 and beyond.

### **Geopolitical Cyber Warfare**

**Current Examples:**

* **Salt Typhoon Cyber Espionage Campaign (2024):** In 2024, a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign attributed to China’s Ministry of State Security, known as Salt Typhoon, compromised major U.S. telecommunications providers, including AT&T, Verizon, Lumen Technologies, and T-Mobile. The attackers targeted core network components, enabling extensive surveillance capabilities. This breach is considered one of the most severe telecom hacks in U.S. history.
* **Cyberattacks Following U.S. Presidential Election (2024):** Following the 2024 U.S. ...
