## Rare Interviews with Enigma Cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski

The Polish Embassy has [posted](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=56989) a series of short interview segments with Marian Rejewski, the first person to crack the Enigma.

Details from his [biography](https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=49767).

@ ALL,

Like many cryptographers that come eventually to public attention Marian Rejewski had an interesting life.

Sadly for ‚Äúsecurity reasons‚Äù his skills went to waste during WWII when he arrived in Britain.

As British cryptographer Alan Stripp said in his 2004 book on the three Polish Cryptographers,

‚ÄúSetting them to work on the Doppelkassetten system was like using racehorses to pull wagons.‚Äù

(The Doppelkassetten system was a low grade hand cipher used by the SS and SD and similar to ‚Äúdouble Playfair‚Äù).

Wonderfully, the first 61 pages of his Marian Rejewski‚Äôs biography, *The First Enigma Codebreaker*, are available [online](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_First_Enigma_Codebreaker/S17BEAAAQBAJ?hl=en).

‚ÄúHe began studying insurance mathematics at the University of G√∂ttingen, about which he said: ‚Äò[the Institute of Mathematics was high up. It was like going to Mecca.‚Äù His adventure with cryptology had only just begun.‚Äù

As most of this stuff was classified, there is a lot that has been lost to history. I only recently found out about the Polish team and that there was also a Spanish team.

During the Spanish Civil War, Germany lent Franco some ‚Äúlow grade‚Äù Enigma machines and the Republicans had quite good cryptanalysts. They mainly ended in France and then joined forces with the Polish team.

You can see a picture of Marian Rekewski and both teams in

This is still little known. There are few papers, like

Camaz√≥n (an important mathematician in the Spanish team) worked for the French Government after WWII and died in Spain in 1982. I only heard about him in a documentary:
(It was available from the Spanish public TV network, but you can no longer watch it‚Ä¶)
