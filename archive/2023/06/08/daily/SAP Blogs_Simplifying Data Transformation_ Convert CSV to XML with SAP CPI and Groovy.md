**Introduction**:

In today's digital landscape, data transformation is a crucial aspect of integration workflows. Often, we encounter scenarios where data needs to be converted from one format to another for seamless processing.

Recently, I encountered a situation where I received a CSV file from a third-party vendor and had to process this CSV to update data in our SAP SuccessFactors (SF) system. However, the structure of the CSV file was not constant. The vendor simultaneously made changes to the column names and sequences in the file structure each month. In this scenario, our standard CSV to XML converter, which relies on XSD-based mapping or fixed column sequence mapping, did not work. To address this challenge, I turned to Groovy scripting to convert the CSV into XML. Groovy provides powerful string manipulation capabilities, making it an ideal choice for handling dynamic CSV structures. With Groovy, we can dynamically process the CSV headers, extract data rows, and generate XML tags based on the header names. This flexibility allows us to accommodate changes in the CSV structure without requiring modifications to the mapping logic.

In this blog post, we will explore how to convert CSV (Comma-Separated Values) to XML (extensible Markup Language) using SAP CPI (Cloud Platform Integration) and the power of Groovy scripting. We will walk through the steps and provide a ready-to-use Groovy script to streamline your data conversion tasks.

data conversion tasks.

#### **Understanding CSV and XML Formats:**

CSV and XML are widely used formats for data representation and exchange. CSV is a plain text format where data is organized in rows and columns, with each column value separated by a delimiter, usually a comma. XML, on the other hand, is a structured markup language that represents data using tags and elements, making it more flexible and suitable for complex data structures.

#### **The Need for CSV to XML Conversion:**

Converting data from CSV to XML becomes necessary when integrating systems that expect data in XML format or when processing data using XML-based tools and technologies. SAP CPI offers powerful capabilities for data transformation and manipulation, making it an ideal choice for performing this conversion seamlessly within integration flows.

#### **Using Groovy Script in SAP CPI for CSV to XML Conversion:**

To convert CSV to XML in SAP CPI, we leverage the Groovy scripting language. Groovy is a powerful and flexible scripting language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is well-suited for data manipulation tasks. We will use a Groovy script within an SAP CPI integration flow to parse the CSV data and generate the corresponding XML representation.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

Let's dive into the step-by-step process of converting CSV to XML using the provided Groovy script:

**Step 1**: Set up an SAP CPI Integration Flow: Create an integration flow in SAP CPI that receives the CSV message payload. You can use any suitable integration pattern to trigger the flow based on your requirements.

**Step 2:** Configure the Groovy Script Step: Within the integration flow, add a Groovy script step. Copy the provided Groovy script into the script editor. This script leverages the powerful features of Groovy, such as string manipulation and XML generation, to convert the CSV data to XML.

```
import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message;

import java.util.HashMap;

import groovy.xml.XmlUtil

def Message processData(Message message) {

    //Body

    def body = message.getBody(String);

    def lines = body.trim().split('\n')

    def headers = lines[0].split(',')

    def data = lines[1..-1].collect { it.split(',') }

    def xml = new StringBuilder()

    xml.append('<root>')

    data.each {

        row ->

            xml.append('<record>')

        headers.eachWithIndex {

            header,

            index ->

            xml.append("<${header}>${row[index]}</${header}>")

        }

        xml.append('</record>')

    }

    xml.append('</root>')

    def formattedXml = XmlUtil.serialize(xml.toString())

    message.setBody(formattedXml)

    return message;

}
```

**Step 3:** Customize the Script (if needed): Review the script and customize it according to your CSV format. Ensure that the script correctly identifies the delimiter used in your CSV file. You can also modify the XML structure to match your desired output format.

**Step 4:** Test and Deploy the Integration Flow: Test the integration flow by providing a sample CSV payload and running it in the SAP CPI development environment. Verify that the script converts the CSV data to XML as expected. Once you are satisfied with the results, deploy the integration flow to your productive environment.

**Conclusion:** By leveraging the power of SAP CPI and Groovy scripting, we can easily convert CSV data to XML, simplifying data transformation tasks within integration flows. The provided Groovy script serves as a ready-to-use solution, saving time and effort in develo...
