# Sandfly Security Collaborates with DigitalOcean on Agentless Linux Security for Modern Cloud Environments

16 June 2025

Press Release

*Now available as a Droplet 1-Click in the DigitalOcean Marketplace*

Sandfly today announced a new DigitalOcean Droplet 1-Click solution in the DigitalOcean Marketplace, delivering agentless intrusion detection and incident response to Linux customers. Users can quickly and easily create a Sandfly Security Droplet within their DigitalOcean infrastructure, helping to provide enhanced Linux security without the performance impact of traditional agent-based solutions.

> *“Sandfly is one of the most exciting pieces of security tech I’ve seen recently. We’re excited to not only be a customer but also offer an integrated solution to our customers through the DigitalOcean Marketplace. This technology addresses Linux security in a really novel and compelling way.”*Timothy Lisko, Deputy CISO at DigitalOcean

Craig Rowland, CEO of Sandfly Security, emphasized the significance of bringing their technology to the [DigitalOcean platform](https://sandflysecurity.com/resources/digitalocean-cloud-deployment): "This collaboration brings our agentless Linux security to DigitalOcean customers, addressing the visibility and protection gaps in Linux environments without the stability and performance risks of traditional agents. Linux powers everything from cloud infrastructure to embedded systems, but requires fundamentally different security tactics than Windows-based solutions. With DigitalOcean, we're delivering immediate protection for the entire Linux ecosystem - helping to eliminate compatibility headaches, performance impacts, and deployment complexity."
