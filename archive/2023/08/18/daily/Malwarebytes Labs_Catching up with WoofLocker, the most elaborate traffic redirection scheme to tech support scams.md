# Catching up with WoofLocker, the most elaborate traffic redirection scheme to tech support scams

Posted: August 17, 2023
 by [Jérôme Segura](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/jeromesegura)

Back in January 2020, we blogged about a tech support scam campaign dubbed [WoofLocker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2020/01/woof-locker-stealthy-browser-locker-tech-support-scam) that was by far using the most complex traffic redirection scheme we had ever seen. In fact, the threat actor had started deploying infrastructure in earnest as early as 2017, about 3 years prior to our publication.

Fast forward to 2023, another 3 years have gone by and this campaign is still going as if nothing has happened. The tactics and techniques are very similar, but the infrastructure is now more robust than before to defeat potential takedown attempts. This change may have been in response to the work we did with web hosting companies and registrars, which only put this operation out of business temporarily.

It is just as difficult to reproduce and study the redirection mechanism now as it was then, especially in light of new fingerprinting checks. By connecting previous indicators of compromise we were able to expand our knowledge about the first iteration of WoofLocker and its new setup.

While we still do not know a lot about who is behind this scheme, we believe it may be the work of different threat actors that specialize in their area of expertise. WoofLocker may very well be a professional toolkit built specifically for advanced web traffic filtering and used exclusively by one customer. Victims that fall for the scam and call the phone number are then redirected to call centres presumably in South Asian countries.

This blog post summarizes our latest findings and provides indicators of compromise that may be helpful to the security community.

## Overview

Contrary to other tech support scam campaigns that often rely on [malvertising](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malvertising) as a delivery vector, we only observed WoofLocker being distributed via a limited number of compromised websites. The threat actor appears to have gained access to two categories: non adult traffic and adult traffic. That distinction can be seen in the unique redirection URL created for each victim with a parameter called “nad” and “ad” respectively.

Malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites is used to retrieve the WoofLocker framework directly into the DOM from one of a handful of domain names. The code used by WoofLocker is highly obfuscated and makes use of steganography, a technique that embeds data inside of images.

Each victim that visits the compromised site is fingerprinted to determine if they are legitimate or not. Numerous checks are performed to detect the presence of virtual machines, certain browser extensions and security tools. Only genuine residential [IP addresses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address) are considered, provided they have not already been fingerprinted.
