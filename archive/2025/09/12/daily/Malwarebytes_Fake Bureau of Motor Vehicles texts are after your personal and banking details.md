# Fake Bureau of Motor Vehicles texts are after your personal and banking details

Posted: September 11, 2025

Scammers are sending out texts that claim to be from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV), saying that you have outstanding traffic tickets.

Here’s an example, which was sent to one of our employees.

![text message scam BMV](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/scam_text_red_b92633.png?w=514)
> “Ohio (BMV) Final Notice: Enforcement Begins September 10nd.
>
> Our records indicate that as of today, you still have an outstanding traffic ticket. Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 15C-16.003, if you fail to pay by September 9, 20025, we will take the following actions:
>
> 1. Report to the BMV violation database
>
> 2. Suspend your vehicle registration effective September 9st
>
> 3. Suspend your driving privileges for 30 days
>
> 4. Pay a 35% service fee at toll booths
>
> 5. You may be prosecuted, and your credit score will be affected.
>
> Pay Now:
>
> `link`
>
> Please pay immediately before enforcement begins to avoid license suspension and further legal trouble. (Reply Y and reopen this message, or copy it to your browser.)

The Ohio Department of Public Safety actually [warned](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/OHBMV/bulletins/3e44428) about this scam a few months ago, and the Bowling Green (OH) Police Division [repeated that warning](https://www.facebook.com/bgpdoh/posts/weve-received-several-reports-of-local-residents-receiving-scam-messages-claimin/1190259059794828/) on Facebook this week.

The people in Ohio are not alone. We found similar warnings issued by the [Indiana DMV](https://www.in.gov/bmv/resources/consumer-scam-alerts/#trafficviolation), [Colorado DMV](https://dmv.colorado.gov/fraud-alertsscams), [West-Virginia DMV](https://transportation.wv.gov/DMV/News/Pages/DMV-warns-of-text-message-payment-scam.aspx), [Hawaii County](https://www.vrl.hawaiicounty.gov/other-services/important-bulletins), [Arizona Department of Transportation](https://azdot.gov/news/dont-fall-scam-texts-using-adot-motor-vehicle-division-logo), and the [New Hampshire DMV](https://www.dmv.nh.gov/news-and-media/new-hampshire-dmv-warns-text-message-scam).

If you click the link in the message, you’ll be taken to a website that mimics that of the department in question. The site contains a form to fill out your personal details and payment information, which can then be used for financial fraud or even identity theft.

The scam messages all look the same except for the domains which are rotated very fast, as is habitual in scams. Because they are all from the same campaign, it’s easy to recognize them though.

## Red flags in the scam text:

There are some tell-tale signs in these scams which you can look for to recognize them as such;

1. **Spelling and grammar mistakes**: the scammers seem to have problems with formatting dates. For example “September 10nd”, “9st” (instead of 9th or 1st).
2. **Urgency:** you only have one or two days to pay. Or else…..
3. **The over-the-top threats:** Real agencies won’t say your “credit score will be affected” for an unpaid traffic violation.
4. **Made-up legal codes:** “Ohio Administrative Code 15C-16.003” doesn’t match any real Ohio BMV administrative codes. When a code looks fake, it probably is!
5. **Sketchy payment link:** Real BMVs don’t send urgent “pa...
