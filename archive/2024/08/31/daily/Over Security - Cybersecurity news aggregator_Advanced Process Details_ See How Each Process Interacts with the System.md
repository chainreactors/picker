Advanced Process Details: See How Each Process Interacts with the System

When you investigate suspicious files or potential malware, you need deep visibility into process behavior. [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=advanced_process&utm_term=150824&utm_content=linktolanding)‘s **Advanced Process Details** provides exactly that – in-depth information about how a specific process interacts with the system.

In this article, we’ll take a high-level look at what information you can find in advanced process details. Let’s get started!

## Accessing the Feature

To open advanced process details, find the process you want to investigate in the main [process tree](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/process-tree-analysis/) view. Then, click to select it and look for the **More Info** button.

Clicking this button opens up the advanced details interface:

## Interface Breakdown

Let’s start by breaking down the main interface, beginning with the general information on the right. This section mostly shows the same details as the process tree, but in a more expanded and easier-to-read format.

You can immediately see the malicious score and signatures, along with their descriptions. Unlike the tree view, here you can switch between **Group view**, which filters only the most important events, and **Deep view**, which lists all the process interactions with the system in sequence. Here’s how that looks:

Another feature unique to advanced process details is the **timeline**. You can drag the pointer along it to adjust the displayed events based on the execution timeline.

Now, let’s turn our attention to the menu on the left. The vertical menu is divided into two sections:

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image5-1-1024x585.png)

1. The top section contains tabs with more in-depth information about the process.

2. The bottom section features a list of processes, allowing you to switch between them without having to close out of the detailed view. Super convenient!

## Breaking Down the Different Tabs

We’ll look at **Main Information** sub-menufirst.

### Code Signing

The **Code Signing** tab provides crucial insights into the authenticity of the process. It shows whether the process has a valid digital signature, which is often used to verify the legitimacy of software.

In this tab, you can see the certificate details, including the issuer, status, validity, and in-depth information about the signature.

When using this tab, focus on verifying the legitimacy of the digital signature. A valid signature from a trusted issuer usually indicates that the process is safe. However, be cautious of expired or self-signed certificates, as these can be signs of potentially malicious activity.

### Process Dump

The **Process Dump** tab allows you to download a full memory dump of the selected process. This is a powerful tool for in-depth forensic analysis. Memory dumps can contain vital information, such as encryption keys, passwords, and other sensitive data that the process was handling at the time of the dump.

To download a dump, hower over it and click on the download icon which will appear next to the Size field.

### Script Tracer
