# Footage Shows Kenyan Police Fired at Journalist Covering Protests

Journalist Catherine Wanjeri Kariuki was wearing a bright yellow hoodie underneath her beige-coloured vest emblazoned with the word “PRESS” when three pellets fired by Kenyan police lodged in her left thigh.

Kariuki is a Kenyan broadcast reporter with Kameme TV and Mediamax. She was standing with fellow journalists at the intersection of Pandit Nehru Road and Kenyatta Avenue in downtown Nakuru, a city in western Kenya, when she was shot with a less-lethal weapon at close range.

Less-lethal weapons also known as non-lethal weapons are [often used in crowd control](https://www.amnesty.nl/content/uploads/2023/03/Amnesty-position-paper-kinetic-impact-projectiles.pdf) situations by police but can potentially be lethal depending on how they are used.

Footage and images captured at the scene on July 16 reveals that a police officer shot towards a group of eight unarmed people including several journalists from a moving police vehicle.

The use of force appears to [violate multiple rules](http://kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=CAP.%2084) outlined in Kenya’s National Police Service Act. The Sixth Schedule of the Act outlines that:

1. “A police officer shall always attempt to use non-violent means first and force may only be employed when non-violent means are ineffective…”
2. “The force used shall be proportional to the objective to be achieved, the seriousness of the offence, and the resistance of the person against whom it is used…”
3. “When the use of force results in injuries -the police officers present shall provide medical assistance immediately and unless there are good reasons, failing to do so shall be a criminal offence…”

Bellingcat was not able to identify the police officer responsible for the shooting, however footage appears to show it was the person seated behind the driver’s seat of the police vehicle, licence plate GKB905Y.

More than [40 people have been killed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c978l3rlymvo) since anti-finance bill demonstrations began in June this year. Kenya’s [police chief resigned](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenyas-police-chief-resigns-following-criticism-over-protests-2024-07-12/) last month over the police response to the protests but accountability for police brutality has been hard to come by in Kenya. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have previously documented [multiple incidents of excessive use of force by police](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/10/16/kenya-police-killed-beat-post-election-protesters) and the independent body formed to investigate the issue – the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) – has [consistently struggled to secure convictions](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/kenya-police-watchdog/) against police officers.

Nakuru County Police Commander, Samuel Ndanyi told Bellingcat the incident involving Kariuki was “unfortunate” but denied police fired from their vehicles at reporters. He said the case has been handed over to IPOA to investigate.

Bellingcat contacted IPOA to ask about the status of the investigation, but they had not responded at time of publication.

Journalist Catherine Wanjeri Kariuki told Bellingcat she wants the case to be properly investigated so that more journalists do not become a target of police.

 “Journalists are tired and fed up of being suppressed and being told to keep quiet when they shouldn’t.”

While there have been [more lethal incidents](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/01/world/video/kenya-protesters-shot-nairobi-ldn-digvid) during the anti-finance bill protests in Kenya, video evidence from this case shows exactly how a police weapon was used, seriously injuring a journalist who posed no threat.

## Protests Spread Across Kenya

Widespread street protests began in Nairobi and quickly spread across the country on June 18, as people took to the streets to [oppose a finance bill that would raise taxes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/26/kenyan-president-scraps-bill-to-raise-taxes-after-violent-protests-leave-23-dead).

At least 23 people were killed in violent clashes between police and protesters at parliament in Nairobi. Protests have continued even after Prime Minister William Ruto withdrew the bill and fired the majority of his cabinet. Kenya’s National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) reports [at least 50 people have been killed](https://www.knchr.org/Articles/ArtMID/2432/ArticleID/1201/Statement-on-Mukuru-Murders-and-Updates-on-the-Anti-Finance-Bill-Protests) since protests began.

On the day Kariuki was shot, protesters had gathered in the downtown of Kenya’s third largest city, Nakuru.

## Demonstrators in Downtown Nakuru

Protesters began to gather on Tuesday morning along Kenyatta Avenue.

Protesters [can be seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FGzAEuptqc) marching down the street with whistles, and vuvuzela. Armed Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) and police can also be seen on the streets.

A number of [KDF forces were deployed to Nakuru](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-06-26-military-officers-deployed-to-guard-protected-areas/) in late June to guard the government office in the city, they can be seen in footage wearing camouflage but some deployed police were [also in camouflage](https://www.camopedia.org/index.php/Kenya).

A [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz7YeZcXJzU) by KTN News captured a small number of protesters speaking to the media at 1:55pm local time, just outside the Faulu Microfinance Bank, located [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place//data%3D%214m2%213m1%211s0x18298dbe23c9cf79%3A0x975942db68673e61?sa=X&ved=1t:8290&ictx=111) at the intersection of Kenyatta Avenue and Pandit Nehru Road.

[Local media](https://fb.watch/u3UkQ8gL_O/) also showed footage of protesters being [dispersed with tear gas](https://www.the-star.co.ke/in-pictures/2024-07-16-photos-police-fire-teargas-to-disperse-nakuru-protesters/) along Kenyatta Avenue.

Throughout the day news crews were present at the intersection of Kenyatta Avenue and Pandit Nehru Road in downtown Nakuru. Footage shows a small number of protesters at the site and traffic continuing to move through the area at about 2...
