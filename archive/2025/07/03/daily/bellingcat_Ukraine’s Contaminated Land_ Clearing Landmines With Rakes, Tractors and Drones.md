# Ukraine’s Contaminated Land: Clearing Landmines With Rakes, Tractors and Drones

In a field near the small town of Bezymenne in southern Ukraine, Viktoria Shynkar carefully picks out a narrow path through the overgrown grass in front of her.

This small corridor of farmland in Mykolaiv Oblast will be checked for the presence of landmines and explosive ordnance.

If clear, Shynkar – a 36-year-old who worked as a hairdresser before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 – will move forward and create another space of the same size.

While she enjoys spending her days outside, it remains painstaking and dangerous work.

Shynkar and her colleagues, who work for the demining charity the Halo Trust, uncovered 243 [TM-62](https://cat-uxo.com/explosive-hazards/landmines/tm-62m-landmine) Soviet-designed anti-tank mines left by the Russian army in a neighbouring field.

A chunky and intimidating 32-centimetres in diameter and 13-cm-wide, the TM-62 contains 7.5 kilos of TNT and can [puncture a tank](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/b137730b83a5a96486adac5eba16e41b) if triggered.

The presence of landmines and other unexploded ordnance is a significant issue in Ukraine, impacting civilians and Ukraine’s agricultural industry – a major employer and source of income to the country.

## Data Challenges

Numerous bodies have sought to calculate the impact of landmines on Ukraine since the onset of Russia’s full invasion.

Established by the Ministry of Defence, the country’s National Mine Action Centre (NMAC) has produced a map that highlights areas it confirms as hazardous, are suspected of being hazardous as well as those that have been cleared or checked for hazards. It can be seen [here](https://ua.imsma.org/portal/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=1260fdb6ad224627b3f67c394ee94437) and in the image below.

The information is collated from over 80 demining groups operating in the country, which employ people like Shynkar. They collect data from the field and share it with the NMAC who upload it to this map made using the IMSMA platform produced by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining.

Yet the data the NMAC map contains, while significant, is only partial.

For example, it only creates a picture for the Ukrainian side of the front line, and just parts of it at that, with an area 20 kilometres from the frontline inaccessible to demining groups. Those same demining groups are also not operating in Russian-controlled regions, making the overall picture even less clear.

Furthermore, just because an area may be noted as not being impacted in landmine datasets doesn’t mean that it is not at risk from mines or other explosive ordnance that may not have detonated on impact. Some may simply not have been found yet.

## Waiting for Demining Groups To Visit

This is a concern for Ihor Kniazev, a farmer from the town of Dovhen’ke in Kharkiv Oblast. He complains to AFP that he has been waiting a long time for demining groups to visit. “Every year, they promise ‘tomorrow, tomorrow, we will clear all the fields’,” he says.

Kniazev says that he undertook the dangerous task of clearing his own fields with a metal detector. “Everyone clears mines themselves, absolutely everyone,” he insists. He even says that he ran over a mine in his tractor and was lucky not to be injured.

While Kniazev found that his land was indeed contaminated, his predicament highlights an important issue in demining in Ukraine and for farmers returning to areas that were previously occupied or near lines of contact.

While some areas are clearly identified as being mined, there remains uncertainty around those that are only suspected of being mined.

Several experts AFP and Bellingcat spoke to warned of the economic damage that could arise from suspicions that turn out to be incorrect. As a 2024 UN Development Programme [report](https://www.mineaction.org/sites/default/files/documents/2.1.2_new_heslop_ukraine_masg_oct_24.pdf) stated, areas suspected of being contaminated but not actually contaminated are either left alone or subjected to the same lengthy clearance process at what can be significant cost.

Such land could otherwise be used to grow crops and help reestablish returning farmers. Ukraine remains a huge food exporter despite the war, ensuring the issue is significant beyond its borders.

Some farmers AFP spoke to highlighted the complexity of trying to figure out which areas were contaminated and which were not.
