## LockBit ransomware on Mac: Should we worry?

April 18, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

One of the big headlines over the weekend is LockBit, the high-profile Russian ransomware gang, decided to expand its portfolio of potential victims by creating and releasing its first macOS payload, potentially triggering members of the Apple community to panic. But have no fear: Apple security experts have dissected the payload, taking a deep dive into what it can and cannot do, and concluded that the ransomware is, actually, toothless.

“Yes, it can indeed run on Apple Silicon. That is basically the extent of its impact,” [says](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x75.html) Patrick Wardle ([@patrickwardle](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle)), known macOS cybersecurity expert and founder of the non-profit, [Objective-See](https://objective-see.org/about.html). “macOS users have nothing to worry about.”

Here’s why.

### The signature is invalid.

Using a utility called *codesign*, Wardle saw that the payload’s signature value is “ad-hoc” compared to an Apple Developer ID. Because the signature is invalid, macOS won’t execute it.

If you’re brave enough to run the payload on your macOS, you’ll be met with this message, says Wardle. (Source: Objective-See)

### The payload is likely a test file.

Azim Khodjibaev ([@AShukuhi](https://twitter.com/AShukuhi)), a security researcher at Cisco Talos, [floated](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-encryptors-found-targeting-mac-devices/) the theory to BleepingComputer that the payload and its other variants designed for other OSs were “meant as a test and were never intended for development in liver cyberattacks.”

Wardle further confirmed this theory, stating it’s far from complete. Indicators in the payload’s code [suggest](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lockbit-ransomware-encryptors-found-targeting-mac-devices/) it’s Linux-based but compiled for macOS with basic configuration settings included. The code also shows its developers have yet to consider macOS’s TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) and [SIP (System Integrity Protection)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899), two security features meant to protect user files and folders.

With TCC and SIP present, this payload will only be able to encrypt a little, if at all.

### The code is buggy.

Laying further credence to test file theory, Wardle finds the macOS payload contains a buffer overflow, which will cause it to crash when executed.

Malwarebytes doesn’t detect this ransomware sample for two reasons: (1) we generally don’t detect non-functional malware test files, and (2) we only detect actual malware on Mac and not individual files.

## No worries for now!

Apple users can rest easy knowing that this macOS ransomware, as it is now, will hardly impact anyone. However, as Wardle quickly pointed out, this may be different in future releases.

“The fact that a large ransomware gang has apparently set its sights on macOS should give us pause for concern and also catalyze conversations about detecting and preventing this (and future) samples in the first place,” he [says](https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x75.html) in his blog.

With LockBit operating as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) outfit, its ambition is to offer a range of ransomware. Currently, we have at least two available offerings: [LockBit Black](http://www.threatdown.com/blog/ransomware-review-september-2022) (based on BlackMat...
