# Booking.com reservation abused as cybercriminals steal from travelers

Posted: June 6, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Robert Woodford, a recruitment marketing specialist, recently [shared on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marketing4recs_bookingscam-travelscam-staysafe-activity-7334597530455826432-6VNu/) how he fell victim to a highly sophisticated scam while booking a hotel in Verona through Booking.com, providing a striking example of how attacks on the hospitality industry affect travelers.

After completing a legitimate booking—and trading some communications with the hotel—Woodford received a separate message that he believed came from the official Booking.com messaging system. This message requested “missing details” and a prepayment.

But to be safe, Woodford logged into Booking.com directly rather than clicking any links. There, he found the same message in the *same thread* as his earlier communications with the hotel. The payment link also looked official, as it contained “bookingcom” in the URL. Woodford didn’t realize until after making the payment that the merchant’s name was incorrect and the payment was fraudulent.

Woodford’s story falls in line with a blog I wrote a few months ago about how [phishers use fake CAPTCHAs to trick hotel staff into downloading malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/fake-booking-com-phish-uses-fake-captchas-to-trick-hotel-staff-into-downloading-malware). It also demonstrates how travelers can be deceived by increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals exploiting real booking data and trusted platforms.

The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) [reported](https://www.ncsc.admin.ch/ncsc/en/home/aktuell/im-fokus/2025/wochenrueckblick_9.html) similar attacks where hotel staff were tricked into installing [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) through fake CAPTCHAs and malicious clipboard commands. These infections compromise hotel booking systems, allowing attackers to manipulate guest communications and payments.

To be clear, these types of online scams are so effective because the hotel itself has been compromised, and travelers log into official, verified websites and services only to receive malicious messages from cybercriminals who are secretly in control. These aren’t fake websites—these are fake representatives for real hotels using the hotels’ own messaging platforms to speak with customers.

Once the criminals infect the booking system, they can access guest data, and payment information, enabling them to impersonate hotels and reach guests directly.

Adding to this picture is [a warning from Arcona Hotels & Resorts](https://arcona.de/de/hinweis) who discovered “technical irregularities” and disconnected several locations from the central IT services as a precautionary measure to limit potential damage. ResponseOne GmbH, a company specializing in IT forensics, was brought in to conduct a technical analysis and manage the situation.

Arcona Hotels & Resorts is a German-based company specializing in operating and developing hotels, particularly focusing on leisure and holiday hotels, boutique hotels, and 5-star properties. While we have no direct information about what happened there, the timing and nature of their advisory suggest that this incident might be part of a wider campaign targeting the hospitality industry’s digital infrastructure.
