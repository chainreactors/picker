# What are HIPAA Incidental Disclosures?

December 3rd, 2024

For mid-sized companies and enterprises in the healthcare sector, HIPAA compliance is a critical aspect of maintaining trust and safeguarding patient and customer data. However, even with the best systems in place, **HIPAA incidental disclosures**—unintentional but avoidable disclosures of protected health information (PHI)—can still occur. These unintended incidents can lead to serious consequences, including regulatory fines and penalties, reputational damage, and a loss of customer trust. For any organization handling and communicating sensitive data and PHI, understanding and addressing these risks are essential for safeguarding your business.

### What Are HIPAA Incidental Disclosures?

HIPAA incidental disclosures occur when PHI is accidentally disclosed as a byproduct of legitimate healthcare operations. While incidental disclosures are not considered violations if reasonable safeguards are in place, they can still pose risks if left unaddressed.

Common examples of HIPAA incidental exposures include:

1. **Overheard Conversations**: A discussion about patient details in a shared office space or hallway.
2. **Misdirected Communications**: Emails or text messages sent to the wrong recipient.
3. **Improper Document Disposal**: Throwing away paper records with PHI without proper shredding.
4. **Visible Computer Screens**: Leaving sensitive information displayed on unattended monitors.
5. **Faxing Errors**: Sending a fax containing PHI to an incorrect number.

At the same time, you should also be aware of [HIPAA’s permitted disclosures](https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-permitted-disclosures/) as you navigate the different types of disclosures that fall under the regulation.

#### Real-World Example: Consequences of an Incidental Disclosure

In a notable case, a healthcare provider inadvertently emailed PHI to an incorrect recipient. This exposed sensitive information about treatments and diagnoses. Although safeguards were in place for routine communications, ad hoc emails lacked encryption. As a result, the organization faced a $200,000 fine from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Beyond the financial penalty, the company suffered reputational damage, with widespread negative publicity and a decline in patient trust.

### Challenges Enterprises Face with HIPAA Incidental Disclosures

When it comes to preventing unintentional data leads and exposure, larger organizations and enterprises face several challenges that can make the task more daunting, including:

1. **Large Data Volumes**: Managing PHI across communications channels increases the risk of HIPAA incidental disclosures.
2. **Operational Silos**: Fragmented workflows can lead to inconsistent PHI handling, raising the likelihood of disclosures.
3. **Cybersecurity Threats**: Phishing and cyber attacks targeting healthcare data increase exposure risks, especially for email.
4. **Balancing Security and Usability**: Strict safeguards can hinder workflows, leading staff to adopt insecure workarounds.
5. **Ambiguity in HIPAA Guidance**: Uncertainty in applying certain rules creates compliance challenges for enterprises.
