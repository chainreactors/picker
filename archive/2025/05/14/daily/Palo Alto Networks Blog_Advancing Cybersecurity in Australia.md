## Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access Browser Achieves IRAP Assessment

Government organisations and critical infrastructure entities are the custodians of some of the most important and sensitive data in the world. This data and the systems that they process underpin some of the most fundamental functions in modern society, from the provision of food, water, power to the management of welfare, finance and national security information. Consequently they are frequently targeted and attacked by threat actors with considerable capability and intent. The size and scale of Government and critical infrastructure systems, paired with a heavily regulated governing environment, means that [the risk](https://www.defence.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-08/defence-cyber-security-strategy.pdf) to government is further compounded as they are typically forced to operate [legacy systems](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106821#:~:text=Fast%20Facts,Business%20Oriented%20Language%20(COBOL).

As Government and critical infrastructure organisations are uplifting their systems, they are typically faced with becoming increasingly internet facing to enable the benefits of digitisation, interconnectedness and artificial intelligence. Looking to industry, one of the largest attack vectors will occur in the internet browser. Today, [85% of work is done via the browser](/blog/sase/six-uncomfortable-truths-about-working-in-web-browsers/) and as a result, [95% of companies](/blog/sase/browse-bravely-and-secure-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20web%20browser,and%20apps%20you%20are%20accessing) have experienced a security incident originating from the browser.

The browser is a key enabler for Government and critical infrastructure organisations’ security and digitisation, specifically within Australia. As such, Palo Alto Networks is proud to announce a significant milestone in Australian cybersecurity: [Prisma Access Browser (PAB) has successfully completed IRAP assessment](https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/irapassessment.html), reinforcing its readiness to support secure, scalable digital transformation across the public sector. This makes ours the first securebrowser of its kind approved for use in classified environments. It is suitable up to PROTECTED levels and for Critical Infrastructure entities complying with the [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight) and [Australian Information Security Manual (ISM)](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/ism) controls.

This achievement underscores Palo Alto Networks ongoing commitment to supporting Australia's cybersecurity resilience and equipping government agencies and critical infrastructure providers with cutting-edge, sovereign-compliant security solutions.

## An Introduction to Secure Browsers

A secure browser provides a secure, managed web browser environment, designed for specific business needs, allowing for full visibility and control over all web services and user actions.

Features often include controlled access to web apps, the ability to manage user activities, and tools to help prevent data breaches, which are not typically prioritised in consumer browsers. This specialisation helps maintain data integrity and streamline work processes within an enterprise setting.

[A secure browser](/cyberpedia/what-is-an-enterprise-browser) operates as a secure, managed web browsing solution tailored for organisational use. It enforces IT policies, controls resource access, and provides monitoring capabilities for enhanced security.

By integrating with a government agency or a critical infrastructure entity’s infrastructure, a secure browser restricts and monitors user activities according to predefined rules. Predefined rules can include processes, like content inspection and access control, to help achieve a zero trust architecture.

A secure browser isolates web processes to protect against threats, helping ensure that sensitive corporate data remains within a controlled environment. The segregation of corporate from personal browsing enables security maintenance without infringing on your user privacy.

Secure browsers often offer customization options to align with corporate branding and secure remote access capabilities. This means that government agencies or critical infrastructure providers have the capability to enable remote access for users with BYOD in a more compliant, secure and efficient manner.

## **What Does It Mean for Government and Critical Infrastructure within Australia?**

The completion of the PAB IRAP assessment introduces a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity capability to Australian Federal Government agencies and Critical Infrastructure providers. This innovative solution enhances secure AI adoption and strengthens remote working environments, enabling users like you to safely operate within classified and highly regulated ecosystems.

Leveraging the security-first browser from Palo Alto Networks empowers organisations with layers of protection:

* **Stronger zero trust enforcement** across web applications and cloud environments.
* **Seamless security integration** aligned with the [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cybersecurity/essential-eight) strategies.
* **Enhanced remote work protection** for government and critical industries.

### **Accelerating Cybersecurity Uplift with a Platform-Based Approach**

Since introducing our first IRAP-assessed solutions in 2022, the Palo Alto Networks product portfolio has expanded to help organisations rapidly enhance their security posture. Our platform-based approach delivers speed, planning and protection:

* **Faster compliance with Essential Eight and ISM requirements**, reducing time, complexity and costs.
* **A unified cybersecurity strategy** that integrates seamlessly across government and enterprise environments.
* **Proactive defence** against emerging cyberthreats while maintaining operational flexibility.

### **Beyond IRAP — A Commitment to Cybersecurity Excellence**

Palo Alto Networks is **committed to securing Australia** and extending beyond IRAP assessments with our initiatives:

* [**The Palo Alto Networks Trust Center**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com.au/legal-notices/trust-center) — Reinforcing our transparency and security-first approach.
* [**Common Criteria and FIPS Certifications**](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com.au/legal-notices/trust-center/certifications) – Compliance with global security standards.
* [**Active Participation in NIST’s Supply Chain Security Study**](/blog/2020/06/policy-supply-chain-best-practices/) – Highlighting our dedication to securing critical technology ecosystems.
