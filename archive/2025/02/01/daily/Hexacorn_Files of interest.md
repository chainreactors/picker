# Files of interest

Posted on [2025-01-31](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2025/01/31/9839/ "12:50 am")  by  [adam](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/author/adam/ "View all posts by adam")

I really like this MalBeacon’s [project](https://github.com/MalBeacon/what-is-this-stealer) because it highlights how easy it is to detect many malware families by just looking at the telemetry/forensic data obtained from a file system. And since I like it so much I decided to comb my data looking for file names that may serve a similar purpose… The result is this [file](https://hexacorn.com/d/filenames_of_interest.txt).

The set is watermarked hence you have been warned. You cannot use this set for any commercial reason. You cannot create any commercial detection based on this data. The only exceptions are: fully unlimited use by law enforcement, and for educational and non-commercial research purposes only.
