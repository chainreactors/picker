# PentestGPT – AI-Powered Penetration Testing Assistant

PentestGPT is a new AI-driven tool that acts as a virtual penetration testing assistant. **Released in 2024 by a security researcher** (GreyDGL)​, it leverages OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to interactively guide penetration testers through hacking tasks. In simple terms, PentestGPT lets you have a “ChatGPT-like” conversation where it suggests recon steps, exploitation commands, and even helps analyze results during a pentest.

**Features & Capabilities of PentestGPT – AI-Powered Penetration Testing Assistant**

* ***AI-Guided Workflow:*** PentestGPT can suggest the next steps in an engagement. For example, after you tell it you’ve scanned a host and found open ports, it might recommend running `nmap -A` on a specific port or using a certain exploit for a detected service.
* ***Natural Language Interface:*** You can prompt it in plain English (e.g. “Find vulnerabilities in this WordPress site”) and it translates that into actionable techniques. This lowers the barrier for less-experienced testers to use advanced methods.
* ***Learning and Reasoning:*** The tool has shown impressive reasoning on CTF challenges​ – it can chain together multiple hints and vulnerabilities to solve complex scenarios. It won’t “hack for you at one click”, but it’s like having a smart junior pentester by your side who can think of things you might miss.
* ***Use Cases:*** PentestGPT is particularly useful for **brainstorming attack vectors**. Stuck on a privilege escalation? Ask PentestGPT for potential exploits given the system info. It can also draft exploit code or decoding scripts on the fly. Essentially, it offloads some research and scripting tasks to AI.

**How to Use PentestGPT**

The tool is available on GitHub (released under an open-source license). It requires an OpenAI API key (ChatGPT Plus subscription) since it uses GPT-4. After configuring your API access, you run PentestGPT in a terminal. The interface is conversational – you type commands or questions, and it responds with guidance or code. For example, you might input: “I have a low-priv shell on Windows, how can I become SYSTEM?” PentestGPT might reply with a few possible privilege escalation techniques (like checking always-install-elevated registry settings or known vulnerable drivers to exploit).

*In testing, PentestGPT has proved especially helpful in capture-the-flag exercises*, solving vulnerable machines methodically​. Do note, however, that it’s not infallible – it sometimes suggests steps that aren’t applicable, so a human needs to validate its advice. Think of PentestGPT as a powerful brainstorming partner. As AI tools become more common in cybersecurity, PentestGPT is at the forefront of that trend, making it a must-try tool in 2024 for ethical hackers wanting to boost their workflow.

**Installing PentestGPT – AI-Powered Penetration Testing Assistant**

Install the latest version with `pip3 install git+https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT`

You may also clone the project to local environment and install for better customization and development

git clone https://github.com/GreyDGL/PentestGPT
cd PentestGPT
pip3 install -e .
To use OpenAI API
Ensure that you have link a payment method to your OpenAI account.
export your API key with export OPENAI\_API\_KEY='&lt;your key here>'
export API base with export OPENAI\_BASEURL='https://api.xxxx.xxx/v1'if you need.
</code>

Test the connection with pentestgpt-connection
To verify that the connection is configured properly, you may run pentestgpt-connection. After a while, you should see some sample conversation with ChatGPT.
A sample output is below:

<code>You're testing the connection for PentestGPT v 0.11.0
#### Test connection for OpenAI api (GPT-4)
1. You're connected with OpenAI API. You have GPT-4 access. To start PentestGPT, please use &lt;pentestgpt --reasoning\_model=gpt-4>
#### Test connection for OpenAI api (GPT-3.5)
2. You're connected with OpenAI API. You have GPT-3.5 access. To start PentestGPT, please use &lt;pentestgpt --reasoning\_model=gpt-3.5-turbo-16k>
notice: if you have not linked a payment method to your OpenAI account, you will see error messages.</code>
