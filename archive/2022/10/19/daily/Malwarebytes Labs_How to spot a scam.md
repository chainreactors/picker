# How to spot a scam

Posted: October 18, 2022
 by [Mark Stockley](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/mstockley)

Unfortunately, scams are a fact of life online. The virtual ties that bind us are international now: Our public telephone numbers, social media accounts, email addresses, messaging apps, dating profiles, and even our physical mailboxes, can all be reached by any criminal and con artist from anywhere in the world.

And test us they do, with everything from the preposterous offers of “Nigerian princes” to the slow boiling intimacy of long-term, long-distance romances.

There is a lot of good advice around (and plenty of it on this website) to help you understand which scams are popular right, how they work, and how to spot them.

Though undoubtedly useful, the advice is often specific to a single campaign or type of scam: Watch out for fake DHL emails; Beware of SMS messages from the Royal Mail; Don’t open invoices from unknown senders; Check the spelling and links in emails; Reverse image search too-good-to-be-true dating profile pics, and so on.

Being specific, the advice is narrow. SMS scams are not the same as email scams, and neither has much in common with a romance scam. There is a lot to remember.

So today I’m going to offer you something different. I want to give you the most general advice I can—a template that can be applied to almost any scam, over any media, on any time scale, whether it’s a new scam or something tried and tested.

It doesn’t make the other advice redundant, it’s just another way to look at things.

The advice comes from perhaps the most famous conman in the world, Frank Abagnale, whose alleged [exploits](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) were made famous by Leonardo DeCaprio in the movie “Catch me if you can”. Abagnale’s account of his own backstory is either true, partially true, or a total fabrication, depending on who you ask. What isn’t in doubt is that he knows a thing or two about lying to get what he wants.

In 2019 he gave an [interview to CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d526OqZX_LI) in which he gives perhaps the best generalised advice about scams I’ve ever heard, and which I will repeat here.

> In every scam no matter how sophisticated or how amateur, there are two red flags.

These are Abagnale’s red flags:

## An urgent need for money

The end goal of all scams is to enrich the scammer. And that often involves a direct transfer of money, whether it’s entering credit card details into a fake website or wiring tens of thousands of dollars to a stranded lover.

The demand for money is almost always urgent. Scammers know that their requests don’t stack up, so they want you to rush, and they don’t want you to involve other people.

In a romance scam where the criminal hopes to make the victim fall in love with them, the scammer may take their time to begin. However, when the demand for money comes, it is likely to be urgent.

On a recent Lock and Code podcast, Cindy Liebes, Chief Cybersecurity Evangelist for the Cybercrime Support Network, spelled out just [how patient these scammers can be](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2022/05/recovering-from-romance-scams-with-cindy-liebes-lock-and-code-s03e10):

> “It can take months, it can take years, but invariably they will seek to get money.”

In other situations, such as business email compromise (BEC) scams, the urgency is immediate.

In a BEC scam an attacker spoofs t...
