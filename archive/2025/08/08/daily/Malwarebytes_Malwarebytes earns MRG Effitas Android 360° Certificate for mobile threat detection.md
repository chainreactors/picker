# Malwarebytes earns MRG Effitas Android 360° Certificate for mobile threat detection

Posted: August 7, 2025
 by [Tjitske de Vries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/tdevries)

We’re excited to announce that [MRG Effitas,](https://www.mrg-effitas.com/) a globally recognized security assessment firm, has awarded Malwarebytes the prestigious MRG Effitas Android 360° Certificate, one of the toughest [independent tests in mobile security](https://www.mrg-effitas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MRG_Android_360_2025q1_v100.pdf).

Our mobile protection received the highest marks, achieving a near-perfect detection rate in MRG Effitas’ rigorous lab testing, reaffirming what our customers already know: Malwarebytes stops threats before they can cause harm.

Our smartphones have become more than just a device; they are our digital lifelines. With this evolution comes an increased vulnerability to cyber threats.

[Our research](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mobile-scams) showed that half of mobile users face scam attempts daily, and two-thirds admit it’s difficult to spot the difference between a scam and the real thing.

The consequences can be serious: 52% of scam victims experienced financial loss or fraud, and 27% lost access to important accounts, devices, or files.

There’s no doubt that people should be protecting their mobile devices in the same way they protect their computers.

Speaking about the award, our founder and CEO Marcin Kleczynski said:

> “At Malwarebytes, we know that mobile threats are constantly evolving—and so are we. Independent certifications like the MRG Effitas 360° Certificate aren’t just badges; they’re proof of our relentless focus on security, innovation, and protecting real people against real threats.”

MRG Effitas’ Android 360° certification requires a 99% effectiveness rate, making it one of the most challenging benchmarks for mobile protection. MRG Effitas tests a variety of real-life scenarios and in-the-wild pieces of [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware), like SMS payments, banking trojans and [spyware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/spyware), alongside benign samples to test for false positives.

Chris Pickard, CEO of MRG Effitas, commented:

> “There are no participation trophies with this test; it’s a real achievement. Malwarebytes mobile security stood out in our real-world scenarios, confirming its ability to stop and block dangerous mobile threats.”

We believe in earning trust the right way, with real-world results and transparent testing. That’s why we regularly engage with respected labs like MRG Effitas and AVLab.

Recently, Malwarebytes Premium Security was also awarded the [May 2025 AVLab Seal of Excellence](https://avlab.pl/en/the-may-edition-of-advanced-in-the-wild-malware-test-on-internet-samples/) for outstanding performance in its Advanced In-The-Wild Malware Test.

But we’re not stopping there. We’re constantly looking at new ways to protect you while using your mobile devices. Here are some recent updates we’ve made to Malwarebytes Mobile Security:

* **[Scam Guard](https://www.malwarebytes.com/solutions/scam-guard):** We’ve enhanced Malwarebytes’ [AI-powered scam detector](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/product/2025/06/scammers-are-constantly-changing-the-game-but-so-are-we-introducing-malwarebytes-scam-guard) to streamline the submission process for users, including a new welcome screen and media picker experience.
