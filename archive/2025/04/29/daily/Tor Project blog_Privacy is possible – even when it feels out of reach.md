# Privacy is possible â even when it feels out of reach

Big Tech is wielding unprecedented global power. With wealth built on decades of collecting, selling, and manipulating our personal data, the dominant tech companies have achieved levels of influence that make them seem beyond oversight or control. And even when they go out of business, the data we've handed over is out of our hands, [being sold to the next highest bidder](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q4r9xy9wro).

In these circumstances, it can feel like it's hopeless to fight back. These companies already have so muchâwhy should we bother to jump through more hoops to protect our personal privacy? Won't this surveillance machine just do its thing anyway?

This kind of hopelessness benefits the powerful. That you'll give up your privacy for good is Big Tech's biggest hope.

## We know a better world is possible.

It might not seem easy, because Big Tech has big money, but it's within our power to build something better. An internet that respects your privacy requires imagination that breaks out of the Big Tech silos, a different relationship between people and tech, and big investment in tools that prioritize privacy over profit.

Over the years, Tor community efforts have showcased that internet privacy is possible and can be achieved easily. Many of these tools already exist and are now easier to use than ever: the Tor network, [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/), and [Tails](https://tails.net/install/index.en.html). We're ready to take these tools to the next level, to build a better internet. But we need your help to get there.

**When you invest in the Tor Project, [PRIVACY IS POSSIBLE](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-sc2025).**

**Throughout the month of May, help the Tor Project reach our $75,000 goal.** The money raised will be used to develop tools that protect your privacy, allow us to find ways to unblock Tor during censorship events, and ensure Torâs independence from the influence of profit.

[![Donate Button](/sc25/button-large-black.png)](https://torproject.org/donate/donate-bp1-sc2025)

The Tor network has 2.5 million users at any given time during the average day, but fewer than 7,000 individuals make a donation annually. Are you part of that 7,000? Can you take the step to be part of the next 1,500 donors to be part of our donor circle?

Our board and champions of the Tor Project have already started us out with a commitment to match your donation 1:1 up to $15,000. **That means if you donate $25 now, the Friends of Tor will match your gift by donating $25, and your donation will be worth a total of $50.** Thank you to [Wendy Seltzer](https://wendy.seltzer.org/) and Thomas Roessler, [Matt Blaze](https://www.mattblaze.org/), [Aspiration Tech](https://aspirationtech.org/), [Sarah Gran](https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-new-board-members/), and other contributors for championing Tor with this match gift!

Your $25 gift will get you a **Privacy is Possible** sticker if you choose a sticker pack.
