Thanks in part [to your support](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/washingtons-right-repair-bill-heads-governor), the right to repair is now law in Washington.

Advocates in Washington have worked for years to pass a strong right-to-repair law in the state. In addition to Washington’s [Public Interest Research Group](https://pirg.org/washington/updates/washington-becomes-eighth-state-with-right-to-repair-law-on-the-books/), the consumer electronics bill moved forward with a growing group of supporting organizations, including environmental advocates, consumer advocates, and manufacturers such as Google and Microsoft. Meanwhile, advocacy from groups including  [Disability Rights Washington](https://disabilityrightswa.org/) and the [Here and Now Project](https://www.hereandnowproject.org/) made the case for the wheelchair's inclusion in the right-to-repair bill, bringing their personal stories to Olympia to show why this bill was so important.
