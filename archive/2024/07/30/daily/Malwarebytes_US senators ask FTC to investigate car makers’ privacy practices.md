# US senators ask FTC to investigate car makers’ privacy practices

Posted: July 29, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

An ongoing US Senate investigation indicated that connected car makers violate consumer privacy by sharing and selling drivers’ data, including their location, on a vast scale, and that the same car makers often obtain consumer consent through deception.

Based on this investigation, senators have [urged](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25017440-wyden-markey_auto_privacy_letter_to_ftc-1) the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate automakers’ disclosure of millions of Americans’ driving data to data brokers, and to share new-found details about the practice.

And they don’t stop there:

> “If the FTC determines that these companies violated the law, we urge you to hold the companies and their senior executives responsible.”

At Malwarebytes, we [reported](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2023/09/what-does-a-car-need-to-know-about-your-sex-life) how a team of researchers at Mozilla who reviewed the privacy and data collection policies of various product categories for several years now, named “Privacy Not Included,” found [cars](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/) to be [the worst product category they ever reviewed for privacy](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/).

A modern car hasn’t just been a transportation vehicle for a long time. With multiple digital systems, they are increasingly plugged into web applications and digital processes—applications and processes that are vulnerable to [security flaws](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/01/security-vulnerabilities-in-major-car-brands-revealed).

But at least those vulnerabilities are not intentional. Some other privacy issues are.

In November 2023, a [judge ruled it’s fine for car makers to intercept your text messages](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/11/judge-rules-its-fine-for-car-makers-to-intercept-your-text-messages), because the practice doesn’t meet the threshold for an illegal privacy violation under state law.

The senators found some worrying aspects of modern car data collection practices, which included the use of [dark patterns](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/podcast/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-dark-patterns-with-carey-parker-lock-and-code-s02e09) to obtain consent in ways that did not qualify as “informed” consent. Dark patterns, also known as deceptive design patterns, occur when a user interface has been carefully crafted to nudge or trick users into doing things they didn’t set out to do.

Another problem lies in the fact that data was found to be sold on to [data brokers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/data-brokers). These services can allow interested parties—from law enforcement agencies to marketing firms and even scammers—to access records that contain usernames, passwords (including in clear text), email addresses, [IP addresses](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address), and more.

Three car makers confirmed their disclosure of drivers’ data to one [data broker](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cyb...
