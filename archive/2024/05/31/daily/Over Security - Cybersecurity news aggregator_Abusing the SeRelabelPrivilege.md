# Abusing the SeRelabelPrivilege

In a recent assessment, it was found that a specific Group Poilcy granted via ‚ÄúUser Right Assignments‚Äù the **SeRelabelPrivilege** to the built-in Users group and was applied on several computer accounts.

I never found this privilege before and was obviously curious to understand the potential implications and the possibility of any (mis)usage scenario.

Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/modify-an-object-label) is as usual not very clear and helpful, to summarize:

‚Äú*Anyone with the¬†**Modify an object label**¬†user right can change the integrity level of a file or process so that it becomes elevated or decreased to a point where it can be deleted by lower integrity processes.*‚Äú

Luckily, a [post](https://www.tiraniddo.dev/2021/06/the-much-misunderstood.html) from James Froshaw published in 2021 gave much more details and useful information on possible abuse üòâ . I highly recommend reading it before going on.

I decided to do some experiments to understand how ‚Äúfar‚Äù I could go.

I started by assigning to a standard user the *SeRelabelPrivilege* via group policy:

The privilege is only available in High Integrity Level (in the case of cmd.exe -> run as administrator):

But what does this privilege grant to you? Well, a lot of interesting permissions!

* It allows you to **take ownership** of a resource
* Furthermore, unlike the *SeTakeOwnsership* privilege, it allows you to own resources that have an **integrity level even higher than your own**
* Once you have taken the ownership, you can grant yourself **full control** over the resource (process, tokens,‚Ä¶)
* Quick & dirty: Same as abusing the *SeDebugPrivilege* üôÇ

My goal was to take ownership of a SYSTEM process, grant myself full control, and then create a process under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account.

Perfect Local Privilege Escalation‚Ä¶ pardon, just a ‚ÄúSafety Boundary‚Äù violation üòâ

For this purpose, I created a simple POC:

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-4.png?w=1024)

First of all, I needed to get the current user SID and enable the specific privilege. After this, I took the ownership of the process:

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-5.png?w=1024)

I needed to open the process with WRITE\_OWNER access. In the *SetSecurityInfo* call, the ‚ÄúLABEL\_SECURITY\_INFORMATION‚Äù flag is mandatory, otherwise, I was not able to own a process with an Integrity Level higher than my High IL process.

Once I took the ownership, it was super-easy to grant full control:

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-6.png?w=1024)

In this case, I needed to open the process with WRITE\_DAC access, and after setting the explicit access to PROCESS\_ALL\_ACCESS, I gained full control of the process!

*Side note: this is just an example, the same results can be accomplished in different ways by using other API calls.*

Let‚Äôs see if it works‚Ä¶ 7116 was the winlogon process, which ran under System Integrity and was owned by SYSTEM:

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png?w=1024)

Ownership changed and full control was successfully granted:

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png?w=1024)

The easiest way to abuse this was to perform a parent process injection. For this purpose, I used my old [psgetsystem](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem/blob/master/psgetsys.ps1) tool (remember to comment out *Process.EnterDebugMode()*)

![](https://decoder.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9.png?w=1024)

Et voil√†! Got SYSTEM access üôÇ

Just for fun, I also took ownership of the token, granted full access to the token, and lowered the IL from System to Medium üòâ

## Conclusion

From what I understood of this really strange privilege:

* It allows you to take ownership of a resource even if it‚Äôs IL > of yours.
* Once you take ownership you can grant yourself full access to the process and tokens.
* The result, from an abuse perspective, is then quite similar to the Debug Privilege
* Manipulating the mandatory label is just a consequence.
* I still don‚Äôt understand why MS implemented it

Thanks to James Forshaw for his useful hints and for helping me demystify this privilege

That‚Äôs all üôÇ
