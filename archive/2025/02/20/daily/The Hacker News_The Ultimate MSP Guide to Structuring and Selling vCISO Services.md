The growing demand for cybersecurity and compliance services presents a great opportunity for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to offer virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) services—delivering high-level cybersecurity leadership without the cost of a full-time hire.

However, transitioning to vCISO services is not without its challenges. Many service providers struggle with structuring, pricing, and selling these services effectively. That's why we created [the Ultimate Guide to Structuring and Selling vCISO Services](https://cynomi.com/guide-structuring-and-selling-vciso-services/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=CS&utm_campaign=article&utm_content=guide-selling-vciso-services-02-2025).

This guide, created in collaboration with Jesse Miller, a seasoned vCISO and founder of PowerPSA Consulting, offers actionable strategies to navigate these hurdles. From identifying what to offer and whom to target, to crafting compelling sales strategies, this resource provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a successful vCISO practice.

## Where to Begin: What to Offer and to Whom

This guide outlines the key steps to successfully offering vCISO services, starting with existing capabilities and identifying the right clients.

### **Step 1: Evaluate Current Offerings**

Many MSPs and MSSPs already provide elements of vCISO services without formalizing them. The guide helps you assess existing security activities and identify opportunities to package them into a complete vCISO service.

### **Step 2: Assess Existing Clients**

Not every client is an ideal fit for vCISO services. The guide explains how to segment the client base by industry, size, and security maturity, ensuring efforts are focused on those who will benefit most. It also covers prioritization strategies to maximize revenue and create compelling value propositions.

By leveraging your existing relationships, vCISO services can efficiently meet previously unmet needs, allowing you to grow your revenue through targeted upselling. This approach enables you to maximize the potential of your current clients before focusing on attracting new clients.

### **Step 3: Structure vCISO Services**

A structured approach ensures scalability and consistency. Using a matrix, analyze client needs based on security maturity and complexity, then package offerings accordingly:

* **Basic:** Foundational risk assessments, compliance assistance, and tactical security measures.
* **Strategic:** Long-term planning, board-level discussions, and compliance oversight.
* **Leadership:** Executive-level oversight, acting as a fractional CISO for complex security needs.

Identifying a focus area within this matrix helps prioritize clients, such as developing vCISO packages for those in medium maturity and medium complexity. Standardizing services ensures a scalable system that delivers consistent results. Leveraging frameworks and automation streamlines sales, reduces complexity, and accelerates service delivery.

## Selling vCISO Services

### Scoping & Go-to-Market

As outlined in the guide, start by gathering key client information to determine fit and align services effectively.

* **Assess Business Drivers:** Understand the client's industry, goals, and major initiatives to ensure cybersecurity strategies support their objectives.
* **Evaluate Readiness & Priorities:** Determine if the client has a real need for security leadership, compliance guidance, or risk management—and whether they are ready to invest in it.
* **Avoid Misaligned Clients:** Walk away from businesses that don't prioritize security to maintain strong partnerships and focus resources on high-value clients.

Tailor services based on these insights while setting clear expectations on scope, deliverables, and impact. Focus on **high-value, strategic outcomes** to build long-term trust and drive measurable results.

### Elevate the Conversation: Key discovery questions to drive vCISO engagement

When engaging with a client, focus on understanding their business goals, challenges, and why they need vCISO services. A business-centered conversation builds trust and ensures security is positioned as a strategic asset rather than a cost.

Key discussion points:

* **Align cybersecurity with business success** by framing it as a driver of resilience, compliance, and growth.
* **Highlight legal and regulatory implications** to address potential financial and reputational risks.
* **Emphasize the cost of inaction**, showing how proactive security is far more cost-effective than responding to a cyber incident.

By tailoring vCISO services to mitigate risk, support business objectives, and enhance long-term stability, clients will see cybersecurity as an essential investment rather than an overhead expense.

### **Key Selling Points**

Building trust with clients requires demonstrating both technical expertise and business understanding to provide tailored security strategies.

### **Key Benefits of vCISO Services:**

* Enterprise-level security without full-time costs
* Flexible CISO options based on needs
* Faster compliance with regulations
* Streamlined cyber insu...
