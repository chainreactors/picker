[![operational technology](data:image/png;base64... "operational technology")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXpKT6kyqgqwVeLE_U8s3Hs-5dYGDLSiGaEjGuo8l7tpK89MfEyBgzdQddQrvEK65LnrHJ2_pl164doAjitluZiiXNjPyXzJnIfr1A6PoC1eMXUSTyyRk7w3lZNPj8tqF1edA6Tt5N3WKBETaDzbhM7VZ8oX6xSebu-GmPNTLNjg4VSvcH_gqUfqUWkpQ/s790-rw-e365/indus.jpg)

For too long the cybersecurity world focused exclusively on information technology (IT), leaving operational technology (OT) to fend for itself. Traditionally, few industrial enterprises had dedicated cybersecurity leaders. Any security decisions that arose fell to the plant and factory managers, who are highly skilled technical experts in other areas but often lack cybersecurity training or knowledge.

In more recent years, an uptick in cyberattacks against industrial facilities and the trend of IT/OT convergence driven by Industry 4.0 have highlighted the vacuum of ownership around OT security. [According to a new Fortinet report](https://cyolo.io/blog/former-ciso-reacts-to-fortinet-state-of-ot-cybersecurity-report/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored+post&utm_campaign=5thingciso), most organizations are looking to Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to solve the problem.

Fortunately, CISOs are no strangers to change or difficult challenges. The position itself is less than 20 years old, yet in those two decades CISOs have navigated some of the most disruptive cybersecurity events that were truly watershed moments in technology.

Still, most CISOs have made their mark securing IT environments — and IT security strategies and tools rarely translate to an OT context. While the soft skills of collaboration and team-building will certainly help CISOs as they bring the factory floor into their realm of responsibility, they must also make a concentrated effort to understand the OT landscape's unique topography and distinctive security challenges.

## Safety over everything

The CIA triad — Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability — is a key concept in cybersecurity. Critically, IT and OT prioritize the elements of the triad differently — although safety is always the common denominator.

| Image 1: The CIA triad of IT security is reversed in the OT world, where availability is the highest priority. |

* **In IT, safety means that data is protected through confidentiality.** People get hurt when their sensitive, private data is compromised. For the enterprise, securing data saves them from breaches, fines, and reputational damage.
* **In OT, safety means that cyber-physical systems are reliable and responsive.** People get hurt when a blast furnace or an industrial boiler does not function properly. For the enterprise, availability keeps systems running on time down to the millisecond, which ensures productivity and profitability.

Somewhat ironically, the AIC triad of the OT world has resulted in systems and tools that prioritize physical safety but often come with few or no cybersecurity features at all. It will be the CISO's responsibility to identify and implement security solutions that protect OT systems from cyberthreats without disrupting their operations.

## Levels of segmentation

In both OT and IT, segmentation limits the network's attack surface. In OT, [the Purdue Model](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VAAMI/ICS-modules.pdf) serves as a framework for how and why systems can and should communicate with each other.

In a highly simplified nutshell, the Purdue Model comprises five layers.

* Levels 4 and 5 are the outermost layers that include web and email servers, IT infrastructure, and users firewalling in remotely.
* Levels 2 and 3 are the operational layers that operate the software and applications that run OT environments.
* Levels 0 and 1 hold the devices, sensors, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and distributed control systems (DCS) that do the actual work and must be protected from outside interference.

The purpose of these layers is to create both logical and physical separation between process levels. The closer you get to the cyber-physical operation of industrial systems like injectors, robotic arms, and industrial presses, the more checks and balances are in place to protect them.

While the concept of segmentation will not be new to CISOs, they will need to understand that the separation of zones is much stricter in OT environments and must be enforced at all times. Industrial enterprises adhere to the Purdue model or other similar frameworks to ensure safety and security and to meet many regulatory compliance mandates.

## Downtime is not an option

In IT, downtime for upgrades and patches is no big deal, especially in a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) world where new updates are released practically in real time.

Whether for safety or profit, OT systems are always up and running. They cannot be stopped or paused to download a new operating system or apply even a critical patch. Any process that requires downtime is simply a non-starter for the vast majority of OT systems. For ...
