Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor was unresponsive to multiple communication attempts during over one
year of responsible disclosure after submitting our advisory to them, see the
timeline below.

It is unknown to us whether a patch is available. Customers of SIMCom are urged
to reach out to their contact person at SIMCom or distributors to demand a patch
which removes the backdoor command.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product
conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further
security issues and verify the removal of the backdoor command.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Undocumented Root Shell Access (CVE-2025-26412)
The SIMCom SIM7600G modem supports an undocumented AT command, which allows
an attacker to execute system commands with root permission on the modem.

An attacker needs either physical access or remote shell access to a device
that interacts directly with the modem via AT commands.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Undocumented Root Shell Access (CVE-2025-26412)
The SIMCom SIM7600G modem supports an undocumented AT command, which
allows an attacker to execute commands with root permissions on the modem.
For this example the tool mmcli is used to communicate with the modem.
The following example shows how the AT command "AT+CSHELL" can be used to
execute system commands on the SIM7600G modem by a physically connected
attacker:

# mmcli --modem=1 --command='AT+CSHELL="id"'
response: '+CSHELL: uid=0(root) gid=0(root)'

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following firmware version has been tested on a SIMCom modem, that
was integrated in a 3rd-party device:
* Firmware Revision: LE20B03SIM7600M21-A

The vendor did not respond to our questions, which firmware revisions or
other products are affected. It is assumed that more firmware revisions
are affected.
