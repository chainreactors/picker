What is an Interactive Malware Sandbox?

Today’s malware is complex, and often comes with a wide assortment of evasion methods.

Many families got so good at evading automated sandboxes, that traditional methods often fall short in detecting them. This is where interactive malware sandboxes like [ANY.RUN](https://any.run/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=interactive_sandbox&utm_term=140824&utm_content=linktolanding) come into play — it offers a powerful tool for cybersecurity professionals to engage directly with potential threats, and study evasive malware.

## What is an Interactive Malware Sandbox?

An interactive malware sandbox is a specialized [environment](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/5-ways-virtualization-can-improve-security/) designed to safely execute and analyze potentially harmful software.

![](/cybersecurity-blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-min-1-1024x568.png)

[Unlike traditional sandboxes](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-vs-automated-sandbox/) that run malware in a closed, automated system, interactive sandboxes allow users to actively participate in the analysis process.

This hands-on approach enables a deeper exploration of the malware’s behavior, allowing for real-time adjustments and observations.

By interacting directly with the malware, analysts can observe how it responds to different inputs, network conditions, and system configurations. This level of interaction is particularly valuable in identifying sophisticated threats that might evade detection in automated systems.

## How Interactive Malware Sandboxes Work?

When a sample is uploaded to the sandbox, the environment is immediately prepared to execute the malware.

What sets interactive sandboxes apart is the ability for the analyst to [step in and guide the process](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/interactive-malware-analysis/). For instance, if the malware attempts to open a webpage, the analyst can observe the page content, monitor [network traffic](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/new-threat-details-window/), and see how the malware interacts with the site.

Or, if the malware involves unpacking files or completing installer instructions, the analyst can manually execute each step and see exactly what the malware does at every stage.

This real-time interaction also means that the analyst can simulate different user behaviors:

* Enable [macros](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/macros-in-malware/) in Microsoft Office.

* Click through an installation wizard.

* Open attachments.

* Navigate through [system prompts](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/windows11-uac-bypass/).

* Paste or copy content from the VM clipboard.

All of it helps progress the analysis session forward and collect valuable information on the malware’s triggers and the full scope of its capabilities, which might remain hidden in a fully automated system.

After the analysis session, like the [example above](https://app.any.run/tasks/ab01e92e-d82d-475a-ab1b-1b7a6afe350b/?utm_source=anyrunblog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=interactive_sandbox&utm_term=140824&utm_content=linktoservice), ANY.RUN saves the recording. You can pause, rewind, and replay specific actions within the sandbox and dive deep [into each process](https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/process-tree-analysis/) spawned by the sample.

## Benefits of Using an Interactive Malware Sandbox

Interactive malware sandboxes offer several advantages:

* **Better detection**. Many advanced malware strains can detect a sandbox, and then “play dead,” which leads to false nega...
