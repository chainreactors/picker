As 2022 comes to a close, stress can be at an all-time high. This time of year, many have planned holiday vacation time, relatives may be coming in from out of town, or there may be end-of-year time crunches at work. Due to these stressors, we may become lax in our judgement when it comes to how we view security. However, we must be wary of scammers during the holiday season and not let our guard down. These conditions are the perfect storm for malicious actors. In 2021, the FBI and CISA saw an increase in [highly impactful ransomware attacks occurring on holidays and weekends](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa21-243a). We should not expect things to be any different at the end of this year either.

In October, [Cybersecurity Awareness Month](https://www.social-engineer.org/newsletter/see-yourself-in-cyber/) taught us the importance of safe practices such as the use of multifactor authentication, strong passwords, and VPNs. Even though that month has since passed, the holiday season is perhaps one of the most crucial times to keep those same practices at the forefront of our mind, along with other useful tips to keep ourselves safe. Let us consider a few of them.

## Caution on Vacation

Many find themselves travelling during this time of the year. We may be very excited to finally get some time off after a very busy twelve months. However, never let yourself become too comfortable when letting people know that you’re away! One instance to be careful of is when posting on social media. If we were to post too much about going on holiday mentioning dates away, destinations, etc., we could run the risk of being targeted by a malicious actor. How so? They could pose as your hotel or airline by sending you convincing phishing emails. Or even worse, plan out when you will be away so as to gain access to your personal estate.

When on vacation, the last thing you want to worry about is work emails, right? You may set up “Out of Office” automatic replies to let people know you are not available, and to reach out to someone else. Though these may be useful, they may be more of a security risk if they are not worded properly. It is recommended that [“Out of Office” replies](https://www.directdefense.com/your-detailed-out-of-office-autoresponder-could-be-putting-your-organizations-email-security-at-risk/) should NOT include the following:

* Specific dates of your vacation (e.g., December 23-27)
* Corporate information you would normally include on a regular email (e.g., job title, company roles, chain of command details, etc.)
* Personal contact information such as a cell number

What would happen if an employee were to include all this information in their “out of office” automatic replies? A malicious actor could use this information to impersonate the employee while they are away! An attacker can easily find these types of automatic replies by means of mass phishing campaigns.

## Deals and Promotions

This time of year also brings a surge of [promotional scams](https://www.aura.com/learn/holiday-scams). With the increase of malware related scams mentioned at the outset, it is important to be on guard when searching through our inbox. Scammers may include details about “jaw-dropping” holiday discounts to entice their victims. These may come in the form of [phishing emails, text messages or advertisements](https://www.capcomfcu.org/blog/scam-alert-fake-holiday-deals/) while online shopping. Also, beware of fake in-app purchases or shared links on social media.
![Scammers during the holidays](https://www.social-engineer.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/December-2022-SEORG-Blog-1.jpg)
ALWAYS be wary of any links found in emails or text messages from unknown or unexpected senders. The link may have misspellings of a brand or have nontraditional characters embedded in it. If it is believed to lead to a reputable website, visit the site directly yourself instead of using the link. You can also try using free link checkers on the web to see if it is in fact malicious.

When deals seem too good to be true, it’s likely because they are. If you’re not sure whether an offer or deal is legitimate or not, always search and fact check first before taking any action. Always make sure you are shopping on the correct website as well. If you mistype a website by accident, there may be a scam website deliberately misspelled to catch accidental web traffic.

Beware of Delivery Scams! With the increased traffic of online shopping and package shipping, scammers are given another avenue to take advantage of. They may send out phishing emails and texts disguised as reputable companies like UPS, FedEx or Amazon. The message may claim to be a notification about incoming or missed deliveries. However, links attached to the phony messages may lead to sign-in pages asking for personal information or may be infested with malware.

## Fake Charities

Scammers will exploit any possible situation and circumstance. They do not “play nice” or fair, regardless of what time of year it is. December is the [most popular month for charitable giving](https://institute.blackbaud.com/charitable-giving-report/overall-giving-trends/). Scammers are aware of this and take advantage of it by creating fake charities, GoFundMe campaigns, and other charitable activities. These types of scams may also use current events, such as the war in Ukraine, to trigger an emotional response and click on a link.

In some cases, a charity may not be fake at all, however scammers can make a passable “lookalike” website to trick users. Because of this, always check the URL and charity name before donating. Be wary if a charity seems to be pressure you in...
