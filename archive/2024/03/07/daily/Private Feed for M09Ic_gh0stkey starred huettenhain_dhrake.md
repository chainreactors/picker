# Dhrake

Dhrake is a collection of scripts for reverse engineering Delphi binaries with [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and [IDR](https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR).

## TL/DR How to Use Dhrake

1. Use [IDR](https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR) to load the Delphi binary and generate an IDC script from the symbols that [IDR](https://github.com/crypto2011/IDR) extracts.
2. Load the sample into [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and let it analyze the file.
3. Run [DhrakeInit](/huettenhain/dhrake/blob/master/DhrakeInit.java), giving it the path to the IDC file you generated in step 1.
4. Reverse engineer until you see something like:

   ```
   iVar2 = TStringList.Create(VMT_472694_TStringList, CONCAT31((int3)((uint)extraout_EDX >> 8),1));
   ```
5. Navigate to `VMT_472694_TStringList` in the listing view...
