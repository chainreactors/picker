# Developer verification: a promised lift for Android security

Posted: August 27, 2025
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

To reduce the number of harmful apps targeting [Android](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/how-to-clean-your-phone-from-virus) users, Google has [announced](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html) that certified [Android devices](https://www.malwarebytes.com/android-antivirus) will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed.

But this new measure is not just about [malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware) that’s found on the [Google Play Store](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/08/77-malicious-apps-removed-from-google-play-store), it’s mainly about sideloaded apps (apps downloaded from outside the official Google Play Store).

Since August 31, 2023, apps on the Play Store already were subject to a [D-U-N-S (Data Universal Numbering System) number requirement](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html). Google says this has helped reduce the number of cybercriminals exploiting anonymity to distribute malware, commit financial fraud, and steal sensitive data.

To broaden this success, Google intends to start sending out invitations gradually starting October 2025, before opening it up to all developers in March 2026. In September 2026, the requirements go into effect in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. At this point, any app installed on a certified Android device in these regions must be registered by a verified developer. The requirements will then be rolled out globally.

This initiative, branded as ‘Developer verification,’ aims to combat the widespread problem of malware from sideloaded apps. Google says its research shows that 50 times more malware comes from sideloaded sources than from Google Play itself.

So, the new rules extend to everyone distributing Android apps, including those hosting them on third-party app stores or offering APK downloads directly. For developers who distribute their apps solely through the Google Play Store there will not be much of a change.

Yet, while legitimate developers will tell you how hard it is to get their apps accepted into the Google Play Store, cybercriminals manage to sneak in their malicious apps anyway.

For a full understanding of the new requirement, we’ll need to explain what “certified Android devices” are.

A definition for a certified Android device is: an Android product—such as a smartphone, tablet, smart TV, or streaming box—that has passed a rigorous series of Google security, compatibility, and performance tests, and is officially approved by Google. Certified devices run an official version of Android and have access to Google apps and the Play Store. Uncertified devices often lack these and may not receive updates or proper security support.

This is important to know because not all Android malware is limited to phones. Take for example, the [BadBox botnet](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/03/android-botnet-badbox-largely-disrupted) which also affects devices like TV streaming boxes, tablets, and smart TVs.

In practice, a certified device encompasses all mainstream devices from Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, and the Google Pixel line.
