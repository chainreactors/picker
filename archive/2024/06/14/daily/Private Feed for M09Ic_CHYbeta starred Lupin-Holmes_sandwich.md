# Sandwich Attack Generator

This is a simple Ruby script to generate [UUIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) based on a range of timestamps in order to perform a [Sandwich Attack](https://versprite.com/blog/universally-unique-identifiers/).

### Requirement

Ruby version >= 3

### Usage

The script can be run from terminal with two mandatory parameters and three optional parameters:

**Example:**

```
./sandwich.rb <UUID1> <UUID2> [-o <FILEPATH>] [-m "<MACHINE1>,<MACHINE2>,<MACHINE3>"]
```

Parameters:

* `<UUID1>`: First UUID for generating range (required)
* `<UUID2>`: Second UUID for generating range (required)

Optional flags:

* `-o` followed by `<FILEPATH>`: This flag is used to specify an output file name.
* `-m` followed by comma-separated machine names enclosed in quotes. This flag allows you to specify the machines you want to create files for.

If no filename or machine is specified, then will generate in default 'uuids\_list.txt' file.
