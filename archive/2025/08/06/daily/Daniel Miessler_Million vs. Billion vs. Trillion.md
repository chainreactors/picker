# Million vs. Billion vs. Trillion

Understanding massive numbers through the lens of time

We hear the words million, billion, and trillion quite a bit. And we know that a million is a lot, a billion is a whole lot more, and trillion is even more than that.

But here's a good way to see how big the difference actually is.

## How long is a million seconds? [​](#how-long-is-a-million-seconds)

First, let me ask you a question: How long do you think a million seconds is? In terms of days, weeks, years, decades, or whatever.

Turns out it's **11.5 days**. That's it. Less than two weeks.

## How long is a billion seconds? [​](#how-long-is-a-billion-seconds)

Now, how about a billion?

A billion seconds is **31.7 years**.

So a million seconds ago was last week, and a billion seconds ago was 1993.

## How long is a trillion seconds? [​](#how-long-is-a-trillion-seconds)

Okay, last one. How long do you think a trillion seconds is?

A trillion seconds is **31,689 years**.

A trillion seconds ago, humans were still in the Stone Age. Writing hadn't been invented. Agriculture hadn't been invented. We were hunter-gatherers using basic tools.

## The structure and higher levels [​](#the-structure-and-higher-levels)

As you can see in the image, the pattern here is to multiplication by 1,000—which adds three zeros. Here are the next few levels.

| Name | Zeros | Scientific |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One | 0 | 10⁰ |
| Thousand | 3 | 10³ |
| Million | 6 | 10⁶ |
| Billion | 9 | 10⁹ |
| Trillion | 12 | 10¹² |
| Quadrillion | 15 | 10¹⁵ |
| Quintillion | 18 | 10¹⁸ |
| Sextillion | 21 | 10²¹ |
| Septillion | 24 | 10²⁴ |
| Octillion | 27 | 10²⁷ |
| Nonillion | 30 | 10³⁰ |
| Decillion | 33 | 10³³ |
| Undecillion | 36 | 10³⁶ |

## The takeaway [​](#the-takeaway)

1. Big numbers are difficult for the human brain to intuitively process
2. As you go up, you're just multiplying by 1,000 and adding three zeros
