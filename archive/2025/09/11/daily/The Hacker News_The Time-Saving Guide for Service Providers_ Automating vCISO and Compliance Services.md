## Introduction

Managed service providers (MSPs) and managed security service providers (MSSPs) are under increasing pressure to deliver strong cybersecurity outcomes in a landscape marked by rising threats and evolving compliance requirements. At the same time, clients want better protection without managing cybersecurity themselves. Service providers must balance these growing demands with the need to work efficiently, deliver consistent results, and scale their offerings.

Yet, many service providers still rely on manual processes that slow down delivery, make it harder to maintain consistency across clients, and limit the time teams have to focus on more strategic initiatives. Even experienced service providers can find themselves stretched thin as they try to meet rising client expectations while managing operational complexity.

In this environment, automation offers an opportunity to work more effectively and deliver greater value. By streamlining repetitive tasks, improving consistency, and freeing up time and resources, automation helps providers expand their services, strengthen client relationships, and grow sustainably.

We created *[The Service Provider's Guide to Automating Cybersecurity and Compliance Management](https://cynomi.com/guide-the-service-providers-guide-to-automating-cybersecurity-and-compliance-management/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=cs&utm_campaign=automating-cyber-guide-09-2025)* to help providers navigate the transition to automation. Inside, you'll find a practical overview of current challenges, real-world examples, and guidance for identifying where automation can have the biggest impact.

## The Hidden Costs of Manual Work

Tasks like risk assessments, policy development, framework mapping, remediation planning, and executive reporting often require [13 to 15 hours of manual work each.](https://cynomi.com/state-of-the-vciso-2023/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=cs&utm_campaign=automating-cyber-guide-09-2025) This level of effort places mounting pressure on internal teams, extends project timelines, and delays client outcomes all of which can restrict growth.

Over time, these inefficiencies quietly erode both profitability and service quality, making it harder to scale and compete effectively.

Key hidden costs include:

* **Time delays** that impact client satisfaction and slow down revenue cycles
* **Inconsistencies** across assessments and documentation, undermining trust
* **Talent inefficiency** as senior staff handle administrative work instead of strategic tasks
* **Missed revenue** opportunities due to limited capacity for upselling or onboarding new clients

Manual processes also create specific bottlenecks across five critical areas of service delivery:

1. **Onboarding & Assessments** – Repetitive, slow, and often inconsistent
2. **Framework Mapping** – Labor-intensive and prone to errors
3. **Remediation Management** – Hard to scale and standardize
4. **Progress Reporting** – Time-consuming and lacks consistency and clarity
5. **Service Customization** – Manual adjustments reduce repeatability

Automation is key to overcoming these barriers and unlocking scalable, high-margin service delivery.

## How Automation Can Help: 5 Key Use Cases

According to *[The State of the Virtual CISO 2025 Report](https://cynomi.com/state-of-the-vciso-2025/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=cs&utm_campaign=automating-cyber-guide-09-2025),* vCISO providers using AI or automation report a 68% average reduction in cybersecurity and compliance workload over the past year.

AI-powered technologies like Cynomi's vCISO Platform automate and standardize vCISO workflows end-to-end, cutting manual efforts by up to 70%. Here are five key areas where automation can make a measurable impact:

1. **Risk Assessments & Onboarding:** Interactive, guided questionnaires and centralized data capture replace emails and interviews, cutting hours from onboarding timelines.
2. **Policy Development:** Automated platforms generate client-specific policies mapped to frameworks like NIST and ISO.
3. **Compliance Tracking:** Tasks are automatically mapped to frameworks and updated as standards evolve, reducing oversight and error risk.
4. **Remediation Planning:** Tasks are prioritized and assigned automatically, allowing teams to track progress and outcomes in a centralized hub.
5. **Progress Reporting:** Client-branded, progress reports are generated in clicks, turning security activity into clear, business-focused insights without the usual delays.
6. **Standardizing Service Delivery:** Automation streamlines core tasks like onboarding and compliance management, allowing providers to deliver consistent, high-quality services across clients without reinventing the wheel each time.

## The ROI of Automation

One of the most effective ways to measure automation's value is through work hours saved. Tasks that once took over 13 hours can now be completed in just a few, freeing up nearly 10 hours per task to reinvest elsewhere. Multiply that across clients, and the impact on margins and capacity becomes substantial.

As Steve Bowman, Business Partner at Model Technology Solutions, noted, "When we started, it was four or five months before I'd have somebody doing an assessment on their own. Now it's down to one month." This dramatic improvement in ramp-up time underscores the transformative effect automation can have ...
