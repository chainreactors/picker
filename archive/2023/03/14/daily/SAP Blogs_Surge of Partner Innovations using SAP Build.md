Since the announcement of [SAP Build](https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/low-code.html) during SAP TechEd in November 2022, there has been considerable interest in the SAP ecosystem to explore SAP’s uniquely powerful low-code solution, SAP Build, that puts world-class enterprise technology in the hands of business users. SAP Build helps to "build visually", "integrate seamlessly," and "collaborate securely", which are the new hallmarks of creating enterprise applications without code, thereby enhancing business agility.

SAP Partners came together across regions to discover, learn and get their hands-on, to explore and build their own applications using SAP Build solution, during the recently concluded [Hack2Build](https://events.sap.com/hack2build/en/home) events during  February 16-24, 2023.

Hack2Build offered a unique opportunity for SAP Partners to address current business challenges by building a working solution prototype using SAP Build, with the support of SAP.

As part of this event, Partners were encouraged to use the features and capabilities of SAP Build Apps, SAP Build Process Automation and SAP Build Work Zone to develop processes and applications related to industry specific scenario or cross-industry scenario of their choice based on their customer needs and demonstrate a working proof-of-concept of their solution.
