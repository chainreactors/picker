*Sustainable SaaS (SusaaS) sample application*

Inspired by a recent [**partner co-innovation project**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/07/circelligence-by-bcg-innovate-in-the-circular-economy-on-sap-btp/) with **The Boston Consulting Group (BCG)**, this is the first post of a series on building a multitenant Software as a Service (SaaS) application on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) using **CAP** and the **SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Runtime**.

The use of the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) in the Cloud Foundry environment is the scenario's main focus. If you are interested in building Multitenant SaaS applications on SAP BTP using CAP, based on the **SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime**, please check the following [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/05/multitenant-saas-applications-on-btp-using-cap-sap-btp-kyma-runtime/).

In addition to this introduction and overview blog, three more posts on dedicated technical follow-ups are available.

* **[Advanced Version](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/21/multitenant-saas-apps-on-sap-btp-using-cap-tried-and-true-the-advanced-scope/)**

* [**Expert Features**](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/29/multitenant-saas-apps-on-sap-btp-using-cap-tried-and-true-the-expert-scope/)

We highly suggest checking out the ****[GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-multitenant-saas/)**** supplied alongside this article. It includes detailed instructions for setting up the multitenant SaaS sample application described in this post in your personal SAP BTP environment. Please be aware that the *Expert Features* are still **WIP** so the GitHub repository and relevant documentation parts will be further improved. Okay, let’s keep the introduction brief and start right away with some history!

## A tiny history of Software as a Service

In the beginning, the SAP space was formless and empty, and darkness covered everything. So, on the third day SAP created the Business Technology Platform and a place for Cloud development was born.

As a result, developers in prehistoric tribes all over the world began to learn about SAP BTP and the benefits it provides to humanity. The first applications were created in Pangaea's many regions, such as eu10 and ap20. As the new SAP world was discovered by more and more indigenous people, incredible developments like SAP HANA Cloud and SAP Integration Suite were made available.
