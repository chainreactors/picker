## Winner, Name that Ware May 2025

The Ware for May 2025 is a Facebook (now Meta) Portal. I’ll give the prize to opticron for the quick guess, email me for your prize!

I actually considered redacting the audio DSP, but decided to leave it in because it’s an interesting detail. Despite having a big burly SoC with multiple cores and a GPU, the designers still opted to integrate a dedicated chip for audio DSP. I guess silicon has gotten cheap, and good software engineers have only gotten more expensive.

I’ll also give an honorable mention to Azeta for doing a great “spirit of the competition” analysis. Thanks for the contribution!

   Just fwiw these are particularly good pieces of hardware; I’ve bought a few so my not-so-young parents far across the planet have a super-easy-to-use & reliable video chat system – the video quality (pans and zooms, tracking people around the room using a fixed fisheye and software) is great and the audio quality is excellent. Whoever engineered this product did a fine job IMO; it’s been very reliable, does exactly what it says on the tin without problems, and the a/v quality is fine. Solid AF.
