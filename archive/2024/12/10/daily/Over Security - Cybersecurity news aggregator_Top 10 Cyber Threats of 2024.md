## Introduction

The aim of this blog is to highlight the 2024 global cybersecurity
trends that defenders can study to prepare themselves for the threats of 2025. The Top 10 Cyber Threats of 2024 had several interesting themes,
such as aggressive cyber espionage campaigns from Russia and China, new cases
of state-sponsored cybercrime from Iran and North Korea, ground breaking ransomware attacks, and multiple disruption events that were notable.

## #1 The Snowflake Campaign

This year, Snowflake was the center of a historic [data
breach campaign](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/mandiant-hackers-snowflake-stole-significant-volume-data-customers/). Snowflake is a cloud-hosted service that allows companies
to store huge datasets. In May, up to 165 customers had their databases accessed and stolen using valid login
credentials. In June, the stolen data was offered on the
English-speaking cybercrime community known as BreachForums, which was [resurrected](https://intel471.com/blog/breachforums-saga-continues-whats-next)
following a [takedown](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/breachforums-seized-one-worlds-largest-hacking-forums-taken-down-fbi-again)
by the FBI earlier in the year. The aftermath of the Snowflake campaign has been staggering. The publicly known impact includes 110 million [AT&T](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/)
customers, 30 million [Santander](https://www.santander.com/en/stories/statement)
customers, 560 million [Ticketmaster](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1335258/000133525824000081/lyv-20240520.htm?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343)
customers, 380 million [Advance
Auto Parts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/advance-auto-parts-stolen-data-for-sale-after-snowflake-attack/) customers, and 190 million [LendingTree](https://www.wired.com/story/snowflake-breach-advanced-auto-parts-lendingtree/)
customers.

Snowflake’s own investigation [disclosed](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Communication-ID-0108977-Additional-Information)
that the breaches were part of a targeted effort directed at users with
single-factor authentication. The cybercriminals used leaked credentials obtained through [infostealing
malware](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/snowflake-customer-passwords-found-online-infostealing-malware/). Ruling out whether the attack was caused by
compromised credentials of current or former Snowflake employees or a vulnerability
in the product.

There is some good news though. The cybercriminals behind the attack have been caught. In November, the US authorities [charged](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25288984-1-moucka_connor_indictment)
Connor Moucka and John Binns for the Snowflake campaign.

## #2 The Scourge of Ransomware

Ransomware persisted as a perennial threat to organizations
worldwide for yet another year and likely many more to come. However, in
February, pharmacies across the US ran into issues filling prescriptions due to an [ALPHV/BlackCat
ransomware attack](https://therecord.media/prescriptions-nationwide-impacted-by-change-healthcare-incident) affecting a multibillion-dollar healthcare conglomerate
called Change Health, which is involved in processing half of all medical
claims in the US.

The aftermath of this incident was massive. There were up to [100
million people impacted](https://therecord.media/change-healthcare-100-million-impacted-ransomware-attack) and the company unfortunately decided to pay an eye watering [22
million USD ransom](https://therecord.media/unitedhealth-ceo-testifies-senate-hearing). But what made this incident one of the worst of the
year was that as of July, the [cost
of the ransomware attack](https://www.secureworld.io/industry-news/unitedhealth-change-healthcare-attack-costs) to Change Health was between 2.3 billion USD and
2.45 billion USD – one of the highest amounts in history for an attack of any
kind against a single organization.

Plus, the record for the highest ever ransom payment was also
broken this year. The Dark Angels ransomware gang was reportedly paid a
mind-blowing [75
million USD ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dark-angels-ransomware-receives-record-breaking-75-million-ransom/). Bloomberg [reported](https://archive.ph/LOLoG#selection-1701.116-1701.142) that
the company that allegedly paid this astronomical ransom was Cencora, a US
pharmaceutical company — that made 262 billion USD in revenue in 2023.

## **#3 The Scattered Spider Problem Persists**

[Scattered
Spider](https://www.sans.org/blog/defending-against-scattered-spider-and-the-com-with-cybercrime-intelligence/) is one of largest English-speaking cybercriminal threat groups, whose
structure is more like a community rather than a few individuals working closely
together. Since around 2022, attacks linked to Scattered Spider have
increasingly grown in notoriety, from Twilio to Reddit to Coinbase, and
eventually MGM and Caesars in late 2023. This year, however, Scattered Spider
continued their attacks, but several members were caught and arrested.

In September, Transport for London (TfL) [disclosed](https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/cyber-security-incident) that
it experienced a [cyberattack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqn7xng7lpo)
on its systems [impacting
customer data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqg2elkj4o), some payment processing systems, and some of their live data
feeds. This incident gained further headlines due to the massive scale of
recovery operations. TfL had to reset the passwords of [30,000
employees in-person](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tfl-requires-in-person-password-resets-for-30-000-employees-after-hack/) and performed an identity verification check for access
to TfL applications and data.

A 17-year-old from Walsall, UK, was [arrested](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/arrest-made-in-nca-investigation-into-transport-for-london-cyber-attack)
a few days after the attack in connection with the cyberattack on TfL, the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) said. Not long before the TfL attack, a 17-year-old
from Walsall was also [arrested](https://www.westmidlands.police.uk/news/west-midlands/news/news/2024/july/walsall-teenager-arrested-in-joint-west-midlands-police-and-fbi-operation/)
in connection to the attack on MGM, attributed to Scattered Spider. This was
followed by a further five more Scattered Spider members – four from the US and
one from UK – being [charged](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-charges-five-linked-to-scattered-spider-cybercrime-gang/)
by the US Department of Justice. However, the FBI came out in May and stated
that Scattered Spider (also known as The Com) is made up of approximately [1,000
individuals](https://cyberscoop.com/potent-youth-cybercrime-ring-made-up-of-1000-people-fbi-official-says/). So it seems they are unlikely to be going away anytime soon.

## #4 The XZ Utils Backdoor

In March, a malicious backdoor [was found](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/29/malicious_backdoor_xz/)
in the widely used data compression software library XZ ...
