Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a critical vulnerability in the open-source mcp-remote project that could result in the execution of arbitrary operating system (OS) commands.

The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2025-6514**, carries a CVSS score of 9.6 out of 10.0.

"The vulnerability allows attackers to trigger arbitrary OS command execution on the machine running mcp-remote when it initiates a connection to an untrusted MCP server, posing a significant risk to users – a full system compromise," Or Peles, JFrog Vulnerability Research Team Leader, [said](https://jfrog.com/blog/2025-6514-critical-mcp-remote-rce-vulnerability/).

[Mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) is a tool that sprang forth following Anthropic's release of Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-source framework that standardizes the way large language model (LLM) applications integrate and share data with external data sources and services.

It acts as a local proxy, enabling [MCP clients](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/guides/test-remote-mcp-server/#connect-your-remote-mcp-server-to-claude-desktop-via-a-local-proxy) like Claude Desktop to [communicate](https://huggingface.co/blog/lynn-mikami/remote-mcp-cloudflare) with remote MCP servers, as opposed to running them locally on the same machine as the LLM application. The npm package has been [downloaded](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=mcp-remote) more than 437,000 times to date.

The vulnerability affects mcp-remote versions from 0.0.5 to 0.1.15. It has been addressed in version 0.1.16 released on June 17, 2025. Anyone using mcp-remote that connects to an untrusted or insecure MCP server using an affected version is at risk.

"While previously published research has demonstrated risks from MCP clients connecting to malicious MCP servers, this is the first time that full remote code execution is achieved in a real-world scenario on the client operating system when connecting to an untrusted remote MCP server," Peles said.

The shortcoming has to do with how a malicious MCP server operated by a threat actor could embed a command during the initial communication establishment and authorization phase, which, when processed by mcp-remote, causes it to be executed on the underlying operating system.

While the issue leads to arbitrary OS command execution on Windows with full parameter control, it results in the execution of arbitrary executables with limited parameter control on macOS and Linux systems.

To mitigate the risk posed by the flaw, users are advised to update the library to the latest version and only connect to trusted MCP servers over HTTPS.

"While remote MCP servers are highly effective tools for expanding AI capabilities in managed environments, facilitating rapid iteration of code, and helping ensure more reliable delivery of software, MCP users need to be mindful of only connecting to trusted MCP servers using secure connection methods such as HTTPS," Peles said.

"Otherwise, vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-6514 are likely to hijack MCP clients in the ever-growing MCP ecosystem."

The disclosure comes after Oligo Security [detailed](https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/critical-vulnerability-in-anthropics.html) a critical vulnerability in the MCP Inspector tool (CVE-2025-49596, CVSS score: 9.4) that could pave the way for remote code execution.

Tenable, which also discovered and reported CVE-2025-49596, said the flaw has to do with the fact that the interactive web user interface (UI) launched by MCP Inspector via localhost to communicate with servers lacks any authentication out-of-the-box.

This enables an attacker on the same network as the proxy instance to inject malicious commands into it, a scenario called NeighborJacking, or trick a victim into visiting a malicious web page, which embeds JavaScript code that can deceive the proxy component into executing arbitrary code through a cross-site attack.

The vulnerabilities lay bare the hidden risks lurking in what has been [described](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/faqs) as an "USB-C" or a universal adapter for AI application, becoming the backbone infrastructure for connecting apps to different data and tools.

"It's crucial to enforce security fundamentals in server development and tool usage," security researcher Rémy Marot [said](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-tenable-research-discovered-a-critical-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-on-anthropic). "Adhering to basic security practices can significantly mitigate risks from vulnerabilities in novel systems and prevent devastating attacks."
