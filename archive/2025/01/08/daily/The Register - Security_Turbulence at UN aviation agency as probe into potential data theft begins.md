The United Nations' aviation agency is investigating "a potential information security incident" after a cybercriminal claimed they had laid hands on 42,000 of the branch's documents.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said in a limited statement on Monday that the suspected incident could be linked to "a threat actor known for targeting international organizations."

"We take this matter very seriously and have implemented immediate security measures while conducting a comprehensive investigation," it added.
