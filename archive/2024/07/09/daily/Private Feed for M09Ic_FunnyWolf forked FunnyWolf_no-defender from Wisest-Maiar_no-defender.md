## How it works

There's a WSC (Windows Security Center) service in Windows which is used by antiviruses to let Windows know that there's some other antivirus in the hood and it should disable Windows Defender.
This WSC API is undocumented and furthermore requires people to sign an NDA with Microsoft to get its documentation, so I decided to take an interesting approach for such a thing and used an already existing antivirus called Avast. This AV engine includes a so-called `wsc_proxy.exe` service, which essentially sets up the WSC API for Avast.
With a little bit of reverse engineering, I turned this service into a service...
