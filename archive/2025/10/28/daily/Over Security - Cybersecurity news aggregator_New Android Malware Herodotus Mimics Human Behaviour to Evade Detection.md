## New Android Malware Herodotus Mimics Human Behaviour to Evade Detection

### Jump to

During our usual monitoring activity of malicious distribution points, Mobile Threat Intelligence service observed unknown malicious samples distributed next to well-known malware variants like [Hook](/blogs/hook-a-new-ermac-fork-with-rat-capabilities) and [Octo](/blogs/octo2-european-banks-already-under-attack-by-new-malware-variant). Despite the shared distribution infrastructure, these samples turned out to be closer to a different malware family previously discovered by ThreatFabric analysts – [Brokewell](/blogs/brokewell-do-not-go-broke-by-new-banking-malware). Nevertheless, the newly discovered malware, named Herodotus by its developers, does not seem to be a direct evolution of Brokewell, but a new threat with parts of Brokewell stitched together with original parts.

In this report we uncover the new threat on mobile threat landscape with several key takeaways:

* Herodotus is designed to perform Device-Takeover while making first attempts to **mimic human behaviour** and bypass behaviour biometrics detection.
* Active campaigns observed in **Italy** and **Brazil**, involving **Device-Takeover attacks** by Herodotus.
* Malware-as-a-Service is already announced while the malware is still in development.
* Links to Brokewell show further potential for capabilities enrichment.

## Herodotus: writing Histories of fraud

Being a modern Device-Takeover banking Trojan, Herodotus follows latest trends and regular Modus Operandi. The actor behind this threat ("K1R0") already announced it as Malware-as-a-Service on one of the underground forums:

![announcement](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/announcement.png?width=859&height=800&name=announcement.png)

Distribution is done via side-loading, potentially involving SMiShing leading to the malicious link that contains the dropper to be downloaded.

The dropper used by Herodotus is written by the same developer and has only been seen distributing Herodotus so far. Once launched, dropper attempts to install the payload in order to bypass Android 13+ restrictions on Accessibility Services.

![dropper](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/dropper.png?width=315&height=700&name=dropper.png)

After the installation of the payload, the dropper automatically starts Herodotus payload. It is further opening the Accessibility Service settings page, urging the victim to enable it. Once enabled, Herodotus launches a “block overlay”, mimicking a loading screen to hide the suspicious activity of granting all the necessary permissions.

Following that, Herodotus is ready to perform credential stealing and further Device-Takeover fraud. The Trojan collects the list of installed packages and sends it to the C2, which returns the list of those to target and the corresponding links to load overlays from. From this moment, Herodotus is waiting for the victim to open a targeted application, which will be overlayed with a fake screen requesting credentials from the account.

Till this point there is little special about Herodotus - there are multiple banking Trojans currently active on the threat landscape following the same approach, and Herodotus is following the trends here. However, there is a feature that sets Herodotus apart from most of the Device-Takeover malware families - it attempts to mimic human behaviour during the remote-control session.

### Humanising fraud

Remote control features are essential for a modern banking Trojan, especially for Malware-as-a-Service families. Herodotus has remote control features abusing Accessibility Service – using it to perform actions on the remote device. From the very beginning of its history, Herodotus provides its operators with the ability to:

* Click element on the screen
* Click by coordinates
* Perform swipes
* Input text
* Perform global actions (Back, Home, Recents)

Operators are using these features to remotely control the infected device - opening targeted applications, clicking through screens, filling in the transaction details to transfer money from victim's account.

For the text input, there are different options for criminals during the remote session. They could interact with device's keyboard, typing in mule account details. However, this approach is vulnerable to typos/misclicks due to multiple reasons: poor remote session connection, misalignment of elements on the screen of operator, human error. That is why MTI observes banking Trojans providing operators with option to directly "set" the text input field, in other words - deliver specified text to the field of choice without the necessity to use device's keyboard. It is achieved either by performing action "ACTION\_SET\_TEXT" or via clipboard - first setting clipboard and then pasting the text in the text field. This approach ensures that the right text is delivered to the right text input field in one action and without any interruptions.

However, from the application's perspective, the user behaviour can look suspicious and machine-like, raising the question of whether there is a real user interacting with the application and entering the data. These sort of events should be detected by behaviour-based anti-fraud engines and marked as possible indicators of a Device-Takeover attack.

Herodotus, unlike many other banking Trojans, is one of the first to attempt to humanise remote actions. In order to make the input look like it is typed in by an actual user,  the text specified by the operator is split into chars, and they are separately set with random delays from each other:

![randomizing_delays](https://www.threatfabric.com/hs-fs/hubfs/randomizing_delays.png?width=854&height=604&name=randomizing_delays.png)

*Randomization of delay between set text events*

Delay specified is in range of **300 – 3000 milliseconds (0,3 - 3 seconds)**. Such a randomisation of delay between text input events does align with how a user would input text. By consciously delaying the input by random intervals, actors are likely trying to avoid being detected by behaviour-only anti-fraud solutions spotting machine-like speed of text input

We have seen examples where developers were pausing the execution of automated actions in order to wait for the UI to be updated (especially on old devices being slow in loading UI), however, there were no random delays as there is no necessity in randomness. Thus, with high confidence we suspect that such a delay is an attempt to mimic human behaviour while automating the input of the text.
