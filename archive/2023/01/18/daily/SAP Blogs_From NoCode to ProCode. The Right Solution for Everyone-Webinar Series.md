The No Code/Low Code concept is gaining more and more attention. This is also driven by the shortage of enough technical professionals. Most people think about apps and front-end development when speaking about this concept, but it doesn’t stop there. It is something that can be used more generally. On Example ist he Machine Learning area, since we don’t always need a tailor-made algorithm. For a lot of standard cases, we can use proven methods which can be provided via a No Code/Low Code framework. This way business users with strong interest in statistics get enabled to solve standard problems themselves.

For me, it is not No Code/Low Code or pro Code. In my opinion, the best option is to offer and combine both, so you get the best of both worlds: a framework to enable and engage the business user and full flexibility for the Pro Coders when necessary. In both cases it is important to involve the business user early on, since they are the ones who should use the solution in the end. So, we should make sure to fulfill their requirements and help them to understand and gain trust in the it. Furthermore, it is important to integrate the machine learning model in the business processes to make seamless usage possible.

Did that get you interested? Then join our Webinar series “From NoCode to ProCode

“The Right  Solution for Everyone” Europe from February 9th until March 23rd; each session starts at 10 EST or 16 pm CET. In this series, my colleagues manuel.namyslo, yannick\_schaper, and I will talk about the SAP Machine Learning Solutions from No Code/Low Code to Pro code and in each session, we will talk about how to integrate the models into the business world.
