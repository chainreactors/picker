# Weekly Update 469

13 September 2025

So I had this idea around training a text-to-speech engine with my voice, then using that to speak over the Sonos at home to announce AI-driven events, such as people ringing the doorbell. A few hours' worth of video from these weekly updates fed into [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/?ref=troyhunt.com) and wammo! Here you go:

> Oh yeah! Now \*this\* is cool! Or freaky ðŸ¤” Doorbell by [@Ubiquiti](https://twitter.com/Ubiquiti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=troyhunt.com), voice by [@elevenlabsio](https://twitter.com/elevenlabsio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=troyhunt.com) and orchestration by [@home\_assistant](https://twitter.com/home_assistant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref=troyhunt.com). Itâ€™s an evolution of this post: [https://t.co/qwN64UJqWy](https://t.co/qwN64UJqWy?ref=troyhunt.com) [pic.twitter.com/dMrD9hPT4J](https://t.co/dMrD9hPT4J?ref=troyhunt.com)

As an unexpected bonus, it's totally freaking the family out ðŸ¤£ But it does make you think about both the potential for good and for abuse. The latter is kinda mind-boggling when you get to thinking more about it...
