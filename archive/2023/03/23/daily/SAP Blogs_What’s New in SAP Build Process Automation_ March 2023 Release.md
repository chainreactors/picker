### **Adding Timed Wait to a Process**

From minutes to months, you can now add a timed wait step to a process to control how long the process should wait or pause before continuing. For example, suppose an employee needs to complete a mandatory training session before starting their job. In that case, HR administrators can add a timed wait to the onboarding process that waits until the training session is completed before moving on to the next task. Learn more in [Add a Timed Wait to a Process](https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCTS/b078c7aa93ed4fc391e3323b7a255b84/a003cb03d9df4209bb055541b6c143a7.html?locale=en-US&version=Cloud).

For forms, the default Submit button can now be changed to **Next**, **Send,** or **Custom** text. For approval forms, you can adapt the default Approve button to **Accept** or **Custom** text and the default **Reject** button to **Decline** or **Custom** text.

### **Filter Entries in Forms**

Selecting an entry in a form field with many possible entries is now easier! In a form, you can filter the records loaded in the dropdown by simply typing into the field. A filter field appears If there are more than 12 values in the dropdown list. You no longer need to search for the entry manually. For instance, when managing customer material information, selecting a customer number is necessary, and this new feature simplifies the process.
