## Cyberattack halts Royal Mail’s overseas post

January 12, 2023

[Mark Stockley](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/author/mstockleymalwarebytes-com/)

If you’re looking to send letters or parcels outside of the UK using Royal Mail, you’ll want to hold off for a little while. Royal Mail is suffering from “[severe disruption](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/11/royal-mail-services-suffer-severe-disruption-after-cyber-incident)” after an unnamed cyber incident.

While no specifics are currently available, Royal Mail has disclosed enough to let us know that the [disruption is very bad indeed](https://twitter.com/RoyalMail/status/1613208820456558600).

The [statement reads as follows](https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12556/~/service-update):

> “We are temporarily unable to despatch items to overseas destinations. We strongly recommend that you temporarily hold any export mail items while we work to resolve the issue. Items that have already been despatched may be subject to delays. We would like to sincerely apologise to impacted customers for any disruption this incident is causing.
>
> Our import operations continue to perform a full service, with some minor delays. Parcelforce Worldwide export services are still operating to all international destinations though customers should expect delays of one to two days.”

## Hunting for clues

The attack is [being investigated by third parties](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/royal-mail-halts-international-services-after-cyberattack/), but there’s no word currently with regard to how quickly the services will be back online. Royal Mail has told Bleeping Computer that domestic deliveries are unaffected, so for now people will just have to steer clear of anything overseas bound. This is of course a big problem for people selling items online, or simply sending items to friends and relatives.

Potentially more costly alternative solutions may have to be found until Royal Mail can get its services back up and running.

We will update this blog as more details are released.

## Updated to add new information about LockBit Ransomware

More news broke overnight, pinning the blame for this one firmly in the direction of [LockBit ransomware being responsible for the Royal Mail incident](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/royal-mail-cyberattack-linked-to-lockbit-ransomware-operation/). LockBit, [often found in our write ups and summaries](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/threat-intelligence/2022/07/ransomware-review-june-2022%23lockbit), is one of the emerging stars in notorious ransomware compromise land. Some claim [LockBit has ties to Russia](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-linked-group-behind-uk-royal-mail-cyber-attack-says-telegraph-2023-01-12/), while the group itself claims to be based in The Netherlands. No self respecting ransomware group is going to confirm their real location, but for the time being anything related to point of origin is tied up in a fair amount of speculation. Speaking of speculation…

## LockBit: Sorry, it wasn’t us

While the “public facing support” of the LockBit gang is [denying responsibility for the attack](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1613817916457115648), this claim feels rather tenuous as [some researchers have pointed out](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam/status/1613820103606296577).

If, somehow, the LockBit group is not behind the attack then at the very least, someone is using the LockBit gang encryptors like (for example) an affiliate. The links supplied via the ransom note link back to several “official” LockBit URLs such as customer support / negotiation, and data leak portal.

This would strongly suggest the LockBit group is behind it, yet they claim otherwise.

Is it more realistic tha...
