# Best Open Source HIDS Tools for Linux in 2025 (Compared & Ranked)

With more businesses running Linux in production‚Äîwhether in bare metal, VMs, or containers‚Äîthe need for visibility at the host level has never been more urgent.

![Best Open Source HIDS Tools for Linux in 2025 (Compared & Ranked)](https://www.darknet.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Best-Open-Source-HIDS-Tools-for-Linux-in-2025-Compared-Ranked-640x427.jpg)

While EDR and XDR platforms dominate enterprise mindshare, **open-source Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)** remain essential in real-world deployments, especially where cost, auditability, or customizability matter.

This post breaks down the **5 best OSS HIDS tools for Linux in 2025**, based on:

* Actual deployment maturity
* Active development
* Breadth of detection (file, process, behaviour, kernel)
* Container/K8s awareness
* Resource usage and signal-to-noise ratio

---

## Why HIDS Still Matters in 2025

Host-level detection is often your last line of defence when:

* Network monitoring is blocked or evaded
* Logs are tampered with or missing
* The threat is insider-driven or lateral movement is already in progress
* Cloud providers only offer limited telemetry (e.g. EC2/VM metadata, not syscall data)

HIDS is also increasingly used in:

* Compliance frameworks (e.g. PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001)
* Linux-based SOC pipelines
* Container and edge security deployments

## Top 5 Open Source HIDS Tools in 2025

Here‚Äôs the current landscape based on GitHub activity, community usage, and known deployments in production.

### ü•á 1. **Wazuh** ‚Äì Best Overall OSS HIDS (for compliance-heavy environments)

**GitHub**: [wazuh/wazuh](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh)
**License**: GPLv2
**Latest Release**: v4.7.3 (May 2025)

‚úÖ Integrated file integrity monitoring (FIM), log analysis, rootkit detection
‚úÖ Powerful rules engine + active response
‚úÖ Web UI + Elastic Stack support
‚úÖ Kubernetes-aware with container runtime events
‚úÖ Built-in PCI/GDPR/HIPAA policy checks

**Use If**: You need audit-ready compliance tooling and scalable enterprise deployments.

### ü•à 2. **Elkeid** ‚Äì Most Scalable for Cloud-Native Infra

**GitHub**: [bytedance/Elkeid](https://github.com/bytedance/Elkeid)
**License**: Apache 2.0
**Latest Release**: v1.10.2 (March 2025)

‚úÖ Built by ByteDance for massive-scale eBPF-based host telemetry
‚úÖ Kafka-backed detector pipeline
‚úÖ Plugin-based rule engine in Go/Lua
‚úÖ Container-native with eBPF and netlink-based visibility
‚úÖ Highly performant on modern Linux kernels

**Use If**: You want cloud-scale HIDS for containerised workloads and distributed infra.

### ü•â 3. **Falco** ‚Äì Best for Runtime Container Threat Detection

**GitHub**: [falcosecurity/falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco)
**License**: Apache 2.0
**Latest Release**: v0.40.0 (Feb 2025)

‚úÖ CNCF sandbox project
‚úÖ Real-time syscall monitoring via eBPF
‚úÖ Built-in rules for K8s-specific threats (e.g., shell in container, modified binaries)
‚úÖ Lightweight and fast, can export to Prometheus/SIEMs
‚úÖ Plugins for CRI-O, containerd, pod security policies

**Use If**: You want a fast, container-native runtime detection engine.

---

### 4. **OSSEC** ‚Äì Classic, Still Functional, But Aging

**GitHub**: [ossec/ossec-hids](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids)
**License**: GPLv3
**Latest Release**: v3.7.0 (2023)

‚úÖ Log-based detection with decent FIM support
‚úÖ Syslog integration, rule tuning possible
‚úÖ Stable and works in legacy environments
‚úÖ Minimal resource usage

‚ö†Ô∏è Lacks native support for modern workloads, no container awareness
‚ö†Ô∏è Less active development compared to Wazuh or Elkeid

**Use If**: You need a low-footprint HIDS for legacy, static, or resource-constrained systems.

### 5. **AuditD + AIDE** ‚Äì Custom Lightweight Stack for DIY Ops

**GitHub**:

* [linux-audit/audit-userspace](https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-userspace)
* [aide/aide](https://github.com/aide/aide)

‚úÖ Extremely lightweight
‚úÖ Works well on hardened systems and low-resource devices
‚úÖ Used in high-assurance environments (NSA/CIS benchmarks)

‚ö†Ô∏è Not a turnkey HIDS solution‚Äîrequires configuration, scripting, and log management
‚ö†Ô∏è No alerting, dashboard, or enrichment without building a pipeline

**Use If**: You want complete control over what gets monitored, logged, and how it gets handled.

## Final Thoughts

In 2025, **open-source HIDS tools are alive and thriving**, especially for teams that care about auditability, cloud-native visibility, or budget-conscious deployments.

* Use **Wazuh** for full-featured compliance and enterprise security.
* Choose **Elkeid** if you‚Äôre running multi-region cloud Linux workloads.
* Add **Falco** to any container pipeline where runtime visibility matters.
* Keep **OSSEC** or **AuditD** around for legacy or hardened static workloads.

The best part? These tools are free, actively maintained, and battle-tested‚Äîoften outperforming their commercial counterparts in transparency and flexibility.
