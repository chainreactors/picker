There's a tiny bit of tech and infosec drama unfolding in the forums of password management app KeePass; in a [topic](https://sourceforge.net/p/keepass/discussion/329220/thread/a146e5cf6b/) related to a supposed bug that was recently assigned a vulnerability identifier of [CVE-2023-24055](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24055).

The bug was reported several times over the past year, and security researchers claim that an attacker with access to a user's system can easily obtain cleartext versions for all passwords stored in a KeePass app by modifying a line in the app's XML config file.

The modification is what KeePass calls a [trigger](https://keepass.info/help/v2/triggers.html), in this case, a trigger to export the app's database in a cleartext format like CSV or HTML.

The supposed bug impacts all versions of the KeePass app, and the controversy comes from the KeePass team's refusal to acknowledge it as a security flaw, let alone fix it.

KeePass devs go by the old adage that if a threat actor has control over your system, it's not your system anymore.

On the other side of the argument, security researchers claim this is a vulnerability because no input (such as entering the master password) is required from the KeePass owner to export the passwords, which should not be possible even in situations when a threat actor gains access to a device.

There are certainly arguments on both sides of the discussion to be had here, but we're leaning towards siding with the security researchers. Password managers should not have a built-in system that dumps all your passwords butt-naked in a file without you having to enter your master password first.

But for KeePass users, things are about to get a hell lot worse in the coming weeks, as [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2023-24055_PoC) code to exploit this issue was published last week on GitHub and will most likely make its way into all your run-of-the-mill infostealers and remote access trojans by the end of the year.

### **Breaches and hacks**

**Blockchain Bandit update:** After six years of inactivity, the threat actor known as the Blockchain Bandit has begun moving $90 million worth of stolen cryptocurrency funds. The Blockchain Bandit is a famous hacker who used a technique called Ethercombing to steal more than 51,000 Ether coins and 470 Bitcoin from more than 10,000 users between 2015 and 2016. [Ethercombing](https://www.ise.io/casestudies/ethercombing/) refers to a technique of reverse-engineering weak public and private key combinations and then emptying out cryptocurrency accounts that used them. Years after the last heists, blockchain analysis company Chainalysis says the stolen funds were [moved](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/blockchain-bandit-2023/) to new addresses. The funds have not been laundered yet.

### **General tech and privacy**

**Incognito session protections on Chrome:** Google has added a [new feature](https://blog.google/products/chrome/5-tips-to-stay-safer-online-with-chrome/) to its Chrome web browser that lets users lock their incognito browser sessions using biometric authentication. Once enabled, this feature will require a fingerprint or face scan before allowing the user to access their previous Chrome incognito browsing sessions.

> To enable it, go to Chrome **Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → Turn ON "**Lock incognito tabs when you close Chrome**."

**GitHub milestone:** Microsoft-owned GitHub [announced](https://github.blog/2023-01-25-100-million-developers-and-counting/) last week that it passed an important milestone, surpassing 100 million registered users.

### **Government, politics, and policy**

**Russia blocks access to CIA, FBI, and RfJ sites:** The Russian government has blocked access inside the country's borders to the websites of the CIA, FBI, and the US State Department's Rewards for Justice program. Russian officials with Roskomnadzor, the country's internet watchdog, [told Interfax](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/883583) they blocked access to the websites for "spreading fakes about the Russian military and discrediting them." However, the timing of this decision is odd and telling, as it came hours after the State Department offered a [$10 million reward](https://archive.ph/uP10p) for information on the Hive ransomware gang and its possible ties to a foreign government.

**Singapore tackles SMS scam:** Singapore telcos will label SMS messages from organizations that have not registered with the local government's IMDA authority as "likely scam" starting February 1 this week. The Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) was established last year, and registration started last November. Organizations that want to send SMS messages to Singapore residents must register in the IMDA's SSIR database, or they'll have their messages labeled "likely scam" and potentially blocked. The [government says](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/smses-from-organisations-not-registered-with-imda-to-be-labelled-likely-scam-from-jan-31) that roughly 1,200 organizations have signed up for the SSIR so far.

**FCC threatens Twilio:** The US Federal Communications Commission has threatened to disconnect Twilio from the US telecommunications network if the company does not take proactive steps to block robocalls originating from its systems. In a [cease-and-desist letter](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-issues-robocall-cease-and-desist-letter-twilio) sent to Twilio last week, the FCC said that its service had been abused by a company named PhoneBurner as part of a major mortgage scam targeting US homeowners. The FCC has given Twilio two weeks to take action against robocallers abusing its service.

**AFP warning for parents:** The Australian Police Force is [warning](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/afp-urges-parents-and-carers-be-vigilant-about-online-gaming) parents and caretakers that online predators may abuse online chat features found inside online and mobile games to contact children. The AFP warns that predators may use the chat feature to request sexually explicit images or to meet with children. The AFP recommends that parents check on their children and who they are talking to online and look into disabling any chat or direct messaging functionality; if the game includes such a feature. The AFP also issued a [second security advisory](https://www.afp.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/parental-privacy-prep-prevents-predators), urging parents to see if any ...
