# Titles: Microsoft Brokering File System Windows 11 Version 22H2 - Elevation of Privilege
# Author: nu11secur1ty
# Date: 07/09/2025
# Vendor: Microsoft
# Software: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11?r=1
# Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control
# CVE-2025-49677

## Description
This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates an interactive SYSTEM shell
exploit for CVE-2025-49677.
It leverages scheduled tasks and a looping batch script running as SYSTEM
to execute arbitrary commands
with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges and interactively returns command
output.

# [Reference](
https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-49677)

## Usage

1. Run the Python script as Administrator on the vulnerable Windows machine.
2. The script creates a scheduled task that runs a batch script as SYSTEM
user.
3. You get an interactive prompt (`SYSTEM>`) in your Python console.
4. Type any Windows command (e.g. `whoami`, `dir`, `net user`) and see the
SYSTEM-level output.
5. Type `exit` to quit and clean up all temporary files and scheduled tasks.

## Files

- `PoC.py`: Python script implementing the exploit and interactive shell.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on Windows.
- Run the script with Administrator privileges.
- The script uses built-in Windows commands (schtasks, cmd.exe, timeout).

## Disclaimer

Use this PoC only in authorized environments for testing and research
purposes.
Disclosure responsibly. The author and nu11secur1ty are not responsible for
misuse.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
