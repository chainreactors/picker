**Kristin Del Rosso:**

And this is an area I've spent a lot of time on. Really, it's like a random rabbit hole. But how it started was I was threat hunting and I came across a vulnerability that was listed on the CNBC. So a database in China, but there was zero record of it in any US vulnerability databases. And so I was like, okay, well, what does it do? Who's it targeting? But also, is there any other vulnerability? Like how many other ones are out there that they are aware of that we are not aware of?

And it turns out there's a lot of vulnerabilities missing. And on top of that, they have a history of altering data and using high value cves for their own purposes. And so I think it's a gap that's really necessary to close. And they also made my slides really difficult because as I was trying to finish it, they were like deleting web pages and I was trying to get screenshots in. So like if I wasn't making the slide deck, I wouldn't have seen them doing this.

So how I want to work through this agenda is starting with just some key players in the vulnerability space. You know who they are. We know a few of them and it's the data I was using for my analysis.

**Kristin Del Rosso:**
Then I want to jump into the vulnerability that kind of kickstarted this whole investigation and who it's targeting and what we found. And then after that, I think it takes it makes sense to if you just take a step back to understand the context of the history of China's and their government's involvement in the vulnerability space, they're so how they source them, how they deal with the people who are submitting them and how the manipulations are gone for several years.

And then after that, there's a project that a friend and I who couldn't be here today. We've been working on trying to automate this gap analysis. And so I'll go through some of the challenges that we've faced working on automating that as well as what we found.

Okay, So the who's who in the vulnerability space, there's four on here and four of them that I was pulling data from. The two on the left you will probably know of you have the National vulnerability database as well as MITRE CVE project. You know, they are sponsored by the NSA. And then also MITRE's is sponsored by CISA and then DHS. You know us very common. I think everyone in the room knows what they are. Then on the left hand side, the right hand side, you have two in China. And these acronyms are going to get really annoying to say there's the C, N, and NVD, and then the CNVD, and then you also have CVEs.

**Kristin Del Rosso:**
So we're going to have lots of like mouth jumbles in this talk, but the CNNVD, it's run by CNITSEC, which is an arm from the Ministry of State Security in China. And that would essentially be like if we had the CIA running our NVD program. And then you have the China National Vulnerability Database that's managed by like a China cert, which they say they're non-government non profit, kind of questionable, don't really believe that. But people when they talk about Chinese vulnerability databases, they tend to say, oh, the China vulnerability database, like lumping it all in one.

Those two websites are actually very different, run by different people, have drastically different content. Some research was done in 2017, and 2018 that I'll get into later on the CNNVD, but no one's kind of paying attention to CNVD, who I think is like the new troublemaker that people should be paying attention to.

There's two more things I want to point out. If you look at the green numbers at the bottom, those are numbers that I pulled on September 16th. Those are the number of vulnerabilities that have been submitted to each website as of that date. And there's kind of some important things to note here.

On the left in the US, the gap between those two, it's 50 vulnerabilities. If you're going solely by count, the NVD has 99.9% of the vulnerabilities that the CVE website has. But on the Chinese side there is a 91% coverage gap.

**Kristin Del Rosso:**
So it's about 18,000 vulnerabilities missing between those two Chinese vulnerability databases. But then you have a different problem where the CNNVD has about what is it, 12,000 more vulnerabilities than any of our databases. And the CNVD has about 6000 less than any of our databases. So not only is there a gap between the US and the Chinese databases, but internally they're also not syncing.

And that's a third problem where the naming convention. So if you're trying to analyze all the different vulnerabilities, you know, the naming, if they were all named the same way, that would be really useful. But they're not. So these numbering conventions here, they're actually all the same vulnerability. But at least in the US, you know, on the far right, CVE dash the year and then dash whatever the five digits are, we can search by CVV number on the NVD website or on the MITRE CVE website. Same thing.

But if you go to the Chinese websites, the far left, the CNNVD, it's year in the month and then three or four digits, whereas CNVD is year and then five digits. So not only are they kind of obfuscating their naming convention because when the vulnerabilities come in, they're not always chronologically, like in order of what you would expect them to be. And I think I stumbled across like some patterns, but not enough to be conclusive of if I was on the CNVD website, if it started with a four, sometimes like it would not have a CVE mapping, but if it was a five, like it would or like if it was a Microsoft product, the middle number would be a three versus like Oracle would be a four. Like they were some patterns, but then it would kind of break after a little bit.

But so they're obfuscating it in a way which I guess makes sense. But worst part about all of this is if you're on the CNNVD website, you can search their database by CNNVD ID or CVE, but you can't search by the other Chinese format and vice versa. Same for that website. So if I'm on the CNVD website, I can search by CNVD or CVE but not by CNNVD, so they've made it really difficult to kind of close the gap between their own two country databases.

And also the other point I want to make here is if you look at the dates of these are all the same vulnerability, but the official government run Chinese website got it in April, the nonprofit got it in May, and we didn't get it till December. So we are also drastically behind on how quickly we respond to closing these vulnerability gaps. And it's just we have very different systems and we can get into this later, but we don't do the best job with encouraging reporting, trying to like incentivizes it.
