# Toby-Find: Simplifying Command-Line Forensics¬†Tools

[DFIR](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/dfir/), [Forensics](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/forensics/), [Malware](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/malware/), [Memory Analysis](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/memory-analysis/), [Raspberry Pi](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/raspberry-pi/), [Triage](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/category/triage/)

In digital forensics, we often take a **toolbox approach** ‚Äî success hinges on having the right tool for the job. Some tools offer broad functionality, while others are deeply specialized. Distributions like **KALI** and **REMnux** do a fantastic job bundling a wide range of forensic and security tools, but keeping track of what‚Äôs actually installed can be a challenge.

If you‚Äôre using a graphical interface, browsing through available packages is fairly intuitive. But when you‚Äôre living in the terminal ‚Äî as many analysts do ‚Äî that discoverability disappears. There‚Äôs no built-in index of command-line tools or how to invoke them.

The first version of **Toby-Find** was born out of necessity. I teach a Network Forensics course at the university, using a custom VM loaded with tools like Zeek, Tshark, Suricata, and more. I wanted students to have an easy, searchable way to see what CLI tools were available and how to run them ‚Äî without needing to memorize commands or dig through man pages.

Later, when I built **[Toby](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2025/07/20/portable-forensics-with-toby-a-raspberry-pi-toolkit/)** (a forensic-focused Raspberry Pi rig running a customized KALI install), I updated Toby-Find to include the complete CLI toolset geared toward forensics and malware analysis from the KALI ecosystem.

And because I can‚Äôt leave well enough alone, I decided to build a REMnux-compatible version too.

‚∏ª

Once installed, you can launch Toby-Find (via tf, toby-find, or tf-help) from any terminal and instantly search for tools, descriptions, examples, and more.

2. Make the install script executable:

```
cd Toby
chmod +x install.sh
```

3. Run the installer:

```
./install.sh
```

4. Follow the prompt to **choose your environment** (KALI or REMnux)
5. Open a new terminal or run:

```
source ~/.bashrc ¬† # or ~/.zshrc depending on shell
```

üöÄ **Usage**

Whether you‚Äôre working from a custom VM, a rugged Pi, or a hardened REMnux box,¬†**Toby-Find gives you a fast, terminal-friendly way to surface the tools at your disposal**¬†‚Äî without breaking focus. It‚Äôs lightweight, portable, and easy to extend for your own lab or classroom.

You can grab the full installer from¬†[GitHub](https://github.com/dwmetz/Toby), and contributions are always welcome. If you find it helpful ‚Äî or build on it ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear about it.
