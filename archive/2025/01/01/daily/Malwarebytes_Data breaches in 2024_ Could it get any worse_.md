# Data breaches in 2024: Could it get any worse?

Posted: December 31, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

It may sound weird when I say that I would like to remember 2024 as the year of the biggest breaches. That’s mainly because that would mean we’ll never see another year like it.

To support this nomination, I will remind you of several high-profile breaches, some of a size almost beyond imagination, some that really left us worried because of the type of data that was stolen, and a few duds.

## Huge increase in numbers

As we [reported in July](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/07/number-of-data-breach-victims-goes-up-1000), the number of data breach victims went up 1,170% in Q2 2024, compared to Q2 2023 (from 81,958,874 victims to 1,041,312,601).

The huge increase is no big surprise if you look at the size of some of these breaches. Remember these headlines?

5. [Dell notifies customers about data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/05/dell-notifies-customers-about-data-breach) (49 million customers)

4. [“Nearly all” AT&T customers had phone records stolen in new data breach disclosure](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/07/nearly-all-att-customers-had-phone-records-stolen-in-new-data-breach-disclosure) (73 million people).

3. [100 million US citizens officially impacted by Change Healthcare data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/100-million-us-citizens-officially-impacted-by-change-healthcare-data-breach).

2. [Ticketmaster confirms customer data breach](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2024/06/ticketmaster-confirms-customer-data-breach) (560 million customers).

1. [Stolen data from scraping service National Public Data leaked online](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/08/stolen-data-from-scraping-service-national-public-data-leaked-online) (somewhere between 2.9 billion people (unconfirmed) and 272 million unique [social security numbers](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/ssn-on-dark-web)).

The reason why I counted down to the biggest one, is because the first 4 are household names and people will know whether they might be affected since they are customers of the company. But National Public Data is a company that most people had never heard of before they read about the data breach.

The data gathered by National Public Data was “scraped,” meaning it was pulled from various sources and then combined in a large database. This also made it hard to get an exact number of affected people. The initially reported 2.9 billion people seemed a stretch, so we looked into that, and the estimates from our researchers say that it contains 272 million unique social security numbers. That could mean that the majority of US citizens were affected, although numerous people confirmed that it also included information about deceased relatives.

## Sensitive data

Some of the huge breaches we listed contained Social Security Numbers (SSNs) which are a challenging process to [be changed](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/04/how-to-change-your-social-security-number), but other breaches revealed all kinds of [sensitive information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii).

Financial information was leaked by [MoneyGram](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/10/moneygram-confirms-customer-data-breach). [Slim CD](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2024/09/payment-provider-data-breach-expos...
