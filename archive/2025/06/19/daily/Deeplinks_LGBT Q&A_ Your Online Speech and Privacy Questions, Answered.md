This year, like almost all years before, LGBTQ+ Pride month is taking place at a time of burgeoning [anti-LGBTQ+](https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/adl-and-glaad-report-more-350-anti-lgbtq-hate-and-extremism-incidents) violence, harassment, and criticism. Lawmakers and regulators are passing [legislation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/02/ghanas-president-must-refuse-sign-anti-lgbtq-bill) restricting freedom of expression and privacy for LGBTQ+ individuals and fueling offline intolerance. Online platforms are also complicit in this pervasive ecosystem by [censoring pro-LGBTQ+ speech](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/metas-new-content-policy-will-harm-vulnerable-users-if-it-really-valued-free), forcing LGBTQ+ individuals to [self-censor or turn to VPNs](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/vpns-are-not-solution-age-verification-laws) to avoid being profiled, harassed, doxxed, or criminally prosecuted. Unfortunately, [these risks](https://newrepublic.com/article/182865/pride-attacks-proud-boys-lgbtq-violence) look likely to continue, threatening LGBTQ+ individuals and the fight for queer liberation.
