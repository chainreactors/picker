# Exploit Author: Chan Nyein Wai & Thura Moe Myint
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.manageengine.com/products/ad-manager/
# Software Link: https://www.manageengine.com/products/ad-manager/download.html
# Version: Ad Manager Plus Before 7122
# Tested on: Windows
# CVE : CVE-2021-44228
# Github Repo: https://github.com/channyein1337/research/blob/main/Ad-Manager-Plus-Log4j-poc.md

### Description

In the summer of 2022, I have been doing security engagement on Synack
Red Team in the collaboration with my good friend (Thura Moe Myint).
At that time, Log4j was already widespread on the internet. Manage
Engine had already patched the Ad Manager Plus to prevent it from
being affected by the Log4j vulnerability. They had mentioned that
Log4j was not affected by Ad Manager Plus. However, we determined that
the Ad Manager Plus was running on our target and managed to exploit
the Log4j vulnerability.

### Exploitation

First, Let’s make a login request using  proxy.

Inject the following payload in the ```methodToCall``` parameter in
the ```ADSearch.cc``` request.

Then you will get the dns callback with username in your burp collabrator.

### Notes

When we initially reported this vulnerability to Synack, we only
managed to get a DNS callback and our report was marked as LDAP
injection. However, we attempted to gain full RCE on the host but were
not successful. Later, we discovered that Ad Manager Plus was running
on another target, so we tried to get full RCE on that target. We
realized that there was a firewall and an anti-virus running on the
machine, so most of our payloads wouldn't work. After spending a
considerable amount of time , we eventually managed to  bypass the
firewall and anti-virus, and achieve full RCE.

### Conclusion

We had already informed Zoho about the log4j vulnerability, and even
after it was fixed, they decided to reward us with a bonus bounty for
our report.

### Mitigation

Updating to a version of Ad Manager Plus higher than 7122 should
resolve the issue.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/?utm_source=edb&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=www) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional ...
