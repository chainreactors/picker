# Europol warns about counterfeit goods and the criminals behind them

Posted: October 28, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

With the holidays around the bend, many are looking for gifts for their family and friends. And since we somehow decided we want to give more each time, we’re also looking for good deals.

But European law enforcement agency Europol [issued a warning](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/dark-side-of-fake-goods) about buying fake goods. Sure, they are cheaper, but they do come with a dark side.

According to Europol’s report titled “[Uncovering the ecosystem of intellectual property crime](https://www.europol.europa.eu/publications-events/publications/uncovering-ecosystem-of-intellectual-property-crime), ”approximately 86 million fake items were seized in the European Union (EU) in 2022 alone, with an estimated total value exceeding EUR 2 billion (US$ 2.1 billion).

Not only does this ecosystem provide buyers with substandard goods, it also enables crimes like intellectual property ([IP](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/what-is-ip-address)) crime, cybercrime, money laundering, and environmental crime.

Intellectual property is what drives innovation. Criminals don’t come up with new inventions, they just create cheap copies of popular items without regards for safety of the product, working conditions, or environmental regulations. The only thing counterfeiters are innovating are ways to [exploit](https://www.malwarebytes.com/exploits) consumer demand for counterfeit and pirated goods.

The report states:

> “The rise of social media, influencers and online commerce have changed consumers’ behavior, increasing their appetite for IP infringing goods or content, while having a low awareness of risks.”

Criminals fully abuse the social media platform algorithms that reach potential buyers using customized ads that speak to their personal interests and preferences. These are often removed after automated reviews.

So, there is another critical role in advertising counterfeit goods, which are influencers. Through their channels, influencers may direct customers to product listings on online stores that evade security protocols about counterfeit adverts.

By buying counterfeit goods you are also unwittingly enabling cybercriminals that are engaged in fraud, corruption, labor exploitation, environmental crime, money laundering, and cybercrime.

On the other hand, the risks of getting caught and the relatively low penalties make IP crime a low-risk, high-benefit criminal activity.

Consumers, however, are not always aware of the fact they are buying counterfeit goods. As sophisticated technologies are used to replicate holograms, logos, and packaging, unaware consumers are more likely than ever to be deceived, and recognizing counterfeit items has become a task that requires specific knowledge and an expert eye.

## How to avoid counterfeit goods

Nonetheless, there are a few pointers to be given on how to avoid buying counterfeit goods.

* Where possible, buy from the brand’s own store. When that’s not an option look for authorized retailers. Many brands publish lists of authorized sellers on their websites. And some of the larger webstores use “Authenticity Guarantee” badges on their listings.
* When it comes to pricing, follow the old saying: “If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.”
* A legitimate webstore...
