In this blog post, you will find a summary of our recent recommendations that we have published on the SAP Help Portal.

For users of **SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, inbound invoicing option for Brazil** and **SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, outbound invoicing option for Brazil**:

* The OAuth 2.0 Clients configuration fields **Client Authentication** and **Resource Access Authentication** have been updated to avoid connection issues. If your system has connection issues, you need to change the options. For further information, refer to [Configuring the Client Profile](https://help.sap.com/docs/SLH_NFe/71b3b178e5cb4a50a88cf2985a14f17c/f2fa2b09723c4cae97e0fb7b63626821.html?locale=en-US).

For users of the **outbound invoicing option for Brazil**:

* The only messaging system available for SAP S/4HANA Cloud is the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, outbound invoicing option for Brazil. You cannot integrate a third-party messaging system with SAP S/4HANA Cloud to issue the following electronic documents:

  + NF-es (document model 55)

  + NFS-e for cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

* If you want to issue NFS-e for other cities, you can use the Partner Enablement option, which allows you to process electronic documents using your own solution.

* Adobe Forms is recommended to generate PDF files of electronic documents. For further information, refer to [Initial Setup | SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SLH_NFe/71b3b178e5cb4a50a88cf2985a14f17c/bcd60cb0576f41afb1422471485651ad.html?locale=en-US).

For users of the inbound **invoicing option for Brazil**:

* Adobe Forms is required to generate PDF files of the electronic documents using the SAP Document and Reporting Compliance, inbound invoicing option for Brazil. For further information, refer to [Initial Setup | SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_NFe/75478ef83fbe47b6836f33609268796b/81b836755bfd4587bbd5d543ffa870e6.html?locale=en-US).
