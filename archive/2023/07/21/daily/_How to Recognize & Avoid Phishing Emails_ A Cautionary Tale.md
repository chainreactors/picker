![How to Recognize & Avoid Phishing Emails: A Cautionary Tale](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Phishing-Emails-1-820x456.png)

We’ve all received spam and phishing emails — our inboxes are often full of them. They let us know that our package is being delivered (even when we haven’t ordered anything), provide details on our “recent” tax filing (that was completed months ago), and encourage us to act fast and enter our credit card — or risk missing out on limited time special offers and cash prizes..

Unfortunately, victims who unknowingly provide their personal details to fraudsters through phishing emails often face severe repercussions, such as identity theft and fraud. According to [phishing statistics from AAG](https://aag-it.com/the-latest-phishing-statistics/), an estimated **3.4 billion spam emails** are sent every day. Furthermore, over **48% of all emails** sent in 2022 were spam.

Yet even more alarmingly, ProofPoint’s latest [2023 State of the Phish report](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/resources/threat-reports/state-of-phish) revealed some shocking data points users on the receiving end of phishing emails: **44%** of users think an email is safe when it contains familiar branding, while another **63%** of users don’t know that an email link text might not match the website it goes to.

In light of these data points, I thought I’d tell the story of some spam that was delivered into my own inbox and share some steps you can take to recognize (and avoid) phishing emails.

## What is phishing, anyways?

Before we get started, it might make sense to quickly define what phishing is in the first place.

**Phishing is the deceptive practice used to acquire sensitive personal identification information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.** Fraudsters often portray themselves as well-known brands, banks, internet service providers, retail companies, or other services to gain the victim’s trust.

The ultimate goal of a [phishing attack](https://sucuri.net/guides/phishing-attacks/) is to steal sensitive data from an individual — for example, usernames, passwords, credit card details, Social Security Numbers (SSN), bank account details, email addresses, phone numbers, or even answers to secret questions.

## How to spot and identify a phishing email

Knowing how to identify malicious phishing emails is the first step in preventing one of those emails from infecting your device or redirecting you to a landing page designed to steal your data.

Let’s take a look at one such example delivered directly to my email address.

[![Example of a UPS phishing email](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/example-ups-phishing-email.png)](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/example-ups-phishing-email.png)

At first glance, this might seem like a valid email. It leverages a recognizable logo and even applies brand colors to the email template.

However, there are a couple of red flags that help us identify that the email is in fact a bit phishy. Let’s take a look at some telltale signs.

### Signs of a phishing email:

Phishing emails often contain at least one of the following red flags.

1. [Typos in the email content and subject lines](#typos)
2. [Email address uses a different domain or doesn’t match the sender name](#address)
3. [Links don’t match the domain name of the sender](#links)
4. [Email invites you to click on links to update information](#updates)
5. [You find attachments in the email](#attachments)

#### 1 – Typos in the email content and subject lines

Sure, it’s always possible that Marketing is just having a bad hair day when you receive a branded email with a bunch of typos. But more often than not, spelling mishaps and bad grammar are a pretty good tell that the email is not from a reputable sender.

![Typos found in UPS phishing email](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ups-phishing-typo-650x287.png)

In this case, multiple typos, spacing issues, and strange grammar were immediately visible in the subject lines and email body. So, always take a minute to thoroughly read through an email before you begin engaging with it.

#### 2 – Email address uses a different domain or doesn’t match the sender name

Legitimate organizations definitely won’t be...
