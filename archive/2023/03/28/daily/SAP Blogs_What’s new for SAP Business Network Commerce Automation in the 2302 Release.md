What's new for SAP Busines Network Commerce Automation customers in the Q1 2023 release?

The list below is not exhaustive of all the great features released in March 2023, but a few highlights that would be of interest particularly to buyer customers of SAP Business Network Commerce Automation:

**Continuous Test Environment Support for External Invoices ([NG-5332](https://help.sap.com/docs/ariba/978b7e36451a4c2c85321a3ef6f3a7e5/41dba996c4d544a3abd3958a840cee4b.html?parentHref=%2Fwhats-new%2F6a6876bb02204429bfc72cf8b861a866%3FArea%3DSAP%2520Business%2520Network%26Version%3DSAP%2520Ariba%25202302%26locale%3Den-US&parentName=What%27s%20New%20in%20SAP%20Procurement%20and%20SAP%20Business%20Network))**
