The U.S. Secret Service, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of State, is offering a significant reward of up to $10 million for information that leads to the arrest and/or conviction of **Timur Kamilevich Shakhmametov**.

On September 26, 2024, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia publicly announced an unsealed indictment against **Shakhmametov**, a Russian national, who was charged with serious crimes related to the establishment and management of Joker’s Stash. This notorious website was notorious for its focus on the illicit sale of stolen payment card data. According to the U.S. Secret Service, Joker’s Stash operated on a massive scale, making available information from approximately 40 million stolen payment cards each year. Over its operational period, this marketplace emerged as one of the largest carding platforms in history, facilitating the trade of millions of payment card details. Analysts estimate that the profits generated from this criminal enterprise could range from an astounding **$280 million to more than $1 billion**.

**Shakhmametov** faces multiple charges, including one count of conspiracy to commit and aid and abet bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The severity of these charges highlights the extensive impact of his actions on the financial security of individuals and institutions alike.

**Background**
Joker’s Stash opened in 2014 and is one of the oldest ongoing compromised credit card shops on the internet. It has become a notable presence in various illicit cyber schemes, gaining recognition for its significant breaches of credit card information. In the past year, Joker’s Stash has been linked to selling compromised credit card information from point-of-sale transactions at Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, Champagne French Bakery and Cafe, and Wawa Inc.

What sets Joker’s Stash apart from its competitors is the freshness of the cards it offers, which assesses the validity of the card data. They also claim to source their card information through “exclusive self-hacked databases.” Additionally, they are unique in their choice to host their shop on blockchain DNS, and in April 2020, they expanded their operations by adding Tor domains to the shop.

Compromised payment card information available in underground card shops can be classified into two categories:

1. **Dumps:** These are skimmed track details from a physical card, obtained using a skimmer or point-of-sale (POS) malware.

2. **Cards:** This refers to data gathered from intercepted network traffic that can be used for online purchases.

While the reasons for the closure have not been explicitly stated, it is suspected that the administrators decided to shut down the site due to concerns about potential intrusions from federal authorities. A coordinated police operation by the FBI and Interpol resulted in the seizure of multiple servers belonging to Joker’s Stash, which temporarily disrupted the site’s operations. Additionally, the agencies seized four of Joker’s Stash domains, further impacting its ability to function.

  Active since 2014, the Joker's Stash carding platform has been implicated in numerous data breaches, trading and exposing millions of users' financial information on the dark web. The operators of this platform have illegally profited by hundreds of millions of dollars using the stolen information.

  There have been multiple security incidents involving cybercriminals trading stolen credit card data on Joker's Stash. The threat intelligence company Gemini Advisory reported that hackers stored payment card details of Wawa customers on the platform. Wawa confirmed that hackers attempted to sell the card information of customers impacted by a security breach that occurred on December 10, 2019. This breach affected the data of 30 million Americans and over one million individuals from more than 100 other countries.

  A thread on XSS Russian forum discussing Joker Stash

  **Timur Shakhmametov** is accused of operating a notorious cybercriminal marketplace known as Joker’s Stash, which U.S. authorities allege generated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from selling stolen payment card information. Neither Shakhmametov nor his accomplice is currently in U.S. custody, and the State Department is offering a reward of $10 million for information that leads to their arrest or conviction.

  Shakhmametov is alleged to have helped run "carding" websites like Joker’s Stash that sell stolen credit and debit card information. These sites have been linked to financial data stolen from tens of millions of Americans, according to U.S. law enforcement. Additionally, millions of dollars in ransomware payments and darknet drug sales have reportedly flowed through cryptocurrency accounts associated with the services provided by Ivanov, another individual involved in this operation.

  For years, the U.S. government has attempted to persuade Russia to take action against cybercriminals operating from its territory, often with little success.
