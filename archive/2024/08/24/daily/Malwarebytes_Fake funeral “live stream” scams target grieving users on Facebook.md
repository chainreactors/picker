# Fake funeral “live stream” scams target grieving users on Facebook

Posted: August 23, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

Some scammers have the morals of an alley cat. But some sink even lower.

Over the last few months, Malwarebytes Labs has discovered scammers active on Facebook that prey on bereaved people by using stolen images and phony funeral live stream links to steal money and/or credit card details.

These scammers are becoming more active and new cybercriminals are picking up the method as well, which is something we see very often. When some scheme works, more lowlifes join in.

Currently, we are aware of two different approaches. One uses fake live stream links of the funeral. It asks people to follow a link where they can watch the funeral service and to share the link among their friends and family. The other asks for donations on behalf of the family of the deceased.

We followed the flow of one such scam, but you should be aware that there are several variations.

Usually, this type of scam starts with a comment on Facebook below the notification of a funeral home.

![Facebook comment promoting funeral service live](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/1-comment.png)

Comment made to look like an update

> “UPDATE POST:
>
> If you can afford you can donate.
>
> Please share family and friends
>
> Watch [name] Loveing Memory & Funeral ServiceLive Stream Online
>
> WATCH LIVE [link]”

The domain the comment links to is not unique. [Malwarebytes Premium](https://www.malwarebytes.com/premium) blocks at least 4 other domains involved in the same type of scam. And there were more which have been taken offline by the time you read this.

If you follow the link, you’ll end up on a landing page similar to this one.

![Live stream landing page with three buttons leading to the same phishing site](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2-landing_page.png)

All three buttons lead to the same [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing) site

All the buttons on this site pointed to a domain which we block for [phishing](https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing).

*Malwarebytes blocks pbg4jptrk.com*

Adding the domain to the exclusion list allowed me to follow through, and I ended up on a site that wants you to sign up for your “favorite movies” so that I could allegedly get full access. Remember, I came here following links to the live stream of a funeral—not because I wanted to watch my “favorite movies.”

![Watch your favorite movies](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/sign-up.png)

After feeding the scam site a bogus email address, I was allowed to move on.

Membership activation. Credit card details needed.

Here I am invited to activate my membership by providing my credit card details. Why do they need my credit card details for a free service?

This is the reason the site provides:

>
> We have streaming licenses for our content for certain countries only. That’s why we need to verify your geographic location using a valid credit card. Your membe...
