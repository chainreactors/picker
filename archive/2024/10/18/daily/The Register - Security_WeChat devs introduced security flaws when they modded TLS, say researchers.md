Messaging giant WeChat uses a network protocol that the app's developers modified – and by doing so introduced security weaknesses, researchers claim.

WeChat uses MMTLS, a cryptographic protocol heavily based on TLS 1.3. The devs essentially tweaked standard TLS but in turn that left the app with an encryption implementation, which "is inconsistent with the level of cryptography you would expect in an app used by a billion users, such as its use of deterministic IVs and lack of forward secrecy."

That's according to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which carried out a comprehensive review of MMTLS's network security.

It identified MMTLS in previous work, but a more thorough analysis revealed it offers two layers of encryption instead of one as first thought. Plaintext content is wrapped in what's referred to as "business-layer encryption" and the resulting ciphertext is then wrapped in MMTLS encryption, the ciphertext from which would be sent over the WeChat network.

Researchers found that most of the cryptographic security issues were in WeChat'...
