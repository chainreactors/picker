# City of Columbus tries to silence security researcher

Posted: September 3, 2024
 by [Pieter Arntz](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/authors/metallicamvp)

The City of Columbus, Ohio is suing a security researcher for sharing stolen data.

All the [complaint](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25082253-complaint-240829) will accomplish, we imagine, is spotlight the ignorance of certain city officials in handling a common security matter.

What happened is that the City of Columbus was [attacked by a ransomware group](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/columbus-investigates-whether-data-was-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/) on July 18, 2024. Due to the timing, it was at first unclear whether the disruption in the public facing services was caused by the [CrowdStrike incident](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/uncategorized/2024/07/crowdstrike-update-at-center-of-windows-blue-screen-of-death-outage) or if it was in fact an attack. The attack was later claimed by the Rhysida [ransomware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/ransomware) group on their leak site, where the group posts information about recent victims that are unwilling to pay.

![Rhysida lists the data stolen from City of Columbus, Ohio for sale](https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/leak_site_pots.png)

The City of Columbus [said](https://www.columbus.gov/News-articles/City-of-Columbus-Thwarted-Ransomware-Encryption-of-its-IT-Infrastructure) that the city’s Department of Technology quickly identified the threat and took action to significantly limit potential exposure. Due to the swift action no systems had been encrypted, but they were looking into the possibility that sensitive data might have been stolen in the attack.

> “The city is in the process of identifying individuals whose [personal information](https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii) was potentially exposed and will provide notice and additional guidance to all who are impacted in the coming weeks.”

Rhysida started an auction to buy the stolen data with a starting bid of about $1.7 million in [bitcoin](https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-bitcoin). When that didn’t render any results, Rhysida published (please note the word “published” here, it’s important) stolen data comprising 260,000 files (3.1 TB) which was almost half of what they claimed to have, on August 8, 2024.

On that same day, the mayor of Columbus stated on local media that the disclosed information was neither valuable nor usable.

> “The fact that the threat actor’s attempted data auction failed is a strong indication that the data lacks value to those who would seek to do harm or profit from it.”

This is where an external security researcher comes in. Security researcher David Leroy Ross, aka Connor Goodwolf, shared information with the media about the content of the stolen data. From what Goodwolf shared it became clear that the data contained unencrypted personal information of city employees and residents.

So, the City of Columbus decided to sue Goodwolf for alleged damages for criminal acts, invasion of privacy, negligence, and civil conversion.

The lawsuit claimed that downloading documents from a [dark web](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2017/07/explained-dark-web) site run by ransomware attackers amounted to him interacting with the ransomware group and that it required special expertise and tools.

When all he did was use a special browser to visit a...
