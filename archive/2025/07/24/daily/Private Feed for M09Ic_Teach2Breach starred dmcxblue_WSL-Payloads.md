# WSL Files

When looking into possible new file formats for Initial Access, one really grabbed my attention. By using the following PowerShell one-liner, you can find file extensions available on the workstation.
When reviewing the results, you might notice that some extensions do not have a designated program for execution:

```
Get-ChildItem Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '^.*\\\.' } | ForEach-Object { $_.PSChildName }
```

From the output, the `.wsl` file extension was particularly interesting.

We are already familiar with WSL as the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which allows developers to run a GNU/Linux environment on Windows. While powerful, WSL is traditionally limited to terminal-based interactions. Users can run Linux on the Windows workstation with some capabilities that are limited to the terminal. Reading the documentation for WSL, I found an interesting paragraph highlighting WSL file extensions.
