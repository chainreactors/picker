<html><body><p>Tosibox Key Service 3.3.0 Local Privilege Escalation

Vendor: Tosibox Oy
Product web page: https://www.tosibox.com
Affected version: &lt;=3.3.0

Summary: TOSIBOX® SoftKey is a  software that enables a secure connection
between your computer and one or more TOSIBOX® Nodes, giving you full
visibility and control over the network devices connected to the Node.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'Tosibox Key Service' for Windows deployed as part of Tosibox
software application. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged
local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.
A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

Tested on: Windows 10 Home 64 bit (build 9200)
