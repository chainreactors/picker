Phishing attacks are becoming more advanced and harder to detect, but there are still telltale signs that can help you spot them before it's too late. See these key indicators that security experts use to identify phishing links:

### 1. Check Suspicious URLs

Phishing URLs are often long, confusing, or filled with random characters. Attackers use these to disguise the link's true destination and mislead users.

The first step in protecting yourself is to inspect the URL carefully. Always ensure it begins with "HTTPS," as the "s" indicates a secure connection using an SSL certificate.

However, keep in mind that SSL certificates alone are not enough. Cyber attackers have increasingly used legitimate-looking HTTPS links to distribute malicious content.

This is why you should be suspicious of links that are overly complex or look like a jumble of characters.

Tools like ANY.RUN's Safebrowsing allow users to check suspicious links in a secure and isolated environment without the need to manually inspect every character in a URL.

**Example:**

One of the recent cases involved Google's URL redirect being used several times to mask the real phishing link and make it difficult to trace the true destination of the URL.

| Complex URL with redirects |

In [this case](https://app.any.run/browses/d5885440-6096-440c-8c1a-10742f27f0bb?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=expert-tips&utm_content=browses&utm_term=250924), after the initial "Google" in the URL, you see 2 other instances of "Google," which is a clear sign of a redirection attempt and misuse of the platform.

### 2. Pay Attention to Redirect Chains

As you can see from the example mentioned above, redirecting is one of the main tactics used by cyber attackers. Besides considering the complexity of the URL, find out where the link leads you.

This tactic extends the delivery chain and confuses users, making it harder to spot the malicious intent.

One more common scenario is when attackers send an email, claiming a file needs to be downloaded. But instead of an attachment or direct link, they send a URL leading through redirects, ultimately asking for login credentials to access the file.

To investigate this safely, copy and paste the suspicious link into ANY.RUN's Safebrowsing tool. After running the analysis session, you'll be able to interact with the link in a secure environment and see exactly where it redirects and how it behaves.

**Example**:

| [![](data:image/png;base64...)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrxmylZAyjS4B8ur0bhCTM8Hmtm3t9afe0GbFSSE-qvy-CtVu3xQSB0qxkzfi8z6CRrZ6w-FFLZe1txigCqZ2a06-UHBhtGlOZxPuE8dRRcJCv4vnOMzHNxIrczca01zHGefZAnMdlgrYRaiy0byp0vTBW5GMFkymECaI6M5SwOCoNVc8N7Ciir7e-MmM/s790-rw-e365/3.png) |

In [this instance](https://app.any.run/browses/0f30d259-53c3-4607-aff1-20fc8759fbd4?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=expert-tips&utm_content=browses2&utm_term=250924), attackers shared a seemingly harmless link to a file storage page. However, instead of leading directly to the intended document, the link redirected users multiple times, eventually landing on a fake login page designed to steal their credentials.

### 3. Inspect Strange Page Titles and Missing Favicons

Another way to spot phishing links is paying attention to the page titles and favicons. A legitimate page should have a title that matches the service you're interacting with, without strange symbols or gibberish. Suspicious, random characters or incomplete titles are often signs that something is wrong.

Besides the page title, valid websites have a favicon that corresponds to the service. An empty or generic favicon is an indication of a phishing attempt.

**Example**:
