## Introduction

Typically, SAP Systems are configured in a three-tier configuration: the presentation tier or layer (FIORI, SAP GUI, or HTML browser), the application layer (SAP Netweaver ABAP/Java), and the storage/database tier.

1. **The Presentation Tier:** This is the user interface layer and is responsible for displaying data to the user and allowing the user to interact with the application. This tier can include web pages, desktop interfaces or mobile apps.
2. **The Application Tier:** This is the middle layer and is responsible for the business logic and data processing. This tier performs tasks such as data validation, calculations, and communicating with the storage tier to retrieve or store data.
3. **The Storage/Database Tier:** This is the bottom layer and is responsible for the permanent storage and retrieval of data. This tier can be implemented using a database management system (DBMS) such as SAP HANA, ASE, MaxDB, DB2, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server.

Such a three-tier architecture provides several benefits, including improved scalability, maintainability, and security. By separating the different functions into distinct layers, changes to one layer can be made without affecting the others, making the application more flexible and easier to maintain.

The different layers/tiers and components in a three-tier software architecture communicate with each other using a combination of protocols and APIs. Some common protocols used in three-tier architecture include HTTP, HTTPS, TCP/IP, and message queues. The communication between the tiers typically occurs over a network, such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the internet.

## Network Performance

Network performance is critical in a three-tier software architecture because of the way the different tiers communicate with each other. In this architecture, the presentation tier, the application tier, and the storage tier are often located on different physical or virtual machines, and therefore communicate over a network. This communication is critical for the overall performance and reliability of the application.

If the network is slow or unreliable, it can cause significant delays in the processing of data and lead to slow response times for the user. Additionally, if the network experiences high levels of traffic or congestion, it can cause dropped packets or even complete failures in communication between the tiers. This can result in data loss or corruption, which can have serious consequences for the application and its users.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that the network used in a three-tier architecture has high levels of performance, reliability, and security. This may involve using redundant networks, load balancing, and firewalls to protect against network-based attacks, as well as monitoring network performance and capacity to detect and resolve issues before they become critical.

By investing in a robust network infrastructure, organizations can ensure the performance, scalability, and security of their three-tier applications.

The application tier of an SAP NetWeaver ABAP system is composed of several individual components, including:

1. **SAP ABAP/JAVA Application Server:** This component provides the business logic and data processing capabilities for SAP applications. This Application Server is providing several types of work processes, including dialog processes (for handling user interactions), update processes (for handling database updates), and background processes (for handling batch processing).
2. **SAP Message Server:** This component provides load balancing and failover capabilities for the Application Tier. It distributes incoming requests to the available work processes and can also dynamically allocate work processes based on system load.
3. **SAP Enqueue Server:** This component provides locking and synchronization services for the Application Tier. It ensures that data is updated in a consistent and synchronized manner, even in a multi-user environment.
4. **SAP Gateway**: The SAP Gateway acts as a central hub for managing authentication, authorization, and security for external access to SAP systems.

These various components of those application servers communicate with each other via network using the TCP/IP protocol.

We typically name the network components connecting the users (GUI, Web clients) with the application server as **frontend network**, the network parts connecting the various component of the application server with each other and the database as **backend network**.

The performance of this **backend network** has a high impact on the overall response time – a poor network will significantly increase the database response or enqueue response times. The total DB response time as seen from the dialog work process consists of the network time from the dialog process to the DB, the DB execution time and the time to send the result back to the dialog process.

**Especially for HANA customers, which have high expectations to see improved performance compared to ...
