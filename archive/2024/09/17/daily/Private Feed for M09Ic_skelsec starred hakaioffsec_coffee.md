# Coffee

Coffee is a custom implementation of the original Cobalt Strike's [beacon\_inline\_execute](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics_aggressor-scripts/as-resources_functions.htm#beacon_inline_execute). It is written in Rust and supports most of the features of the Cobalt Strike compatibility layer. Coffee is structured so it can be used as a library in other projects too.
