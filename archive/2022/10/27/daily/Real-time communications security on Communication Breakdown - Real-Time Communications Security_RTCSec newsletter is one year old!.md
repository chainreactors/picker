# RTCSec newsletter is one year old!

Published on Oct 26, 2022

Roughly a year ago, we sent out the first RTCSec newsletter and have been doing so every month. Each time, we have covered more and more of our favourite topics, VoIP and WebRTC security. And now, it has become our primary way of keep up to date with what is happening, and our most regular publication too.

If you are not yet subscribed, do so at <https://www.enablesecurity.com/subscribe/>. The next one is out in a few days!
