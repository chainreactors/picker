Many DoD contractors are struggling to understand what requirements will apply to them once [CMMC](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/About/) rolls out. CMMC defines three levels, but CMMC Level 2 may allow a self-assessment or may require a third-party certification assessment by a CMMC Third-Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO) which results in four different level/assessment scenarios. This post will help DoD contractors understand what CMMC requirements will apply based on the types of information they handle for DoD.

A [DoD memo](https://dodprocurementtoolbox.com/uploads/DOPSR_Cleared_OSD_Memo_CMMC_Implementation_Policy_d26075de0f.pdf) describes how four types of information will be used to determine both the CMMC level and the assessment requirements that will be inserted into contracts. These are all explained in more detail below:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Information** | **CMMC Level** | **Assessment Type** |
| FCI | 1 | Self-Assessment |
| CUI in non-Defense Organizational Index Groupings | 2 | Self-Assessment |
| CUI in Defense Organizational Index Groupings | 2 | C3PAO Certification Assessment |
| CUI with enhanced protection requirements | 3 | DIBCAC Certification Assessment |

## FCI

### FCI Definition

FCI is Federal Contract Information. The formal definition of FCI includes all information that is provided by or generated for the government under a contract except for information that is intended for public release or simple transactional information. FCI does not carry any special markings to identify it as FCI.

### FCI Handling Impact on CMMC Obligations

All government contractors are likely handling FCI, so DoD contractors that do not handle CUI should expect to receive CMMC Level 1 self-assessment requirements. Contractors that are handling CUI will also need to apply the Level 1 requirements to any systems that are handling FCI but not CUI and do not meet the Level 2 or 3 requirements.

### CMMC Changes to FCI Requirements

The CMMC Level 1 requirements are based on the 15 Basic Safeguards for FCI that have been required by the [FAR 52.204-21](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/52.204-21) contract clause since 2016 so all government contractors should already be compliant. There is currently no requirement to report compliance with the FAR 52.204-21 clause, so only the requirement to report compliance via a self-assessment is new in CMMC. CMMC Level 1 self-assessments are submitted via the DoDâ€™s [Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS)](https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/nistsp.htm).

## CUI

### CUI Definition

CUI is Controlled Unclassified Information. This is information the government itself must safeguard or control the dissemination of as per a specific law...
