# What Audio Analysis Reveals About Aid Workers Killed in Gaza

April 9, 2025

On March 23, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) [announced an operation](https://x.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1903696196587180347) in southern Gaza’s Tal as-Sultan neighborhood and urged civilians to evacuate using a road north to a humanitarian zone. Hours before the statement was shared online, a rescue convoy was traveling along that same road before all contact was lost. The convoy was made up of aid workers from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), Palestine Civil Defense and the United Nations.

At least four vehicles, clearly marked by their emergency flashing lights, were present and had stopped beside another vehicle that was located just off the road when the shooting started.

An almost seven-minute video, recovered from a phone on one of the bodies of the deceased and [released by the PRCS](https://x.com/PalestineRCS/status/1908458778040631384) recorded what happened next. Although much of the footage is dark, the audio provides some clues about events that unfolded. An extended 20-minute version of the original seven-minute video has since been [released by the PRCS on April 8.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WQ9r9t2ISY)

Bellingcat conducted a preliminary analysis of the recording and broke down the audio. We then consulted two audio forensic experts who confirmed the total shots fired numbered in the hundreds.

The majority of gunshots heard during the shooting appear to feature supersonic shockwaves, which seems to indicate bullets travelled toward the recording microphone held by the aid worker. The audio evidence also appears to confirm that the first shots were aimed at the medics’ convoy from a distance of approximately 40 to 45 metres.

Following the incident, IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani [initially](https://x.com/LTC_Shoshani/status/1906761462917247361) denied the PRCS ambulances were randomly fired upon and claimed the vehicles were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals.” Following this, troops opened fire on the vehicles.

However, after the emergence of the seven-minute video recorded by one of the PRCS members — first reported [by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/world/middleeast/gaza-israel-aid-workers-deaths-video.html) and then [released by the PRCS](https://x.com/PalestineRCS/status/1908458778040631384) — which showed the vehicles had their emergency lights and headlights on, the [IDF released another statement on April 7](https://t.me/idfofficial/14019). This outlined that, following a preliminary inquiry into the incident, the Chief of the General Staff had instructed that a more in-depth investigation would be carried out by the General Staff investigation mechanism. This [process is typically enacted](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/q-a-concerning-the-violent-riots-and-attacks-occurring-on-the-border-between-gaza-and-israel-during-2018-9/investigation-of-allegations-of-misconduct/) by the IDF to determine whether a criminal investigation should be opened into an incident.

A video [shared by the United Nations](https://www.unocha.org/media-centre/gaza-tal-sultan-aftermath-30-march-2025) on March 30 showed bodies clad in emergency vests as they were retrieved from a shallow grave. The remains of emergency vehicles were also retrieved.

## Geolocating the Seven-Minute Video

We were able to [confirm](https://bsky.app/profile/godin.bsky.social/post/3llzzybcsfs2v) where the footage was filmed using two large concrete structures silhouetted on the horizon to the left of the road (highlighted below in red). There are also newer temporary structures visible on the right hand side of the road (highlighted in blue). We matched these identifiers from the video with more recent SkySat imagery from Planet Labs, finding they lined up with an area on Gush Katif Road just north of Tal as-Sultan.

Using the chronolocation tool SunCalc, Bellingcat was also able to confirm the video was filmed in the early hours of the morning — something also confirmed by The New York Times. The video shows sunlight on the horizon to the east, and [computing the sunlight for March 23 at 5:00am local time](https://www.suncalc.org/#/31.3234,34.2434,17/2025.03.23/05:04/1/2) for this location shows that the sun would be in around the same position.

## Breaking Down the Audio

Bellingcat has previously used audio forensic analysis to investigate the killing of journalists [Shireen Abu Akleh](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2022/05/14/unravelling-the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh/) and [Abelardo Liz](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/12/11/the-sound-of-bullets-the-killing-of-colombian-journalist-abelardo-liz/) and has compared the sound of live rounds against witness testimonies and official statements.

Most rifle ammunition [available](https://www.silencercentral.com/blog/comparing-subsonic-vs-supersonic-ammunition/) today is faster than the speed of sound (supersonic). The [muzzle velocities](https://nij.ojp.gov/nij-hosted-online-training-courses/firearms-examiner-training/glossary#muzzle%20velocity) of bullets fired by such [rifles](https://www.npsa.gov.uk/system/files/documents/body-armour-guidance-factsheet-1-firearms.pdf) are typically in the range of 650 to 1,000 metres per second (m/s).
