We’re happy to see that [Discord will soon start offering a form of end-to-end encryption](https://discord.com/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video) dubbed “DAVE” for its voice and video chats. This puts some of Discord’s audio and video offerings [in line with Zoom](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/victory-zoom-will-offer-end-end-encryption-all-its-users), and separates it from tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, which do not offer end-to-end encryption for video, voice, or any other communications on those apps. This is a strong step forward, and Discord can do even more to protect its users’ communications.

End-to-end encryption is used by many chat apps for both text and video offerings, including WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, and Facebook Messenger. But Discord operates differently than most of those, since alongside private and group text, video, and audio chats, it also encompasses large scale public channels on individual servers operated by Discord. Going forward, audio and video will be end-to-end encrypted, but text, including both group channels and private messages, will not.

When a call is end-to-end encrypted, you’ll see a green lock icon. While it's not required to use the service, Discord also offers a [way to optionally verify](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/25...
