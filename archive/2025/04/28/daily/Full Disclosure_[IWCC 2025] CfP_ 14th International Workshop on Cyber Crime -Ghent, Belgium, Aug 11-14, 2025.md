[APOLOGIES FOR CROSS-POSTING]

CALL FOR PAPERS
14th International Workshop on Cyber Crime (IWCC 2025 -
https://2025.ares-conference.eu/program/iwcc/)
to be held in conjunction with the 20th International Conference on
Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025 -
http://2025.ares-conference.eu)

August 11-14, 2025, Ghent, Belgium

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission Deadline     May 12, 2025
Author Notification     May 30, 2025
Proceedings Version     June 13, 2025
Conference              August 11-14, 2025

WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION
The societies of today's world are becoming increasingly dependent on online
services, where commercial activities, business transactions, government
services, and biomedical diagnostics are realized. This tendency has been
evident during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These developments, along with
the growing number of military conflicts worldwide (Ukraine, Israel, etc.),
have led to the fast development of new cyber threats and numerous
information security issues exploited by cybercriminals. The inability to
provide trusted, secure services in contemporary computer network
technologies has a tremendous socio-economic impact on global enterprises
and individuals.

Moreover, the frequently occurring international frauds impose the necessity
to conduct investigations spanning multiple domains and countries. Such
examination is often subject to different jurisdictions and legal systems. A
good illustration of the above is the Internet, which has made it easier to
prepare and perpetrate traditional - but now cyber-enabled - crimes. It has
acted as an alternate avenue for criminals to conduct their activities and
launch attacks with relative anonymity, a high degree of deniability, and
the opportunity to operate in a border-agnostic environment. Worrying
developments in the abuse of artificial intelligence and machine learning
technologies lead to the increased capabilities of malign actors who
leverage these tools to design and propagate disinformation, which is
especially dangerous (and effective) during emergencies and crises of all
kinds. The developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence have also
enabled the increase of criminal capabilities in the production,
dissemination, and weaponization of high-quality, convincing fake contact
(text, audio, images, and videos), which translates not only to the truth
and trust decay among the affected societies but also to the enhanced
capabilities in orchestrating the sophisticated cyber crimes.

Furthermore, nowadays, the majority of life-science-based techniques and
resulting data hinge on information technologies. Despite their considerable
advantages, dependence on cyber technologies also exposes vulnerabilities.
Various threats in the digital realm could target biomedical systems,
leading to adverse consequences. The field of CyberBioSecurity was
established to assist bio-related sciences in comprehending potential cyber
threats and formulating defense approaches, recovery protocols, and
resilience strategies.

The increased complexity of communications and the networking infrastructure
is making the investigation of these new types of crimes difficult. Traces
of illegal digital activities are difficult to analyze due to large volumes
of data. Nowadays, the digital crime scene functions like any other network,
with dedicated administrators functioning as the first responders. This
poses new challenges for law enforcement and intelligence communities and
forces computer societies to utilize digital forensics to combat the
increasing number of cyber crimes. Forensic professionals must be fully
prepared to provide court-admissible evidence. Forensic techniques should
keep pace with new technologies to make these goals achievable. Prevention,
mitigation, and interdiction of new and emerging threats necessitate an
increasingly thorough and multidisciplinary approach. They also require the
collaboration of all relevant actors and stakeholders in designing the
technology regulation and cyber governance measures.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together the research outcomes provided
by researchers from academia and the industry. Another goal is to showcase
the latest research findings across a wide range of topics, from digital
forensics to cyberbiosecurity.  We strongly encourage prospective authors to
submit articles presenting both theoretical approaches and practical case
reviews, including work-in-progress reports.

TOPICS OF INTEREST INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
- Big Data analytics helping to track cyber crimes
- Protecting Big Data / AI models against cyber crimes
- Crime-as-a-service

- Novel techniques in exploit kits
- Political and business issues related to digital forensics and
anti-forensic techniques
- Anti-forensic techniques and methods
- Identification, authentication and collection of digital evidence
- Integrity of digital evidence and live investigations
- Privacy issues in digital forensics
- Ransomware: evolution, functioning, types, etc.
- Steganography/steganalysis and covert/subliminal channels
