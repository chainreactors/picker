# ForShops

A proof-of-concept fileless DCOM Lateral Movement technique using trapped COM objects

## Description

This project contains C++ source code for reflectively loading and executing a .NET assembly in a remote computer's WaaS Medic Service svchost.exe process for DCOM lateral movement.

The technique abuses the trapped COM object bug class originally discovered by [James Forshaw](https://x.com/tiraniddo) of Google Project Zero.

For detailed information, please see the accompanying Security Intelligence blog [post](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/fileless-lateral-movement-trapped-com-objects) by [Dylan Tran](https://x.com/d_tranman) and [Jimmy Bayne](https://x.com/bohops) of IBM X-Force Red.

## Usage

* Compile with Visual Studio
* Run with the following command under a privileged context:

```
forshops.exe [target machine] [c:\\path\\to\\assembly\\to\\load]
```

## Defensive Recommendations

The [detection guidance](https://x.com/SBousseaden/status/1896527307130724759) proposed by [Samir Bousseaden](https://x.com/SBousseaden) is applicable for this lateral movement technique:
