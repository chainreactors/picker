[![Apple Zero-Click Flaw in Messages](data:image/png;base64... "Apple Zero-Click Flaw in Messages")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4KtDancywVVxWDkqSRKK73hubUcq3mPBfYq2lESQZk_dpgMapvdBSvUUqKCFKSVXmNmpQqUj5qiXrGMtJrRViHbBIgQHrRBsPO_SKUW6ktdbg7-VsOZx02eRTigEMhANtUSIf8wsef35e7utB6r_LZnZ-lw5Eo2cRLuuDnfFEJ-Tefa4e5lTIv9V8_QN6/s790-rw-e365/apple-exploit.gif)

Apple has disclosed that a now-patched security flaw present in its Messages app was actively exploited in the wild to target civil society members in sophisticated cyber attacks.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-43200, was addressed on February 10, 2025, as part of [iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174), [iPadOS 17.7.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122173), [macOS Sequoia 15.3.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122900), [macOS Sonoma 14.7.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122901), [macOS Ventura 13.7.4](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122902), [watchOS 11.3.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122903), and [visionOS 2.3.1](https://support.apple.com/en-us/122904).

"A logic issue existed when processing a maliciously crafted photo or video shared via an iCloud Link," the company said in an advisory, adding the vulnerability was addressed with improved checks.

The iPhone maker also acknowledged that it's aware the vulnerability "may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specifically targeted individuals."

It's worth noting that the iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1, and iPadOS 17.7.5 updates also [resolved](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/apple-patches-actively-exploited-ios.html) another actively exploited zero-day tracked as CVE-2025-24200. It's currently not known why Apple chose not to disclose the existence of this flaw until now.

While Apple did not share any further details of the nature of the attacks weaponizing CVE-2025-43200, the Citizen Lab said it unearthed forensic evidence that the shortcoming was leveraged to target Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed prominent European journalist and infect them with [Paragon's Graphite](https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/six-governments-likely-use-israeli.html) mercenary spyware.

The interdisciplinary research center described the attack as zero-click, meaning the vulnerability could be triggered on targeted devices without requiring any user interaction.

"One of the journalist's devices was compromised with Paragon's Graphite spyware in January and early February 2025 while running iOS 18.2.1," researchers Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton [said](https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/). "We believe that this infection would not have been visible to the target."

Both individuals were notified on April 29, 2025, by Apple that they were [targeted](https://www.fanpage.it/politica/sono-il-secondo-giornalista-di-fanpage-ad-essere-stato-spiato-e-ancora-non-so-da-chi-ne-perche/) with advanced spyware. Apple began [sending threat notifications](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/apple-expands-spyware-alert-system-to.html) to alert users it suspects have been targeted by state-sponsored attackers starting November 2021.

Graphite is a surveillance tool developed by the Israeli private sector offensive actor (PSOA) Paragon. It can access messages, emails, cameras, microphones, and location data without any user action, making detection and prevention especially difficult. The spyware is typically deployed by government clients under the guise of national security investigations.

The Citizen Lab said the two journalists were sent iMessages from the same Apple account (codenamed "ATTACKER1") to deploy the Graphite tool, indicating that the account may have been used by a single Paragon customer to target them.

The development is the latest twist in a scandal that erupted in January, when Meta-owned WhatsApp [divulged](https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/meta-confirms-zero-click-whatsapp.html) that the spyware had been deployed against dozens of users globally, including Pellegrino's colleague [Francesco Cancellato](https://www.fanpage.it/politica/tutto-quello-che-non-torna-nella-relazione-del-copasir-sul-caso-paragon/). In all, a total of seven individuals have been publicly identified as victims of Paragon targeting and infection to date.

Earlier this week, the Israeli spyware maker said it has [terminated](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/italy-has-ended-spyware-contract-with-paragon-parliamentary-document-shows-2025-06-09/) its contracts with Italy, citing the government's refusal to let the company independently verify that Italian authorities did not break into the phone of the investigative journalist.

"The company offered both the Italian government and parliament a way to determine whether its system had been used against the journalist in violation of Italian law and the contractual terms," it [said](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2025-06-09/ty-article/.premium/paragon-questions-journalist-hack-probe-after-contract-nixed/00000197-511f-ddae-a1ff-5b5fb4bf0000) in a statement to Haaretz.

However, the Italian government [said](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2025/06/09/007-paragon-non-ha-rescisso...
