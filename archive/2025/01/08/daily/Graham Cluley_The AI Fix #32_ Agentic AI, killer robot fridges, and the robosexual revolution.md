In episode 32 of The AI Fix, our hosts learn the meaning of ‚Äúporonkusema‚Äù, Mark discovers his dream job, a school tries using AI instead of teachers, the ‚ÄúGodfather of AI‚Äù says AI will see us as toddlers, and Graham lifts the lid on the hidden threat of killer robot fridges.

Mark explains why 2025 is the year of the autonomous AI agent, and Graham investigates the robosexual revolution, and the claim that robots will be more popular than men in the bedroom this year.

All this and much more is discussed in the latest edition of ‚ÄúThe AI Fix‚Äù podcast by Graham Cluley and Mark Stockley.
