 The [**SAP Champion Spotlight Interview Series**](https://blogs.sap.com/tag/spotlight-interview/) highlights key strategic topics, such as emerging technologies, learning, and other topics, and provides insights from SAP Champions and SAP leaders on turning ideas into innovative approaches that impact people, processes, and technology. |

Whether we know it or not, each of us has a professional brand and reputation.

In an era where people’s attention spans are getting shorter by the minute, creating a professional brand is a worthwhile consideration.

The benefits of professional branding are unlimited. Proactively building a professional brand can help define the path you want to be on and how to get there. Each of us has the power to define his or her brand by aligning intentions with actions.

![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/AbdullahCircleProfile.png)A professional brand helps define the distinct value that an individual brings to their career, the community, and to their networks. It has the potential to strengthen connections and engage more deeply with colleagues.

Professional branding is an ongoing process centered around evolving goals, experiences, and accomplishments.

For agalal1, SAP Champion, YouTuber (43+K subscribers, 2+ million views), and SAP Finance Senior Solution Architect at Nokia, he has a strong professional brand by way of his online presence and activities to help the community. He enjoys helping others learn through his knowledge and expertise.

Given his successful YouTube channel and many other accomplishments, it was great to catch-up with Abdullah from his home office in Paris, Île-de-France, France.

**Stephanie De Camara Marley (SM): Hi Abdullah!** **After your time studying accounting at Ain Shams University, you went on to work for and consult with a variety of market leaders including Mars, Raya, and SAP. What triggered your interest to develop subject matter expertise in accounting and technology that has led to your current role as the![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/Abdullah1.png) SAP Finance Senior Solution Architect at Nokia?**

**Abdullah Galal (AG):** Thanks Stephanie! After my graduation, I received a scholarship in the amazing Information Technology Institute in Egypt. They recommended I join the SAP track because becoming an SAP consultant is a great career choice – and they were right!

During the scholarship opportunity, I decided to proceed with Financial Accounting and Controlling modules, given my accounting background and my love for finance. After the scholarship, I started my journey as an SAP consultant working with different companies on SAP projects. I developed a passion to helping others improve their lives through SAP.

**SM: You have an amazing** [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/c/AbdullahGalal?app=desktop) **following with 43+K subscribers and ~2-million total views centered around SAP S/4HANA, business process management, finance, and related topics. Wow! What sparked your interest to develop this channel around your passion to solve technical issues and understand complicated SAP and Finance topics? What upcoming topics are you planning to cover?**

**AG:** The moments that I appreciate most in my projects are when I teach someone how to use SAP well and see how it impacts his or her work and life! It’s amazing how SAP can help users save a lot of time, and even find better job opportunities in great companies that use SAP. One day I imagined how great it would be if instead of helping one or two people, I could help everyone, so that’s why I decided to start my YouTube channel. Now I help strengthen the SAP community by sharing more knowledge and encouraging others to share.

**SM: How did you become an SAP Champion? In this role, how do you engage with Community members?**

**![](/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/12/Abdullah2.png)AG:** I’ve been consistent in sharing videos and blogs related to SAP for the last 4 years, and that paid off! I have a strong online community that I appreciate a lot, and I was able to build good online relations with many of the SAP Mentors and Champions. I was nominated to become an SAP Champion, and the Influencer Team found my contributions to the Community valuable and accepted the nomination.

I continue engaging with the SAP Community members through my weekly videos and LinkedIn posts, and now I have an official role in improving the SAP Community as an SAP Champion through motivating the Community members to engage more and share more. #share knowledge
