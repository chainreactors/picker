## AI’s Transformative Impact on Work: The Dawn of a New Era

As modern businesses evolve with today’s digital landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping the way we work and redefining roles across industries. As we stand on the cusp of a new technological revolution, it’s becoming increasingly clear that AI will serve as a catalyst for innovation, efficiency and productivity.

We’ll explore how Palo Alto Networks has built an integration with [OpenAI’s ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-chatgpt-enterprise/) to empower organizations with the transformative potential of AI while supporting the critical need for robust data and threat protection.

## AI Access Security and ChatGPT Enterprise

In May, [Palo Alto Networks introduced AI Access Security](https://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/news-releases/news-release-details/palo-alto-networks-launches-new-security-solutions-infused) to help organizations safely harness the power of generative AI (GenAI) applications. With [AI Access Security](/network-security/ai-access-security), hundreds of GenAI apps are categorized and mapped to generate bespoke risk scores that help InfoSec teams make swift and informed decisions. This tool empowers businesses to monitor the adoption and usage of both sanctioned and shadow AI applications; actively helps prevent sensitive data leaks; and, defends against AI-generated malicious responses.

Similarly, OpenAI developed and launched [ChatGPT Enterprise](https://openai.com/chatgpt/enterprise/), an enterprise-grade offering that enables companies to leverage AI capabilities while maintaining strict control over sensitive information.

Visibility into ChatGPT Enterprise data assets.

With our integration with ChatGPT Enterprise, organizations can enhance security outcomes and help with regulatory compliance by gaining clear visibility into sensitive data within their ChatGPT Enterprise workspace, including conversations and metadata used to build custom GPTs. Businesses can easily identify potential data exposure risks by tracking sensitive information shared with GPTs; monitor access to GPTs to prevent overly permissive sharing of sensitive data; and foster better security hygiene by educating end users to assist with robust data protection across the organization.

Customers will be able to identify sensitive data shared in prompts, responses and files across their ChatGPT Enterprise workspaces and author policies to flag potential risks in near real-time.

## AI Access Security Enables Safe GenAI Adoption

In today’s interconnected digital world, uncovering hidden dangers and securing users and data across all GenAI applications and platforms is paramount. That’s why AI Access Security has one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date app dictionaries with over 500 GenAI apps and 60+ AI-specific attributes. Delivered as an extension of Palo Alto Networks [data security solution](/sase/ai-powered-saas-and-data-security), AI Access Security is natively integrated with the Strata Network Security platform. It not only reduces data and security risks across all GenAI apps, but simplifies management, reduces complexity and ensures sensitive data remains protected regardless of where it resides or how it’s accessed.

## Redefining the Future of GenAI Security, Today

Our integration with ChatGPT Enterprise hopes to revolutionize data security for organizations everywhere. Businesses continue to adopt GenAI as part of core business processes. This integration between AI Access Security and ChatGPT Enterprise offers an additional layer of data and AI security that allows organizations to operate with even greater confidence.

Low friction. High confidence. Strong Security.
