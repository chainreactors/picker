# Fmovies & Aniwave: Will The Masters of Pirate Resurrection Rise Again?

The spectacular demise of Fmovies, Aniwave, and a dozen or more related big-brand pirate sites, has former users asking the same question: Are they really gone forever? With many resurrections and Dr. Who-like regenerations over recent years, some seem optimistic. Government records suggests that business bridges are being built from Hollywood to Vietnam, and back again. It seems unlikely that the resurrection of pirate sites would help in any way.

[![](https://torrentfreak.com/images/fmovies-aniwave-down.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/fmovies-aniwave-down.png)The demise of pirate streaming giant Fmovies in June, followed by the closure of Aniwave and more than a dozen others in the space of a few hours Monday night, will be remembered for a very long time.

When the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment modestly [confirmed](https://torrentfreak.com/fmovies-piracy-ring-was-shut-down-by-vietnam-assisted-by-ace-240829/) on Thursday it had supported Vietnamese authorities to shut down the sites, the focus was on huge but easily digested numbers. When combined, fmovies, bflixz, flixtorz, movies7, myflixer, and aniwave, reportedly drew more than 6.7 billion visits between January 2023 and June 2024.

The popularity of these sites obviously made them a target, but significance can also be found elsewhere. For reasons we’re aware of and have reported previously, and likely many more besides, shutting down these sites was never going to be straightforward.

Frustrations date back years but more recently, at the same time domain names were being handed over to the MPA, presumably as part of an agreement, site resurrections were also underway.

The big question is whether Fmovies, Aniwave, and the other sites will attempt something similar.

## Giving Up Was Never an Option

Some believed that nothing could be done about the piracy situation in Vietnam in the short term. Both Hollywood and Japan’s major anime studios seemed to have few options left, but that didn’t mean no options at all.

What follows is a sample of events relating to Vietnam that show the type of environment Fmovies and the other sites were up against. To what extent the background to these events affected the outcome, if they did so at all, is hard to quantify. What’s fairly clear is that when business needs are met in a mutually beneficial manner, momentum can take on a life of its own. As part of the overall vision for the Hollywood/Vietnam relationship, the sites’ existence may have simply become untenable.

## International Symposium on Copyright Enforcement

As previously [reported](https://torrentfreak.com/what-killed-fmovies-death-by-a-1000-cuts-one-killer-blow-or-possibly-both-240719/), Vietnam played host to the International Symposium on Copyright Enforcement starting June 17; those in attendance included the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Trade Organization (WTO), Vietnam’s Copyright Office under the Ministry of Culture, the MPA and [who’s-who](https://www.aapa.eu/members) of major rightsholders and specialist anti-piracy companies.

[![mpa_meet_vnd](https://torrentfreak.com/images/mpa_meet_vnd.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/mpa_meet_vnd.png)The symposium ended on June 21 and Fmovies reportedly stopped updating June 22/23. One day later, MPA Chairman/CEO Charles Rivkin appeared in a photograph alongside Nguyen Quoc Dzung, Vietnam’s Ambassador to the United States.

Topics discussed over lunch included the importance of Vietnam’s streaming market to the Hollywood studios, and “how to strengthen the bonds between our creative economies and protect the livelihoods of the creative workforce driving this shared growth.”

That was June 24 and just a few hours earlier, Fmovies had suddenly started to fail. On life support for a few days, the world’s most popular streaming site would soon be declared dead.

The obvious beneficiary was Hollywood but as we noted in an earlier report, other meetings were also taking place elsewhere in Vietnam. One event attended by the Vice Chairman of Sony Pictures mentioned potential funding mechanisms for local films.

## Vietnam Tourism – Cinema Promotion Program in the United States

Official government documents dated July 2024 show that a “tourism and cinema promotion program” will take place in Los Angeles in the “third and fourth quarters of 2024” with exhibitions on Vietnamese cinema and tourism and a program to “introduce the potential of Vietnam’s cinema scene and policies towards international cinema activities.”

[![us-vietnam-1](https://torrentfreak.com/images/us-vietnam-1.png)](https://torrentfreak.com/images/us-vietnam-1.png)

The goals of the program in the United States include the promotion of tourist destinations and potential filming destinations in Vietnam, plus the following:

*Attract Hollywood film studios to Vietnam to film movies with great appeal, capable of creating international media attention, to promote and attract tourists to Vietnam.*

And there’s more;

> *– Take advantage of the prestige and influence of Hollywood partners to organize the Program, attract public attention, and widely promote Vietnamese tourism. Promote tourism promotion through cinema, effectively exploit tourism from cinema, and create a breakthrough in tourism promotion.*
>
> – Introduce the image and brand of friendly, quality, and sustainable Vietnamese tourism destinations. Create opportunities for Vietnamese tourism service providers to meet and connect with US businesses and partners.
>
> – Strengthening cooperation and exchange; promoting the signing and commitment to effectively implementing cooperation agreements on tourism and cinema between relevant agencies, localities, Vietnamese enterprises and US partners, contributing to concretizing and deepening tourism and cinema cooperation between the two countries.
>
> *– Contact, exchange and work with a number of US tourism and film organizations (US Travel Association, Motion Picture Association of America), a number of large tourism corporations and businesses, media corporations, airlines, cruise lines, and relevant US partners to promote cooperation in tourism and film development.*

[The documents suggest](https://luatvietnam.vn/van-hoa/quyet-dinh-2017-q-bvhttdl-2024-ke-hoach-to-chuc-chuong-trinh-xuc-tien-du-lich-dien-anh-vn-tai-hoa-ky-361482-d1.html) that the MPA agreed to ensure that producers, studio directors, directors, film set directors, and Hollywood stars, attend a special event on an unspecified date. The MPA was asked to make a speech on the same day.
