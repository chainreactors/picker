In this blog post,  Dr. Arnal Dayaratna, Research Vice President, Software Development at IDC, discusses the critical role that Low-Code technologies play in helping organizations to improve collaboration and accelerate development to amplify the digital transformation within organizations

One of the important attributes of low-code development tools is their enhancement of collaboration between enterprise IT-based developers and line of business developers. Defined as developer tools that empower developers to create digital solutions with little or no custom coding or scripting,  low-code development tools are used by professional developers to develop digital solutions for well-defined use cases while line of business developers use them to create application prototypes as well as production-grade solutions. The usage of low-code development platforms by a wide range of constituencies requires organizations to host a broader conversation about best practices for low-code development, and how the organization and its users can optimally benefit from low-code development. This conversation not only enriches collaboration specific to the use of low-code development technologies, but also contributes to the enhancement of digital transformation initiatives within an organization. In this scenario, an organization is required to critically reflect on development-related objectives and how they can be tactically achieved by the concurrent usage of discrete toolsets. This means that the adoption of low-code developer tools both improves collaboration within an enterprise, and contributes to the enhancement and amplification of digital transformation-related initiatives as well.

Low-code development tools enhance collaboration and digital transformation within organizations in the following four ways:

1. Creating a culture of ubiquitous digitization

Low-code development tools contribute to the creation of a culture of ubiquitous digitization by providing tools which every professional resource can use to build digital solutions. By empowering sales professionals, business analysts, data analysts and operations professionals to create digital solutions in addition to professional developers, low-code development tools create a common language for digitization that spans the entire organization. Put differently, enterprise IT leverages the same technology stack as line of business developers who create and iterate on digital solutions. The empowerment of professional resources throughout the organization with the ability to build digital solutions decentralizes development activity away from enterprise IT and leads to a culture of ubiquitous digitization that integrates the development of digital solutions with all professional work.

2. Fostering collaboration between professional developers, line of business developers and line of business professionals

Low-code development platforms increase collaboration between professional developers and other builders of digital solutions by providing a lingua franca for digitization-related initiatives. Low-code development tools facilitate a multitude of collaboration modalities as follows:

* Professional developers and line of business developers can collaborate by sharing digital solutions they have made with one another as well as insights about the development process. One model for collaboration among low-code developers involves professional developers explaining best practices and providing guidance to line of business developers. Another model for collaboration features bi-directional learning between professional developers and line of business developers whereby both developer personas educate each other on the extensibility of low code to different use cases and scenarios. Yet another paradigm for collaboration between professional and line of business developers involves representatives of both parties working together in multi-disciplinary teams that requires them to work together to rapidly develop solutions.

* Another example of how low-code development tools enable and enrich collaborate features professional developers, line of business developers, business users third party vendors such as consultants, ISVs and system integrators, as well as subject matter experts working together to define requirements and develop a digital solution that corresponds to those requirements use low-code. Notably, low-code development platforms can expediently expand the universe of professional resources that can collaborate to confirm requirements and subsequently develop a digital solution that reflects those requireme...
