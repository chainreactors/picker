Some here may still remember Heartbleed. Heartbleed was a critical OpenSSL vulnerability that surprised many organizations, and patching the issue was a major undertaking. Heartbleed caused OpenSSL and other open-source projects to rethink how they address security issues and communicate with their users. OpenSSL started to pre-announce any security updates about a week ahead of time.

This week, OpenSSL announced they would release OpenSSL 3.0.7 this coming Tuesday. It will fix a critical vulnerability [1]. The OpenSSL definition of critical:

> * **CRITICAL** Severity. This affects common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to address these as soon as possible.

In short: This is something you will need to worry about!

The update will only affect OpenSSL 3.0.x, not 1.1.1. Now is the time to figure out where and how you are using OpenSSL 3.0.x. For most systems, you will be able to use the openssl command line utility:

> % openssl version
> OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.5 5 Jul 2022)

Here is a quick list of OpenSSL versions for different operating systems:

**OpenSSL 3.0.0, the first stable version of OpenSSL 3.0, was released in September 2021, about one year ago. Any older operating systems are likely using OpenSSL 1.1.1, which is not affected**.

macOS: macOS, by default, uses LibreSSL, not openssl, installed. But openssl may be installed later by other software like Homebrew and MacPorts.

### Comments

How about Amazon Linux 2, or 2022? A quick search seems like AML 2 is somewhat similar to CentOS 8.

From what I have seen you are correct, the default version is 1.x in AWS. More focus should be on the network devices such as load balancers, VPN access points, WAFs etc which are terminating SSL connections in from untrusted sources (i.e. internet). Least from what I have seen so far all are still using 1.x versions of OpenSSL
