## The UK May Be Dropping Its Backdoor Mandate

The US Director of National Intelligence is [reporting](https://www.theverge.com/news/761240/uk-apple-us-encryption-back-door-demands-dropped) that the UK government is dropping its backdoor mandate against the Apple iPhone. For now, at least, assuming that Tulsi Gabbard is reporting this accurately.

If they do allow ADP in the UK again, it’s worth knowing that it takes them a long time to disable it once it’s on: unless Apple are lying about it it’s still enabled for me (in the UK). So turning it on *immediately* it’s allowed is a good idea.

@tfb I’m sure they could disable it in an instant if they needed to – it was a choice by apple to not comply with the directive, but to not allow more accounts to enable it while they were considering how to deal with the UK government’s demand. Doing so might increase their liability – and massively so; I’m sure they had at least 10x as many people try to enable it following the news than ever tried to enable it in all the previous years.

In reality, how difficult would it be for phone providers such as Apple, Google, etc… to implement a system in which you had fully end-to-end encrypted backups? It seems like that would not be a difficult endeavor.

@ Bruce,

Well I’d say she’s not telling the truth but backing her boss up.

You know his rant the other day about anyone even daring to suggest collecting tax the Tech Mega Corps owe, or fining them for the multiple laws they break every minute of the day.

The Doh-Gnarled has said he’ll tarrif and invade or go to to war etc and other such nonsense.

What most do not realise is that the UK have a “think of the children” nonsense initiative to force not just online ID for every one but “client side scanning as well”.

Apple, Microsoft and Google have already built Client Side Scanning base architecture into all their OS’s. They also have the User Interface level scanning two things need to be added,

1, The AI recogniser that reads all sorts of text from the screen, keyboard and microphone etc.

2, The “ET Phone Home” to “the mothership” such that you can be rounded up and put in jail pending trial in maybe three to five years… For what has a “maximum tariff” of six months…

Plead guilty and you get maybe 4months and you get to go home.

It’s the UK’s latest version of a “plea deal”.

But… The UK “Online Saftey Act”(OSA) puts which ever is the larger 10% of gross global income or £18million for every offence of failing to verify age even of adults…

The plan for UK Companies is to “flip it onto the OS providers” that are all American Corps… And apparently UK OfCom that has the job of regulating / investigating / prosecuting OSA issues have indicated this might be acceptable.

That way UK companies do not carry the OSA risk, nor do they have to have the risk of holding users details and copies of “government documents” that are ideal for ID theft.

But those who stay in the shadows of UK Government are well aware of the “Client Side Scanning” especially that of Microsoft and Win11 and how desperate they are to get even a fraction of their investment back on AI… Thus as US Law not just Allows but actively encourages “collect it all and monetize”… The UK Gov unelected agents/entities know they will be able to not just get the age data but copies of everything an individual does. Including private and confidential work which would otherwise be illegal…

And it’s not just the UK, there is Australia and New Zealand. And it’s also the near thirty countries in Europe that includes a large chunk of what The Trumper thinks is Part of “his” North America… But is nothing of the sort… But like the Canadians, the people that are native there are not happy.

Because they are part of Denmark and many want to keep it that way in preference to a “Putin Tactics” US Executive, even though they actually want independence. Their view is it’s a hundred times better to be part of Europe than the US and it’s “Rape Pillage and Plunder” attitude. Especially of the sort that has been shown to the Ukraine.

It’s also known that the new Government there is having conversations about a new referendum to make US personnel nolonger welcome and tax the lot of them at peek rate as part of the process of starting to get rid of US bases etc, that many feel are putting a cross on their back with respect to Russia.

Oh and the Trumper getting caught sending in agent provocateurs mid this week is kind of dumb… But honestly what do people actually expect of the “lardy arsed wazzock?”

Oh and apparently where his Scottish Golf Course is, it’s been reported that people have broken “planning regulations” which in the UK can have serious consequences such as loosing land title of the Solumn thus the entire property…

Maybe he should rename “Art of the deal” to “Art of upsetting people and loosing everything”.

When prosecutions start due to Microsoft phoning home to UK gov for prosecution under OSA, the negative publicity will be a big boost for Linux…

They are dropping it if they can use other means to get to the same data. Like Windows Recall or other screen scanning…

I wonder if this is because they are close to sign an agreement that will permit the NSA to provide data to GCHQ, and vice versa?
